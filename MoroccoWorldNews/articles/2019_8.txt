Rabat – The subject of a tense contest between Moroccan and Dutch football federations for the past months, PSV Eindhoven attacking midfielder Mohammed Ihattaren has decided to take some time to think seriously about his options. The young talent has said he wants to take the necessary time to think deeply about his international career before taking a firm decision about joining either of his two countries’ teams. Earlier this month, both the Moroccan national team and the Dutch U21 squad called up the 17-year-old for upcoming matches in September. While Ihattaren has admitted to feeling “happy and much honored” by the visible, keen interest from the two countries, the young player has insisted he needs time to make a mature, well-considered, decision about which country he wants to represent as an international. According to reports, Ihattaren has not yet responded to Morocco’s interest in him, but he has reportedly told the staff of the Dutch U21 team to dispense with his services for now. He said he needed time “to reflect on my future as an international.” The decision is a reminder of the singular difficulty of choosing between two counties a player equally cherishes. The final call in such instances is even more difficult at Ihattaren’s age, 17, when most players tend to focus on personal growth at club level. But Ihattaren has already established himself as one of the most promising players of the Dutch league and such precocious talents come with a set of precocious demands and responsibilities. Earlier this week, the head coach of the Dutch national team, in an attempt to exert some pressure on Ihattaren in his final decision, asserted that the PSV Eindhoven prodigy “will have to make up his mind sooner rather than later.” Meanwhile, it is understood that Morocco plans to use a much gentler, less pushy card to convince the young player that choosing the Atlas Lions is in his best interests. The basis for such an idea, some have hastened to argue, is that Ihattaren’s move to momentarily put himself out of contention for a spot in the Dutch junior football team is an encouraging message for Morocco. The move means, the argument goes, that the player is seriously thinking about the Moroccan offer and thus needs to be reassured and encouraged in that direction by the Moroccan federation and technical staff.

Rabat – The initiator of the recently demolished “Holocaust Memorial” site in Morocco’s Marrakech-Safi region has been told to leave the country in the next 72 hours, local outlets have reported. The move comes amid what appeared to be a controversy, sparked by news of the building and then the demolition of a Holocaust Memorial site, about the history of Jewish suffering as well as Morocco’s position on the sensitive topic of anti-Semitism. Olivier Bienkowski, a German national and the founder of Pixel Helper, the non-profit group which conceptualized and built the now demolished site, has since said that his goal was to raise awareness about anti-Semitism, minority rights, and peaceful cohabitation. On Facebook and Twitter, where he had announced his intention of “building North Africa’s first ever Holocaust Memorial,” Bienkowski was adamant that he wanted to shed some light “on the history of persecuted minorities.” Moroccan authorities “have no issues” with the Holocaust or celebrating the country’s “proud history” of diversity and peaceful cohabitation between Moroccans of various political and religious persuasions, including Moroccan Jews, Moroccan Arabic newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported in its weekend edition. However, the newspaper added, citing Moroccan officials, the way in which Bienkowski proceeded when building the now bulldozed site showed more contempt and sabotage than genuine care and concern with the history of Moroccan or North African Jews. Bienkowski built his “so-called Holocaust Memorial” without getting any legal authorization from the competent authorities, government sources told the newspaper. Apart from his social media posts where he “obsessively” spoke about his plan to “build North Africa’s first ever Holocaust Memorial,” the same sources added, the German did not even bother to ask for the legal authorization required for such a “sensitive, important project.” For them, the German ignored the country’s regulations, as he intended to put the authorities of Ait Faska (the town in the Marrakech region where the event took place) “before a fait accompli.” This, they argued, shows that his intentions were malevolent. The German’s ulterior motive was to portray Morocco as anti-Semitic and not open to diversity, according to the government sources. Even after the authorities in Ait Faska destroyed the controversial site for “lack of legal authorization to build,” Bienkowski continued to talk about the issue on social media. Some of his posts appeared to subtly berated Morocco for demolishing his project, while others spoke about the importance of “teaching the history of persecuted minorities in schools and in the public sphere.” Echoing the points made by Ait Faska authorities, Jacky Kadoch, the president of the Jewish community in the Marrakech-Safi region, said that, when looked at more closely, Bienkowski’s goal was to spread misleading ideas about Morocco and its relationship with its Jewish populations and their history. “Morocco’s position on ethnic censing and anti-Semitism is clear, known to the world,” Kadoch said. He summoned a number of historical and present day illustrations to support his broader point that Morocco has a positive history with its own Jewish populations and the wider Jewish history. Kadoch’s illustrations included King Mohammed V saving the lives of many Moroccan Jews when he stood up to France’s Vichy government during World War II, as well as King Mohammed VI’s recent, repeated rhetoric and policies in favor of honoring and perpetuating Morocco’s history of “peaceful, harmonious cohabitation” between Muslim and Jewish Moroccans.

Rabat – A diplomat from the French consulate in Marrakech filed a sextortion complaint against a 27-year-old Moroccan man. The diplomat then withdrew the complaint, fearing a scandal.  The diplomat and the young man met each other on social media and their relationship quickly took a sexual turn, reported the daily Assabah in its August 31 issue. The judicial police had already followed the usual procedures, arresting and interrogating the young man. It was at this point that the diplomat decided to withdraw his complaint according to the daily.  Assabah suggested that the diplomat withdrew his complaint for fear of having his sexual adventures unveiled in court. The newspaper also reported that unknown parties intervened to hush the case to protect the diplomat’s reputation. Assabah also reported that the 27-year-old admitted to having sexual relations with the diplomat. According to the young man, the diplomat revealed to him his sexual inclinations, proposing a real-life encounter. The young man even showed the police compromising photos that the diplomat sent him, says Assabah. The facts date back nearly three months, the newspaper reports. At first, the young man did not know the true identity of the diplomat until he decided to call him. Thanks to an app on his phone, the young man was able to discover the true identity of his new friend.  He was surprised to discover that he was a senior official at the French consulate in Marrakech. With further research on the internet, the young man confirmed the diplomat’s identity but continued to behave as though he was not aware of who the diplomat was. When the young man, attracted to a girl he had seen in one of the diplomat’s photos, confessed to the diplomat being interested in her and asked for introductions, the diplomat refused. The young man insisted on having the girl’s phone number, and the situation quickly turned into harassment and sextortion.  The young man threatened to reveal the diplomat’s identity on social networks and publish compromising photos of him. Forced to give the girl’s number, the diplomat decided to file a complaint against the young man. The prosecution ordered the arrest of the young Moroccan man. Once interrogated by the judicial police, the young man acknowledged the facts but denied intentions of blackmail or sextortion.  When the young man was brought to court, the diplomat withdrew his complaint to avoid having to appear in court, concluded Assabah daily.

Rabat – While I was wrought with anxiety and homesickness on my flight to Morocco for my semester abroad, I cheered myself up by imagining all the delicious Moroccan foods I was about to have at my disposal.  I ignorantly assumed that Moroccan foods would resemble that of the Middle East. I was daydreaming about piles of falafel, hummus, tabouleh, fattoush, mana’eesh, and baba ghanoush. While all of these dishes are available in Morocco, the country has so much more to offer in terms of its own authentic cuisine. I won’t bore you by going over the varieties of couscous and tagines that are native to Morocco. They’re great, but their worldwide fame makes that discussion a bit redundant. Here are ten more Moroccan foods of varying popularity that you need to try during your visit–or make at home! Zaaluk  My favorite way to start a meal is with zaaluk and bread. To be honest, I could eat this as a meal by itself–it’s really that delicious.  The base of zaaluk is mashed eggplants, tomatoes, and garlic. It is spiced with cumin, black pepper, paprika, and cayenne for some heat. Use it as a spread or dip before moving onto the main course of your meal. It’s easy to fill up on this stuff, so pace yourself!  Tangia  I said I wasn’t going to mention tagines or couscous, but I do have to mention one renowned Moroccan dish: tangia.  Most famous in Marrakech, tangia is yet another Moroccan dish named for its cooking vessel.  Tangia, also known as the bachelor’s dish, was originally cooked by unmarried working men who would gather to prepare this easy, meat-based meal.  Tangia is prepared with bone-in chunks of meat or chicken flavored with garlic, onions, preserved lemon, and cumin. Traditionally, bachelors would assemble the ingredients in an urn-like pot and bury the tangia in hot ashes to cook slowly while they went off to work.  Another traditional method included bringing the pot of ingredients to the local hammam, where the tangia was cooked overnight over hot coals and picked up the next morning. The slow process tenderizes the meat so that it falls easily off the bone.  You can easily find this traditional dish at restaurants in Marrakech as well as in Meknes, Fez, and Sefrou.  Moroccans didn’t invent slow cooking, but they certainly perfected the technique. This mouthwatering meal is truly one for the books.  Rfissa  Don’t worry, ladies–Moroccan women get a special meal, too!  Rfissa is a traditional dish of chicken, onions, lentils, and msemen that was curated to replenish women after childbirth. It’s seasoned with saffron, parsley, coriander, ras el hanout, ginger, garlic, turmeric, salt, and pepper.  The secret ingredient is fenugreek, a medicinal herb that supposedly boosts milk production in new mothers. Fenugreek is also lauded as a natural way to treat inflammation, balance blood sugar levels, and improve male libido.  It’s unlikely you’ll find this dish in a restaurant, so take a day to prepare this amazing meal at home.  B’stilla The first time I had b’stilla was days before traveling to Morocco for my semester abroad. I went out to a Moroccan restaurant with my family and one of the courses was this sweet and savory meat pie. I was amazed at how much I enjoyed this strange combination of chicken, eggs, nuts, cinnamon, and sugar.  The Moroccan dish, which has Andalusian origins, is usually prepared for large events or parties. It can be made with chicken, seafood, or even pigeon. Now that I live in Rabat, I get to enjoy homemade b’stilla even without a cause for celebration, courtesy of my wonderful mother-in-law. In addition to making the large pie for family gatherings, she stuffs triangles of phyllo dough with the b’stilla mixture for me to fry up whenever I crave this one-of-a-kind flavor and texture.  Not everyone is as lucky as I am, so grab this traditional meal whenever you get the chance! Sardines Morocco’s Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts are famous for their bountiful varieties of fresh seafood. Seeing as Morocco is the world’s top producer of canned sardines, it comes as no surprise that sardine-based dishes are particularly famous in the Kingdom.  Most Moroccans, of course, prefer fresh sardines over canned. You’ll find endless options in the coastal cities of Essaouira, Agadir, Tetouan, Tangier, and Rabat. Try them grilled, barbequed, or fried and stuffed with chermoula. Amazigh flatbread (madfouna)  The Amazigh flatbread is probably the most underrated dish in the country. Sure, it’s basically a sandwich, but who doesn’t love sandwiches? According to a BBC Travel feature, this ancient “Moroccan pizza” originated in the Erg Chebbi region of the Sahara Desert.  To make the pizza, Saharan bread dough is kneaded, rolled into a round shape, stretched over fillings, pinched closed, and baked. Imazighen originally baked the meal in a fire pit in the sand or in a mud oven, but now it is also cooked in large fire ovens.  Fillings include beef, lamb, chicken, eggs, nuts, onions, and garlic. The quintessential Moroccan herbs and spices—including cumin, paprika, turmeric, ginger, and parsley–add even more flavor to the fillings. The flatbreads tend to be customizable, so there is an option for everyone.        If you ever visit the Sahara, specifically the town of Rissani, don’t pass up the chance to sample this amazing age-old tradition.  Maakouda Maakouda is one of Morocco’s safest street foods–you probably won’t need Imodium after enjoying these crispy potato fritters. No undercooked meat or unwashed vegetables here! You can find this snack practically anywhere, but maakouda also comes in a quiche-like form that can be enjoyed as a meal. This version is baked or cooked in a tagine rather than fried and includes eggs. Both variations pair nicely with ketchup or a spicy sauce.   Either way, you can’t go wrong with this one.  Amlou  Amlou is a deliciously sweet mixture of argan oil, honey, and almonds.  The taste and texture are reminiscent of peanut butter due to the strong nutty flavor of argan oil. I personally prefer it over peanut butter, and I like to tell myself it’s healthier. Enjoy amlou with warm msemen or other Moroccan breads for a filling breakfast or snack.  Everything during Ramadan Sorry, I couldn’t pick just one. But I’ll try to limit myself to sweets.  If you visit Morocco during the holy month of Ramadan, you’ll be exposed to some of the best desserts the country has to offer.  My absolute favorite Ramadan delight is harira and chebakia. Mind you, harira is not a dessert. I had to mention it, though, because the unlikely pair of honey-drenched cookies and a hearty tomato, chickpea, and lentil soup is truly unbeatable.  Other famous Ramadan sweets in Morocco include briwat (deep-fried stuffed turnovers), sellou (flour paste made with nuts, honey, and seeds), and lsan teer cookies (honeyed, crescent-shaped treats).  Don’t eat, drink, or smoke in public during the day if you aren’t fasting for Ramadan–this is hshuma (shameful). Even more hshuma, though, is depriving yourself of these delicious sweets when it’s time to breakfast. Kul! Eat! Almost everything during Eid al Adha Again, I couldn’t pick just one. Eid al Adha is heaven for meat-lovers but not for the faint of heart. You will see a lot of blood, guts, and severed sheep heads if you go out and about during the yearly Festival of Sacrifice.  Moroccan families celebrating Eid use every part of the sheep that they don’t give away to the poor or to friends and neighbors. The first holiday meal for many families is made of sheep entrails and liver: boulfaf and tkalia.   one of the most popular Moroccan foods during Eid, called meshwi, is best enjoyed fresh off the grill. Chunks of sheep or lamb meat are seasoned with parsley, coriander, cumin, black pepper, and salt and barbequed to perfection. Sheep liver is also made into tender kebabs and wrapped with lace fat.   LKhlii is made of dried and salted meat and is a great way to preserve leftover lamb or mutton from the holiday. During Eid, kouraine is made from the slaughtered animal’s legs and prepared with chickpeas, saffron, turmeric, paprika, ginger, cumin, and garlic. Raisins are sometimes added for a touch of sweetness.  Roasted ribs are another holiday favorite, flavored with onion, cumin, black pepper, ginger, coriander, saffron, lemon juice, and garlic.  The holidays are a great time to experience some of the country’s best dishes, but Morocco never faces a shortage of delicious food. This list is merely a glimpse at the amazing cuisine that has either originated in Morocco or been perfected by Moroccans.  With unique culinary traditions in each region, Morocco has something to satisfy every craving.

Rabat – The Moroccan southern city of Agadir has won the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Award for Environmental Management in the Islamic World (KSAAEM) for 2018-2019. Agadir and Kazakhstan’s Nursultan have jointly won the prize in the category of “best friendly city of the environment,” says the website of the municipality of Agadir, quoting a statement from the Islamic Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (ISESCO). The prize will be handed to the municipal council of Agadir on October 2, 2019, at the opening ceremony of the 8th Islamic conference of ministers of the environment that will take place in the ISESCO headquarters in Rabat on October 2-3. The city of Agadir boasts several environmentally friendly spots, namely the gardens of Olhao and Ibn Zaidoun, and the Birds Valley that brings together a variety of bird and animal species. The city also plays host to several green areas all along the corniche. In 1979, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) founded ISESCO, one of the largest international Islamic organizations specializing in education, science, and culture.

Rabat – Participants from 127 countries gathered in Stockholm for World Water Week, beginning August 25. Collaboration on this year’s theme, “Water for society – Including all,” brought almost 4,000 government, private, and civil society participants to the conversation. Scientists, policy makers, business leaders, and civil actors contributed experience and ideas. The international meeting on water and development was organized and hosted by the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI). The forum has grown into an international hub for water issues since its inception in 1991. Topics covered during the week ranged from digital water crisis solutions to sustainable sanitation solutions for refugees and displaced persons. Naoufal Salama of Tangier’s Amendis, a public service operator providing water distribution and wastewater collection and treatment services, presented a local project to conference participants. Salama highlighted issues of water access inequities in and around Tangier, contributing to a broader conversation on equitable water governance. Sub-topics varied across disciplines and geographies, but the common theme remained straightforward: shaping cooperative solutions for global water issues. Water challenges in Morocco ripple across sectors. Health, hygiene, agriculture, and food security are threatened by water insecurity, a stark reality exacerbated by climate change. 13% of Moroccans still use unimproved drinking water sources, and only 77% use basic sanitation services, according to UNICEF. About 15% of agricultural land is irrigated, leaving cultivation dependent on rainfall and dwindling groundwater resources. An extensive drought during 2015 and 2016 led to a 70% decrease in grain production. Agriculture accounts for approximately 15% of GDP and employs 40% of Morocco’s labor force, and the drought left tens of thousands without work. King Mohammed VI called on mosques to pray for rain in the face of agricultural crisis in 2017. His government invested heavily in new agricultural policies. The MENA is known as one of the world’s most water-stressed regions. Human exploitation has severely depleted groundwater levels, and consumption rises as the population grows. Climate change exacerbates existing water challenges at an accelerating pace. Morocco and its regional neighbors face threats to water security from rising temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns, increasing soil salinity, and extreme weather events. As World Water Week participants collaborated on international efforts, the G7 wrapped up its annual meeting in Biarritz, France. On Monday, members discussed the threat of climate change. These global powers agreed on the urgency of action. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed G7 leaders, excepting the absent US President Trump, on the world’s climate crisis. “We have the tools to address the climate emergency, but we need more political will,” he insisted. Morocco’s political will is clear in national policy and rhetoric. King Mohammed VI took a strong stance on climate change in a speech preceding the First Conference of the Climate Commission for the Sahel Region in February. His words, read by a Foreign Minister, expressed concern over water resources: “food shortages, dwindling water supplies and desertification caused by global warming will continue to push our youth into exile, depriving our continent of part of its crucial human resources.” Morocco acknowledges the severe threat of water insecurity, exacerbated by climate change. Still, the country has no water management agreements with neighboring Algeria. The two countries face water scarcity and similar threats from the climate crisis. At the same time, diplomatic relations between the two countries are mired in rivalry. Aquifers shared by the two countries in the Bounaïm-Tafna basin provide water for surrounding agricultural lands. Proper management could provide water to underdeveloped regions in both countries, but proper management requires cooperation. EcoPeace Middle East proves that in a time of crisis, transboundary water management can drive cooperation in a strained diplomatic environment. The nonprofit, run by Jordanian, Palestinian, and Israeli directors, works on environmental peacemaking across the Jordan River Basin. The region is one of the most water-stressed areas of the world, and home to perhaps the world’s most intractable conflict. Israeli co-Founder Gidon Bromberg inspired hope in a speech last August: “Water scarcity is the most critical environmental issue that our region faces. Managing our shared water resources … presents the opportunity to forge solutions that advance peacemaking in the region. Even in the most intractable of situations and conflicts, when we work together on a common objective that serves mutual interest, we can … build trust and give good reasons for hope for a better future.” Morocco is lauded for efforts in domestic water management. This includes construction of one of the world’s largest desalination plants, situated near coastal city Agadir. Large-scale projects such as the Douira plant, and small-scale water projects across the country help Moroccans in social and economic spheres. However, these efforts are insufficient, according to climate crisis and consumption projections. In his February speech, Morocco’s sovereign stressed the need for international cooperation: “Rallying stakeholders against the devastating effects of climate change cannot stop at national borders. In fact, it should transcend all rifts.”

Rabat – A conscript serving in the military service died on August 30 at the military hospital of Moulay Ismail, Meknes.  A military source told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that the deceased suffered from diabetes. According to his mother, the conscript had been suffering from diabetes for six years. His condition required insulin injections, but he voluntarily stopped treatment in order to volunteer for military service, added the mother. When asked about his medical history, the conscript denied having any medical issues and told the medical committee that he did not take any medication. According to MAP, the military provided adequate support for the family of the deceased, as is the protocol in such cases. Meknes is one of the 14 training centers dedicated to new conscripts after the selection process. The military selection process started on August 19 and is supposed to end today, August 31. The final selected conscripts are expected to start their one-year military training tomorrow, September 1.

Rabat – While doing research for my recent piece about sterilization, I came across a VICE article about the cats of Marrakech. It was written in 2014 by someone named Tory Noll.  “The best thing about Marrakech is its out-of-control cat population,” reads the first line of the article. The author mentions that she has “a soft spot for deformed and mangy cats,” so she’s particularly fond of those in Marrakech.  The article is essentially a photo essay of the street cats in Marrakech. Each photo includes a caption and the names given to the cats by the author.  The first photo features a cat with a visible eye infection. The author describes the cat’s “wonky eye” as “cute.” Another photo features three kittens.  “One of them was blind, which was super sad, but he seemed happy otherwise,” the caption reads. “They slept in a cardboard box. It could be worse!” The author also shares two photos of a pregnant cat. The first shows how large she is, while the second is a close-up shot of her face.  “Babe alert! She’ll have no problem finding another dude to mate with,” the author writes.  Is this person delusional? I wondered, suddenly enraged. Do people really think like this? It took me a few moments to realize my own hypocrisy and get down off my high horse.  Yes, people really do think like this—I used to think like this. Even as a supposedly well-informed American student in Rabat, I was blissfully unconcerned with the nagging issue of animal welfare in the country. I actually loved seeing cats every day on my walk to school.   My wake-up call didn’t come until April of 2018, more than two months into my semester abroad.  One of my school buildings was in Rabat’s old medina, and living nearby was a pregnant cat. When she gave birth, people from the neighborhood set up a cardboard box to house her and her newborn kittens. Residents also left cheese, milk, and meat scraps for the nursing mother. I thought this was cute.  The box had been in the same spot for nearly four weeks. One day I approached my class building only to find that a neighbor had poured a bucket of dirty water out of her window directly onto the box, soaking the kittens and spooking the mother into abandoning them.   The kittens’ pitiful cries reverberated throughout the small alleyway for days. They were too young to be without their mother, who was lurking nearby but now refused to go near them.  I will never forget how helpless I felt as I left my lecture one afternoon because their cries were insufferable. I found the wooden crate they had been trapped under and held their shivering, dirty bodies to my chest. Two of them were barely moving.     I didn’t know of a nearby vet, but even if I did, I had no way of transporting them. I didn’t know of a pet store where I could buy kitten formula, but even if I did, I couldn’t foster them at my host family’s apartment.  I asked the employees at my school if they could call anyone for help. As far as I know, no calls were made. I reached out to a local animal association but received no response. I had no other resources to consult.  The neighborhood’s residents, who had once cared so much for the mother cat and her kittens, could now only look on with sympathy.  The kittens starved to death in a matter of days. They cried for help until they no longer had the strength. They spent their last moments cold, wet, and afraid. This is not cute.  This tragedy is not an anomaly in Morocco. In fact, I’ve heard of much worse.  A boy walking in Temara encouraged his dog to attack a kitten on the sidewalk. The dog gouged her face and punctured her stomach, and she died of her injuries. This is not cute.  A man wheeling a cart of fruit near Rabat ran over a box of three-week-old kittens. One was crushed to death and the others were mangled. The man continued on his way. This is not cute. In Casablanca, a group of children picked up a stray cat by his tail and dangled him over a balcony. They dropped him to see if he would survive the fall. This is not cute.  Thousands of unwanted kittens dumped on a garbage tip in Azemmour, and elsewhere throughout Morocco contract viruses which complicate and cause their eyes to crust over and pop out of their heads. This is not cute. In Marrakech, I saw the bloodied remains of a dead cat lying atop a steaming pile of garbage. This is not cute.  Being kicked and threatened with hot oil by restaurant owners is not cute. Living in the filth under a butcher’s meat display is not cute. Getting stuck in trash bins during a desperate search for food is not cute. Tails being ripped from bodies by passing cars and motorcycles is not cute. The hunger, thirst, fear, and pain faced by Morocco’s street cats are not cute. Fighting for food and territory, being tormented by humans, and getting trapped in an endless cycle of pregnancy is not cute. Morocco’s street cats are suffering, and it is not cute. I used to play devil’s advocate. Well, they’re not all suffering, I would tell myself. A lot of people take care of them. Most Moroccans I know love cats. Look at the cats in the medina, they’re so happy and well-fed! Are some stray cats loved and cared for? Sure, you could say that.  But you know what? I don’t care anymore.  The street cats of Morocco have lost their charm to me. I no longer see them as cute. I only see their infected eyes and scarred faces; their injured legs and mangled tails; and their scrawny, dirty, starving bodies. This is not cute. It’s heartbreaking.  Animal welfare isn’t a priority in Morocco, and it probably won’t be for a long time. I can’t blame anyone for this. The government has bigger fish to fry, and most ordinary people barely earn enough to provide for their own families, let alone the stray cats of their neighborhood.  All I can ask is for my fellow foreigners to stop glorifying the disastrous animal overpopulation problem that is plaguing this country.  Morocco’s street cats are not cute. They are suffering. And they will continue to suffer so long as we write off their misery as endearing.  If you would like to learn more about animal welfare in Morocco, check out some of these organizations:   ERHAM – Azemmour Association de Defense des Animaux et de la Nature (ADAN) – Rabat La Tribu des Quat’pattes – Rabat SFT Animal Sanctuary – Tangier L’association Mchichates Comme Chats et Chiens (CCCM)

Rabat – Members of the Spanish Civil Guard stationed in the southern port of Almeria rescued six Moroccan minors. The minors were hiding under a large international transport truck coming from the port of Nador. La Voz de Almeria reported that the civil guard found the minors with the help of dogs trained to search for people hiding under vehicles. The Spanish daily pointed out that the minors had hidden near the engine of the truck, putting their lives in serious danger. The rescue operation came as Spanish and Moroccan border forces are under increased pressure from Moroccan and North African diaspora, returning to Europe after the summer holidays.  Spanish Police officers stationed in various Spanish ports step up efforts during crossings of foreign immigrants living in the Iberian territory, said the news outlet.  La Voz de Almeria also noted that during this period, police forces notice an increase in attempts of Moroccan and Algerian minors to infiltrate the country through passenger ships. “Endangering their lives, the minors try to reach the other side of the Mediterranean via the ships anchored in the ports of Ceuta and Melilla,” says the Spanish media.

Rabat – Police thwarted an attempt to smuggle 700 kilograms of cannabis resin in the city of Asilah in Northern Morocco, on August 30. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that police seized 700 kilograms of cannabis resin near the city’s coastline. Police also seized five mobile phones. DGSN also arrested a 19-year old man suspected of involvement in the international drug trafficking network. Police put the suspect in custody for further investigation to determine the circumstances of the drug trafficking case. The crackdown on the drug trafficking operation took place a day after Moroccan security services seized six tons and 723 kilograms of cannabis resin in Agadir. Police arrested a 54-year old man on suspicion of involvement in an international drug trafficking network. In Ceuta crossing point on Thursday, August 29, police also foiled a drug trafficking attempt of 98 kilograms of cannabis. Customs said that the value of the cannabis seized at the crossing point in Ceuta is estimated at MAD 980,000. Morocco’s Administration of Customs and Indirect Taxes (ADII)said that Moroccan customs seized 19.2 tons of cannabis resin in 2018, 14.7 tons less than the number of cannabis resins seized in 2017 ( 33.7 tons).

Rabat – Spokesperson of the Moroccan government Mustapha El Khalfi announced that Morocco aborted 57,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019. In a press conference after the weekly government meeting on Thursday, August 29, El Khalfi said that Morocco has dismantled 100 irregular migration networks. The minister also emphasized the importance of a shared responsibility to tackle the common concerns over irregular migration. El Khalfi echoed concerns shared by  Director of migration and border surveillance at Morocco’s Ministry of Interior Khalid Zerouali, who also called for shared responsibility for border security. In an interview with El Diario, Zerouali said earlier this month that “border security is the responsibility of all countries, all countries must contribute to make the fight against cross-border crime an effective fight.” Zerouali also said that the Moroccan-Spanish  collaboration on migration is exemplary and a “model of cooperation between the south and the north.” “We work with mixed maritime patrols between the Royal Gendarmerie and the Civil Guard, air and land and cooperate in the exchange of information to fight against [criminal] networks,” he said  He added that “working together creates trust” between countries. On August 23, the Spanish acting government approved a €32 Million grant to back Morocco’s efforts to curb irregular migration. The grant seeks to “support efforts made by the Moroccan authorities to fight against irregular immigration, smuggling of migrants, and human trafficking.” Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that Spain believes that shared responsibility is necessary to fight the flow of irregular migration.

Rabat – During talks with the president of the Moroccan House of Representatives, Habib El Malki,  Don Pramudwinai praised the quality of political relations between the two countries. He stressed that the similarities between both kingdoms would encourage the emergence of economic cooperation in various fields. The Thai Foreign Affairs minister expressed his readiness to support all initiatives in this direction. He then called for the involvement of all stakeholders, including the private sector, in finding opportunities for cooperation. In this regard, Pramudwinai gave the example of the Moroccan-Thai parliamentary friendship group and the positive results of El Malki’s participation in the 40th General Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA) of the Association of South Asian Nations (ASEAN). El Malki, on the other hand, affirmed that Morocco’s deep interest in the region of Asia and in cooperation with ASEAN. Announcing that Thai parliamentarians will be invited to an economic promotion day to be held in Morocco, El Malki stressed the importance of the contribution of parliamentary diplomacy in strengthening ties between the two kingdoms. He also hoped that the cooperation agreements being finalized would be concluded as soon as possible and signed during the Head of Thai Diplomacy’ forthcoming visit to Morocco. El Malki further indicated that a memorandum of understanding between the legislative institutions of the two countries has been proposed.

Rabat – The Ministry of Equipment, Transport, Logistics, and Water announced yesterday, August 29, that the Regional Road 106, connecting Taliouine and Tafraout, in the Taroudant province of southern Morocco is blocked due to heavy rain. The blocked road leads between the villages of Assaki and Ighrem. The Ministry advises people to avoid this section in a notice on its website. The recommended alternative would be to take the National Road 10 from Assaki until the intersection with National Road 7, then taking National Road 7 until the village of Ighrem. The notice also contains a number that affected citizens can call for more information: 05 37 71 17 17. This announcement comes only two days after the Tizert village incident. In the same region as the blocked road, floods killed seven people and injured one.. The Ministry announcement could be the first step in preventing more weather-related accidents.

Rabat – After making its debut last May during the Cannes Film Festival, “The Unknown Saint” will be showcased during BFI London Film Festival, which will take place from October 2nd to 13th. The movie is the first feature film by Moroccan director Alaa Eddine Aljem. BFI London Film Festival is one of the most important annual film festivals in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1953 by the British Film Institute (BFI) and it is sponsored by the British newspaper The Times. Every year, the festival features more than 300 films and documentaries of various lengths, from around 50 countries. After projections in Melbourne (Australia), Marseille (France), and Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina), the movie will be projected in the British capital twice, on October 2 and 4. “The Unknown Saint” stars Moroccan actors Younes Bouab, Anas El Baz, Hassan Badida, Salah Bensalah, and Bouchaib Essamak. It tells the story of Amine, a young thief, who digs a grave to hide a bag of money, before his capture by the police.  Released from prison ten years later, he returns to retrieve the bag, only to find a shrine to an “unknown Saint” built directly over his loot, and a brand new village constructed all around it. The movie blends a modern myth with caricatural comedy. It is a Franco-Moroccan co-production, financed by Doha Foundation, with the participation of Germany, Lebanon, and Qatar.

Rabat – A video of a woman with a British accent screaming at chicken vendors and committing acts of vandalism in the souk of Sidi Bouabid in Tangier has gone viral. The footage has sparked anger over tourists visiting Morocco with the aim of imposing their own cultural and societal values on the population. In the video, the woman can be seen aggressively screaming, at the men that they “can’t read”. Still screaming, she proceeds to swear at them and stick up her middle finger, violently berating the chicken vendor for the living conditions of the chickens.   Having already amassed a crowd of onlookers, she throws herself on the cages, attempting to break open the lid. When the chicken vendor tries to keep the lid shut, she bites his hand. The onlookers tell the woman she is crazy, and others tells the chicken vendor to call the police. As the woman gets increasingly hysterical, another onlooker advises the vendor to carry the chickens away in order to pacify her. However, when he does begin carrying the chicken cages away with the assistance of other men, the situation only escalates. “You don’t treat animals that way!” she yells. She then proceeds to punch the Moroccan chicken vendor. The man responds by putting his hands in front of his face in self-defense. She then tries to break the chicken cages open again, kicking and punching anyone who tries to intervene. The tourist can be seen directing her anger towards an elderly woman before the footage goes shakey and the video cuts off. A police source told lesiteinfo.com that the tourist was taken to hospital in a hysterical condition, after locals informed the tourist police of the incident. While some internet users make fun of the tourist, others point out the more worrying dynamic and draw attention to the fact that, while she believes she is promoting animal rights and informing an ‘ignorant’ population, she is displaying an arrogant, neo-colonial attitude, expecting to influence change in a culture she does not fully understand. “Thank god she didn’t come to Morocco during the festival of sacrifice,” one user pointed out. “I pity this poor salesman who was just trying to make a living, only to be subjected to awful name-calling and gestures! And coming from a supposedly civilized country as well,” said another. “Does she think that in her countries chickens live in villas or something?” another chimed in. Others commented that if she would not behave that way in her own country, she should not do it here either, describing it as an act of vandalism that should be punished with imprisonment and fines. Another user commented “if it was a child in a cage instead she would have taken a selfie with it instead,” perhaps alluding to her having a white-savior complex, a term used for white tourists who visit countries in the global south, particularly in Africa, and try and “help” without fully understanding the dynamics at play. While police were called to the scene of the incident, it remains to be seen whether the woman will be prosecuted for what can only be described as verbal and physical assault, as well as vandalism. The incident is an example of ‘white privilege’ in practice, and is a common theme in the modern phenomenon of ‘voluntourism.’ In an ever more global society, where the privileged classes are able to travel at will, the global south is experiencing a resurgence of colonial powers at an individual level. Now it is not only the governments, explicitly controlling political and financial dynamics, but the individuals who, as a result of their own privilege, see themselves as superior to the inhabitants of the countries they visit.

Rabat – As the African Games wind to a close, Egypt is set to end with the highest medal count. With several medal ceremonies still to go in sports like volleyball and tennis, Egypt has racked up 82 gold medals. In second so far, Nigeria has 42 golds. Following Nigeria are South Africa (35), Algeria (31), and Morocco (28). Egypt also has the most medals overall (238), followed by Algeria (114), Nigeria (105), Morocco (96), and Tunisia (89). Rabat has been hosting the African Games since August 16. Saturday, August 31, will be the last day of the games.  Today’s final competitions include men’s football. Nigeria will take on Burkina Faso at 5 p.m. at the Boubker Aamar Stadium in Sale, Rabat’s twin city. Morocco’s men’s and women’s team tennis players will take on Egypt in the final team tennis competition on Saturday, hoping to score two more gold medals. Morocco’s most successful sportspeople have been its karatekas. In both men’s and women’s karate events, Morocco earned nine gold medals. Morocco also won golds in taekwondo, boxing, snooker, judo, equestrian sports, fencing, triathlon, and canoeing. Although many swimmers won multiple medals, only South African Erin Gallagher has won an impressive 10: eight gold medals and two silver medals. Showing her versatility across the sport, Gallagher won medals in the 100 meter freestyle, 50 meter backstroke, and 100 meter butterfly events. Athletes come together in the continental sporting event, previously called the All-Africa Games, every four years. The games are an important lead-up to the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020. Fifteen of the 26 sports in Rabat’s African Games are qualifiers for the Summer Olympics.

Rabat – A new, government-sponsored report has established that expanding social disparities and pointed income inequality constitute the main factors of the failure of Morocco’s public schools as well as the deepening gap between rich and poverty-stricken Moroccans. The report, ran under the supervision of Omar Azziman, the president of Morocco’s Higher Council for Education, Training and Scientific Research (CSEFRS), is a damning statement on the current state of Moroccan public schools. While it does offer a glimmer of hope about what can be done to reverse the bleak realities it describes, the report is adamant that the present situation is “highly concerning” for Morocco’s educational system. It warns that the future is even more worrisome for the country’s public schools if private schools continue to thrive at the expense of government investments in public learning institutions. The report estimated that, in the recently concluded academic year, only 14% of the over 7 million Moroccan pupils were registered in private schools. By contrast, however, the performance index of this tiny minority of private schools-educated pupils during national exams was far above that of the rest. On average, a child in private school scored 461 points on tests. This is over 100 points above that of an average performer from a public school, where the standard performance stood at 340 in the past academic year. The numbers are “alarming” and, according to CSEFRS, speak volumes about the “concerning” context within which Moroccan public schools have found themselves in the past two decades or so. While a set of multiple and interlocked factors may all certifiably account for the big performance gap between private and public schools, the report prominently cited “poverty” and “social disparities” and “unequal redistribution of wealth” as the main explanatory factors. Coupled with the shortage, or sometimes complete lack, of government funding to raise the standards of the teaching quality in public schools or renovate the mostly crippling infrastructure is the “skewed, unequal income redistribution” across the social spectrum. Behind this finding is the oft-repeated point that rich or middle-class Moroccan families send their children to private schools, whereas poor, low-income citizens are obliged to send theirs to public institutions. A related consequence of this, according to the report, is the creation of an unbalanced competition between the tiny minority of privately schooled Moroccans and the remaining, crushing majority of Moroccans lacking the social and cultural capital available to their counterparts at private institutions. The educational system as it currently stands, suggests the report, is becoming the primary driver of a reproduction system, sustaining the existing social disparities. A dysfunctional, poorly funded educational system dampens social mobility and “sustains social disparities.” But, the report hastened to add, as if shining a tiny glimpse of hope over what is essentially a dispiriting assessment, radical reforms and policy interventions can reverse the current situation. To reverse the tide and possibly salvage Moroccan public schools, however, the report proposed a 2020-2030 “strategic vision.” Almost entirely inspired from King Mohammed’s oft-cited new development model, the “strategic vision” called for an inclusive education system where significant government funds go into rehabilitating school infrastructure, raising teaching quality (qualified and well paid teachers), and providing incentives to low-income students in the forms of scholarships or loans. The report comes just three months after another CSEFRS study found that, again due to social disparities and a bundle of related factors, one in five Moroccan students typically drop out of school at a very early age, driving up the already high numbers of Moroccans who end up living through surviving from one precarious job to another.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Navy rescued on Thursday, August 29 156 irregular migrants, including 15 women and three children. A military source told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that the migrants were facing difficulties onboard several inflatable boats. Most of the migrants are of sub-Saharan origin, according to the source.  Some of the migrants were in poor health. The royal guards provided the necessary medical care to the migrants, who were then brought safely to different Moroccan northern ports. The pressure from the flow of irregular migration pressure continues, while Morocco launches concrete measures and initiatives to curb the influx. As both a transit and destination country, Morocco is intensifying its efforts with international partners to strengthen border control. The ongoing pressure urged Spain to reinforce its activism at the level of the European Union (EU), which pledged  €140 million to assist the North African country to contain migration flows. On top of the EU grant, Spain approved on August 23, €32million to Morocco. The fund seeks to support efforts made by the Moroccan authorities to fight against irregular immigration, smuggling of migrants, and human trafficking. In addition to Thursday’s rescue operation, the navy has assisted many irregular migrants in difficult situations in the Meditteranean throughout the year. On August 4,  the navy rescued 424 irregular migrants in the Mediterranean. The list of migrants included 53 women and 16 minors. They were on board several damaged makeshift inflatable boats on Sunday, August 4 night and the rescue mission continued into the early hours of Monday, August 5. The navy also rescued 63 sub-Saharan migrants on August 4.Irregular migration continues to cause frustration for the Spanish and Moroccan governments. The most recent irregular migration operation took place today, August 30 after 153 irregular migrants, originating from sub-Saharan countries, mostly Guinea, crossed the border between Morocco and Spanish exclave, Ceuta, today, August 30

Rabat – A Japanese stationary company has sold all 500 of the anti-groping gadgets produced for a trial-run of the product. Customers can use the device, about the size of a lip balm tube, to put an invisible ink stamp on the hand of a groper. Later, if police shine an ultraviolet light on the offender’s hand, the stamp appears with the image of a small hand. Offenders can wash the ink off, however. Hirofumi Mukai, the company spokesman of Shachihata stationary company, said the product sold out within an hour of its launch on Tuesday, August 27. The small device costs ¥2,500 (MAD 226) and is intended to be used by women who experience groping, especially on crowded trains. Tokyo police “recorded 1,750 cases of groping or molestation,” the Independent reports. Morocco has also grappled with the harassment and assault of women in public. A group of teenagers attacked a woman with a mental disability on a bus in Casablanca in August 2017. A video of the incident sparked public uproar in Morocco. In another viral video from March 2018, a Moroccan man tried to remove a woman’s clothes while she kicked him in self defense. Last year, Parliament passed Law 103-13 on the “Elimination of Violence Against Women,” setting increased penalties for sexual harassment and assault.  Shachihata did not address the potential for abuse, for example, if a person chose to stamp non-offenders with the anti-groping gadget as a prank. Some activists, however, complained that the device makes money from harassment prevention, putting the onus on women to defend themselves, according to the BBC.

Rabat – Spanish police have arrested a 25-year old suspect in Elda, Spain for his alleged links to the ISIS, Spanish security services announced on Twitter. El Matinal said on August 29 that the suspect is a Moroccan national. Germany issued an arrest warrant against the suspect, for his alleged involvement in document fraud and tax fraud. The Twitter post said that the suspect has been on the run since 2017. The suspect traveled to Spain via several European countries through irregular means. 🚩Detenido en Elda #Alicante un presunto colaborador de DAESH reclamado por #Alemania desde su huida en 2017 y que se ocultaba en nuestro país tras moverse de manera clandestina por varios países #SomosTuPolicía #EstamosPorTi pic.twitter.com/kOekknejGj — Policía Nacional (@policia) August 29, 2019  Spanish security services have arrested several Moroccans for alleged links to terror groups in recent years. July, a Spanish judge sentenced a Moroccan national to prison for  “ promoting terrorism.” In  June 2018, Spanish security services also arrested a 30year old Moroccan near Barcelona under an international arrest warrant from Moroccan police. The suspect fled Morocco after security services dismantled a terror cell in September 2018. Morocco and Spain regularly collaborate in the fight against drug trafficking, terrorism, and irregular migration networks. Moroccan police, in cooperation with Spanish and Moroccan intelligence services, arrested a Moroccan terror suspect in April. The suspect was allegedly planning a terror attack in Seville, southern Spain. In June, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Spain is “Morocco’s largest trading partner and the two countries are linked by exemplary cooperation relations in several areas such as migration management and anti-terrorist cooperation.” The statement was not the only acknowledgment Morocco received from Spain. In 2019, Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs Josep Borell said that cooperation between Spain and Morocco against terrorism “is an example to follow for other countries to address this scourge, because it is a cooperation that is beneficial for both parties.”

Rabat – Japanese daily the Japan Times has heaped praise on Morocco for the transformations it has witnessed in recent years, noting the country’s “close” commercial and diplomatic ties with Japan, as well as its label among foreign investors as the “gateway to Africa.” In an article titled “Momentum in Morocco,” the Japanese paper, though an interview with Hicham Boudraa, CEO of the recently established Moroccan Investment and Export Development Agency (AMDIE), explored the notable advances that Morocco has recently made in a number of sectors, from infrastructure projects to the industry and energy sectors. As an assertive voice in the African Union and a trailblazer in continental trends, the report notes, Morocco has established itself as a go-to destination for investors interested in the enormous opportunities on the African continent. It reads, “A member of the African Union, Morocco is today working closely with organizations across the continent. Investors are referring to Morocco as “the gateway to Africa” as the country is well-positioned to provide companies with access to Africa’s 1.5 billion potential consumers.” Focusing on Morocco’s “Gateway to Africa” nickname among foreign investors, Boudraa explained to the Japanese newspaper that a key part of Morocco’s attractiveness is the unparalleled geographic advantage it offers to companies registered in Morocco and doing business dealings across the continent. “Intrinsically connected to Africa and on Europe’s economic doorstep, Morocco is fast-becoming the best regional investment destination,” he said. Predictably, as the article comes in the week of the 7th Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) and in the wake of consolidating bilateral commercial relations between Morocco and Japan, it extensively covered the steps both Japan and Morocco have made in recent months and years to bolster their developing, promising cooperation. “Japan recognizes Morocco’s potential,” the article noted. It continued: “While South Africa is home to the highest number of Japanese companies of any African country, Morocco comes a close second. Today the largest private employer in Morocco is a Japanese company.” According to Boudraa, Morocco understands the demands and priorities of Japanese—and other foreign investors—increasingly relocating to the North African country. As such, the country has been going the extra mile to secure investors’ confidence by making the necessary political reforms to make them feel safe and positive about their Moroccan ventures. When it comes to convincing investors and gaining their trust, Morocco’s socio-political and economic stability in a region typically associated with political turbulence has proved an effective selling point. “Our political system remains stable in what has been described as a turbulent region of the world,” Boudraa asserted. But also added to that is the impressive gains the country’s relatively new but flourishing industrial sector has registered of late. Between a vibrant automotive sector, a promising aeronautical industry, and with state-the-of-art infrastructure sprouting across Morocco, Boudraa suggested, it is only natural that the North African country attracts sustained interest from investors. “It is important investors recognize that Morocco’s success as a nation is based on the country’s stability and the king’s vision,” the article remarked.

Rabat – Having met with senior officials in Morocco, Army General Stephen T. Townsend, the commander of the US Africa Command (AFRICOM), said on August 29 that Morocco is a “strong” counterterrorism partner. During his visit to Rabat, Townsend emphasized to the press the importance of the relationship between Morocco and the US. The US official said that the relationship between the two countries is “based on a mutual commitment to security and sustainable development in the region.” “By training together with other African partners, the US military and the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces can improve our ability to work together and provide a safe, more prosperous future for the region,” he said. Townsend added that Morocco is a regional leader in security as it secures not only its own borders, but also brings security to the rest of Africa through training and peacekeeping operations. The US military official also spoke about the worrying situation in the Sahel region,  emphasizing that the US share Morocco’s concerns about the instability in the region. Head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) Abdelhak Khiame has long warned of the alarming situation in the Sahel. In a series of interviews,  Khiame explained that gangs and criminal networks consider the Sahel region a safe zone for terror cells. He said that a lack of security cooperation in the region is exacerbating the already fraught issue. In response to the threat in the region, Townsend said, “We are working with all of our African partners and international partners to try to solve this problem.” The US official reiterated the US acknowledgment of Morocco’s efforts to stand against extremism, radicalization, and terrorism. Morocco has modernized its security strategy. The surge of terror threats in Morocco urged Morocco to introduce in 2015 the BCIJ, who has been dismantling terror cells for years. The 2018 Global Terrorism Index listed Morocco among the least impacted countries by terrorism. Morocco’s counterterrorism strategy, according to the report, makes the North African country safer than powerful countries, including the US, ranked 20th, and France ranked 30th.  Morocco ranked 132nd out of 163 in the 2018 terrorism index. In addition to Morocco’s efforts in curbing terrorism, Townsend also extolled Morocco’s cooperation under peacekeeping operations. Morocco contributes with more than 2,100 uniformed peacekeeping volunteers. Townsend also praised the annual African Lion exercise, the largest exercise that AFRICOM undertakes. Morocco has been hosting the exercise as the primary sponsor for years, Townsend said. He added that the next exercise will convene 3000 participants from 21 partner nations, including at least eight African partner nations.

Rabat – The Moroccan ambassador to South Africa, Youssef Amrani, addressed a gathering of intellectuals and diplomats in Pretoria, expressing his confidence in the continent’s future, on Thursday, August 29. For 15 years, Morocco did not have an ambassador in South Africa. That changed this summer after South Africa agreed in March to accept Amrani’s credentials. South Africa and Morocco differ on the status of Western Sahara but have agreed to reinstate high-level diplomatic relations. Amrani spoke at the University of Pretoria on Morocco’s Africa policy, according to state-run media agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). As two of the continent’s largest economies, Morocco and South Africa play central roles in its future.  The Moroccan ambassador to South Africa highlighted the importance of higher education and training as he spoke of King Mohammed VI’s priorities.  While Moroccans’ value of higher education is evident from the high percentage of Baccalaureate degree holders who enter university (75%), comparatively fewer pursue vocational training (25%). King Mohammed VI has been emphasizing the need to embrace vocational training as a viable alternative for the unemployed. Amrani noted the emphasis Morocco is putting on Africa, evident in its political rhetoric and investment partnerships, especially since rejoining the African Union in 2017. “We are convinced that the current process of globalization can not continue without a developed, prosperous and self-sufficient Africa,” he said, according to MAP. To attain self-sufficiency, Amrani said, Africa needs peace and security and to promote its youth. Africa’s multiple conflicts and a median age of just 19 years make the call no small challenge. However, the landmark African Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) that went into effect in May could be a boost to the continent’s economy and the aspirations of its young people. Ambassador Amrani noted that active South-South cooperation and accelerating regional integration will be pillars of African development. By uniting 54 countries in a $3.4 trillion trading zone, the CFTA will go a long way towards continental integration. As regional leaders on the northern and southern edges of the continent, Morocco and South Africa are key to successful continental integration.

Rabat – Based on intel provided by the Directorate-General for Territorial Surveillance (DGST) on August 29, judicial police in Agadir arrested a 54-year-old suspected of belonging to an international drug trafficking network. In coordination with Royal Gendarmerie, police forces attempted to seize three vehicles thought to be trafficking massive quantities of cannabis resin.   The cars’ drivers, however, tried to escape, damaging highway equipment and facilities in the process. One of the suspects also fired a hunting rifle at the police officers in an attempt to avoid arrest. Different Moroccan police forces cooperated in leading search operations. The search enabled the seizure of two cars with fake plates, six tons and 723 kilograms of cannabis resin, and the hunting rifle.  Police arrested all the suspects involved and opened an investigation into the case under the supervision of the Prosecutor’s Office. The investigations are ongoing in order to arrest possible accomplices in the trafficking network and to determine if it is  connected to other international drug trafficking networks.

Rabat – According to Pakistan Today, the Moroccan embassy,  led by Mohamed Karmoun, transported the 26-ton goods without the agreement of the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Based on documents issued by the carriers of the cargo, the Pakistani news outlet claimed that the Moroccan embassy imported the shipment under diplomatic immunity. The Pakistani tax authorities have opened an investigation into the matter. An administrative officer of the embassy, Jaouad Anouar, told Pakistani media that the diplomatic mission “did not order nor import such heavy cargo.” He also said that the ambassador had opened an investigation into the case. According to TelQuel, the last massive shipment made by the Moroccan Embassy in Islamabad weighed nearly two tons. The cargo was furniture intended for Moroccan diplomats in Pakistan.  Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the embassy in Islamabad categorically denied media reports concerning the allegedly unlawful shipment. “Any import of duty-free items requires, according to custom rules, that the Protocol Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the host country be informed in advance,” the embassy said in a statement. “Any request in this regard must include a packing list indicating the capacity of the shipment, its origin, and its port of embarkation,” said the statement. Adding that it had officially contacted the Pakistani Foreign Office to clarify the issue, the Moroccan embassy stated it had not applied for any import. According to the statement, the Director-General of Protocol at the Pakistani Foreign Office confirmed that they did not receive any request from the Moroccan embassy for such a shipment, adding “it would probably be a fraudulent act.” The Pakistani official also stressed that the Moroccan embassy has always respected the rules set out in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

Rabat – Morocco’s “high potential” banking and financial sector and its “laudable” efforts on the renewable energy front were the talking points of a side event at the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) on Wednesday, August 29. The event, organized by Casablanca Finance City (CFC) and Moroccan Agency for Renewable Energies (Masen), aimed to showcase investment opportunities in the banking and financial sectors in Morocco as well as the North African country’s recent efforts in renewable energies, one of the primary areas for Japanese investments in Africa. The event was held in a conference-like format and convened dozens of Japanese business owners and larger scale investors with potentiale interests in exploring, and building businesses in Morocco. Speaking to the audience, CFC director, Said Ibrahimi, promised his company’s readiness to orient and accompany Japanese investors in any , prospective ventures in Morocco. Focusing his arguments on the “incredible, enormous” opportunities in Morocco’s banking and services sectors, Ibrahimi told the Japanese investors that Morocco’s status as a continental investment hub and a leader in banking and market capitals makes it an ideal place to invest in Africa. Investing in Morocco, he argued, offers an opportunity to take advantage of the bulk of what Africa offers from a financial point of view. Ibrahimi backed up his arguments by providing figures on the assertive presence and influence of three Moroccan banks—BMCE Bank, Bank Populaire, and Wattijariwafa Bank—on the continent. With subsidiaries across, respectively, 19, 17, and 14 African countries, the three Moroccan banks are part and parcel of Morocco’s growing assertiveness in, or impact on the new intra-African dynamics. He said the three banks and other Moroccan companies, especially in the telecommunications sector, can share their African expertise and experience with their Japanese counterparts interested in exploring the continent’s investment opportunities.
Renewable energy and environment-friendly practices also featured prominently in the conference’s central points. Ali Zerouali, the president of the Moroccan Agency for Renewable Energies (Masen), extensively spoke about Morocco’s recent achievements on the renewable energy sector. In its bid to become a continental and worldwide leader on environment-friendly policies, the Moroccan government recently announced its bold ambition to get almost half of its electricity from renewable energies. Focusing on this and some other efforts the country has made in recent years on the climate front, Zerouali asserted that Morocco presents an added value for Japan’s interest in helping the African continent in terms of minimizing policies and practices that can harm the environment. The Masen director also pointed out that with more input from Japan, Morocco will be more poised and in a better position to share its experience and expertise with other countries across Africa. Throughout the event, other talking points and questions revolved around the challenge of the climate crisis for the coming decades as well as Morocco’s—and Africa’s—role in shaping the future of the world. Almost all speakers urged collective action to come to terms with shared concerns, such as the climate crisis and the changing, fast-moving services sector.

Rabat –  A search and rescue mission made up of the Libyan coast guard and local fishermen recovered five bodies after a ship carrying about 100 people sank off the coast of Libya on August 27.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  reported that three Moroccan nationals, who had been hoping to reach Italy were presumed among the five dead, a man, a woman, and a small child who are yet to be identified.  According to the UNHCR, more than 40 people are estimated to be dead or lost at sea following the boat accident. However, the rescue operation was successful in saving more than 60 people who are currently being held in the northern coastal town of Al Khoms near Tripoli.  Among the survivors were other Moroccan nationals, in addition to Egyptians and Tunisians.  However, the bulk of passengers of the capsized ship transporting migrants to Europe were Sudanese.  In July, 155 migrants died in a similar accident in the Mediterranean off the Libyan coast, in the biggest reported fatality of the year. UNHCR estimates that after this latest incident, more than 900 people have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean in 2019 alone. An additional 5,400 migrants and refugees have been intercepted at sea by the Libyan coast guard. During the Gaddafi era, the state kept tight control over the country’s coastlines and stop migrants heading to Italy, in exchange for large sums of money handed over by European countries.   40 more people reported lost off Libya. 900 have died in the Mediterranean in 2019. Capacity to save lives at sea has much decreased. This is what happens when the humanitarian act of rescue gets politicized. It is inhumane, immoral and illegal. https://t.co/6Kwg8JQsHw — Filippo Grandi (@RefugeesChief) August 27, 2019 
Currently, over 90 percent of refugees and migrants seeking to cross the Mediterranean towards European shores now depart from Libya. The war and political instability following the fall of the Ghaddafi regime has weakened the security apparatus and allowed smuggling networks to thrive, especially considering Libya’s porous borders with many fragile Sub-Saharan states and the length of its difficult to patrol the coastline.     The UNHCR High Commissioner Filippo Grandi, has blamed the situation on ‘politicizing the humanitarian act of rescue’.  Various NGOs active in the field have also condemned European policies of criminalizing search and rescue operations and aid to migrants in the Mediterranean.  Italy, for instance, has stopped a rescue ship operated by Mediterranean Saving Humans, from entering its territorial waters.    Earlier this week, the Italian government grounded two planes used by NGOs to search for migrants in the sea. Malta has also refused to let the rescue planes operate out of its airspace.

By Kawtar Ennaji &amp; Yahia Hatim Rabat – While enjoying a football match, Tizert villagers in the Taroudant province suddenly found themselves swept away by a flash flood. Heavy rainfall hit the region on August 28 and 29. The resulting floods caused widespread human and material damage.  At the time of writing, authorities recovered the bodies of seven people while an elderly man was injured. Other victims of the flood are still missing. Moroccans have taken to social media to express their frustration. Internet users are claiming officials and local authorities ignored warnings about the construction of the football pitch.  Villagers allegedly warned officials of the impending danger associated with the terrain allocated for the football pitch prior to its construction.  A local activist, Achnid Abderahman, posted pictures of the football field, warning the people in charge of the recurrent floods in the region.  “As you can see the football field is built on the riverbed. In the summer, floods demolish everything in their path as it is known for most mountainous areas,” he explained in his July 15 Facebook post. Mountainous regions in Morocco often face similar floods during high rainfall.  The embedded image shows that the football field was located close to the marked riverbed. For most Internet users, the field was “obviously misplaced,” especially as “mother nature often has the upper hand.” One Facebook user sarcastically enumerated all the steps leading to the “disaster.”  “Someone proposed building a football field on the riverbed, another found the idea great, approved it and authorized the construction. After that, someone budgeted the project, and then someone else allowed the two teams to play the football match; a fifth person organized the event and provided the logistics,” said the Facebook post.  The post concluded by saying, “it is with like-minded people that you want to build the new development model…” In response to the post, several internet users commented on the stupidity of those responsible for the project.  “As usual with the leaders of this country, they think only in the short term, they must have thought it was the only flat ground! It’s their neurons that are flat,” said one of the comments. “They are the victims of the stupidity of adults and the mistakes of irresponsible officials,” added another Internet user. “Building a football field on a riverbed is a matter of madness and a lack of education,” “it’s unfortunate that we still have idiots making decisions in Morocco,” added two other users. Locals, on the other hand, expressed their dissatisfaction of the facilities of Ighrem hospital, where some of the flood victims were treated. One of them commented sarcastically: “even the hospital needs to be in a hospital,” referring to the terrible state of its facilities. Low media coverage sparks additional anger Frustrated social media users also drew attention to the low media coverage of this tragedy.  Moroccans expressing their opinions on Facebook say that the country’s biggest media companies are not giving the event enough coverage. Moroccan channel Al Aoula dedicated around 30 seconds to the tragedy in last night’s 20 minute-long news program.  Another channel, 2M TV, did not even mention the floods in its late-night news program. 2M mentioned the incident in a couple of articles on its website, and the articles contain little information. The government is yet to respond to the claims of state responsibility for the incident pending an investigation into the incident opened on August 29. Senior government officials including the prime minister have, however, tweeted their condolences.

Rabat – The National Commission for Medical Students announced on Wednesday, August 28,  that it has reached an agreement with the government after six months of protests. Since March, medical students have been carrying out protests and strikes against poor medical training conditions, and the government’s decision to privatize medical education and services. On August 28, the commission announced the signing of an agreement with the government that would end the six-month strikes and boycott. The commission said that it signed the agreement with representatives of the ministries of Education and Health. Under the agreement, it “was decided unanimously”  to lift the boycott decision issued by the commission in a statement earlier this month.  Earlier this month, the Ministry of Education issued a statement to announce that medical, dentistry and pharmaceutical retake exams will take place from September  4-30. The ministry also urged students to attend retake exams as they boycotted the first exam session. The national commission, however, said that a march will take place on September 1 as part of the continuous ”struggle” to urge the government to meet their demands. The students are now expected to sit for the retake exams and to cancel the September 1 march after the signing of the agreement. The commission also announced its decision to hold a press conference to give a public statement on the agreement. The commission concluded its press release, by praising the efforts of all medical students and activists who defended the right to public education in the health sector.

Rabat – Two days before the end of the African Games 2019, Morocco fell behind to the 5th spot on the leaderboard, having been perching in 3rd place for nearly a week. Nigeria is now in 3rd place with Algeria, ahead of Morocco, in 4th place. Morocco has won, during the ongoing African Games, 80 medals including, 23 gold. That is just one gold medal fewer than Algeria, and four gold medals behind Nigeria. Moroccan athletes could still regain a position in the top 3 by going for gold in the remaining days of the competition. Currently at the top of the medals board sits Egypt, with an impressive total of 189 medals, including 63 gold. South Africa, with 72 medals (32 gold) is in 2nd place. The rest of the top 10 countries on the medals board is as follows: The African Games 2019, held in Morocco, will continue until the end of August. More than 6,000 athletes from 54 countries, in 29 different sports are participating in this year’s games. It is Morocco’s first time participating in the African Games, after its return to the African Union in 2017.

Rabat – Army General Stephen T. Townsend, the commander of the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) recently met with Moroccan government and military officials to discuss ways of further deepening the evidently strong defense collaboration between the US and its North African allies. During his stay in Rabat on Thursday, August 22, General Townsend met with Abdeltif Loudyi, Delegate Minister in charge of administering national defense-related questions. In their conversation, the two officials touched upon the “diversified” and “dynamic” security connections between Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces (FAR) and the Pentagon. They each praised the successful and “strategic” US-Morocco cooperation on national defense and counterterrorism, expressing confidence about what they mostly presented as encouraging prospects for the bilateral links between the two allies. General Townsend, who visited Rabat “heading an important delegation,” according to Moroccan news outlet MAP, reiterated the US’ satisfaction at Morocco’s reliability as a partner as well as the North African country’s security and stability-linked efforts in the region. The newspaper added that the AFRICOM commander’s visit and subsequent meetings with various Moroccan officials were carried out in the “friendship and privileged alliance spirit” that have been the distinct markers of the US-Morocco defense cooperation. General Townsend and Minister Loudyi both called for bolstering the “dense and multi-faceted” military cooperation. They also spoke about organizing more mixed training sessions between Moroccan and US troops to enhance interoperability and develop a closer cooperation in terms of intelligence sharing. The meeting comes weeks after Washington, through both President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, highlighted Morocco’s “strategic importance” in the US’ MENA ambitions. Both officials reiterated America’s commitment to maintaining close ties with its North African ally. Typically seen as security and stability bastion in its region, Morocco has gained a reputation over the years for its counterterrorism and de-radicalization success story. Counterterrorism is also one of the US’ most pressing concerns of both the US domestic and foreign policies, and General Townsend’s visit is seen as part of the US’ bid to further support Morocco’s efforts on that front. “We still have a lot to accomplish together, notably the continuation of our fight against extremism in all its forms, the promotion of tolerance and religious understanding, the promotion of common priorities in Africa…” President Trump said recently of the strong, diversified US-Morocco ties.

Rabat – After the contradictory statement from the separatist group’s leader, Ibrahim Ghali, a separatist “diplomat” said that the Polisario army is deployed at the gate of Guerguerat on the Mauritanian border. Pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara quoted the separatist Sahrawi “diplomat,” Najat Handi, who said that the Polisario Front’s army is “ready to intervene at any moment” to address “violations” from Morocco. The statement comes after the Ghali called for war with Morocco in a video message posted by Futuro Sahara in July.  The separatist leader said that the Polisario Front is launching an initiative for compulsory military service in the Tindouf camps, to “prepare for the inevitable war against a relentless enemy.” Ghali said that peace negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario are not going “anywhere,” adding that  Polisario has only one alternative: war. Weeks after his threats of war, the leader ofthe separatist group asked for “cooperation and reconciliation” with Morocco. He said that he is “extending” Polisario’s hand to the Kingdom of Morocco for “peace, reconciliation, cooperation, and good neighborliness.” He, however, called the self-proclaimed SADR a “brotherly country.” which stands in direct opposition to Morocco’s territorial integrity and sovereignty over its southern provinces in Western Sahara.  The Polisario’s calls for war run in direct opposition to the United Nations’ position. The UN has long warned both Morocco and the Polisario front against any action with might destabilize the region. In addition to threats of war, Handi also criticized the United Nations for not appointing a personal envoy after the resignation of Horst Kohler for health reasons on May 22. She said that Sahrawis are “waiting for the appointment of the personal envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General as soon as possible.” She added that the post “can’t remain vacant any longer.” The self-styled diplomat also spoke about the Polisario-Mauritania rapprochement, claiming that  the rapprochement is “beneficial to the region and its people.” She added that with a good relation between Polisario supporter, Algeria,  Mauritania, the separatist group would “contribute to giving a boost to the conflict, which remains unsolved for a long time.” The Polisario leadership is now facing the fact that several international powers, including the US are allegedly not in favor of the creation of a new state between Morocco and Mauritania.  Polisario expressed frustration after the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) published a lengthy report on the US’ support for Morocco’s cause. On August 11, the WSJ said that Washington cannot support the emergence of a state in southern Morocco.  With all the ongoing inhumane incidents in the Tindouf camps, the Polisario Front’s focus is on convincing international powers of its separatist ideologies and the validity of its position. A delegation of the separatist group is currently taking part at this year’s Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) meeting in Yokohama. Despite the presence of the self-proclaimed SADR at the event, Japan remains staunch in its support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. The Polisario Front, meanwhile, continues the arbitrary arrests of all political opposition in the Tindouf camps. While human rights organizations call on the Polisario leadership to address the ongoing human rights violations and inhumane conditions in the camps, Ghali blithely looks the other way, pointing the finger at Morocco and flexing its diminutive muscles.

Rabat – However, the media, given the nature of the political system of this country, enjoys a tremendous amount of freedom and independence, and consequently, has more room for maneuvering and creativity. The image US media projects of the American society abroad undoubtedly has its ups and downs. On the one hand, it glorifies such American ideals as: freedom, democracy, equal opportunity, multiculturalism, and gender equality, and on the other, it disseminates distorted information that enhances the already existing stereotypes and misconceptions.  This analysis aims at investigating ways in which the media affects, positively and negatively, the world at large, taking Morocco as an example.  The  impact  of the American culture Crossing physically from one culture into another can be a traumatic experience; the move is not only a difficult, but one also has to learn the focal language and its intricacies, adapt to the climate and, most importantly, understand the culture (known as the silent language) and the way of life of the target country. Storti, in a book entitled: The Art of Crossing Cultures, argues that: “Before you can adapt to foreign culture, you first have to survive the move abroad. People who move overseas face a number of adjustments all at once. They must, of course, come to grips with the local culture, with the peculiar behavior of the natives. But they must also get used to a new job, a new community, and a new country.”  Nowadays, however, if one does not feel comfortable going to other cultures, some of these cultures, instead, will come to him in various forms and shapes. One such culture is the American Culture.  Indeed, today’s America, with its strong economy, technology, civilization and military might, has successfully spread its culture around the world to the extent that it has become universal, to say the least. Is it not the case that American fast food  such as McDonald’s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Pizza Hut, are taking the world by storm, not forgetting, beverages such as Coca Cola, Pepsi, and Seven Up,?  Needless to say, however, if American culture has become universal, the credit or the blame, undoubtedly, goes to the cinema and television shows that have over decades held the world’s breath with their good and not so good entertainment. Among the many other forms of American culture that have invaded us in the comfort of our homes we find music, dance, fashion, web and language. Nevertheless, one is made to wonder, to what extent that which we are subjected to around the world is truly representative of America, its people, ideas, philosophy and way of life? Many foreign critics argue, quite vehemently, today, that the American culture projected abroad is only representative of that of the Whites/WASPs (White Anglo Saxon Protestants), albeit with some token representation of other cultures. Now that the concept of “political correctness”  is spreading fast among the intellectuals all over the world, the critics are calling for true multiculturalism in America. Paul Gray ,  in an article entitled: “Whose America,” published by Time magazine on July 8, 1991, argues that: “In the critical optic of this new “multicultural” perspective, American history as it was once written–those often tedious treks from Christopher Columbus to Dwight Eisenhower–leaves out too much, namely nearly everyone who was not a white male. Some adherents go further, questioning whether the Western ideas and ideals that gave birth to America discriminate against people from other traditions. A more radical school argues that those values are no more than the ethnic expression of Euro-centric culture and should be taught only as such.” This means that the American culture, or should we refer to it as American plural culture, if we take into consideration not just the culture of the white man but, also, that of the African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Arab-Americans, Puerto Ricans/ Latinos, and Amerindians, etc. may come to us in the next decades in different shapes and forms, with the possible rehabilitation of all racial minorities. As a matter of fact, the much-acclaimed film “Dances with Wolves” , which rehabilitates Amerindians and their culture is a true avant-goût of the shape of things to come in the future, hopefully. The Magic of Window of the media For decades, the media has played a major role in the glorification of American civilization and culture on a global level. Indeed, the cinema, since its birth up to now, has relentlessly spared no effort to publicize, the American way of life. Whether right or wrong the images that it has projected “subliminally” of this country will, in some cases, remain with many people, who do not have the possibility to travel and discover the country by themselves, for life. This undertaking was later reinforced by television and other means of mass communication such as the Internet. The cinema and the magic of Hollywood Hollywood and the cinema are two things that go together in most people’s minds. Hollywood has glorified the cinema with its magic touch, and the cinema has glorified Hollywood and made out of it a whole world of beauty and fantasy, unequalled in modern times. Because of their quality: the professionalism of the actors, the high quality scripts, the excellent level of dramatization and the perfect use of artefacts and artifices, films spawned in Hollywood are slick and attractive, and, as a result, enchant the world beyond belief, to the extent that the viewer is brainwashed into believing that America is what they see on the screen, no less and no more. It is true that the cinema is just the cinema and the institutions should not be blamed for viewers’ interpretations, for that is a reflection of themselves and their values. After all, does not Shakespeare, while talking about theater, say, in Hamlet, that it is: “to hold, as’t were, the mirror up to nature…“ Maybe the cinema, because it is not the theater, in order to be convincing and entertaining, has to free itself from the restraints of everyday reality and raise fiction above everything. The Moroccan public, most of whom cannot travel to the United States for financial and administrative reasons, is left to discover that part of the world through the “magic window” the cinema and television. Because they are not able to check what they are offered against reality, they are somewhat “brainwashed” into believing that America is what they see on the screen, and as a result many misconceptions are formed, sometimes for life. The misconceptions of America that the magic of the cinema has spawned in the Moroccan viewers’ imagination can be summarized as follows: – ridiculous wealth – violent society – excessive sex and love – fast life and, with time and more exposure to the cinema, these misconceptions became established truths that prove to be difficult to scrap or shed altogether. A brief look at each of these will reveal the distortions that the cinema willingly or unwillingly is responsible for. Ridiculous wealth Many American films, no matter what their theme is, do, perhaps unwittingly, display particular aspects of the American way of life. For many cinema goers in Morocco, the plot of the film is something they enjoy during the show and probably forget about afterwards, but what remains in their mind, for obvious psychological reasons, are the scenes that exhibit incredible wealth in the shape of grandiose mansions with servants and limousines, beautiful cars, yachts or private airplanes, women wearing expensive jewelry and designer clothes, and well-dressed men, puffing at huge cigars and drinking expensive champagne, while talking big business with other men looking just as smart and as rich.  This, is of course reminiscent of the literary classic turned into a successful movie: “The Great Gatsby” and the American Dream. On the nature of the novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald in the 20s of the last century, James Topham writes what follows in ThoughtCo:  « The power of Gatsby as a character is inextricably linked to his wealth. From the very beginning of The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald sets up his eponymous hero as an enigma: the playboy millionaire with the shady past who can enjoy the frivolity and ephemera that he creates around him. However, the reality of the situation is that Gatsby is a man in love. Nothing more. He concentrated all of his life on winning Daisy back. It is the way that he attempts to do this, however, that is central to Fitzgerald’s world-view. Gatsby creates himself—both his mystique and his personality—around rotten values. They are the values of the American dream—that money, wealth, and popularity are all there is to achieve in this world. He gives everything he has—emotionally and physically—to win, and it is this unrestrained desire that contributes to his eventual downfall. » It is true that there is great wealth and affluence within the American society as Clive James reveals, quite rightly, in Flying Visits:  “But as always happens, no matter how often one visits America, the really overwhelming thing was the affluence… We should always remember that when Americans talk about being in a slump, they mean a slump by their standards. For the visitor the sheer wealth of the country must remain the abiding impression…” but certainly not as it is depicted in the movies. The educated viewer can use his good judgement and sound discernment to evaluate what he is exposed to. However,  those people who do not speak foreign languages and therefore are in no position to understand the plot and the dialogue rely very much on the images and the visual effects, and these can easily invade their imaginations and turn what is probably fiction into sacred established truths, not to say of course clichés. In the mind of the average Moroccan, the affluence displayed, quite often, in films has become axiomatic to the extent that a reference is made to it in a proverbial manner in Moroccan Arabic: Wash tesHablek ana mirikani? “do you think I am American? (meaning: do you think I am as rich as an American).” Violent society For years the American movie industry has cashed in, unscrupulously, on an innate instinct of love of violence among humans, and, as a result, produced thousands of films that surpass each other, only in their degree and various manifestations of crude violence.  The typical Moroccans, who can be squeamish about physical violence, believe that it is a second nature to Americans, for otherwise they would not glorify it in such a masterly way in their films and series. Following films made about the Prohibition, bootlegging, wars between different Mafia gangs, and about such infamous gangsters as Al Capone  and Lucky Luciano, many Moroccans believe strongly that cities like New York and Chicago must be extremely unsafe, with gunfights commonplace in the streets. It is true that there is crime in these two cities, as is the case in all big cities, but not to the extent presented in films like “The Godfather”  and many others. More and more educated Moroccans believe that the reason the American films are so popular and so entertaining is due to the fact that directors, script writers and actors know how to make use of violence professionally in the entertainment. They may not mean any harm, but unfortunately it is extremely difﬁcult to foretell the effect of such films on common viewers. Excessive sex and love Prior to the outbreak of AIDS and the death of the film star Rock Hudson, most American films contained several scenes of love-making, while often the leading actor was portrayed as an individual capable of seducing and going to bed with any woman he fancied.  Furthermore, some of these films seemed to put the emphasis more on crude sex than on romance, affection and intimacy; to extol promiscuity and, in many situations, base sexual intercourse. Furthermore, sex and love were not presented as respected human feelings and functions but rather as destructive weapons used by wealthy and power-hungry people to achieve their ignoble aims. In many of these films, women are all blonde, tall, beautiful, slim and rich. They are, also, tough and cunning, but they all have a flaw in their personality in the sense that they are emotionally prone to fall in love and have sexual intercourse with any men that come their way and attempt to seduce them as portrayed in the TV series “Sex and the City” (1998-2004) of 94 episodes and 2 films. “Sex and the City” has received both acclaim and criticism for its themes and characters. Nowadays the male lead characters in films are less promiscuous than in the past, but women still appear to be easy to seduce. For people who are not very familiar with American culture, the films in question make them believe that American women are morally loose and are, in general, more interested in carnal pleasures than in romantic love and affection.  Taking films as a sure reference to go by, some people can put themselves in delicate situations when in company of American women, by the things they say or the moves they make which can be interpreted as sexual harassment, of course. Fast life It is true that in America life is faster in tempo than in many other countries, but in the cinema it is even much faster than reality: people marry and divorce with alarming rapidity; people become wealthy or poor fast; politicians rise to power and fall into disgrace suddenly. In America, time is very important, but what is even more important is knowing how to use it to make money and become successful, which in principle is within the reach of everyone according to the tenets of the American Dream philosophy.  However, for many observers and analysts this dream has, today, withered with the arrival of Donald Trump to power and the rise of White Nationalism.  Therefore, to maximize its use, Americans developed fast cars, fast trains, fast airplanes,  and fast food (the film saga “Fast and Furious” is a good example,) and acted likewise with emotions, feelings, ways of thinking, expression and relationships.  However, the cinema unwillingly gives the impression that life in the United States does not take its natural course because everything runs against the clock in a rat-race fashion, and that is why, perhaps, some Americans suffer from dire mental problems that are unheard of in other parts of the world and resort to violence, as a therapy, to unburden their pent-up emotions. On this particular trait, Lawrence R. Samuel, writes in Psychology Yesterday:  “The assassination of Martin Luther King fifty years ago today had a direct, immediate effect on the perception of the American Way of Life.  Almost overnight, our national character was infused with a recognizably darker and more sinister tone; many began making the case that we were a uniquely violent people, a position that seemed increasingly difficult to contest. The idealistic dreams of the counterculture seemed to immediately fade after that murder, making the tragic event appear to represent a turning point in American history. “This is a crucial time, and a test of the American way of life in the eyes of the world,” said Deborah Wolfe, a professor at Queens College in New York, in May of that year, blaming hate and ignorance for the violent act.  The assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in June added to the sense that America was a deeply troubled nation whose citizens had an unusual propensity to kill each other.” Television: Selling American culture to the world Following in the steps of the cinema, American television has achieved much success in the realm of home entertainment. Because of new technological breakthroughs in direct satellite broadcasting, American television is becoming a dangerous weapon of incredible political and cultural importance.  During the Gulf War, CNN managed to enter millions of homes around the world and kept millions of people glued to their TV sets seeking more information. One wonders to what extent CNN was manipulated (journalists were embedded by the American army) by all sides to achieve their political or military aims.  Today with fiber optics, American TV unrivalled series created by NETFLIX or HBO (“ Game of Thrones”), are reaching all countries of the world and their “subliminal effect” is such that people eat American, drink American, dress American and want to act American.  In Morocco, all young people want to learn American English to watch films and series in the Internet, and French, the language of the colonial power, that was until recently a hype language is losing ground dangerously, as a result.  On the topic of the “subliminal effect” of American media, Nicky LaMarco writes in Chron:  « Subliminal perception will be experienced by a consumer when they perceive a marketing message without their conscious awareness. There has been a raging debate for many decades about whether it really is possible to influence the decisions of consumers through subliminal perceptions. While the controversy continues and no conclusions have been reached about how effective the method is, many marketers still put subliminal images and words in their advertisements while others don’t really prioritize them. » In many countries around the world, American programs, shows and telefilms are broadcast on prime time. What’s more, television stations across the world have adopted American TV techniques in presenting news, game shows, soap-operas, and debates. Cable TV, once exclusively American, has come now to homes all over the world. In Morocco, the long-awaited second public TV channel went private and became 2M, which commenced broadcasting in 1989, adopting in many ways an American outlook, for not only was it fee-paying, then, but it, also, presented the viewer with a slick package of programs in which American productions had the lion’s share.  The influence of American media on 2M was such that locally-produced programs were very much American in outlook. At the beginning, when the project was unveiled, few people believed that such an undertaking would achieve commercial success in this country; two years later, with 150,000 paying subscribers, this television channel was doing better than anybody imagined in could. American television productions are undoubtedly the most popular around the world for their entertainment quality. The productions in question shown on Moroccan television channels can be subjectively divided into two main categories by their impact on Moroccan viewers: “positive” shows and “negative” shows. “Positive” shows: In general, they are lighthearted sitcoms that provide entertainment for the whole family with no exception. These shows often deal with family situations and do glorify such an institution, as well as other positive social values and ethics. Two of these shows had quite a positive effect on the Moroccan viewer: “The Cosby show”  and “Who’s the Boss”    “The Cosby Show” is a sitcom about a black middle class family in America and its daily life, expectations, cultural background and difficulties. This show, one of the most popular produced by American television industry ever, is seen as “positive” TV program because it portrays the life of a racial minority group that suffered, for centuries, from the white man’s discrimination and persecution, and for once it is shown in positive light and not as most films do, where black people are pimps, drug dealers, criminals or crooks.  “The Cosby Show” is pure entertainment and not a political manifesto. As for “Who’s the Boss,” it is another lighthearted comedy pertaining to family matters and dealing with problems of single-parent families, bringing up children in a liberal environment and with the work ethic in American society and it was well-received by Moroccans. These two shows have the merit of presenting American society in its natural form with no distortion or exaggeration and making it look as any other human society prone to problems, difficulties and mishaps but also happy, healthy, simple and normal. “Negative” shows: These are the shows that distort reality and project a distorted image and help create misconceptions and stereotypes among the viewers. Among these we find: “Dallas”  and “Santa Barbara.”  “Dallas” left the impression, among Moroccan viewers, that all Americans are as rich and as prosperous as the leading family in the series, and that wealth in America is synonymous with jealousy, intrigue, adultery and murder. As a result, many people believe that to be successful in the American society one has to act like J.R., who is a living symbol of what the American Dream is all about, which, of course, is not the case. This, also, suggests wrongly that American high society can be above the law and get away with it.  The other show that gives a “negative” image of American culture is “Santa Barbara.” Very much like “Dallas,” it gives the wrong impression that American society thrives on illegal and immoral practices such as adultery, rape, sexual abuse, forgery, deceit and dishonesty. The impact of television on the viewer is much stronger than that of the cinema for the simple reason that nowadays, TV is an important part of our life: it is a full member of the family. A member who has the power to tell us things, in ways we rarely question.  In Morocco for example, television has succeeded in entering most homes and has managed to change the habits of the society. Prior to its advent, people used to sit around trays of tea and tell stories and exchange pleasantries. Today, the traditional tea ceremony has lost its charm and, as a consequence, of the age of television, the round tea trays have other shapes and eating tables are not circular anymore because people want to eat and watch TV. So, to accommodate this new member of the family, the traditional tables had to become rectangular so that “The Cosby Show,” “Who’s the Boss,” “Dallas,”” Santa Barbara,” and “Sex and the City,” can be seated on the opposite side comfortably for the viewing pleasure of everyone in the family. The impact of other media It must be borne in mind that the impact of other media: press, radio, internet, advertisements, are today as important as the cinema and television.  However, like the television, they sometimes can be very efficacious in imprinting a variety of impressions on the audience’s mind. Advertisements, as a matter of fact, are such a strong medium for they interact with peoples’ choices and needs. For instance, some commercials that extol the qualities of a given soft drink, a beauty product, or toiletry, often give the impression that American society is a society of healthy, good-looking, and rich people who enjoy the pleasures of life, one of them being the product advertised.  For the viewer, this means that people who are plain, physically disadvantaged, aged, poor have no place in such a society because it is a society where only good-looking and somewhat rich people live. THE IMPACT OF THE MEDIA ON SOCIETY The media, in general, has a tremendous impact on society because it is a very “convincing” form of communication against which the individual has no defense or protection. The American media, owing to its advanced technology and its vast experience, has no difficulty in “convincing” the people of the world of the veracity of its messages.  In Morocco, for instance, cinema and television have left with Moroccans a number of stereotypes about the American society, some of these have already been dealt with earlier, namely: wealth, violence, excessive sex and love, and fast life. The other stereotypes are: – selfishness: Americans are very self-centered and egoistical. They only care about others when their interest is at stake; – individualism: “This is my space, this is my towel, this my space or “bubble,” etc. you are not supposed to use it under any circumstances,” is a common attitude among American people. No sense of sharing or communal solidarity; – ego-centrism: Americans think that they set the standards and the world follows; – no sense of alternative etiquette: Americans have no respect for social etiquette and cultural traditions of societies other than theirs; – materialism: Americans think that they can buy with money anything they need or want. For them money seems to be everything;  – no respect for age: America seems to be a society that does not accept people who are not productive and active, so old age is considered as a serious liability; – stinginess: Americans are very miserly people. They have no sense of generosity; and – family values: America is becoming more and more a society of selfish individuals for whom the family is more like a biological reference. Divorces are as common as marriages. People marry more for the experience than for founding a family. But besides its ability to create stereotypes involuntarily, the media also strives to present American culture in a good light. Indeed, it glorifies, quite rightly, such principles as: – freedom; – democracy; – equal opportunity; – respect of human rights; – honor and respect; – free enterprise; – political, cultural, linguistic and religious pluralism; – privacy;  – alternative sexual identities (LGBTQ), etc. The media has spared no effort to glorify the American genius. In countless films and television shows, the creativity and the intelligence of the American man is celebrated to the extent that he is sometimes portrayed as an individual with incredible powers, someone like a demi-god.  This is illustrated by such popular films as: “Rambo,” “Captain America” or “Superman.” At the height of the Cold War, American soldiers, intelligence agents, scientists, etc. always triumphed over their Soviet counterparts who symbolized evil and dictatorship.  The media presents the American hero as someone intelligent, educated, polite, generous, magnanimous, handsome and strong. In a word, he is the super hero who knows no fear. He is always ready to defend his country and people with no hesitation whatsoever. For him, America is the ultimate symbol of freedom and democracy. James Petras, on the subject of the impact of the American media on the rest of the world, argues in Global Policy Forum that it is some sort of “cultural imperialism:”  “U.S cultural imperialism has two major goals, one economic and the other political: to capture markets for its cultural commodities and to establish hegemony by shaping popular consciousness. The export of entertainment is one of the most important sources of capital accumulation and global profits displacing manufacturing exports. In the political sphere, cultural imperialism plays a major role in dissociating people from their cultural roots and traditions of solidarity, replacing them with media created needs which change with every publicity campaign. The political effect in to alienate people from traditional class and community bonds, atomizing and separating individuals from each other.” And goes on to say forcefully: “The principle target of cultural imperialism is the political and economic exploitation of youth. Imperial entertainment and advertisement target young people who are most vulnerable to U.S. commercial propaganda. The message is simple and direct: ‘modernity’ in associated with consuming U.S. media products. Youth represent a major market for U.S. cultural export and they are most susceptible to the consumerist-individualist propaganda. The mass media manipulates adolescent rebelliousness by appropriating the language of the left and channeling discontent into consumer extravagances. Cultural imperialism focuses on youth not only as a market but also for political reasons: to undercut a political threat in which personal rebellion could become political revolt against economic as well as cultural forms of control.” However, one must point out that American social media Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc. have been instrumental, no doubt, in the advent of the Arab Spring in 2011 and the political emancipation of the Arab millennials , in particular, and the Arab citizen, in general. Today, the Arabs stand free from the shackles of fear from government retribution but, also, patriarchal tradition and sheer tribalism of dictatorships and youth are fighting openly for political, cultural, sexual and religious freedom in this part of the world. The latest manifestations of this are the uprisings of Sudan and Algeria for the establishment of democratic forms of government in these countries. For Stuart Jeanne Bramhall, “democracy is America’s biggest export.”  CONCLUSION The American media, a window to the culture and the civilization of this country, has for years acted as a successful means of intercultural communication with the rest of the world. This difficult task, however, is fraught with a multitude of dangers, including propaganda, distortion, and brainwashing. The image this media projects of American society abroad has, undoubtedly, has positive and negative repercussions. On the one hand, it disseminates unwillingly distorted information that helps create stereotypes and misconceptions, and on the other, it publicizes and glorifies such American ideals as freedom, democracy, justice, etc.  The American media has also been successful in spreading worldwide democracy and the rule of law as well as the respect of human rights, gender equality, religious freedom and cultural emancipation by projecting American democracy worldwide in a pedagogical manner. To cross cultures safely and positively, the American media has to be used with great caution to avoid the pitfalls of stereotyping, especially in the case of people who do not have access to other means of information or the possibility of cultural discernment.  The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Morocco World News’ editorial views. © Morocco World News.

Rabat – The judicial police in Beni Mellal, a city 305 kilometers from Rabat, have arrested a suspect for the rape of a 16-year old girl. The suspect, who already has a criminal record, raped the victim on the rooftop of the building where she lives with her mother. The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) announced the arrest of the suspect on Wednesday, August 28. The police arrested the suspect after the victim reported the incident, police said in a statement. The suspect threatened the victim with a knife before carrying out the sexual assault. The suspect will remain in police custody, while the investigation into the incident continues. Both the victim and her mother appear in several online videos, recounting the ordeal. “I was sleeping when [my mother] woke me up to go to bring bread for breakfast. When I was heading to the bakery, two people suddenly showed up with a motorcycle. I distanced me from them,” she said. The victim added that when she was going back to her house, one of the motorcycle riders stopped her. “I told him that I don’t know him. He kept following me and calling to come back.” Once she entered the building, the suspect grabbed her and took her to the rooftop.  “I begged him to let me go, I told him that he has sisters that you don’t want to see them harmed,” the victim said. She also told him “how long she has been protecting her honor [virginity] are you going to just ruin that for me?” In Morocco and other Muslim countries, virginity is associated with honor for women. The honor code remains a common concept transmitted from one generation to another in Morocco, especially in rural areas. The victim said that the suspect filmed her when he finished raping her when I was “covered with blood.” In tears, and with a shaky voice, the victim’s mother condemned the assault. “My  only daughter was raped (…) I am calling on authorities to intervene to arrest the rapist.” The incident followed a similar rape case of Hanane, a woman in Rabat, who was violently raped by a man with a significant criminal record. Hanane sadly died as a result of the injuries she sustained during the assault. Police arrested the main suspect in addition to eight other suspects involved in the crime. The suspects also filmed the rape, which sparked widespread outrage among Moroccan internet users.

Rabat – The Moroccan Cinema Center (MCC) has selected Maryam Touzani’s directorial feature debut, Adam, to represent Morocco at the prestigious Oscar Awards. The film has been entered into for preselection in the category of Best International Feature Film. Although Morocco has not had great success in the Oscars so far and a Moroccan movie has not passed the shortlist stage since 1977, Adam has received wide critical acclaim since it entered the festival circuit making supporters hopeful. The movie, which will make its debut in theatres in January 2020, spotlighted the controversial topic of unwed mothers in Morocco. The story was inspired by a pregnant woman who was going door-to-door asking for work in Touzani’s hometown of Tangier. “In a country like mine, it’s the biggest shame for a woman to have a child out of wedlock,” said Touzani. “She doesn’t want to disappoint her parents so she cannot tell the truth.” Touzani also explained her reasoning behind featuring taboo topics: “There is a facade that everything is all right on the outside even if people are tormented inside. It is good to let in some air and light, and people are relieved and happy things are being spoken about.” Whether Adam proceeds to the next stage or not, Touzani will be at the Oscars. Touzani recently joined the Oscar’s Academy, in the “Screenwriters” category. As part of the role, she will be responsible for selecting the nominees and winners in the category for the upcoming Academy Awards. She is joined by three other Moroccans already in the Academy, actor Saïd Taghmaoui, director Nabil Ayouch, and producer Khadija Alami.

Rabat – Every year in Imilchil, a small town in the Atlas Mountains, up to 40 couples convene to tie the knot as part of a long-running tradition known as the Imchil Marriage Festival. The festival is currently in full swing, running from August 23 to September 8. The festival is born from a Berber legend, the Amazigh equivalent of Romeo and Juliet. As with all folklore passed down verbally, the story is varied depending on who tells it – but the general legend is that two star crossed lovers from the Ait Hadiddou tribe in the region wanted to marry, but their family, sworn enemies, forbade them.  Torn between their families’ wishes and their love for each other, the grief was so much that the couple cried themselves to death, and filled the two rivers in the region, now known as Isli (his) and Tislit (hers), with their tears. The tragedy does not end there – the tribes also believe that the couple was unable to be united in the afterlife because the mountain between the two rivers separates them in death as well as life. As a result, they are doomed to yearn for each other eternally. According to the legend, the families, ridden by guilt, established a day on the anniversary of their deaths that young members of the tribes could marry each other, so as to prevent another tragedy befalling a young couple again.  From that, Imilchil Marriage Festival was born and still carries on to this day as a symbol of both love and tragedy.  The festival happens in Imilchil, which only has a population of about 2000, because Sidi Mohamed El Maghani, the patron saint of the Ait Haddidou, is buried there. It is believed that any marriage blessed by El Maghani will be long and prosperous. Although today no actual weddings occur during the festival, young men and women from the various tribes still meet and get engaged. They otherwise wouldn’t have the opportunity, living in a conservative society with strict social norms around courtship and marriage. The couples participate in an engagement ceremony and then marry at a later date of their choosing in a private gathering. Women who attend the festival looking for a potential life partner, chaperoned by their fathers, dress in traditional attire and don their finest jewelry and the men who are available dress in all white – making the festival quite a sight to behold. The sound of traditional music floods through the area and the atmosphere is joyous. The festival is also an occasion for the local tribes to sell their wares and to stock up before the harsh winter months in the mountains. A temporary souk is set up, with tents sprawling across the small village. For many years, the festival was a closed event between tribes, but as tourism in the area increased, the festival was opened to visitors – a great privilege to be handled with respect when visiting.  Imilchil is also a beautiful place to visit outside of the festival period, although it is not recommended during the harsh winters. The area is known for its great camping spots, such as the aforementioned Isli and Tislit rivers. The easiest way to get to Imilchil is via a bus from Marrakech to Beni Mellal, and then a taxi to Imilchil. The journey takes approximately 5 hours.

Rabat – Leading Moroccan banking group Attijariwafa Bank has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Japanese group Mizuho Bank, with the two entities vowing to use the platform to further the growing bilateral ties between their two countries. The agreement was signed yesterday, August 28, on the sidelines of the ongoing Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD). In a press statement after the signing of the convention, Attijariwafa expressed satisfaction at securing the trust of yet another international partner. The statement noted that the cooperation between the two banks will involve a wide range of banking and finance-related matters, from investing in development projects and capital markets to accompanying private enterprises, either established or start ups. “The signing of this memorandum is the culmination of our bank’s efforts with international partners to facilitate and improve our services to our clients abroad,” the statement said. It went to describe the memorandum as “an additional milestone” in both Attijariwafa and Mizuho’s plans for expanding their activities far beyond the borders of their respective countries. With Attijariwafa’s status as one of Morocco’s and Africa’s leading banking and financial groups and Mizuho’s reputation as one of Japan’s biggest banking groups, the two partners hope to use their joint platform as a springboard for spearheading more international success. “I am convinced that this partnership will create added value for us and our clients,” said Mohamed El Kettani, CEO of Attijariwafa. From Japan’s successive, reassuring statements on Western Sahara to the increasing number of Japanese groups in the Moroccan market, the MoU between the two banks comes amid promising prospects for the bilateral ties between Tokyo and Rabat. In an interview last Sunday with MAP, Morocco’s official news outlet, Katsuhiko Takahashi, the chief of the MENA division at the Japanese foreign affairs ministry spoke positively about Morocco’s growing importance for Japanese investors. He said that Morocco’s “geographic advantage” as a “gateway to Europe, Africa, and the Middle East” makes it a particularly sought after market for Japanese companies looking to invest at the international level.

Rabat – Amina Rachid, officially Jamila Ben Omar, was born on 11 April, 1936, in the city of Marrakech.  Growing up in the artistic environment of the imperial city, Rachid developed a certain love for the arts,  acting in particular. She discovered her talents as an actress while still a student in primary school. When Rachid reached high school, in the 1950s, she had already gained experience as an amateur actress in school plays. In the early 1960s, Moroccan national radio announced their need for new female recruits. Rachid took the offer and made her debut in the field of radio theater, along with her lifelong colleague Habiba El Madkouri, who passed away in 2011.

In 1971, Rachid took an acting training course abroad, before she came back to Morocco to become an employee at the National Company of Broadcasting and Television (SNRT), where she met her future husband and life partner Abdellah Chakroun. Chakroun was also an employee at SNRT when he got engaged to  Rachid, ten years his junior. He went on to become SNRT’s director, then general manager of the Arab Radio and Television Union, and finally an advisor at the Ministry of Culture. Rachid and her husband Abdellah Chakroun were one of the most famous couples in the Moroccan art industry. During their marriage, which lasted more than 50 years,  Rachid always asked her husband for advice when it came to job offers and other decisions. She also accompanied her husband on all his travels, either professional ones or those for medical reasons.  Chakroun  devoted most of his free time to writing. He wrote many books about theater and culture. He also wrote a biography about his wife, entitled “Amina Rachid: An Actress in Radio, Theater, Television and Cinema”. The artistic couple had two children during their long marriage. After Chakroun’s death in 2017, Amina Rachid’s health deteriorated until she finally slipped away on Monday, August 26. Over the course of her career in plays, movies, dramas and soap operas,Rachid performed in several emblematic movies that became classics of the Moroccan cinema. She starred in “Lalla Hobby” (My Love, 1996), “Fiha lmelh w skarr w mabghatch tmout” (She has diabetes and blood pressure and she does not want to die, 1999), and “Qoloub Mouhtariqa” (Burning Hearts, 2007) to name a few. Some of Rachid’s most famous dramas and soap-operas are “Lwassiya” (The Will, 1999), “Laouni” (2005), and “Hnia, Mbark w Massoud” (2006).

Rabat – GQ Middle East, one of the men’s fashion &amp; style magazines, has featured Moroccan rapper Issam on the front cover of its quarterly issue. The GQ cover is the latest addition to a series of wins this year for Issam, who signed a record deal with Universal Music in France in May. He told GQ the deal has given him a renewed sense of confidence because “they told me that I could do what I wanted musically. Even visually. The label believes in me. They give me the means to try new things,” he said. However, things haven’t always been easy for the 26-year-old rapper from Casablanca. just last year, Issam was denied a visa to visit the Arab World Institute in Paris, and the rejection left him frustrated. “I am 25 years old, I am single and Moroccan. That’s why they rejected my visa. I went through a very difficult period after that, I’ll be honest,” he told QG. “Music has no borders, but artists do.” Issam also used the GQ interview to highlight the role Arab people are currently playing in music internationally, saying he believes Arab people are the future of music rather than Americans. “American music does not innovate anymore. There is no more shock. Nothing new. It is time for the Arabs to dominate. I really believe it,” he said. “I want us to unite and help each other. We can show the world what we have. This is our moment. It’s our turn, he continued. “I want to have inspired the next generation. I want to open the door to the Arabs. To make it easier for them.” Issam added that despite having made his big break with the major record deal, he does not intend to stop grinding anytime soon, because wasting time is one of his biggest fears. “I do not want to waste time. If I do not come home tonight and do not make music that can reach millions, I lost my time. That’s what scares me,” he admitted. Issam, known for blending trap music with elements from traditional Arabic music, first came into the spotlight in 2018 with his “Trap Beldi.” The song was a hit, and also one of the first Moroccan trap songs to reach over 10 million views on YouTube. He is expected to release his first album under Universal Music in January 2020.

Rabat – Sale’s Appeals Court has postponed the appeal process of the 24 suspects involved in the killing of two Scandinavian tourists in the Atlas Mountains. The process due to begin today, August 28 will now take place on September 11. Danish Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, and Norwegian victim Maren Ueland, 28,were beheaded in December 2018  when they were bivouacking at mount Toubkal in the Imlil region, 80 kilometers from Marrakech. On July 18, the same court sentenced the three main perpetrators of the heinous crime to the death penalty. Abdessamad El Joud, a 25-year-old street vendor confessed having to beheaded one of the victims with Younes Ouziad, a 27-year-old carpenter who killed the other girl, while Rachid Afatii, 33, was filming the scene. A fourth individual, Abderrahim Khayali, who was filmed with the three main suspects pledging allegiance ISIS was sentenced to life imprisonment. The video was recorded three weeks before the crime. While the defense lawyers are asking for light sentences for the perpetrators, civil party lawyers are asking for confirmation of the preliminary verdicts. Hafida Mkasaoui, one of the defense lawyers, told Morocco World News on August 28 that the families of the victims appealed the court’s decision on compensation. The court ruled on July 18 that  the claim for compensation from the state for the families of the victims is inadmissible. The court, however, asked for the four main defendants to pay MAD 2 million to the families jointly. Maksaoui said that the appeal request will revive the case..  “As a defense team we also requested an appeal,” Maksaoui said. The defense team are asking for lighter sentences for the suspects. Asked whether they think the court will accept their request, Maksaoui said that it is a “possibility.”

Rabat – Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, is leading an important Moroccan delegation at this year’s Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) meeting in Yokohama, as the North African country looks to advance the already robust relationship with Japan. Japan and Morocco seem to have put last year’s row over the participation of “high-ranking” Polisario delegation at a Japanese government-organized meeting in Tokyo behind them. This year, Morocco is effectively represented among the over 4000 participants at the TICAD meeting. The Bourita-led delegation comprises, among others, Mohcine Jazouli, Delegate Minister for African Cooperation; Abdelkader El Ansari, the chief of the Asian and Oceania division at the foreign affairs ministry; Mohamed Methqal, the chair of the Moroccan Agency of International Cooperation (AMCI), and the Moroccan Ambassador to Japan, Rachad Bouhlal. Japan wants to assert global presence This year’s TICAD theme focuses on the human aspects of the relationship between Japan and its African partners. The theme is tailored to Japan’s usual message to its African partners. It conveys the idea that Tokyo’s interest in the continent is not only in investing in traditional, economic sectors, but also—and importantly—in equipping the continent’s leaders and future decision makers with the adequate tools to confront the challenges to come. Initiated in 1993 as a development and expertise sharing platform between Japan and the African continent, TICAD has become an essential part of Japan’s bid to assert itself in global affairs, mainly through countering the expanding presence of another Asian giant, China, on the continent. This year’s event comes in the wake of Beijing’s vow to inject a whopping $60 billion in Africa. While Tokyo’s African presence is not as imposing as Beijing’s or Washington’s, its human resources- directed development cooperation with the continent has lent credence to its impact on the continent over the years. Among African decision makers, the overriding behind-doors rhetoric is more welcoming of Tokyo than of most development partners. The governing idea is that Japan is “less intrusive” than Western partners and—increasingly— China. Faced with China’s enormous financial clout, Japan is projecting itself as quality rather than a quantity partner for Africa, the Japan Times reported yesterday on the eve of the conference. Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinto has said that, through TICAD, Japan seeks to “launch impactful actions on the continent.” Education, science, technology, and renewable energy are the main domains of Japan’s African presence. The conference opened today, August 28, and is expected to close on August 30. For all the focus on Japan-Africa development partnership, as the three-day event features debates on a wide range of expertise sharing issues between Japan and the continent, Morocco, one of Japan’s strongest African partners, is bound to focus on the Asian country’s relationship with Polisario, the self-determination-seeking separatist group in Western Sahara. There have been perceptible efforts from numerous Japanese officials in the months since last year’s diplomatic row to distance the country from the Polisario Front. The latest in date came on Sunday, August 25, when the chief of the MENA division of the Japanese foreign affairs ministry reaffirmed his country’s “constant and immutable” stance on the territorial conflict as one of not recognizing Western Sahara as a distinct state. But it was later revealed that Polisario would be in attendance of this year’s TICAD. In a subsequent, explanatory statement, the Japanese Foreign Affairs Minister, Taro Kono, said that Polisario’s presence does not alter Japan’s position. “Even if a group which claims itself as a state which Japan does not recognize was sitting in this room, this fact does not mean that Japan, in any way, implicitly or explicitly recognizes it as a state,” Kono said. This was by all accounts a move meant to appease and reassure Morocco. But Morocco, either faithful to its recently adopted—and widely reported—“proactive diplomacy,” or just receptive of Japan’s explanations, has so far remained uncharacteristically silent on Polisario’s presence at the event. Morocco has traditionally protested against Polisario’s attendance at events like TICAD, typically interpreting a formal invitation to the militant group as a tacit stamp of approval on its statehood claims. But in light of the now prevailing “proactive diplomacy” among Moroccan diplomats, some experts and observers are bound to argue, Rabat may have come to realize that insistently boycotting Polisario lends to the separatist group more credibility and visibility. Another explanation may be that the recent, worldwide wave of support for its Autonomy Plan might have comforted Morocco in its Western Sahara stance, making the typical, expected media feud with Polisario less and less salient or necessary. The new Moroccan diplomatic effort, the argument goes, is increasingly shifting the focus towards convincing the international community of the “seriousness,” “pragmatism,” and “credibility” of the Moroccan autonomy proposal, instead of constantly whining about any ceremonial Polisario presence at policy events. But whether any of all these reasoning reflects the thinking of the drivers of the Moroccan diplomacy will depend on whether Morocco goes through the entire TICAD meeting without reproaching Tokyo for inviting Polisario, or whether the Morocco-Japan relations will undergo no cold moment after this conference.

Rabat – Habib El Malki, President of the Moroccan House of Representatives, met on August 26 and 27 with several of his counterparts from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Bangkok. El Malki participated in AIPA’s 40th General Assembly as a guest of honor. During talks on the sidelines of the Assembly, El Malki expressed the will of the Kingdom to strengthen its cooperation with this important region of the world. He also discussed the means to develop cooperation and partnerships with the member countries through parliamentary diplomacy. At the Assembly’s opening on August 26, he formally called for granting Morocco an observer status within AIPA. Morocco is the only Arab and African country to participate in the Assembly. Accompanied by Morocco’s ambassador to Bangkok, Abdelilah El Housni, El Malki also expressed his gratitude for Vietnam’s support of Morocco’s request to obtain observer status within the AIPA. Speaking at the plenary opening session, El Malki stressed the importance of sharing experiences between legislative and state institutions.  “Over the past two decades, we have witnessed an unprecedented momentum of international parliamentary cooperation at the regional, continental and global levels,” he said. El Malki noted that this cooperation aims “for a world of peace, understanding, tolerance, and prosperity that we all wish to transmit to future generations.”  He also emphasized how Morocco effectively participates in several regional interparliamentary bodies. He recalled Morocco’s membership in the African Parliamentary Union, the Pan-African Parliament, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean Union, the Arab Parliamentary Union, and the Parliamentary Assembly of French-Speaking Countries. “We also enjoy the status of ‘Mediterranean partner’ in the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, the status of ‘partner for democracy’ in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, in addition to the observer status in most sub-regional parliamentary assemblies in Latin America,” said Habib El Malki.  He then highlighted how “within this important parliamentary network, only Asia is missing.”  El Malki affirmed that joining the AIPA will offer the possibility of organizing joint parliamentary events focusing on major current issues such as climate change, international security, or human rights. The ASEAN Interparliamentary Assembly was established in 1977. It has ten permanent member countries and 12 observer countries. The participation of the Moroccan Parliament in the AIPA General Assembly, as an observer, offers a unique opportunity to institutionalize and conduct a dialogue with ASEAN member countries and other observer countries. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, is currently the 5th largest economy in the World.  It was established on August 8, 1967 in Bangkok, Thailand. It includes Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Rabat – US News released a list of 80 worst and best places to be a woman. The Best Countries for  Women ranking listed Morocco as the 63, up seven places from the 2018 ranking when Morocco was listed at 69. Despite the notable change in the ranking,  this year’s list shows Morocco nearly at the bottom,behind Mexico (50),  India (57), Saudi Arabia (41), and UAE (30). Tunisia is the 77th on the list. The last on the list is Myanmar, where the Rohingya conflict is ongoing in northern Rakhine State. US News said that the Best Countries for Women“is  a perception-based ranking based on the responses of nearly 9,000 women who filled of surveys for the 2019 Best Countries rankings.” The ranking takes into account several  aspects, including care about human rights, gender equality, income  equality, progress, and safety. Morocco’s government has been active in addressing gender issues in recent years, including sexual harassment in the street. In 2018 the government adopted Law 103-13 on gender-based discrimination. The criminalizes public harassement and all forms of violence including sexual assault. Female activists, however, found loopholes in the law, questioning its efficiency after the increase of rape andsexual assaults, and the publicization of the incidents. Activists have been also condemning light sentences given to defendants charged with violence against women, rape, or sexual harassment. A government-sponsored survey in July showed that 12.4% of Moroccan women faced sexual assaults in public spaces in the past twelve months.  The government has also vowed to improve human rights and gender equality, including laws on inheritance. Morocco’s efforts were recently acknowledged as advisor to  President Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump, extolled Morocco’s strategy in ensuring equality between Moroccan women and men in terms of inheritance law. On August 19, Ivanka congratulated the“Moroccan government for this important step towards the adoption of inheritance law amendments, and look forward to supporting their full implementation.” The statement came after Morocco adopted  three bills related to communal agricultural land (sulaliyat), which take into account the aspirations of rights holders, including women also known as sulaliayt.

Rabat – Minister of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education, and Scientific Research, Said Amzazi, called on Monday, August 26, in Rabat for a collective mobilization to implement the framework law 51.17 at the start of the academic year 2019-2020. He urged all executives in the domain of education to multiply their efforts in order to develop the educational system. The framework law 51.17 caused a lot of controversy, especially after the House of Representatives adopted it on July 22, 2019. Most of the articles contained in this framework law are not out of the ordinary, and aim to fix some of the inconsistencies that the educational system suffers from. However, article 31 of this framework law, calls for the teaching of scientific and technical subjects in middle and high schools in foreign languages. This specific article caused a lot of controversy within the Moroccan society. Said Amzazi defends this controversial legal framework with three main arguments. First, he explains that the use of foreign languages will help Moroccans embrace globalization, by addressing the negative impact that three decades of Arabization have had on Morocco’s competitiveness on the international level. “Ours is an era of globalization. So we have to either catch the train, or we don’t, and then we exclude ourselves from the global dynamics”, Amzazi said. The majority of job offers on the Moroccan labor market require fluency in foreign languages, because most well-paid and status-enhancing jobs are offered by French multinational companies operating in Morocco. Second, Amzazi explains that teaching in foreign languages, French in particular, is required for social justice. According to the minister, Arabization created two Moroccos separated by a socio-economic status, often associated with fluency in French. The changes presented by the framework law 51.17 will insure that Moroccan students are able to communicate in French. Finally, the minister defends the legal framework by explaining that one of the reasons why university dropout rates are high is linguistic insecurity. While students are taught during their whole pre-university courses in Arabic, they face an important challenge at university, where all scientific and technical subjects are taught in French. Introducing some of the subjects in French at middle and high schools, as suggested by framework law 51.17, could prevent the challenging situation that new university students face. The framework law 51.17 has faced and still faces strong opposition in Morocco’s political scene. Political parties PJD and Al Istiqlal have expressed, more than once, their anger towards this legal framework in the parliament. In March, Abdelilah Benkirane, PJD member and former Head of Government, uploaded a 26-minute long video on his Facebook page, where he condemns this controversial law and explains how it is against the Moroccan constitution that recognizes Arabic as an official language of the Kingdom. In the video Benikrane also forecasts a failure in the education system, as the language, French, might be a burden for some students. Benkirane also expressed his preference for English, as a teaching language: “If education in a foreign language is necessary one day, there is a better language for it than French”, implying English is a more appropriate alternative. On July 22, two days before the House of Representatives approved of framework law 51.17, Chairman of the PJD at the House of Representatives Idriss Al Azami Idrissi submitted his resignation letter. Local media speculated that this move was due to his opposition to the adoption of the new framework law for education. As for Moroccan streets, they are divided into those in favor of Arabic as an instruction language, and others who support the implementation of teaching in French. A third group calls for the use of a more international language, such as English. Many experienced teachers might find it difficult to adapt to teaching scientific and technical subjects in a foreign language, as sciences have been taught in Arabic for more than three decades, and, so far, there has been no official training to insure that teachers meet the new standards. Moroccan schools and teachers will have to speed up their preparations in order to adapt to the new framework law, before the official start of the academic year, on Thursday, September 5.

Rabat – After receiving a pile of written protestations against an “undemocratic” and “unilateral” government-sponsored draft bill on the right to strike, the Moroccan government, through its ministry of employment and vocational training, has backtracked and announced that the bill would go through some amendments before adoption by parliament. According to Moroccan outlet Al Akhbar, the series of “international criticism” the bill received in recent weeks “have given new ideas to the government,” especially to the Minister of Employment and Vocational Training Mohamed Yatim. Himself a former trade union representative, Yatim has allegedly replied to some of the disapproving messages his department recently received. The minister has reportedly promised to do his best to include some of the missing elements that critics have pointed out in the different protest letters and emails. The draft bill had already been introduced to the parliament and was awaiting the stamp of approval from the two parliamentary chambers. The document was widely expected to successfully pass parliamentary scrutiny, as most of the bills introduced by the government tend to be adopted. However, in his response to international trade unions, Minister Yatim reassured that the draft has not yet been formally discussed at the parliament, meaning that it can still be amended before it is reintroduced for parliamentary voting. Among the criticism facing the draft bill is the lack of inclusive dialogue with all the stakeholders on labor-related legislation.
The criticism is rooted in the Social Dialogue Agreement. Signed in April of this year, the agreement states that any labor-related legislation should be the object of thorough consultation between the government, labor and trade unions, and the General Confederation of Enterprises of Morocco (CGEM). Labor union representatives have mainly criticized the government for “contravening the spirit of the 2011 Constitution” which guarantees workers’ right to strike or express dissent in the forms of “freedoms of assembly, peaceful demonstration, association, and union and political affiliation.” The draft law prohibits strike in some sectors. At the same time, even in instances where it authorizes striking, it discourages workers from actually expressing dissent by “imposing fines and penalties,” according to Moroccan trade unions. Meanwhile, Article 14 of the draft stipulates that, when striking, workers “cannot be paid for the duration of the strike.” The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), one of the many international labor unions to have stood in solidarity with their Moroccan counterparts, recently lamented the “unilateral” nature of the draft law, describing it as “a violation of the most fundamental and constitutional rights.” But not all government departments are happy with the Minister of Employment and Vocational Training’s decision to heed the criticism and make changes accordingly. Al Akhbar noted in its report that a number of “discordant voices” within the government have lashed out at the minister’s move. They reportedly argued that, for a draft bill that boasted unanimous support from the government, backtracking because of criticism from international labor unions sends an encouraging message to others who may resort to the same method in the future when trying “to police” the behavior or stance of the Moroccan government on some issues.

Rabat – PixelHelper, the German NGO, posted on its official Facebook page, on August 27, a number of photos and live videos of the demolition of its Holocaust memorial. The authorities of El Haouz region (Ait Faska, Marrakech) carried out the demolition process starting yesterday, August 27. The demolition came in response to the NGO beginning construction work without the required authorization. The NGO, created by the owner of the memorial project Oliver Bienkowski, expressed its disappointment and disagreement with the demolition. PixelHelper also demanded compensation from the Moroccan State for the “substantial” material losses caused by the operation.  “If you consider that we have worked here over 365 days with 10 employees we have incurred damages of about €100,000,” said the NGO. PixelHelper “protests against the disproportionate destruction of the memorial dedicated to the murdered Jews in Europe and standing against the persecution of minorities such as the Sinti and Romani (Eastern Europe), Muslim Uigurs (China), and Gays,” says the NGO’s Facebook post. PixelHelper also denounced how Moroccan authorities destroyed “all works of art, including the rainbow at the entrance.”  “Expensive equipment such as a 15-meter camera pole was destroyed by bulldozers, water and power lines were cut, and the European canned bread emergency aid destroyed,” added the NGO. The NGO had a small bakery within its facilities and used to bake bread and distribute it as humanitarian aid for crisis zones in Africa. PixelHelper also reaffirmed that the “Moroccan authorities and embassies were always informed about our plans.” “Unfortunately, from the start, all cooperation was denied by the authorities and in the first year, all appointments were rejected by the Kaid.” In a more recent post, PixelHelper exclaimed that “art is not a crime!” The organization hopes that King Mohammed VI will intervene to stop the demolition process before the memorial’s tower goes down. “We appreciate the endless kindness of His Majesty King Mohammed VI and hope that the demolition of the Holocaust Memorial Tower in Marrakech, expected to be demolished by August 29, will be prevented.”  PixelHelper further expressed its appreciation of Moroccan society saying, “we have been active in Morocco since 2014; we love the warmth of people and the endless possibilities of ideas and projects.”

Rabat – The Ministry of Agriculture has finally broken its silence over the “bird massacre” caused by hunting tourists near Marrakech earlier this month. Earlier in August, photos and videos of men from the Gulf posing with more than a 1,000 hunted quails, went viral on social media. The videos and photos prompted outrage among internet users, who called for immediate intervention from the Ministry of Agriculture. The ministry issued a statement quoted by Moroccan television channel 2M, in which it denounced the act and said that everyone involved in the incident must be held accountable. The statement said that the region where the hunt took place  was a lot leased to a hunting tourist company. The company is therefore responsible for the hunt. An iInvestigation into the incident also shows irregularities related to the non compliance with the lease contract. The contract provision stipulates that the company is required to control the hunting activity and “take full responsibility for the acts committed by its clients.” The statement added that it has checked the validity of the photos and videos posted online. The images show a group of men posing with more than 1,000 dead quails, thrown on the ground as a result of the hunt. The statement said that  the ministry suspended the tourist hunting license of the organizing company, “which will be prosecuted.” The ministry finds that the investigation reported that the hunting party had killed three times the regulated quota of birds allocated for hunting. Investigations also reveal that local forestry staff intercepted another illegal hunty party from the same company. “The operation ended in the seizure of 36 weapons ” used for the hunt.

Rabat – Morocco’s Secretary for Sustainable Development, Nezha el Ouafi, met with Ousman Jarju, director of the Green Climate Fund’s (GCF) Country Programming Division, in order to discuss Morocco’s future projects and engagements with the GCF. The meeting took place within the GCF’s global programming conference in Songdo, South Korea.  At the meeting, El Ouafi reiterated the country’s commitment to its National Sustainable Development Strategy. She also drew attention to Morocco’s goal to increase its reliance on renewable energy from its current level of 35% of all energy consumption, to an expected 52% in 2030. She discussed the plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2, by 42% within the next decade. Funding for this plan comes, in addition to Morocco’s own contributions, in part from the GCF.  Morocco, with its predominantly dry climate, is particularly at risk due to global climate change. The country has been experiencing increased droughts and desertification in recent years. Current forecasts showcase that this situation will likely worsen due to rising global temperatures. According to the Ministry of Energy, the average Moroccan had 2 560m3 of water available in 1960, contrasted with 730m3 today and the forecast estimate of 500m3 by 2030.  Morocco’s electricity consumption per capita has doubled from 1999 to 2015, reaching 901.13 kWh, with 61% of its production currently depending on imported fossil fuels. To remedy this situation, Morocco has been investing in solar, wind and hydraulic production facilities. In addition to running public awareness campaigns encouraging the use of private solar panels.  The Green Climate Fund, established through the United Nations’ Framework Convention on Climate Change, works to assist beneficiary developing states in countering the effects of climate change. Currently, the GCF works in partnership with the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Sustainable Development, CDG capital, and the Agency for Agricultural Development on over six different projects. These projects are designed to help Morocco both mitigate the causes of environmental degradation and to adapt to future climate conditions. The GCF is partially funding the Saiss Water Conservation Project, the Development of Argan Orchards in Degraded Environments, in addition to Irrigation Development and Flood Management.

Rabat – Moroccan rapper French Montana used his stage time as a presenter at the Video Music Awards (VMAs) in New York to raise awareness about the plight of immigrants in the US. While presenting the award for Best Latin video alongside American actress Alison Brie, he said he was “proud” to present the award “because as an immigrant, I feel like we are the people that make this country, and I feel like I want to be the voice.” French Montana, whose real name is Karim Kharbouch, emigrated to the US from Rabat at age 13 and has since become one of the biggest names in hip-hop. “These nominees — and most of them are immigrants, too — are on top of the biggest movement in music,” he added. Brie chimed in in agreement, saying: “What’s happening to immigrants in this country is unconstitutional and frankly disgusting!” Brie was most likely referring to Trump’s harsh immigration policies since he came to office in 2016. After making his statement French Montana announced the winners: Rosalia &amp; J Balvin with their video for “Con Altura.” Both of the stars performed in Rabat in July at Morocco’s Mawazine festival.

Rabat – In the first semester of 2019, Morocco’s electricity production increased by 25.1%, up by 19.1% compared to the same period last year.  The data is provided by the Direction of Studies and Financial Forecasts (DEPF), part of the Ministry of Interior. According to DEPF, the good performance is mainly due to an increase of 49.1% in private electricity production at the end of the first quarter of 2019, after it registered a 3% increase a year earlier. It is also due to the production of electricity projects implemented under Law 13-09. which progressed by 64.3%. The law, enacted on February 11, 2010, considers the development of national sources of renewable energies as a priority of the national energetic policy. In the second quarter of 2019, electricity production registered a growth of 22.5%, having registered 27.9% in the first quarter of the same year. Net Energy Gain (NEG) registered a growth of 5.3% in the first semester of 2019 after it was only 0.1% a year earlier while electricity imports fell by 92% in the first semester of 2019. The consumption of electricity slightly increased by 2.4% in the second quarter of 2019, driven particularly by the good performance of energy sales of medium voltage, up by11%, distributors up by 4.2%, and low voltage energy, up by 6.4%. The DEPF points out that, sales of electric power, in the first semester of 2019, increased by 0.8%, after a decline of 1% a year earlier. Morocco aims to generate 42% of its electricity from renewable energies by 2020. To achieve its high aspirations, Morocco has heavily invested in solar energy through the world’s 2nd largest solar plant, the Noor Ouarzazate project and Noor Midelt I which is yet to be constructed. The Noor-Ouarzazate complex was built on an area of more than 3,000 hectares with an investment of $400 million loans from the World Bank and an additional $216 million from the Clean Technology Fund.

Rabat – The Spanish Police arrested five people and investigated one more for their alleged belonging to a criminal group operating in the forgery of residency permits. The group simulates “relations between irregular immigrants and Spanish citizens,” in order to provide them with the permits. Epandalusia.es reported that the group included three women and three men of Moroccan and Spanish nationalities, aged between 32 and 48 years old. Spanish National Police’s Central Squad of Illegal Immigration Networks and False Documents (UCRIF: Unidad Central de Redes de Inmigración Ilegal y Falsedades Documentales) began investigating the group after two Moroccan immigrants voluntarily turned themselves in at the Provincial Foreigners and Borders Brigade.  The two Moroccans complained that “a fellow Moroccan requested €6,000 from each in order to provide them with the necessary documentation to regularize their situation in Spain.” According to Epandalusia.es, the suspects attempted to falsify documents to register immigrants as a common-law couple. The group would then try to include the “couple”  in the register of inhabitants of a town near Granada.  The final objective was to obtain a residency card as a relative of a citizen of the European Union, which means legal residency in Spain and freedom of movement within most EU countries. The investigation concluded that the main suspect, a 45-year-old Moroccan and legal resident, was in charge of recruiting clients interested in regularizing their stay in Spain. He would go to meeting places of the Moroccan community around the capital, offering his services and claiming to have “contacts” in official Spanish institutions. In return, the suspect demanded large amounts of money.

Rabat – The selection panel for the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize has released its 2019 shortlist. Prominent Hirak Rif leader Nasser Zefzafi has not managed to make his way onto the list. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) announced on August 24 that the selection panel had released the shortlist for the 2019 Prize. The list of nominees includes Ilham Tohti of China, Buzurgmehr Yorov of Tajikistan, and the Youth Initiative for Human Rights. The winner will receive a prize of  €60,000. The council will announce the winner to the public at the opening of PACE’s autumn plenary session in Strasbourg on September 30. In April,  Belgian member of the European Parliament Kathleen Van Brempt  proposed the Hirak Rif detainee as a candidate for the prize, which  rewards “outstanding civil society action in the defence of human rights in Europe and beyond.” “We nominate Nasser Zafzafi for the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize,” Brempt said on Facebook. Zefzafi is one of the four Hirak activists who were sentenced to 20-year imprisonment in June 2018 for participating in unauthorized protests in the Al Hoceima province. PACE  awards the prize annually in partnership with the Vaclav Havel Library and the Charter 77 Foundation. The prize rewards human rights activists in memory of writer Vaclav Havel, who served as President of Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic.  In 2018, Zefzafi was also a finalist for the Sakharov “Freedom of Thought Prize.”  Members of the European Parliament in the foreign affairs and development committees voted for the three finalists of the Sakharov Prize. The voting committee chose Nasser Zefzafi, along with Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian filmmaker, and NGOs working to save migrants in the Mediterranean sea. Sentsov won the prize.

Rabat – Ronald Koeman, the head coach of the Oranje, the Dutch national football team, has just made plain his desire to do everything in his power to thwart Morocco’s quest to convince Mohammed Ihattaren to play for the Atlas Lions. Ihattaran, the 17-year-old PSV Eindhoven attacking midfielder whose stellar performances for club have sparked a strong interest from Morocco, his country of origin, and the Netherlands, his birth country, is currently at the center of a tense-looking feud between the two national teams. Both countries have recently called up the teenage player for upcoming matches. Morocco’s newly appointed head coach, Vahid Halilhodzic, has picked the PSV Eindhoven player for his list of pre-selected players for the Atlas Lions’ upcoming friendly games in September. For its part, the Netherlands called up the youngster for a spot in its youth squad for the Euro U21 qualifier game against Cyprus on September 10. Amid heightened debates about which side the young prodigy will pick, Koeman is seems confident that the youngster won’t be picking Morocco over the Netherlands. “Ihattaran cannot play for Morocco in September,” he said in an interview. More than a declaration of intent, the Dutch coach’s firm comments, which he made in a recent interview with Dutch outlet Studio Voetbal, came with the suggestion, as MWN previously reported, that the Dutch are in no mood to let go off Ihattaren. Koeman said just as much in the interview, promising that the paperwork will be made tough for Ihattaren should he decide to pick Morocco over the Netherlands. “In case Ihattaren chooses to play for Morocco, he will have to follow some procedures, including filling in a formal request declaring his intention to join Morocco.” The process Koeman describes has nothing to do with the FIFA regulations dictating a player of dual citizenship’s decision to pick between the two countries he is eligible to represent. The process of filling in a formal request is often the last resolve for a player at club level when his ambitions or well being do not dovetail with that of the club he happens to find himself at. This was the case with Brazil’s Philip Coutinho when he decided to leave Liverpool for Barcelona. It is also currently the case for Neymar, who has formally requested to leave France’s PSG for another European giant. But when it comes to choosing the country a player wishes to represent, the player has no obligation to notify the country he is ditching. As long as he has not played for a given country in an official FIFA game, a player is free to choose any national team he wishes to join. In his interview, Koeman, fully aware of the FIFA regulations, seemed to be exerting pressure on Ihattaren to make his final choice “sooner rather than later.” That comment is a direct, deliberate challenge to Ihattaren’s current position. When asked about Morocco’s interest in him in an interview last week, the teenage player suggested he needed time to think before making his decision. “I am much honored to have been preselected [by the Moroccan coach]. It is a beautiful feeling. But I will not make my decision now,” he said. Between a young and promising Dutch squad setting out to emulate, even revive the country’s past, glorious days and the reportedly well-known tendency among Moroccan parents in the Diaspora to convince their children to choose the fatherland, Ihattaren’s will be a tough choice to make. Meanwhile, for all his strong-willed declarations about making it hard for Ihattaren to choose the Lions over Oranje, Koeman seems to understand that, at the end, and regardless of his pressure, the final call will fully be the player’s—and his parents’. “In any case, the decision is entirely up to him and his parents. But he will have to make up his mind sooner rather than later,” said the Dutch coach.

The concept refers to an implicit contract between members of society whereby, for example, citizens exchange one thing, such as freedom, for another, given by the State, such as security and safety.  The concept represented an essential theoretical basis for understanding the origins of political governance. Some date the concept back to the writings of Plato, Aristotle, Al-Mawardi, Thomas Moore, Ibn Khaldoun, and others. The idea of a contract determining the nature of the relationship between the rulers and the ruled has preoccupied human thought since ancient times.  According to the Encyclopedia Britannica (“Social Contract”, Encyclopedia Britannica), what distinguishes Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau’s thought from others is “their attempt to justify and delimit political authority on the grounds of individual self-interest and rational consent.” This means that they tried to normalize “why and under what conditions government is useful and ought, therefore, to be accepted by all reasonable people as a voluntary obligation.”  But the three philosophers differ according to whether their goal is to justify the system of governance or to protect individuals (ibid.). Hobbes says that the primitive nature was cruel and chaotic, a state of permanent warfare; therefore, individuals agreed to appoint a tyrannical ruler who would take away their freedom but protect them from chaos and war (Leviathan or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil, 1651). Locke (in Two Treatises on Civil Government, 1690) argues that the nature of things requires the preservation of natural rights against insecurity.  That is why abiding by civil rule is part of a social contract, and is conditional upon “the protection not only of the person but also of private property”. “Sovereigns who violated these terms could be justifiably overthrown” (Encyclopedia Britannica).  So, while Hobbes builds his theory on the need to overcome primitive chaos by trading freedom for security and stability, Locke considers that human rights are natural and inherent and must be preserved by choosing a ruler who provides security and justice in exchange for people’s obedience.  In Du contrat social ou Principes du droit politique (1762), Rousseau, on the other hand, says that “humans were unwarlike and somewhat undeveloped in their reasoning powers and sense of morality and responsibility.” (Encyclopedia Britannica). “When, however, people agreed for mutual protection to surrender individual freedom of action and establish laws and government, they then acquired a sense of moral and civic obligation.” (ibid.).  What is important for Rousseau is the moral aspect, that is, the basis of governance is morality, the desire of the ruled to comply with the ruler’s decision because s/he sees it as a preservation of security and tranquility. The contract is moral first and then civil, but the basis is the shift from nature and instinct to rules and morality.  Marx and Engels found in the theory of social contract, especially of Locke and Rousseau, a source of Utopian thought which advocates a direct democracy not based on individual interest.  At the same time, they perceived it as a desperate bourgeois attempt to reconcile the interests of those in power on the one hand and the people on the other, (James Sterba, “The Marxist Dilemma / Paradox of Social Contract Theory”, American Philosophical Quarterly Journal, 1982.) From the point of view of Marxist thought, it is not considered a contract if the proletariat assumed its historical role, controlled the means of production and eliminated the capitalist mode of production.  As if Marx and Engels were using Rousseau and Locke only to demonstrate the necessity to return to the primitive phase, the pre-social contract phase, as a practice of a natural pattern of production. The difference between Rousseau and Marx is radical: the first sees the transition to the contract an accentuation of the sense of morality; the second (with Engels) sees the return to primitive utopianism as the highest peak of morality (Friedrich Engels, “Der Ursprung der Familie, des Privateigenthums und des Staats” 1884.)  John Rawls was the most influential philosopher of the 20th century to have used the concept of a “social contract” in order to set up the foundations for a “just society.” In his book, Theory of Justice (1971), Rawls criticizes utilitarianism, which posits that justice is “ defined by that which provides the greatest good for the greatest number of people.”  (“John Rawls’ Theory of Justice Summary, UK Essays”).  Rawls also proposes that if a “theoretical person who, shrouded in a veil of ignorance, must design a just society without foreknowledge of his or her own status in that society…the individual will choose a system of justice that adequately provides for those positioned on the lowest rungs of society,” fearing that “he or she may end up in such a disadvantaged position and will want to be adequately provided for.” (ibid.).  According to Rawls, the foundation of the social contract is: “what will guarantee a just society without sacrificing the happiness or liberty of any one individual.” Rawls’ goal is to reconcile the principle of “freedom” on which Western capitalist societies were formed (according to the liberal principle) and the principle of “justice”, the basis of the philosophies of social justice that were developed in the 19th and 20th centuries.  The correlation of these two notions in political thought and political practice in the twentieth century has made thinkers at a loss as to justice requirements in the era of the primacy of freedom. Rawls suggested a solution within a social contract, possible at least theoretically and philosophically. Rawls and many other thinkers, such as Amartya Sen, have rehabilitated the “social contract” theory within social philosophy and development thinking at the international level.  The successive economic crises of the last two decades, the revolutions and wars of the Arab Spring, the growth of populism, the emergence of protectionist tendencies, and the attack on globalization have nowadays all precipitated the emergence of demands for a new social contract. In 2015, the World Bank’s North Africa and the Middle East Branch issued a report called “Towards a New Social Contract.”  The report claimed that the countries of the region adopted the “same development model”, despite the fact that their economies differ in relation to whether they export or import oil.  The model stems from the fact that the state “would provide free health and education for all, support basic materials and fuels,” and also be the major employer, providing the largest number of jobs via the public sector. On the other hand, we find low citizen participation in political life, and a relative curtailment of freedoms to (allegedly) ensure the security of both the state and citizens.  This contract achieved significant economic and social successes in the Arab region. In 2000, “poverty rates were low and declining. Almost everyone completed primary school, and enrollment rates in secondary and tertiary education were high and rising” (ibid). However, by the end of the 2000s, the contract began to show signs of growing fragility. Public indebtedness increased as a result of the pressuring social demands bill, especially in light of the economic crisis and the skyrocketing prices of fuel and food at the international market (ibid.).  The public sector is no longer able to provide jobs to the unemployed and “the private sector did not grow fast enough” to compensate for the shortage of job opportunities (ibid.). Despite continued investment in education and health, the reform of these two important sectors still faces major challenges, particularly on two fronts, “quality and equity” (ibid.). Thus, the old social contract is no longer “suited to the needs of the current generation of citizens” according to the authors of the report.  Instead, the report proposes a new social contract based on encouraging competitiveness in the private sector rather than relying on the state as a source of employment, abandoning subsidies of basic commodities, and switching to a system of direct cash transfer to the poor. Add to this the need to give space to citizen’s voices and the need to hear them in order to regain their trust.  This may sound like a new development model rather than a social contract, but it carries within it a veiled description of what the Arab regimes might gain, i.e. stability and political legitimacy at the time of social propensity for revolutions and civil wars.  At the beginning of December 2018, Nemat Shafik, President of the London School of Economics and former Vice President at the Bank of England, (and prior to that) at the IMF, and the World Bank, published, on the website of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a lengthy article entitled “A New Social Contract: Overcoming Fears of Technology and Globalization Means Rethinking the Rights and Obligations of Citizenship” (Finance &amp; Development. Dec, 2018, Vol. 55 Issue 4).  In her article, Shafik analyzes the circumstances of “the failure of our social contract to manage properly the consequences of globalization and technology.” “The advance of automation” has led to a significant drop in the employability of a large portion of low-skilled workers and will lead to a major split in the labor market “for the benefit of the more educated,” says Shafik. She also added that social security systems in the United States and France (“redistributive policies”) led to the protection of low-income households but burdened governments with debts.  Additionally, everyone contributes by paying taxes when they have a job, and the rich pay more taxes but “live longer, and thus benefit more from the pension system”. According to Shafik, this disrupts the erroneous saying that there are those who “work hard” and those who are ” a burden to others.”  Finally, Shafik says, “we face huge issues of intergenerational fairness.” “As the age of the median voter rises by a year, public spending on pensions goes up by 0.5 percent of GDP,” she adds. So young people should also mobilize, vote, and participate in electoral processes to make their voice heard and impose their views.  Shafik, therefore, says that it is necessary to review the social contract and establish a new system based on the principle of “payment of taxes in exchange for public goods, and looking after the old, the young, the infirm, and those who have fallen on hard times.” Putting conditions on remittances to those in need, requiring insurance in return, rethinking the social security system, and encouraging the rich to use public services to ensure a sustained sense of solidarity and “quality assurance” – are all inevitable policies to overcome the crisis.  It is also necessary to maintain “pre-distribution policies (i.e. investment in education, social mobility, infrastructure investments in poorer regions, and spreading productivity improvements to the frontier).”  We have to invest more in the capacity of education to bridge social identity. Shafik says: “countries with greater social mobility grow faster because they more effectively match people to the right jobs,” and thus contribute significantly to supporting production. Under this new social contract, young people must be given “entitlements that they can use to improve skills over the course of their lives”, an investment in the future “because they would repay the investment with higher future taxes that could finance care for the elderly.” (Shafik).  On the other hand, minimum wage cuts should be offset “by wage subsidies, earned income tax credits, and higher minimum wages, combined with access to services such as education and healthcare” to maintain reasonable standards of living for all. Effective policies must be enacted to ensure proper and appropriate employment transformation in order to adapt to automated production and digitization, through training, monitoring the opportunities offered by mechanization and digitization, and “giving part-time and temporary workers more rights to pensions, paid leave, and training.”  Finally, income must be rebalanced so that capital can bear a large part of the burden by “eliminating policies aimed at heavy taxation of employment” and by taxation of “capital where economic activity takes place” (ibid.) to counter tax evasion and resorting to tax havens. All these issues, which are of concern to development theorists of international institutions, are not far from the current debates around the issue of development in Morocco. Moroccans speak of a deep crisis of the current development model; the existing model which has relatively worked for the last few decades has reached its limit. The current social contract is no longer valid and may not meet the aspirations of today’s generations.  The lack of trust in politics and in State institutions is due to many categories of the population backing away from the terms of the contract, which was engineered after Independence (1956-1999) and reproduced in a new form during the “New Era” (starting 1999).  In fact, the historical evolution of Morocco’s development since Independence can be summarized in two successive social contracts. The second one was built on the foundations of the first; at the same time, the second provides a more or less clear and profound critique of the first one.  The first social contract that was developed in the post-Independence period was based on the central role of the state in regulating the provision of services, such as health, education, and access to basic services, and in being the main employer due to its monopoly of the production means, especially by owning main companies and big businesses.  On the one hand, the state intervened to subsidize food and fuel and set up relatively limited social safety and insurance networks. On the other hand, the overall governance system was motivated by security concerns, which meant that the few democratic openings now and then were always followed by exceptional measures whereby citizens’ voices were silenced, dissenters were jailed, opposition parties were oppressed, and the press was muzzled.  The terms of the contract were the state’s intervention as a guarantor of the redistribution of wealth in exchange for everyone’s involvement in a political project based on the consolidation of executive monarchy as a fundamental basis for government and governance in Morocco.  Under this contract, Morocco was able to maintain relative stability (despite the turbulent events of 1965, 71, 72, 73, 81, 84, and 90), to form a new elite that public schools managed to bring from various social classes, to establish a strong centralized administration and an experienced territorial cadre of civil servants, and to maintain relative (but fragile) social equilibrium (despite the chronic precariousness of the lower social classes). However, the resulting authoritarian welfare state had a high bill. Open access to public services, subsidies of basic foodstuffs and fuel in periods of price inflation, and wage increases to absorb popular anger drained treasury resources.  The existence of loyal elites gave the regime a cadre of trained officials capable of defending it politically. However, the fact that these elites were originally “unproductive classes” living on a rent system, deprived the national economy of opportunities to develop and create more wealth to finance the social bill.  The growth of a class that benefits from privileges without producing any added value, successive social demands, and an inflated civil service administration led to a rise in the foreign and domestic debt, with public finances approaching bankruptcy.  The World-Bank-and-IMF supported Structural Readjustment Programs (1984-1992), despite their macro-economic achievements, froze social spending on education, health, and basic services, set a ceiling for public employment, disrupted the normal development of wages, and halted the development of the social security network.  When Hassan II warned of Morocco’s economic “heart attack” in 1995, it was an official announcement that the post-independence social contract had reached a dead end.  The second contract adopted during the New Era (Mohammed VI Reign) is a sophisticated reproduction of the first contract. The new social contract has been based on the fight against poverty, the gradual targeting of lower social classes, the lifting of subsidies on foodstuff and fuel and the expansion of social security networks and improved access to basic services.  All of this in return for a tacit consensus on continuing to work within the framework of the basic perennial foundations of “Monarchy, National Unity and Islam” and a careful orientation towards gradual democratization (despite its many shortcomings) and participatory political decision-making.  This contract had the commendable results of reducing poverty, reducing the unemployment rate, and expanding the middle class.  Nonetheless, it did not offer a solution to the problem of chronic youth unemployment, especially for higher degree holders; it did not contribute to raising the income of the emerging and highly demanding middle class; and did not guarantee quality access to education, health, and basic services for all.  Indeed, the expectations of the middle class and the youth grew at a time when an emerging wealthy class benefited from privatization, and privileges granted to investors in real estate, agribusiness, agriculture, energy, and telecom. The wealthy class appeared as if it were a group of self-interested lobbies enhancing the unequal distribution of wealth and contributing to growing corruption and lack of transparency in public tenders.  The New Social Contract witnessed its first crisis with the successive Arab Spring revolutions when voices took to the streets calling for uprooting corruption, combatting new economic lobbies, and doing away with the alleged control of things public by the so-called “deep state”.  The new 2011 Constitution gave an impetus to reforms (especially political reforms) and was able to administer a serious lifting of the renewed social contract, but it soon showed its limitations in absorbing popular anger, especially as citizen participation in development and in the renewal of the governance system and actual political democratization remained absent in light of a manufactured conflict with the Islamists and the attempt to go back on the achievements of the 2011 Constitution.  Such desperate attempts to reengineer the political map (in a pseudo-counter-revolutionary manner)  deterred the country from addressing the core issues of economic growth, human development, ensuring effective citizen participation in managing local affairs, and supporting a fair redistribution of wealth.  The Rif Hirak (uprising in the northern city of Al Hoceima that lasted more than a year), the uprisings of marginal communities, and the Facebook revolution against the elites and state symbols opened the door to a deep crisis described by King Mohammed VI as “the crisis of the current development model.” Hence the current debate among political stakeholders on the need to think seriously and effectively of a new and more effective social contract.  Such a contract must include smart and conditional targeting of the poor, including an effective upgrading of their abilities and skills that would lift them out of poverty. If they overcome poverty and become active economically, they will contribute to the economic cycle and produce wealth, taxes, and resources that would compensate for the funds spent through conditional direct transfers.  This new contract should also include strong support of the middle classes through the reduction of income tax or other mechanisms to fund improved access to housing, car acquisition, payment of private education for children, access to college for the young and funding for travel and leisure.  Strengthening the capabilities of the middle class will increase their consumption capacity and will thus give a strong boost to the economy and contribute to raising public resources. Supporting the middle class does not mean setting up a rent system but investing in economic growth and wealth creation.  The contract should also include conditional cash transfers (dependent on training, learning, and skills enhancements) for young people in university, unemployed youth, and young job-seekers.  The support to youth may be in the form of grants, long-term advances, temporary jobs, and achievement awards which offer young people the means to improve their skills, help them find jobs, and contribute to building their identity and their future.  Ensuring direct citizen engagement in the management of local matters is also essential to ensure more effective management of development issues. It means setting up mechanisms for citizen monitoring of projects, citizens holding officials and elected representatives accountable through public sessions, setting up procedures to manage local financial resources through transparent consultations and open budgets developed with the participation of the local community and the population, and developing effective systems for managing complaints and grievances related to development programs and their impact on the population.  But all this comes only in the framework of gradual but real democratization and from within the framework of the perennial foundations of the Moroccan nation.  When we talk about responsibility and accountability, we must give it the real meaning of choosing who manages public matters through ballot boxes and holding them accountable through parliament, oversight entities, and elections, but only if all resources are put at their disposal and they have ample power to take decisions. There is no accountability in the absence of the right resources and the lack of real decision-making power.  Finally, it is imperative to ensure that the voice of the citizen is heard by guaranteeing his/her right to criticize and demonstrate. Society and the state become stronger when citizens are free, the press is more independent and critical, the parliament is strong and holds real accountability power, civil society is more democratic and mobilized, the unions are more responsible, strong, and critical, the private sector is more aware of its economic role and is well organized…  States become weak when critical voices are crushed, silenced, and curbed, and they become strong when their opposition is strong and independent as are the views of those who criticize the government and the regime.  The duality of rights and duties is essential to the success of the desired social contract, provided that we understand that the lack of awareness of one’s duty does not eliminate the mandatory enjoyment of one’s rights.  The right is binding and legitimate and must be guaranteed and protected by the law, but duty is a culture and a set of values developed through awareness, debate, and engagement.  Rights are constitutional and universal entitlements and duties are an acquired culture. That’s why it is not acceptable to trade this for that. A successful society is one that guarantees the most basic rights and works hard to spread the culture of true citizenship.  This is not possible without the determination and courage of all to bring forth hope, the hope for a brighter and better future for all—for a society where no one soul is left behind.

Rabat – Japanese Foreign Affairs Minister Taro Kono has reiterated that the presence of the Polisario Front at the Tokyo International Conference on Africa’s Development (TICAD) does not affect his country’s position regarding the separatist group. TICAD 2019 is due to take place in the coming days and representatives from Morocco and the self-proclaimed SADR will be in attendance.  Kono said, on August 27, that his country does not recognize the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The Japenese official made the affirmation in confirmation of an official statement from Japan, in which the Asian country reaffirmed its position on the presence of members of the Polisario Front at TICAD. On August 25, MAP interviewed  Katsuhiko Takahashi, the chief of the MENA division of the Japanese foreign affairs ministry, who reaffirmed Japan’s “constant and immutable” support for the United Nations-led political solution to end the Western Sahara conflict. Takahashi said that Japan does not recognize the self-proclaimed SADR and has no intention of changing its position. He added that his country does not recognize “Western Sahara as a state. This is Japan’s constant and immutable position and we have no intention of changing it.” Japan is also determined to avoid Polisario-run rumors on Tokyo’s alleged solidarity with Polisario’s separatist ideology and claims against Morocco’s territorial integrity.  In 2018, a row emerged after a delegation from the Polisario Front attended TICAD. In response, Kono said that “even if a group which claims itself as a state which Japan does not recognize was sitting in this room, this fact does not mean that Japan, in any way, implicitly or explicitly recognizes it as a state.” Kono also expressed “his deep regrets about the incident and the confusion during the opening session of TICAD ministerial meeting” during talks held with Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita following the controversial incident. The symposium opened on August 28 in Yokohama and will run until August 30. Mouhcine Jazuli,  Minister Delegate to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in charge of African Cooperation represents Morocco.

Rabat – Police operating in the port of Tangier-Med, in coordination with customs officers, foiled a drug trafficking operation today, August 27. The police intercepted a 4×4 vehicle registered abroad attempting to smuggle cannabis while it was boarding a ship headed to Spain, says the Directorate General of National Security (DGSN). Searches using sniffer dogs resulted in the seizure of 460 kilograms of cannabis resin. The traffickers had carefully hidden the drugs in the cavities of the car. According to DGSN’s statement, the perpetrators specifically designed the cavities in the vehicle’s frame and doors for the trafficking operation. The DGSN also questioned the 38-year-old driver, a Moroccan national, and his 40-year-old companion. The defendants were placed in custody under the supervision of the Prosecutor’s Office. The investigation conducted by the judicial police is ongoing in order to elucidate the circumstances of the trafficking operation, concludes the statement.

Rabat – For all of Morocco’s mishaps and dishearteningly early elimination at the latest CAN , defender Mehdi Benatia is of the opinion that the Moroccan Lions were better and slightly more equipped than Algeria’s national team. Algeria ended as the CAN winners with a style of play—safe for the ugly win against Senegal in the final— that elicited rapt commentaries and waves of admiration. Algeria’s national team was, in addition, the center of gravity of most of the compliments at the recently concluded Africa Cup of Nations, winning all its matches and putting on display a playing style and philosophy which attracted unanimous applause. Morocco’s Atlas Lions, on the other hand, went out of the tournament as disappointing—and disappointed—title contenders. The Lions’ early, unexpected defeat against underdog Benin shattered the dreams of the “Renard Generation” and the enormous sums of money FRMF, the Moroccan federation, invested in the hopes of ending more than three decades of trophy drought. Speaking to a Qatari daily over the weekend, however, Benatia sought to put things in context, in perspective, ultimately saying that Morocco’s national team at the recent CAN was more the victim of fate and bad luck than of the lack of inspiration or skill in its squad. For Benatia, the Moroccan Lions were slightly better equipped and more in shape than Algeria’s Desert Foxes. Morocco would have been a stronger, more deserving champion, he argued. Benatia’s point, noted Moroccan Arabic newspaper Al Akhbar, which reported on the Atlas Lion’s interview with the Qatari daily, is that fate—that mysterious combination of favorable (or not) circumstances and events—and luck were in Algeria’s favor at the expense of teams like Morocco’s which “had everything to be deserved champions.” Sounding exceedingly nostalgic throughout the interview, the former Juventus and Bayern Munich defender spoke at great lengths about what playing in the “Renard Generation” meant for him and other players. He suggested that it was the solid performance and esprit de corps of this generation that helped cement Morocco’s reputation recently as a serious contender at the continental level and a challenging opponent for world-class national teams. Hervé Renard, the now former Moroccan coach, left Morocco after failing to deliver on the terms of his agreement with FRMF. When accounting for the calamitous defeat against Benin, many Moroccan fans and sports commentators tend to point to “some technical blunders” in Morocco’s lineup. After yet another morale-crushing CAN experience for Morocco, Renard and FRMF were compelled by unfriendly post-CAN winds to sever ties, ending one of African football’s most hyped bromances. But Benatia still holds the ‘Renard Generation’ in very high esteem, saying that despite the continued trophy drought and the particularly lackadaisical game against Benin, the squad under Renard’s tenure was by far one of Morocco’s best in recent memories. He also said that the early exit from CAN still hurts today, part of the reason being the enormous pool of talented players and the quality of management that were supposed to put Morocco far beyond the level of most other African teams. This is not the first time that Benatia has given a mixed assessment of Morocco’s display at CAN 2019. While visibly apologetic about the team’s overall disappointing performance at the latest CAN, the veteran defender has been unwavering in his belief that the team did its best to live up to the great expectations that came with being ranked as one of the best African teams. In a post-CAN message to Moroccan fans, Benatia sent out words that sounded at once like an apology and a rallying cry. “This CAN has ended in great bitterness for us,” he began, as he went on to add that the team did it best to make fans happy and will continue to do so in the future. “On and off the pitch, a lion will remain a lion, even when wounded,” he concluded, in reference to the nickname of Morocco’s national football team.

Rabat – Moroccan Royal Marines rescued 62 migrants from a sinking boat in the Mediterranean Sea, today, August 27, reported Spanish news agency EFE.  The boat was about 15 miles (24 kilometers) to the North of Sidi Abed Beach, near Al Hoceima (north of Morocco). The boat was damaged and full of water when the Royal Marine reached it. The rescued migrants, including three women, originating from the sub-Saharan countries of Nigeria, Guinea, Gambia, and Cameroon. The Royal Marines took them directly to the city of Al Hoceima. Many of the irregular migrants needed medical attention. According to official statistics, the Moroccan authorities prevented more than 40,300 migrants attempts to cross the Mediterranean Sea in the first half of this year alone. Last year, the authorities aborted around 89,000 undocumented migrants making similar attempts.

Rabat – The 2019 International Franchise Attractiveness Index ranked Morocco 39 with a significant score of 54. With a list of 131 states, the index listed Morocco as the first attractive business hub in Africa and the 2nd in MENA after the UAE. Morocco jumped up three places since 2018 when the annual report placed Morocco at 41 with a score of 54.53. The list shows Morocco competing with some of the international powers, including  France, Spain, Germany, and Australia. Germany is the first on the list with a score of 25.50, followed by the UK with a score of  26.08, and Canada with a score of 29.58. Saudi Arabia ranks 42nd on the list with a score of 55.15, while Qatar positioned itself at 59th. Egypt was listed  51st with a score of 60.53 ahead of Kenya, and South Africa with 54 and 55, respectively. Tunisia is the 77th on the list. The index listed Algeria as the 66th with a score of 69.53, Nigeria 81st, and Senegal as 82nd.  Researchers at the Rosenberg International Franchise Center (RIFC) develop the index by taking into account the attractiveness of 131 counties as “international expansion markets” for US-based franchises. “This index is generated through a quantitative model that is based on peer-reviewed research and a survey of franchise executives. The model produces two different index rankings (Balanced Growth and Aggressive Growth) based on a company’s risk tolerance levels,” according to the University of New Hampshire (UNH). Morocco’s location works as a pillar to attract international investors. The 2019 Investment Climate Statements  from the US Department of State said in July that Morocco’s political stability, geographical location, and efforts to build a robust infrastructure, contribute “to its emergence as a regional manufacturing and export base for companies.” The report also recalled Morocco’s strategy for attracting investors, with several measures in place, including facilitating foreign investment. The report said that the facilitation is especially relevant in “export sectors like manufacturing, through macro-economic policies, trade liberalization, investment incentives, and structural reforms.” The report also indicates that Morocco attracts the fifth-most foreign direct investment (FDI) in Africa, with an intention to position itself as a regional business hub due to its status and location and the “tri-regional focal point of sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Europe.”

Rabat – The Brazilian government has rejected $22 million in aid offered by the Group of Seven (G7) countries, the seven largest economies in the world. The G7 pledged the funding during their annual summit held from August 24 to August 26 in France, in an effort to curb the wildfires raging in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro previously accused Macron of having a “colonialist” mindset when he said he wanted to make the fires a priority at the summit. Bolsonaro’s Chief of Staff Onyx Lorenzoni echoed a similar sentiment when he announced Brazil’s decision to reject the aid to online media outlet G1, saying Macron instead needed to take care of “his home and his colonies.” “We appreciate the offer, but maybe those resources are more relevant to reforest Europe,” continued Lorenzoni. “Brazil is a democratic, free nation that never had colonialist and imperialist practices, as perhaps is the objective of the Frenchman Macron.” Referencing the Notre Dame fire in April, Lorenzoni sniped that “Macron cannot even avoid a foreseeable fire in a church that is a world heritage site. What does he intend to teach our country?” “Brazil is a democratic, free nation that never had colonialist and imperialist practices, as perhaps is the objective of the Frenchman Macron.” Speaking to French TV on the evening of Monday, August 27, Macron responded to the Brazilian government’s criticism. “We respect your sovereignty. It’s your country,” Macron said. “But the trees in the Amazon are the lungs of the planet.” “The Amazon forest is a subject for the whole planet. We can help you reforest. We can find the means for your economic development that respects the natural balance. But we cannot allow you to destroy everything,” said Macron. He also acknowledged that by importing soja from Brazil, France is “partly complicit,” as the industry puts further pressure on the rainforest. He added that Europe’s dependence on Brazil for imported proteins “was a very bad choice,” and that Europe needs to develop alternatives. Earlier this month, Brazil declared a state of emergency over the rising number of fires in the Amazon, and as the situation is thrust into the spotlight of international media, a global outcry has ensued. So far this year, almost 73,000 fires have been detected by Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE), with a sharp spike in July and August. The number is an 83% increase from last year. Brazilian scientists believe that at least 50% of the fires are set by loggers and ranchers to clear land for cattle. Environmental agencies have attributed the spike in deliberate fire setting to Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro relaxing environmental policies and regulations in favor of economic growth. On Thursday, August 22, Bolsonaro said the Brazilian government lacks the resources to fight the fires. The Brazilian federal government has not yet provided any major organized effort to fight the fires, but following the G7’s monetary pledge Bolsonaro said that he would send 44,000 soldiers to help battle the blazes, and military planes began dumping water on fires in the Amazon state of Rondonia. The move has been dubbed “too little, too late” by many critics.

Rabat – On August 27, local authorities in Ait Faska demolished the buildings of the Holocaust memorial. The project has been under construction since September 2018.  The project’s owner shared photos of the demolition process on his Facebook page (at around 9 am). The demolition comes hours after local authorities denied all “rumors” about the memorial’s ongoing construction works. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Marrakech local authorities explained that the rumors of a Holocaust memorial being built in the region “are devoid of any foundation.” “The competent services in the province have not granted any authorization for the establishment of such a project,” added the authorities’ statement.  Start of the controversy During the third week of August, international media, Israeli news outlets in particular, reported the launch of construction work for building the Holocaust memorial in the village of Ait Faska (25 kilometers from Marrakech). The project was launched by Oliver Bienkowski, founder of the German non-profit organization against racism, PixelHelper. The project would have been North Africa’s first Holocaust memorial.  The project was expected to include an LGBTQ+ corner dedicated to gay Jews who died in the Nazi concentration camps. PixelHelper introduced the project in a Tweet on August 9. The tweet was accompanied by pictures of the construction site. Un signe contre les #minorités persécutées dans le monde entier. La construction du premier mémorial de l’#Holocauste en #Maroc #Afrique du Nord devrait servir de source d’informations sur l’Holocauste pour les écoles et le grand public. #Marrakech #Juif #Hitler #génocide pic.twitter.com/TsJEn4bIrH — PixelHELPER 🦇🇪🇺🌈 (@PixelHELPER) August 9, 2019  The Tweet said, “a sign against persecuted minorities all over the world. The construction of the first memorial of the Holocaust in Morocco, North Africa will serve as a source of information on the Holocaust for school kids and the general public.” According to The Jerusalem Post, Bienkowski explained that he looked up his name in the “Yad Vashem” database and found people with the same last name among victims of the Holocaust. “I found that people with the same last name as me, as well as Freemasons, were killed by the Germans in concentration camps,” he added. Bienkowski also explained that “as a German with Polish roots and a Masonic background, I immediately started working and building this project.” According to Telquel Arabic, Bienkowski constructed a “Jewish obelisk” (a quadrilateral stone column with a pyramid at the top), stone carvings for tombs, and oven-like structures, reminiscent of those used by the Nazis in the holocaust. Auch #Freimaurer, #Rotary &amp; #Lionsclub Mitglieder, #Sinti &amp; #Roma &amp; #Behinderte sind in deutschen #Konzentrationslager getötet wurden. All Ihnen wollen wir auf dem Gelände des #PixelHELPER Hauptquartieres einen Platz schenken. pic.twitter.com/jA5gNWtSlc — PixelHELPER 🦇🇪🇺🌈 (@PixelHELPER) August 19, 2019  Bienkowski told The Jerusalem Post, “we have a black tower with an infinity flame, and in the black house we will show people the history of the Jews in North Africa during the Holocaust.” “Then, in the middle of the monument, we have [blocks with the colors of] a rainbow for the LGBTQ+ Jews and people who died in concentration camps,” he continued. Bienkowski announced that the memorial’s rainbow installation will be finished by Hanukkah, on December 22. Bienkowski also explained that he intends to “turn on the infinite flame on the tower, to indicate that evil does not come in quick steps; it starts with small steps that nobody recognizes.” Political dimensions Questioned by Marrakech’s local authorities, he denied any political dimension to the construction project. Bienkowski said that the “obelisk” was merely an artwork, the tombs were meant for flowers, and the rainbow floor was simply a rainbow with no reference to the gay community, says Telquel Arabic. Telquel Arabic further reported that Bienkowski had apparently rented a villa in Ait Faska in August 2018. “He claimed he would build a children’s park, but local authorities, under the supervision of the Kaid, noticed unauthorized construction works and intervened to stop them last May,” says the news outlet. Bienkowski’s Tweet on August 26, shows a live recording of the ongoing construction works. In the Tweet, Bienkowski started a crowdfunding campaign for the project. #interactive construction &amp; #development #aid #livestream start the next action with a paypal donation to [email protected] #crowdfunding #crowdhelping https://t.co/WfNDDREbxh — PixelHELPER 🦇🇪🇺🌈 (@PixelHELPER) August 26, 2019  The controversial memorial construction comes almost a year after Israeli media misinterpreted a message from King Mohammed VI. The message was addressed to a symposium on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani delivered it at a roundtable on “The power of education in preventing racism and discrimination: the case of antisemitism.” The King called participants at the UN roundtable to “promote education for peace” and invest in education and culture to win the battle against the proliferation of exclusive and racist ideologies. Journalists raised the possibility that Morocco might include the Holocaust and other episodes of Jewish history in Moroccan history textbooks.

Rabat – Morocco’s top tourist destination, Marrakech, with its famous Jemaa El Fna square and the numerous food stalls, is ranked 7th in the list of top 10 worst resorts for food poisoning. Based on the investigation led by the UK’s leading Holiday Sickness claim Experts, Sick Holiday, and food intolerance company YorkTest, Egypt’s Hurghada tops the list of resorts with 380 cases have been reported between 2017 and 2018. The data was based on insurance claims submitted to Sick Holiday. The list of resorts with the highest number of food poisoning cases includes Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic with 211 cases (2nd), Mexico’s Riviera Maya with 182 cases (3rd), Turkey’s Antalya with 108 cases (4th), and Mexico’s Cancun with 95 cases (5th). Other destinations infamous for food poisoning are Cape Verde’s Boa Vista with 84 cases (6th), Marrakech with 83 cases (7th), Cape Verde’s Sal with 68 cases (8th), and the Spanish cities of Majorca (9th) and Benidorm (10th) with 66 and 62 cases respectively reported.  “One of the more common holiday illnesses reported to Sickholiday.com in Morocco is Dysentery, a bacterial infection that can lead to severe diarrhea, stomach cramps and in rare cases can be life threatening,” said Sick Holiday. “Although all holidaymakers visiting Morocco are advised to drink only bottled water, poorly maintained swimming pools can also lead to serious stomach illness such as Gastroenteritis as a result of contracting Cryptosporidium,” it added. According to Richard Conroy of Sick holiday, food poisoning kills 420,000 people a year worldwide and affects 600 million people a year. He added that keeping food at the wrong temperature for a long time is a factor for food poisoning. Leaving food out for long periods before being reheated can also cause intoxication as it allows the development of pathogenic bacteria. Conroy pointed out that “a single fly can deposit up to 1,000 microbes by landing on food that is waiting to be served, which sometimes has been left out in the heat for hours.”

Rabat – The Middle East and North Africa Business Aviation Association (MEBAA) will come back to Marrakech for another airshow in September. The MEBAA airshow will take place from September  25-26 at Marrakech Menara Airport. Since 2015, the show has attracted aviation experts and attendees from across Morocco and the world. The first MEBBA show took place in 2015 at the  Mohammed V international airport in Casablanca. The annual airshow attracts products from aviation giants, including Gulfstream and Boeing. Ali Ahmed Alnaqbi, founding and executive chairman of MEBAA said  that “Morocco is a growing market when it comes to the business aviation.” The chairman said that the airshow in Morocco has become an “important gathering and an important event.” “Morocco is a hub and therefore it is important to raise the infrastructure there to the highest level and that is why MEBAA chooses Morocco to do the first-ever show outside of the United Arab Emirates,” he added. Alnaqbi said that the show features different products. “We have companies in Morocco that exhibit in the Morocco show from the United States, from Europe, and from Africa as well, and from Asia.” He added that companies “must not miss that very important show in Morocco.”  For many observers and international reports, Morocco is a leader in Africa’s aviation sector. Bridging Africa and Europe, Morocco positions itself as a gateway to the promising African market for both military and business aviation. Morocco’s Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy said in 2018 that the aeronautical sector “is fast-moving forward” in Morocco. The minister added that Morocco exported $1.2 billion worth of aeronautical materials, and aerospace jobs increased by 50% in 2017. Morocco now has 130 aerospace companies. In addition to the MEBAA show, Morocco also hosts Marrakech Air Show. The 2018 Marrakech Air show took place in October at the  Royal Moroccan Air Force military base in Marrakech. Since its inception in 2008, the International Marrakech Air Show has annually convened leading firms in the aerospace industry.

Rabat –  Staff at the Orly Airport in Paris experienced a moment of fear on August 25 after members of staff noticed smoke coming out from one of the engines. The Paris airport posted a tweet on August 25 saying that “an incident on one of the engines of this aircraft upon arrival in Orely required the safe landing of passengers. The incident is over and the passengers have been taken care of by the airport staff.” News reports said that the incident occurred on a Royal Air Maroc aircraft, which served the  AT750 flight between Casablanca and Paris with a  Boeing 737-800. The incident took place after the Royal Air Maroc aircraft landed in Paris. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that, according to Royal Air Maroc, during the “landing of the flight, the airport’s technical services reported suspicion of smoke in one of the aircraft’s engines.” Bonsoir. Un incident sur l’un des moteurs de cet avion à son arrivée à Orly a nécessité le débarquement des passagers en toute sécurité. L’incident est terminé et les passagers ont été pris en charge par le personnel aéroportuaire. — Paris Aéroport (@ParisAeroport) August 25, 2019  The emergency caused the pilot-in-command to ask for an “emergency evacuation” to ensure the safety of passengers and crew of the aircraft. The RAM statement added that the passengers “were evacuated in good conditions and without incident.” The company concluded its statement by praising “the professionalism and responsiveness of its crew and renew its commitment to quality and safe flights.” Passengers who had to take the Royal Air Maroc flight condemned the company’s lack of communication after they received no explanation about the incident. Mail reçu à l’instant! Ils espèrent qu’on a fait bon voyage, oui… jusqu’à l’évacuation!! Sans aucune explication!! pic.twitter.com/9Pz904eU77 — Elise (@lilichemv1) August 25, 2019  One passenger shared an email received from Royal Air Maroc on Twitter, in which the company wished that people on board its flight had a good trip. “Yes, until the evacuation!! without any explanation,” wrote the Twitter user. Boeing has been under pressure recently after the Ethiopian Airlines ET 302 plane crash in March with a 737 MAX plane. The aircraft was carrying 149 passengers. Two Moroccans died in the incident. In addition to the Royal Air Maroc incident on August 25,  the Aviation Herald reported on August 26 that a Smartwings Boeing 737-800 with 170 people on board experienced a technical issue after one of the engines shut down “spontaneously  while en route.”

Rabat –  A number of inhabitants of Douar El Garaa, one of the oldest slums in Rabat, came face to face today with Moroccan authorities. The clashes were filmed and posted on YouTube.  The clashes took place near the ruins of some citizens’ houses. The video shows the Moroccan officers bundling in a big mass and advancing towards the scattered citizens, women’s screams filling the background. On the other side of the ruins, the video shows a group of young men standing in front of the riot squad officers, throwing rocks at them.   The clashes appear to be due to an ongoing displacement of the inhabitants. As part of the project “Rabat capital of lights“, previously supervised by Abdelwafi Fatit, former governor of Rabat, Douar El Garaa is expected to be demolished. Authorities in Rabat have offered apartments for MAD 100,000 or lands on the Ain Aouda area of South Rabat in compensation for the demolished homes. The residents rejected the offers as they did not have the money to buy the apartments or to build new houses on the proposed lands. Some refused to move from the center of Rabat to the Ain Aouda area on the outskirts of the capital. Since 2017, the residents have been protesting the authorities’ plans. Some of them demonstrated, in 2017, near “Bab Soufara” (Ambassadors Gate) near the royal palace in Rabat. In May 2018, during the King’s official activities near their neighborhood, the residents also protested with slogans demanding accountability.

Rabat – Moroccan residing abroad have been asked to pay 31% of their vehicle’s value in order to cross the Algeciras port, in Spain. MREs, who have been returning to their host countries after spending the summer holiday in Morocco, have encountered entry difficulties at Algeciras port. Spain’s Civil Guard at Algeciras port has imposed new regulations, without prior notice, on MREs leaving the port. MREs driving cars with temporary plates have been surprised by Spanish authorities asking them to pay 31% of the car’s value. Drivers who do not pay the new tax will have their cars seized. Spain now considers the cars as imported without a declaration.  The information has been shared by an MRE through a video posted on youtube on August 20. In the video, the MRE explains the new tax imposed on Moroccans arriving in Spain. “Since 5 in the morning, I arrived at Algeciras port, I was blocked by Spanish customs. [Mercedes] GLA 2018, you have 6,000 to 7,000 to pay,” said an MRE in the video.  He added that Spanish customs seized a Mercedes C63 and asked the owner to pay 20,000. The MRE was unable to pay the tax and his car was seized. The car owner was later taken to the hospital after he lost consciousness. MREs who are unable to pay the tax are forced to wait near their impounded vehicles.  In a second video, the MRE reveals that some MREs sleep near their vehicles, while some have children and babies.  “Some sleep near their vehicles, some with their children and babies under a blazing sun. Others were attacked by Spanish Customs and some were verbally harassed,” he denounced. He encouraged Moroccans living in France to file complaints against the Civil Guard as soon as they get onto the French soil. In a third video, the MRE revealed that the Moroccan customs are aware of the situation but have taken no action to support the MREs affected. The MRE who posted the videos contacted the French embassy in Morocco to complain but was told they could not help him.

Rabat – Moroccan workers’ representatives say they have had enough of the government’s reluctance to meet their demands. After three months of fruitless discussions over improved working conditions, the groups are pointing accusatory fingers at the government, saying that they are no longer willing to tolerate the government’s passivity and perceived lack of interest in their daily struggles. The relationship between Moroccan trade unions and government authorities has been a bit of a roller coaster in the past three months, oscillating between public or written protestations, half-hearted compromise, a static social dialogue, and strike announcements. The two entities now seem to have finally switched to a full-throated Tom &amp; Jerry mode. In the latest development, especially marked by the failure of the ongoing social dialogue, trade union representatives are accusing the El Othmani-led government of treason and lack of concern. The news, reported by Al Akhbar in its August 26 edition, comes in the wake of a three-month long dialogue between the government and workers’ representatives. Trade unions demanded improvement of working conditions, with the most vital elements being salary increase and a revision of family allocations from MAD 200 to 300 for each of the first three born to a family. While the government agreed in principle in July and promised that implementation would follow, nothing has changed in the past months. In an unsparing attack on the government’s failure to deliver on its promises, an association of trade unions described the prevailing situation as an “unacceptable step back and treason.” The collective statement also urged the government to start working towards signing the official decrees for the implementation of all the measures agreed upon three months ago. Should the government fail to positively respond to the unions’ cri de coeur, stressed the statement, the coming months will be a constant scene of public strikes and protests. In an attempt to justify the delay in meeting its agreement with the group of worker representatives, the government said that the long wait was due to the summer holidays. It promised, yet again, to deliver as soon as possible. But trade unions say they have waited numerous times, and for far too long. The biting tone of the message suggests they have no intention of waiting for months again, only to be told on the due date to wait some more. They do not seem to have bought the government’s summer holiday excuse. The statement reads: “The government has evoked summer holidays as a reason why it delayed singing into a decree [the agreement]. But these are baseless allegations that do not justify the delay in signing an agreement many of us trade unionists grudgingly signed, given that some of us disagreed with many of the points it contained.” The statement added that trade unions have already played their role by signing the terms of thé agreement, even though they did not feel at ease with some if the content. It noted that “the ball is now in the government’s court….” This latest episode of the broken social dialogue comes after teachers’ and doctors’ strikes. For all the workers’ declared determination to take to the streets in case their demands are not met, the Moroccan government may drag its feet on delivery, testing the group’s resolve. But the acrimonious tone of the trade union’s message suggests there are more strikes in store for the coming weeks should the government fail to deliver or convince the seemingly irritated workers to wait a little more.

Rabat – The Spanish Ministry of Interior has announced a deadline for the removal of barbed wire from Ceuta and Melilla border. According to El País, the barbed wire surrounding the fences separating Morocco from the two Spanish enclaves should be removed before the end of the year. In January 2019, the Spanish government announced its intention to remove the famous fences that “put people’s lives in danger, instead of preventing assaults on the borders”, reports El Mundo. Some weeks later, the Spanish government explained that they would replace the barbed wire with another material, ensuring security without harming anyone. The Spanish Ministry of Interior also announced that they would raise the fences, making them reach 10 meters. According to El Mundo, Ministry of Interior will devote a EUR 32.7 million budget to the improvement of the infrastructures and security systems in the crossing borders of Ceuta and Melilla. The plans include changing surveillance cameras and implementing a facial recognition system, among other modifications. Official data from Spanish authorities recorded that 3,344 unaccompanied minors from the MENA region arrived in Ceuta in 2018. 3,302 of the unaccompanied minors were boys and 42 were girls, many of whom came from the neighboring cities of Tetouan and Tangier in northern Morocco. However, in April 2019, Spanish news outlet ABC reported that Spanish authorities noticed a 52% decline in the number of irregular migrants from April 2018 to 2019. Successful irregular migration attempts from Ceuta and Melilla crossing borders also decreased, from 1,085 in 2018 to only 226 in 2019.

Rabat – Morocco’s Princess Lalla Meryem, born to King Hassan II and his wife, Lalla Latifa Hammou, celebrates her 57th birthday Monday, August 26. The firstborn child of King Hassan and Lalla Latifa, Lalla Meryem was born in Italy during the royal family’s vacation. Throughout her life, Lalla Meryem has taken on her roles in the royal family as the daughter of a King and sister of a King while pursuing her role in society as a royal advocate for women and vulnerable children. Lalla Meryem has served as president of the Social Work of the Royal Armed Forces (FAR) since 1981, a post King Hassan II gave her shortly after she received her Baccalaureate from Mohammed V University. Focusing on the plight of Morocco’s most needy people, Lalla Meryem’s work includes presiding over the National Observatory for the Rights of the Child (ONDE), the Moroccan Association of Support for UNICEF, the Children’s Parliament, and the National Union of Women of Morocco (UNFM), according to state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). In the last year, Lalla Meryem has attended numerous functions as part of her royal work. She launched the African Cities Without Street Children campaign in November 2018 Marrakech during the Africities Summit. In March, the secretary-general of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Yousef Al-Othaimeen, appointed Lalla Meryem as goodwill ambassador for the prevention of child marriage and the promotion of family and marital values. The princess also launched a vocational skills center for production, marketing, and training this year to help young people aged 15 to 30 to learn skills for the labor market, MAP reports. Lalla Meryem has also stepped up to welcome several royal visitors to Morocco in the past year, including Princess Astrid of Belgium, Queen Letizia of Spain, and the UK’s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.  Since King Mohammed VI’s divorce from his wife, Lalla Meryem often appears at his side at official functions.

Rabat – A governmental decree of August 22 has postponed the deadline for the end of construction work on Safi’s new harbor. The decision to add one year to the previous deadline of July 30, 2019, comes after a series of severe delays in construction works. King Mohammed VI inaugurated the construction project of Safi’s new harbor on April 19, 2013. The harbor was supposed to be functional five years later, at the latest. The construction delays follow a series of technical norm infractions by the company responsible for the works, according to Assabah newspaper.    In July 2017, an accident caused 700 blocks of concrete forming the charcoal dock to crack, making it impossible for ships to moor. Since then, the dock has been reconstructed from scratch. Those responsible for the accident, which happened more than two years ago, have not yet been sanctioned These delays have already cost the government in the region of MAD 500 million. These losses add up to an estimated MAD 600 million costs for the National Office of Electricity and Water (ONEE), along with the environmental damage caused by the duration of works. Abdelkader Amara, the Moroccan minister for Equipment, Transport, Logistics, and Water, is to be held accountable for these delays, according to Assabah. The newspaper speculates that his political future is under threat, and that the delays in the accomplishment of the project could cost him his position. The new Safi harbor is expected to contribute, when ready to operate, to the functioning of Safi’s new thermal power station, launched in December 2018, which requires 10,000 tonnes of charcoal daily.

Rabat – On August 26, the National Airports Authority (ONDA) announced that 2,394,773 passengers passed through Morocco’s airports in July 2019. This is an increase of 14.24% from July 2018.  The majority of Morocco’s commercial air traffic is fed by the European market, representing 76% of passengers in Morocco’s airports in July 2019. This is a 12.16% increase from last year.  The North American market is significantly smaller, with only 75,642 passengers in July, compared to 1,433,641 from Europe.  Domestic travelers represented only 277,263 of the nearly 2.4 million passengers in Morocco’s airports in July. However, the number of domestic travelers significantly increased this year, growing by 32.55% since July 2018.  Only 3.21% of passengers arrived from North African countries, while 7.55% of travelers came from other African nations. The Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca, the largest airport in Morocco and one of the five busiest in Africa, unsurprisingly welcomed the majority of commercial traffic in the Kingdom with 1,080,399 passengers. This is up 9.72% from last year.  Mohammed V is followed by the international airports in Marrakech, Agadir, Fes-Saiss, and Tangier.  The Rabat-Sale International Airport in the Kingdom’s capital received only 99,496 passengers this past July, but this is still a 13.08% increase from the year before. The airport in Beni Mellal, near Marrakech, welcomed only 66 passengers in July 2019, compared to 861 passengers in July 2018.  The Ben Slimane airport, an hour east of Casablanca, only saw 40 travelers this July.  The most popular international air routes from Morocco are to the Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports in Paris, France.

Rabat – The judicial police arrested the lead nurse as she accepted the sum of MAD 200 as a bribe. The lead nurse worked at the resuscitation unit at the Mohammed V Regional Hospital in El Jadida. The nurse was arrested after a citizen called the Green Line of the Office of the Public Prosecutor, complaining that the nurse was blackmailing him. She asked for the bribe in return for providing medical services to the victim’s relative in the resuscitation unit. The Regional Judicial Police Department, in coordination with the public prosecutor at the Court of First Instance of El Jadida and Rabat’s Public Prosecutor’s Office, set a police unit to monitor and track the bribery in a sting operation. After searching the nurse, the police confiscated a MAD 200 bill with the same serial number as the one reported. Under the instructions of the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the lead nurse will remain in custody while standing trial. In Morocco, corruption has not spared the medical sector. In May 2019, The Moroccan National Association of Private Clinics (ANCP) sent a letter to private clinics in Casablanca calling for an end to the bribing of ambulance drivers. Doctor Hachem Tyal, the deputy director of the ANCP told Morocco World News, “it appears some clinics have been bribing ambulance drivers, asking them to bring patients to the clinics.” The ANCP, warned by patients and ambulance drivers, condemned the private clinics’ behavior. On May 14, 2018, the Moroccan government launched a corruption hotline as part of its plan to end all forms of corruption by 2050.

Rabat – The Group of Seven (G7), an organization comprising of the world’s 7 most powerful economies, has reached an agreement to step up and help end the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. The agreement came as the leaders of the G7 countries; Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US met for the G7’s 45th annual summit, held in Biarritz, France, from August 24 to August 26. French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that the G7 countries will donate $22 million in emergency aid to the cause. Macron said that the funds will be “available immediately.” He added that France will also pledge “concrete support with military in the region within the next few hours.” Just a day before the G7 summit began, Macron called for the crisis in the Amazon rainforest to be added to the G7’s agenda last minute on Twitter on August 23. Justin Trudeau also voiced his support. I couldn’t agree more, @EmmanuelMacron. We did lots of work to protect the environment at the #G7 last year in Charlevoix, &amp; we need to continue this weekend. We need to #ActForTheAmazon &amp; act for our planet — our kids &amp; grandkids are counting on us. https://t.co/KwaR8Eevq5 — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) August 23, 2019  US President Trump was notably absent from the summit on Monday, the day dedicated to environmental talks. Macron added in a press conference that despite his absence, the US is “in general agreement over the need to fight the wildfires.” Earlier this month, Brazil declared a state of emergency over the rising number of fires in the Amazon, and as the situation is thrust into the spotlight of international media, a global outcry has ensued. So far this year, almost 73,000 fires have been detected by Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE), with a sharp spike in July and August. The number is an 83% increase from last year. Brazilian scientists believe that at least 50% of the fires are set by loggers and ranchers to clear land for cattle. Environmental agencies have attributed the spike in deliberate fire setting to Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro relaxing environmental policies and regulations in favor of economic growth. The Brazilian federal government has not provided any major organized effort to fight the fires. On Thursday, August 22, Bolsonaro said the Brazilian government lacks the resources to fight the fires. The Amazon rainforest is frequently referred to as the “Earth’s lungs,” thanks to the huge amount of carbon dioxide the rainforest absorbs to produce 20% of the world’s oxygen. If too much of the rainforest is destroyed past the point of return, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will rise significantly, causing the hole in the ozone layer to grow and climate change to worsen.

Rabat – American President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson enjoyed a breakfast together during the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, on Sunday, August 25. Over a meal of scrambled eggs and veal sausages, the two blond leaders had much to discuss. With the UK’s looming exit from the EU, set for October 31, the prime minister and the president want to agree on a trade deal. Descending from a spiral staircase with Boris Johnson, Trump first asked reporters if they knew who Boris is. “You know who this is? Does everybody know?” he asked, before predicting Boris would be a “fantastic prime minister.” Trump remained on the last step of the staircase, highlighting the height difference between the two men. Johnson quickly returned to the last stair and spoke optimistically. “We’re going to do a fantastic deal, once we clear up some of the obstacles in our path.” A deal, Trump said, could be agreed “pretty quickly.” He also called the EU an anchor around Britain’s ankle. At the G7 summit are some of the world’s most powerful countries: the US, Canada, the UK, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan. Russia has not been part of the group, previously known as the G8, since 2014. Three countries that are not part of the G7 have been prominent in the summit’s discussions: Iran, China, and Brazil.  France invited the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to Biarritz. The delegation from the US, whose relations with Iran are tense, were reportedly surprised. Although Zarif met with French President Emmanuel Macron, he did not meet with Trump. The US’s escalating trade war with China was also a focus of the summit. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday she hoped the two countries could come to an understanding. “We have all interest to find a solution and would be very glad if an agreement could be found between China and the US.” After worldwide attention came to forest fires in Brazil, Macron announced a fund to combat the fires. The $20 million emergency fund will be for countries in the Amazon.

Rabat – Since 2017 the province of Berkane has been hosting an annual celebration of its agricultural sector.  The socio-economic event aims to illuminate the potential of this sector in the rural town of Aghbal, near the Moroccan-Algerian border. If successful development continues, Aghbal’s cultural, artistic, and natural assets could facilitate tourism in the region.  The celebration encourages the exchange of experiences between farmers and professionals while exploring methods of developing fig tree cultivation, according to Moroccan news outlet Le Matin.   The festival was first launched in 2017 by the Gharmawne Agricultural Cooperative and the Gharmawne Association of Fig Producers and Agricultural Development and organized with support from the Ministry of Agriculture.  This year, about 30 cooperatives participated in the event and displayed their local products, which included olive oil, honey, and argan oil in addition to fig products. Visitors also enjoyed sports and artistic activities as well as presentations on fig tree culture and development. Mohammed Sadiki attended the opening ceremony. Sadiki is the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Agriculture, Maritime Fisheries, Rural Development, and Water and Forests. Sadiki announced the event’s fig tree planting project. The Gharmawne Agricultural Cooperative led the project as part of the Plan Maroc Vert.  According to The Economist, 100 hectares of fig trees were planted in hopes of developing the fig industry, improving the productivity and quality of figs, and promoting the fig market.  The project aims to make figs available throughout the year as 200 tons of figs will be dried and 1,200 tons will be packaged fresh.  The long-term goal of the project in Aghbal is to extend the area reserved for fig-trees, which will require an investment of just over MAD 2,000,000.  Successful implementation of this project would ideally improve farmers’ income from MAD 1,700 per hectare to MAD 43,000 by increasing fig production to 5.2 tons per hectare. The third edition of the Aghbal Fig Festival ran from August 23 to 25.

Algeria remains behind Morocco in 4th place, with 46 medals (12 gold, 14 silver, and 20 bronze). The African Games have been held every four years since 1965, previously under the names All-Africa Games and Pan African Games. Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic games first conceived the idea, but the games are now organized by the African Union (AU) with the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA) and the Association of African Sports Confederations (AASC).

Rabat – The 2019 World Car Free Day will take place on Sunday, September 22. In Morocco’s capital, Rabat, the NGO “Youth of the 21st Century” is launching a campaign to hold the city’s own Car Free Day.  The NGO, created by a group of young adults in December 2012 to discover and develop the potential of Moroccan youth, have named the campaign “Rabat, without my car.”  It is the third time that the NGO has brought awareness to Rabatis of the pollution challenges caused by urban transportation. Twice before, the NGO has run similar successful events. The campaign does not only aim to reduce air pollution but also to decrease noise and enhance quality of life in the city. Inhabitants of Morocco’s capital are invited to give up their cars on September 22, between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., and to use public transportation and bicycles instead.  The NGO, in collaboration with local authorities, will draw circuits where people can bike or walk freely without any car traffic. The organization invites those who choose not to participate in the event to avoid these predefined circuits. The event concerns all fuel-powered vehicles, except emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire trucks. Car Free Days are held on September 22 every year in many cities and countries around the globe. The event encourages motorists to give up their cars for a day. According to the Washington Post, the event “promotes the improvement of mass transit, cycling and walking, and the development of communities where jobs are closer to home and where shopping is within walking distance.”

Rabat – Local authorities in Marrakech’s old medina have intervened to destroy the house built in the middle of the ramparts. The house was built near the medina’s Bab Doukkala. The act came after Amel Mellakh, a researcher in tangible and intangible heritage, brought the matter to the public opinion. Mellakh took to her Facebook to post photos showing a part of the rampart being destroyed to build a house.  On Friday, August 23, the local authorities responded to the researcher’s call to action. Mellakh posted on Facebook pictures of the local authorities demolishing the house.  Mellakh thanked everyone for sharing the matter and showing support, particularly authorities who acted within less than 10 days. “I thank the friends, the actors of the civil society and the net surfers for their comments and the patriotic support, but also I thank the reactivity of the authorities of the Wilaya of Marrakech, for their welcome and for the work which provides for the rehabilitation of the medina,” Mellakh said. Marrakech-based news outlet Kech24 wrote about the house as early as 2014, according to Mellakh.  Mellakh recalled that the Wilaya of Marrakech has begun a “procedure of emptying buildings out, compensating residents, and proceed to the demolition.” In the pictures shared online, the house could be easily spotted as it is located on one of Marrakech’s main avenues. It was considered disrespectful to the city’s cultural heritage and wealth and detrimental to the rampart’s aesthetics. In her post on Facebook, Mellakh lauded the local authorities’ efforts and professionalism to revive the cultural heritage. For Mellakh, it is the responsibility of everyone to contribute to the preservation of the cultural heritage and the idea that it is the job of the elites and officials must be changed. “My wish is to introduce the ordinary citizen into the responsibility of preservation and to change the idea that it is just the elite and the administrative officials who must do it, it is our heritage and commitment to all of us,” she concluded.

Rabat- Maroc Telecom and the Moroccan government have signed a new MAD 10 billion investment convention as part of the government’s “proactive investment policy” to rehabilitate and develop the country’s telecom infrastructure. The agreement is aimed at furthering the telecom company’s outreach in a Moroccan telecommunication market in which it already sits comfortably at the top. In an announcement following the signing of the convention, both the government and the managing board of Maroc Telecom highlighted the agreement’s benefits for the society at large. The move will not only confirm the company’s status as the country’s most widely used network provider, but will also facilitate nationwide access to 4G and broadband connections. In addition to that, the announcement added, the bulk of the MAD 10 billion investment plan will go towards enhancing Moroccans’ telephone and internet experiences by facilitating access to a more reliable and faster network for regular phone calls and online activities. Another part of the fund is expected to go into expanding Maroc Telecom’s activities, which will in turn create job prospects for thousands of Moroccans, the announcement reassured. The previous investment conventions between the government and Maroc Telecom—five in total—amounted to MAD 68 billion. While the high figure may raise eyebrows among critics who have relentlessly complained over the years about the Moroccan government condoning Maroc Telecom’s tacit monopoly, the documents of the conventions make the point that the series of investments cannot be detached from their aim of improving most Moroccans’ experience with phone calls and internet connection. The company remains by far Morocco’s leading telecom organization, boasting almost half of the country’s telephone and broadband connections market. The move’s implicit counterargument against critics who view the investments as the government condoning monopoly is that Maroc Telecom’s total share of the Moroccan market—43.8%, is a testimony of the sizable number of Moroccans who will benefit from improved Maroc Telecom services. This, and the job creation aspect, appear to be the deal’s selling points, but it is to be seen whether the news will sit well with the other remaining percentage of Moroccans subscribed to other companies like Inwi, the second in Morocco’s telecom hierarchy and a virulent critic of its rival’s monopoly tendencies.

Rabat – In response to the latest rape allegation facing his already bruised reputation, Tariq Ramadan is categorical that the accusation is baseless and part of a further smear campaign. Months after being released on bail, facing multiple rape accusations, world renowned Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan is yet again grappling with a new rape allegation. The complainant, a journalist in her fifties, according to reports, has said that she has felt emboldened by the recent stories about Ramadan to break her silence about her experience with the scholar, French media reported yesterday, Sunday August 25. Ramadan was quick to reply, however. He suggested that the accusation was merely a ploy to further defame him, quelling the accusation and promising his social media followers that he will soon be telling a full account of the newest allegations. He aims to put to rest what he sees as yet another organized campaign to further tarnish his already suffering image. “Of course I have been told about the new elements of the investigation and the new complaint that has been abundantly covered by the press this Sunday August 25,” Ramadan wrote in a Facebook post. “Barely surprising,” he added, appearing to argue, as he has on multiple occasions in the past months, that both the ongoing investigations into the previous rape accusations and the latest complaint come from a place of resentment against his identity and his public visibility as a Muslim intellectual. “I will be speaking in the coming days to expose the facts with determination, clarity, and serenity—God willing,” concluded the short Facebook post. Ramadan’s latest alleged victim said that the incident happened on May 23, 2014 in a hotel room in the Sofitel Lyon. She had allegedly gone to the place for an interview with Ramadan, only to be reportedly raped by Ramadan and “one of his staff members.” “It happened very quickly and it was incredibly violent,” the woman was quoted in news stories as saying. She indicated that she wanted to come out and recount her “painful” experience. But, she explained, she was subsequently sent numerous threats from both Ramadan and his staff, telling her that going out with the story would be more ruinous to her than it would to Ramadan. “You do not know how powerful I am,” she recalled Ramadan as saying to her in the aftermath of the incident and in a bid to silence her. Previously, Ramadan was arrested on January 31 of last year after two women came out with rape accusations in late 2017 and filed complaints against him for sexual abuse and rape. He was then released on bail in November of last year after spending 10 months in detention. Ramadan has been adamant from the outset that all the allegations are politically, ideologically motivated.

Rabat – This morning I woke up to an English person’s nightmare – I put the kettle on, popped a Yorkshire tea bag in a mug, only to discover that there was no milk in the fridge. Fortunately, I live a stone’s throw from our local hanout or corner shop. I quickly got dressed, picked up the baby, and, closely followed by our little dog, pottered down the dirt track leading from our house, and round the corner to the hanout.  I should explain that I live in a hamlet outside Essaouira, so small that it has no official name. It is populated by a few local families who have owned and lived on the land for generations, along with a growing community of expats who rent palatial villas down much longer dirt tracks than mine.  As I approached the hanout, a car swerved in front of me, causing dust to rise into the air temporarily blinding me. The 4×4 approached so fast that it almost mowed down the puppy, who had run on ahead. Protective Mamma-bear fury rising within me, I strode towards the car door ready for a fight but was somewhat deflated when the driver didn’t even notice I was there. Out of the large car stepped an elderly European man, who walked off, oblivious of the effect he was having on me. I set off in hot pursuit.  The European man arrived at the hanout just before me, and, without so much as a bonjour, barked his orders at the man behind the counter. The proprietor was already serving a Moroccan man who was first in the queue, and behind him were at least two women waiting to buy their morning bread. The assembled crowd looked at the new arrival askance. The proprietor diplomatically responded with a nod but continued to serve the customers already waiting. When his turn finally came, the elderly Frenchman, visibly irritated, complained about how long he had waited.  At last, it was my turn to place my order. After the necessary greetings, the proprietor apologized to me for the wait. I had only waited for three or four minutes. As I walked home, I wondered what had prompted him to apologize. Did he think that I, like the Frenchman, minded having to wait my turn behind Moroccans?  Later, in an idle moment, I found myself skim reading my Facebook feed and saw a post on a page for expats in Essaouira. The ‘conversation starter’ post in French read “Good morning, subject for discussion, the role of foreigners in the development of our town.” The post had piqued my interest so I clicked on the comments. One ‘expat’ wrote, “changing mentalities and lifestyles.” Another suggested “initiatives about lifestyle, like cleanliness and respect for the environment.” However, one French Essaouira resident commented, “it is not our town to develop.” As an ‘expat,’ or immigrant, in Morocco, I have always tried to integrate, to adapt to the society I live in. I am still struggling to learn Darija, and insist on drinking English tea in my own home, but I hope that, to some extent at least, my efforts have paid off.  This said, used to living in European countries, I have to admit to finding some aspects of life in Morocco frustrating – recycling, waste management, time management, the education system, strangers giving unsolicited advice on how to dress or bring up my child, and couscous, to name but a few – but, as someone who has chosen to live in this country, I would not want to impose my own cultural sensibilities on Moroccans. Except possibly on my husband… Both the early morning incident with the grumpy Frenchman and the online discussion, led me to wonder, what is the role of foreigners living in Morocco? And, perhaps more importantly, what do Moroccans think of us? I started by asking the two Moroccans closest to me; my 5-month-old son giggled, but my husband had some more relevant input. He explained to me that the land we live on has been changed immeasurably by the influx of French residents. Little by little, since the 1970s more and more expats have moved to the countryside outside Essaouira. Before they came, the land was worth next to nothing and the people who owned it were very poor. Now, with the popularisation of Essaouira as a destination for expats, the land is worth much, much more. The landowners are now in a position to sell, build, and rent.  Some close neighbors, for example, rent out their villa to an expat and live on the profits so their lifestyle has been immeasurably changed by the influx of European expats. The two hanouts and the butcher’s shop that serve the area would not remain open without the custom of the European residents. So from an economic point of view, the expats have a positive impact on the region.  According to the Wall Street Journal, in 2016 a two-bedroom villa in our village costs, on average, MAD 4000 a month to rent. Over the past two years, prices have further increased. The rent from a villa near Essaouira, therefore, would make a significant difference to a  Moroccan family, who own their own home and have a private water source. However, a 2002 research report on ‘the windy city’ found that land and real estate prices in the region continue to rise. “For instance, eight years ago, it was still possible to buy a nice spacious house for €10,000. Nowadays, a small house, which is in need of repair, costs approx. €30,000 or more, and there seems to be no end in sight for the upward spiral of prices.” Since the report was published, prices have risen even higher, prohibitively so for local Moroccan families. Later, sitting in a little cafe in the medina, I asked some coffee-drinkers what they thought of the expats living in their community.  Mohammed, 42, who works as an events planner, said that the economic value of European residents is a two-edged sword. “European tourists avoid our hotels now so the hotels are firing their workers as they can’t afford to stay open. Foreign tourists prefer to go to stay in European – owned riads or Airbnbs owned by French or English expats,” he explained. “Yes, of course they bring money, but they are taking it away from Moroccan owners too.” He explained to me that this is becoming an issue across Morocco, with the payments usually going directly from one European bank account to another, and not, in fact, contributing to Morocco’s economy. I must admit that even my parents when they have come to Essaouira have rented a riad from British expats, and I had never before considered the impact this choice had on the local economy, only thinking of the elegance and comfort of the lovely riad. Zahra, 27, the cafe’s waitress brought over a pistachio milkshake. I asked her what she thought. “The tourists and the French people who live here, they want Essaouira to be like Europe, they want to eat European food, and tell us how to live.” I felt a certain amount of guilt as I sipped my Italian drink and looked with distaste at the cigarettes of the two Moroccan men smoking in close proximity to me. However, I was cheered up by the response I got from Samir, a 52-year-old spice vendor. “Most of the expats in Essaouira are so nice. They live here like us, it’s their town too. They do Moroccan stuff, and they do European stuff. It’s normal.”  “Sure, some people are rude, but some Moroccans are rude,” he added. Talking to Samir definitely made me feel less worried about my ‘expat’ status. Perhaps thinking about ourselves as all members of the same community rather than ‘us and them,’ is what makes the difference.  Finally, I asked Hussein, 38, who sells fish in the port. “I love how diverse our city is” he said. “There are French, English, German, Moroccan, Spanish all living here. I love to chat with them and to hear their experiences and ideas. Diversity is good. We can learn a lot from them.”  The mixed responses didn’t entirely resolve my internal debate, and I am still feeling more than a little embarrassed about being classed in the same category as the angry man from the hanout. I must now decide how, as an immigrant in a diverse, tourist town, I can both retain my own culture and respectfully integrate into the society in which I have chosen to live. I suspect it will never be straightforward to get the balance right, but I am sure it’s healthy to have the debate.

Rabat – Based on intel provided by the services of the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST), the National Judicial Police Brigade (BNPJ) arrested the suspect on August 23. The suspect holds an Israeli passport. The criminal police suspected that the individual was closely linked to a criminal network involved in the falsification of Moroccan IDs and passports. The network, dismantled on March 21, included 5 Israeli passport-holders. According to a statement from the Directorate General of National Security (DGSN), the 52-year-old suspect may have obtained a Moroccan ID and passport using false documents via the services of the dismantled criminal network. After checking the International Criminal Police Organization’s (Interpol) database, Moroccan police discovered that the suspect was the subject of an international arrest warrant under a red notice issued by Interpol on January 17,  2019.  The suspect was involved in several murders as well as an attempted murder in settling accounts between organized crime networks, says the DGSN statement. The suspect was placed in police custody under the supervision of the public prosecutor’s office. The investigation to determine all the circumstances of the case is ongoing.

Rabat – Members of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) and Moroccan customs managed to size 92 kilograms of cannabis resin during the operation on August 25. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) said that the value of the drugs seized is estimated at MAD 920,000.  Police seized the cannabis on a commercial vehicle registered abroad, customs told MAP. Search operations led to the seizure of the drugs, which were carefully hidden at the ceiling of the vehicle. Police arrested a Moroccan living abroad in connection with the operation. The suspect will remain in custody pending further investigation to determine the circumstances of the drug trafficking operation. The operation is part of Morocco’s crackdowns against drug trafficking. Moroccan customs said in a report in May that they seized 19.2 tons of cannabis resin in 2018, 14.7 tons less than the number of cannabis resin seized in 2017 (33.7 tons). The administration added that its agents carried out several crackdowns in 2018, including one operation where 240 kilograms of cannabis resin had been concealed inside orange juice cartons.

Rabat – In an interview earlier today with MAP, Morocco’s state-run news outlet, Katsuhiko Takahashi, the chief of the MENA division of the Japanese foreign affairs ministry, reaffirmed his country’s “constant and immutable” support for the UN agenda in the Western Sahara diplomatic stalemate. To the question of whether Japan identifies with the Polisario Front’s separatist agenda, the Japanese diplomat was particularly insistent that his country does not recognize the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) and has “no intention of changing” its position. In October 2018, Japan made headlines in the Moroccan media for the Asian giant’s perceived solidarity with the Polisario Front’s self-determination aspirations for Western Sahara. The media controversy revolved around the presence of a “high-ranking Polisario delegation” at the Tokyo International Conference of Africa’s Development (TICAD) meeting. Takahashi’s interview with MAP comes as Japan prepares to host this year’s iteration of the TICAD forum scheduled to run from August 28-30, and the contention around last year’s forum was particularly topical. In response to any perceived Japanese sympathy for the Polisario agenda, however, the Japanese official was adamant that his country is a strong Moroccan ally and has never been receptive of the front’s separatist aspirations. “Japan does not recognize Western Sahara as a state. This is Japan’s constant and immutable position and we have no intention of changing it,” Takahashi said when asked about Tokyo’s relationship with the Polisario Front. He added: “For Japan, this question [Western Sahara] should be resolved in a peaceful way through dialogue between concerned parties. Japan continues to support the UN’s mediation efforts.” On the Morocco-Japan relations, the Japanese diplomat stressed “Morocco’s important role” in the MENA region. He said Morocco’s significance for stability and development in its region is part of the North African country’s appeal to its Japanese partners. “Japan greatly values its partnership with Morocco,” Takahashi said as he recalled Morocco’s unique status in international exchanges as “a gateway to Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.” Morocco is currently home to 69 Japanese companies, and Takahashi expects the number to increase in the coming years. The upward trend in the Morocco-Japan commercial and diplomatic connections, he argued, is rooted in the “geographic advantage” Morocco offers as a gateway to three continents as well its “economic potential” as a regional and continental investment hub. Takahashi’s comments on Japan’s Western Sahara stance come as a further instance of the perceptible desire among Japanese diplomats to bury last year’s controversy and salvage the country’s strategic relationship with Morocco. Tokyo views cementing its ties to Rabat as a not-to-miss opportunity to position itself in what some observers are calling “the second scramble for Africa.” Earlier this month, Takuji Hanatani, Japan’s ambassador to Morocco, also highlighted the “importance Japan attaches to its friendship with Morocco” by reiterating Tokyo’s wish to distance itself from reports of Japan’s recognition of the Polisario-claimed Republic. Like Takahashi, Ambassador Hanatani said that Japan “has never supported or recognized” Polisario’s statehood claims, while its support for the UN-led settlement imitative and Morocco’s proposal has “always been constant and unchanged.”

Rabat – The Minister of Health, Anas Doukkali, reassured citizens that Levothyrox is back to the Moroccan market in large and sufficient quantities. Doukkali told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) on Friday 23 that the market has been flooded with “a significant and sufficient amount” of the medicine. He said that the ministry injected pharmacies with 240,000 new boxes of the medicine in addition to the more 500,000 imported between July 15 and August 8.  In July, the Ministry of Health said that it recorded a stockout of the medicine, which has no alternative substitute. It said that the medicine is subject to “rigorous control. The ministry is expecting 500,000  boxes of the medicine by the end of August, and another 700,000 boxes in September. Morocco will also receive 400,000 boxes of the medicine in November to meet the needs of consumers. The minister said that his department will closely monitor the “distribution of the medicines in all pharmacies” across Morocco to avoid issues. He explained that the lack of the medicine in June was due to the increased demand from a number of patients to buy the drug in large quantities, which exceeds their monthly needs. The decision to buy large quantities was after the announcement of a shortage in themedicine.  The price of the medicine does not exceed MAD 25 per box.

Rabat – Morocco’s increasingly visible identity as a genuine advocate of South-South diplomacy and the imperative of furthering the perceptibly strong bilateral relations were at the center of a recent meeting between the Moroccan Ambassador to Peru, Amin Chaoudri, and Pedro Olaechea, the speaker of Peruvian Congress. Meeting in Lima, Peru’s capital, on Friday, August 23, the two officials highlighted the “serious” steps both of their countries have taken in recent years and months to cement bilateral ties on a wide range of issues, from security to education to cultural and commercial exchanges. The Moroccan diplomat later told MAP, Morocco’s official news outlet, that the meeting was a “perfect illustration” of the new dynamics in the diplomatic overtures between Morocco and Peru. Since King Mohammed VI’s “historic” trip to the South American country back in 2004, Ambassador Chaoudri explained, the bilateral relationship has gone through positive experiences which have lately culminated in the establishment of a committee on Morocco-Peru friendship. As a firm believer in the necessity of South-South Cooperation, the Moroccan ambassador elaborated, Morocco is poised to advance its relationship with Peru to a much higher level. This, he argued, will be achieved “on the basis of a strong friendship, mutual trust, as well as shared values” in the service of promoting the South-South momentum in global affairs. Olaechea, the Peruvian MP, was as enthusiastic as the Moroccan diplomat when speaking about the long term implications of the strong-looking Morocco-Peru ties. Like the Moroccan diplomat, the South American official spoke at length about the need of countries in the Global South, also called third world or developing countries, to continue building bridges of political and cultural cooperation “to face common challenges at both the regional and global levels.” Speaker Olaechea underscored Morocco’s political reforms and its forward-looking foreign policy, saying that Morocco’s increased visibility in African affairs and South-South circles makes the North African country a reliable and “sought after” partner for Peru and any other country interested in Africa and South-South affairs. During their meeting, the two officials spoke about the political impasse in Western Sahara and Morocco’s proposal—the 2007 Autonomy Plan—to end the decades-long conflict between Rabat and the separatist Polisario Front. On that front, the Peruvian speaker reiterated his country’s stance by saluting the UN-led political process and praising Morocco’s proposal for a sustainable, politically negotiated, and mutually acceptable solution. Peru is part of the new cohort of South American countries that have recently expressed their wholehearted support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan at the expense of their traditional Marxism-inspired solidarity with the Polisario Front. The rupture has brought to light what many observers have called Morocco’s “pro-active diplomacy” on the Western Sahara question. Instead of the reactionary approach of perceiving pro-Polisario countries as “enemies” of Morocco’s territorial integrity, the North African country has in recent years proceeded by engaging them and underscoring the positive implications of its proposal for stability and development in the disputed territories. In May, the Peruvian Council of Solidarity with Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), which has until recently been a fierce advocate for self-determination and independence in Western Sahara, announced that self-determination was no longer a viable, feasible pathway towards a lasting settlement to the territorial conflict. In light of UN Resolution 2468 and other developments in the Western Sahara issue over the past months and years, the Peruvian group stressed in its statement, the separatist camp’s agenda is “neither realistic nor pragmatic and does not respond to a mutually acceptable solution.”

Rabat – On Saturday, August 24, Moroccan security services arrested  an Israeli prisoner who escaped house arrest in October 2018. Identified as Golan Avitan, the prisoner was involved in the killing of three people in a mob bombing in Tel Aviv. The incident happened 15 years ago, when the suspect allegedly organized a criminal attack that killed three and injured a dozen other people in 2003. Avitan was given house arrest for the incident after he turned down a plea deal that would have seen him serve nine years in prison, instead of significantly longer time on house arrest. Police, according to the Times of Israel, arrested Avitan in a Casablanca Synagogue. He was in the synagogue to meet with his children who came from Israel to visit him in Morocco. Morocco’s official news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) has not reported on the arrest of the Israeli prisoner yet.

Rabat – Six Hirak detainees, including their leader Nasser Zefzafi, have announced their intention to renounce their Moroccan citizenship. The detainees conveyed their decision to the public through a letter read by the father of Nasser Zefzafi, Ahmed Zefzafi, on August 23. The signatories of the letter said that they are also willing to break their “bonds of allegiance” to the kingdom. The signatories include detainees such as Nasser Zefzafi and Nabil Ahmjik, who are serving  20 years in prison. The sentences, according to the detainees,  are “reprisals due to their political views and potions.” The signatories of the letter said they wrote it in “their right mind.” The announcement has caused a divide among Moroccan internet users. While some Moroccan Facebook users supported the move, others described itas “foolish”. Lawyer Mohamed El Haini said in a Facebook post: “At a time when everyone was seeking a pardon for the detainees to close the case (…) we are surprised by the decision to renounce citizenship. This unexpected decision could cause escalation and [further] escalate the crisis.” Moroccan law stipulates that a Moroccan citizen cannot voluntarily renounce his or her citizenship. It is the government’s decision to drop someone’s citizenship in case of a  serious criminal act. “Instead of convincing the detainees to ask for amnesty as the only constitutional solution remaining  to close the dossier, there are those who do not want the best for [the detainees].”  He added that such a decision will not only “harm the detainees, but also the [evil] advisers who propose such a sickening and legally invalid steps.” In 2018, 54 Hirak activists were convicted of “threatening state security” following their participation in the 2016-17 Hirak Rif protests in Al Hoceima. The massive demonstrations were sparked by the death of Mohcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was killed in a garbage truck while trying to retrieve his confiscated fish in October 2016. The Hirak detainees appealed the sentences against them, but the Casablanca Court of Appeal upheld the prison sentences against them in April.

Rabat – Jean Paul Carteron, the founder and honorary chairman of the Crans Montana Forum, has heaped praise on Morocco’s new development model, describing it as King Mohammed VI’s “revolutionary” gift to Moroccans. Carteron, who was speaking in response to King Mohammed VI’s “the Revolution of the King and the People” speech on August 20, said that Morocco under Mohammed VI has established itself as a thriving market, a country on the march, and an example of development and stability in its region. Carteron emphatically spoke about King Mohammed VI’s own personal investment in curbing the tide of socio-economic disparities. The country’s new development model, he argued, is a new, “revolutionary” social contract “gifted” to it by a “courageous” and “determined” King. While some Moroccans may have been unsettled by the pace of the “disruptive” industrial transformations their country has witnessed of late, Carteron argued, the King is offering them a new social contract built on inclusiveness and public accountability. “The new contract takes into account the concerns of the vital forces of the private sector, political formations and trade unions, as well as those of all citizens,” he said. Throughout the interview, the businessman consistently presented the King as a visionary and a listener. “The King feels the pace of events, anticipates them, and opens up new avenues every day. It is this vision, courage, and determination that ensure a brilliant and promising future” for Morocco. Going back to the August 20 speech, he highlighted that social inequalities and lack of economic opportunities for large swaths of Moroccan populations have been at the center of many of the King’s speeches and policy recommendations. Like many of his most recent speeches, the King’s address to the nation on August 20 was in many regards a call for collective efforts when it comes to rising to the daily challenges facing the country. For Carteron, the most salient message from the address came “when the King said that the country’s issues should be faced in an inclusive and participative approach that guarantees the implication of all citizens.” As the chairman of the Crans Montana Forum, an international political and investment platform Morocco has deftly used over the years to highlight its development efforts in its southern provinces, especially in Dakhla where the last two editions were held, Carteron said that Morocco’s “determination” to go forward should bring positive messages to both Moroccans and other countries in the region.

Rabat – Separatist Sahrawis have launched an online war against Morocco and its media to challenge reports that condemn the inhumane situation suffered by Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps in Algeria. Pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara said that separatists have launched the online campaign to defend their cause. Members of the group call themselves an “electronic army” whose main task consists in sharing “photos, videos, and documents” to control the narrative and counterbalance Morocco’s rhetoric on the conflict.  The self-styled online army seeks to “clarify the facts to the world through intensifying comments on posts that incorrectly address the Sahrawi case or adopt the Moroccan narrative.” The move comes as an attempt to cover up a series of violations in the camps as some pro-Polisario news outlets published a number of reports about the Polisario Front’s arbitrary arrests of opposition activists. Recently, Futuro Sahara has published a series of articles about struggle of Sahrawi families due to the arbitrary arrest of their relatives. In June, the Polisario Front launched a crackdown against protests aimed at condemning violations in the camps. Subsequently, the front arrested Moulay Aba Bouzid, Fadel Braka, and Mahmoud Zidane, who are still in detention without  trial. Human Rights Watch and the Peruvian Council of Solidarity with Sahrawi People have condemned the arrest of the activists, who have been detained since June. According to the council, the three Sahrawis are “subject to harassment and intimidation.”   The three activists have been “unjustly accused of alleged criminal acts and treason,” charges that could lead to serious sentences, including the death penalty.

Rabat – Moroccan athlete Soufiane El Bakkali took home the victory from the Paris Diamond League’s 3000m steeplechase, a race which includes hurdles and water jumps, on Saturday, August 25. El Bakkali injured his foot during the race and blood could be seen seeping through his shoes, but that didn’t stop him from being the first to cross the finish line. Tweets by iaaforg The win “at a cost, as he limped away with blood all over his shoe after being badly spiked in a race,” said International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) who organizes the diamond league. El Bakkali was also faced by tough competition, with accomplished athletes such as Ethiopia’s Lamecha Girma and Kenya’s Benjamin Kigen coming in 2nd and 3rd place behind him. He finished the obstacle race with a total time of 8:06.54, whereas Kigen clocked in at 8:07.09, and Girma at 8:08.63. The win adds to El Bakkali’s already long list of athletic achievements at just 23. In 2016, El Bakkali represented Morocco at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, coming 4th in the men’s 3000m steeplechase, his specialty. He placed first in the steeplechase at the Mediterranean Games held in Spain in 2018, and 2nd in the African Championships in Nigeria. Just this summer, El Bakkali won the men’s 3000m steeplechase championship in Monaco on Friday, July 12, clocking in a time of 8:04:82. It marked his second time winning the competition, having won in 2018 as well, although he failed to break his record from last year of 7:58:15.

Rabat – Prominent Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan has again been accused of rape, with a second woman issuing a complaint. A fifty-year-old radio journalist claimed that Ramadan, along with a member of his staff,  raped her during a meeting for an interview on May 23, 2014, in a hotel room in Sofitel Lyon, according to French news outlet Le Point. “It happened very quickly,  and it was an incredibly violent,” the complainant said. She alleges that both men raped her several times. When she threatened to file a complaint against Ramadan, the Islamic scholar allegedly said, “You do not know how powerful I am.” The complainant claimed that she received a message from Ramadan in January, two months after his release. She says that she did not reply to his message. She added that the two men visited her and told her in person that Ramadan tried to reach out to her. “[They said] if I had ill-intentioned ideas they could fix that.” Since February, the prominent Islamic scholar has been facing charges of sexual assault and rape in France and Switzerland. He was released on bail in November 2018 after he spent nearly ten months in prison. Ramadan has denied all accusations against him, emphasizing that he will remain in France to defend his “honor.” “I would like you to make your decision from your conscience, not because my name is Tariq Ramadan and I’m demonised in this country,” he said in November. Ramadan’s lawyer Emmanuel Marsigny said that his client’s release shows that all rape accusations are “lies.” In February,  Ramadan decided to file a lawsuit against his accusers, claiming that their claims amount to defamation. In  October 2017,  feminist activist Henda Ayari, published a tweet claiming that Ramadan is her aggressor.  However, Ayari’s narrative has changed numerous times throughout the investigation, which cast doubts on the circumstances of the case and the allegations against Ramadan.

Rabat – Friday is Jamila Bakkari’s favorite day of the week. Not because it signals the upcoming weekend, but rather because she gets to spend the morning carrying out one of Morocco’s cherished traditions: preparing couscous. Jamila has been making traditional Moroccan couscous since the age of 14. Every Friday morning, she and her seven sisters would help their mother and grandmother cook the massive meal for their large family. Jamila began helping by washing vegetables, but she was later appointed to managing the meat. Having learned each detail of the craft for years, she had no issues assembling the meal for the first time on her own when she got married. In most cultures, women are often tasked with continuing the valuable traditions, crafts, and legacies that compose the foundations of a society. The Moroccan tradition of Friday couscous is no exception to this rule. Each Friday, mothers, grandmothers, wives, sisters, and daughters around the country spend up to three hours preparing a family meal that will be devoured in less than fifteen minutes. While some women may find the task exhausting, Jamila absolutely adores this tradition and the role she plays in its preservation. Not only is the finished product delicious, the memories she associates with preparing and eating couscous are close to her heart. “Couscous has always given me the chance to spend time with my family,” she says. “I grew up with seven sisters and two brothers. My brothers never helped with cooking,” she laughs. “They didn’t care.” “My sisters and I would take turns helping our mother and grandmother cook during the week, but on Friday mornings we all had to be in the kitchen.” “It wasn’t a chore for me,” she recalls fondly. “I loved every minute of it. We always laughed and had a great time.” Several decades later, Jamila prepares the dish by herself. She doesn’t mind these moments of solitude, though, as she enjoys looking out the large windows of her kitchen at the people bustling around the mosque across the busy street. While she waits for the ingredients to cook, she chats with her friends on WhatsApp and watches TV with her husband. At this point in her life, Friday couscous is more important than ever. It guarantees her time with her family, as her oldest son has moved out and her youngest is usually working or busy with his friends. On Fridays, however, it’s hshuma–shameful–for anyone to be absent from the midday meal. The sweet variant of Moroccan couscous, tfaya, is usually prepared for special occasions. In the Bakkari household, however, this delightful dish is served regularly. The process begins with the meat, which is cooked in boiling water. The meat used for this particular dish is sheep, left over from Eid al-Adha. While the meat is cooking, Jamila sautés onions, chickpeas, and raisins in a pan with oil. These ingredients are spiced with salt, black pepper, saffron, turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, and sugar. When the meat is fully cooked, Jamila mixes the broth with the sautéed onions, chickpeas, and raisins to form a delicious sauce, which is then left to simmer on the stove. Meanwhile, Jamila adds oil to the dry couscous before steaming it in the kiskas, which is a large two-part cooker. Jamila steams the couscous three separate times to achieve the perfect fluffy consistency. In between steams, she rehydrates the couscous. Across the street, hundreds are gathered at the mosque to pray, and the busy streets of Temara are suddenly calm. The quiet peace is quickly shattered as prayers end and worshippers swarm the street. The vendors lining the mosque begin shouting their prices. From the fifth-floor kitchen window, Jamila watches her husband and youngest son leave the mosque together. Her husband buys some fresh fruit for the family to eat after the meal. When the couscous is perfectly cooked, Jamila covers it with the sauce and tops it with meat. Jamila always times her cooking perfectly so that the dish is hot and ready to serve as soon as the men return home from prayer. Only a few minutes pass before the entire dish is cleared. In photos: vegetable couscous The process for cooking vegetable couscous is similar to that of tfaya. Jamila begins by boiling a whole chicken, which is seasoned with salt, black pepper, ginger, turmeric, saffron, parsley, and coriander. When the chicken is finished, she stews vegetables in the broth until they are tender. Jamila likes to use fresh pumpkin, carrots, cabbage, and potatoes for this couscous.   Other vegetables commonly used for this dish include turnips, sweet potatoes, beans, and zucchini or courgettes. The dry couscous is dressed with olive oil before heading to the kiskas. As always, Jamila steams the couscous three times. The cooked couscous is then soaked with the meat and vegetable stew and served. Every Friday, Jamila cooks enough couscous for six people, but only five of us gather around to enjoy the meal. The remaining portion is put into a separate dish and placed on a tray with some fruit. Jamila’s husband, Mohammed, brings the tray to a man who lives on the roof of the adjacent building. “He’s living there alone. He doesn’t have any family to cook for him or eat with him,” Mohammed says of their neighbor. “Eating couscous at a restaurant is too expensive to do every week.” “It’s important for us to include him, even if he’s not actually eating with us,” Jamila says. She has been cooking enough for him every Friday for two years. “Every Moroccan should be able to enjoy our traditions.” This statement underscores exactly how valuable the tradition of Friday couscous is in Morocco. The tradition, which has been passed down for generations, is preserved by people like Jamila and Mohammed, who remind us to value family, charity, and kindness–the Moroccan way.

Rabat – Students from 20 countries gathered in Benguerir on August 21 to participate in the launch of Solar Decathlon Africa (SDA). SDA “challenges collegiate teams to design, build and operate grid-connected, attractive and net-zero-energy houses during an eighteen-month period,” says the competition’s website. At the end of the competition, taking place between August and September 2019, teams assemble their modular houses in a solar village open to the public from September 13 to 27. The competition includes 20 teams from different African countries such as Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Senegal, and Tanzania. North African countries include Algeria, Egypt, and Morocco. Turkey, Germany, France, and South Africa have also sent competing teams. This year, students have until September 13 to build and assemble solar-powered houses. The houses have taken over a year to be designed. Teams will be evaluated on the basis of ten events, scored out of 100 each. The team accumulating the maximum of points on one thousand will be named the winner. Start of SDA  On November 15, 2016, the Moroccan Ministry of Energy, Mines and sustainable development; the Moroccan Research Institute in Solar Energy and New Energies (IRESEN); and the U.S. Department of Energy signed a memorandum of understanding.  The memorandum’s signature came following the international conference on climate COP22 in Marrakesh discussing the importance of renewable energy. The memorandum aimed to build collaboration between all parties for the development of Solar Decathlon AFRICA. According to SDA’s website, the competition was designed to “integrate unique local and regional characteristics while following the philosophy, principles, and model of the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon.” On January 30, 2019, UM6P and IRESEN kicked off the 1st African version of the international student competition for green buildings “Solar Decathlon Africa.”

Rabat – El Faro TV has released a video by showing a young Moroccan national climbing one of the Ceuta port buildings. The young man was trying to reach the roof before the port authorities noticed him and asked him to come down. On his way down, the individual can be heard saying, “I hate Morocco, I want to go to Spain.” The video shows two other individuals at a close distance, waving and watching him as he climbs down.  El Faro de Ceuta said, “the young Moroccan fellows departed from the scene looking for a new opportunity.” According to El Faro de Ceuta, the Port Authority of Ceuta is planning to close the openings near the maritime station. Immigrants use the gaps to reach the roof of the station and access the ships connecting Ceuta and Algeciras, says the Spanish daily. El Faro de Ceuta also reported that with the increasing pressure from undocumented migration, the port has become one of the places where immigrants take refuge awaiting an opportunity to reach Spain by boarding the ships. Morocco’s efforts to control the increasing pressure of irregular migration In collaboration with the EU, Morocco has launched significant initiatives and operations to manage and control the massive number of undocumented migrants attempting to cross to Spain via Morocco. Morocco’s migration and border control chief, Khalid Zerouali, said that Morocco’s strategy to curb undocumented migration has proved to be effective. In 2019, Moroccan authorities stopped 25,000 irregular migration attempts, up 30% compared to the same period in 2018.  Zerouali added that Moroccan authorities also cracked down on 50 irregular migrant trafficking networks active at both the local and international levels, “up 63% compared with a year earlier.” In April, Spanish news outlet ABC reported that the Spanish Ministry of the Interior noticed a 52% decline in the number of irregular migrants from April 2018 to April 2019. According to ABC, the number of aborted attempts in July alone represented a 70% decrease. Irregular migration attempts in Ceuta and Melilla also dropped.  ABC said that only 226 people managed to enter Spain through Ceuta and Melilla. In 2018, the number was 1,085.  Spanish measures to curb irregular migration In the face of the rising number of undocumented migrants attempting to enter Europe via Spain, the European country has turned to Morocco for help. Spain has granted Morocco financial aid as well as state-of-the-art equipment to support its efforts in curbing migration. Most recently, the Spanish government approved, on August 23,  €32 million to back Morocco’s efforts to curb irregular migration. The Spanish government previously approved a €26 million grant to Morocco’s Interior Ministry on July 5. The grant was part of the €140 million promised by the European Commission in the 2019 budget for the “Support for the integral management of borders and migration in Morocco” project. Morocco had earlier received €40 million from Spain as part of the European Commission’s grant. Spain and EU gave the grants to Morocco in order to purchase equipment, including a fleet of vehicles, to reinforce Morocco’s border control.  On the Spanish side, El Confidencial reported, in June 2019, that the Spanish ministry of interior replaced 41 DOMOS cameras and 11 fixed cameras, and installed 14 new technical cameras as well as a more modern CCTV control platform on the Ceuta border. The Spanish news outlet also indicated that the ministry intended to launch a new facial recognition system in both Ceuta and Melilla as a way to fast-track border control and increase security. Ceuta also planned to remove concertina wires, while Morocco started building its new wire fences.

Rabat – At just 17 of age, Mohammed Ihattaren is yet again at the center of a tussle between the Moroccan and Dutch football federations. Both countries are courting the services of the PSV Eindhoven prodigy. Mohammed Ihattaren, whose sustained brilliance with his club have recently earned him a solid reputation in football circles in the Netherlands, is now confirmed to be on the radars of both the Moroccan and Dutch national teams. This is in addition to being, at club level, a promising candidate for spots in some powerhouses of European football. Vahid Halilhodzic, the newly appointed Moroccan coach who is visibly in search of an effective, working formula to set afoot a refreshed, talented, and game-winning squad, has already named the PSV play-maker in his list of 49 names in consideration for a definite spot in the national squad. In recent tournaments, Morocco’s most recurrent shortcoming had to do with being clinical when suffocating the opposition, scoring goals to take advantage of its best moments in the game. Ihattaren is seen as a good addition to a Moroccan national squad in search of furthering its offensive line, sharpening its attacking prowess. But the Netherlands has no intention of letting go of Ihattaren. The young player has already been a contentious topic between the federations of Morocco and the Netherlands. Most recently, no sooner had Morocco’s Hallihozic named the young prodigy in his preselected squad than the Netherlands called call him up to be part of their U21 squad for a Euro qualifiers match against Cyprus on September 10. While Ihattaren by all evidence deserves the opportunity with the Netherlands’ U21, the move’s coincidence with Morocco’s pre-selection has sparked raucous debates. The incident has brought to light another tug-of-war between the two countries over Ajax star player Hakim Ziyech, who like Ihattaren was born and raised in the Netherlands and made his name as one of the country’s promising players. In light of Ziyech’s unexpected decision to play for Morocco even as he had every chance of making it to the Netherlands’ starting squad, the sudden move to counter the news of Morocco’s pre-selection has been taken to mean that the European country is ready to battle to prevent another Netherlands-nourished talent from choosing Morocco’s Atlas Lions. Despite the media fuss and the perceived Morocco-Netherlands tussle to secure his services, the player at the center of the tug-of-war appears to be gauging the pros and cons of both options before making his final decision. “I am much honored to have been preselected [by the Moroccan coach]. It is a beautiful feeling. But I will not make my decision now,” Ihattaren said recently when asked about the two offers.

Rabat – Chilling footage depicting a group of Gulf tourists posing with the more than 1400 quails they had killed in one day in Marrakech made the rounds on Moroccan social media earlier this week. The video elicited a wave of harsh criticism and indignation among Moroccans. Many described the act as “barbaric” and “sick.” Adding insult to injury, however, the preliminary findings of the official investigation into what has come to be known as the “bird massacre” have established that the Gulf hunters did not have a valid hunting license. Moroccan newspaper Al Massae reported in its weekend edition that the “bird massacre” issue took another interesting twist yesterday after authorities discovered that the Gulf tourists responsible for the “outrageous” killing of the quails did not actually have the authorization to hunt on Moroccan territory. According to the Moroccan paper, the Marrakech-based tourism agency which delivered the tourists their hunting license was not accredited for delivering such documents. Hunting and forestry associations vigorously condemned the sorry occurrence and urged the “competent authorities” in Marrakech, especially the city’s waters and forestry office to shed further light on the “structural dysfunction” and complacency that led to the “outrageous” killing of 1490 birds. In a statement summarizing the findings of the investigation, as well as the circumstances that led to the incident, the National Society for Hunting demanded that all those responsible for “this crime” be made accountable for their actions. The statement however, as to whether the Gulf businessmen or the illegal tourism agency that sold them the fake hunting license documents deserve to bear the brunt of the punishment. It simply emphasized that authorities take the issue very seriously and wish to “ensure that justice is done” to avoid a repeat of such an incident. Meanwhile, hunting professionals in the Marrakech area have demanded that the authorized tourism agency be severely punished for “this disgrace.” The series of denunciatory statements and calls for punishment all came with the hope that making an example of the tourism agency would be an effective deterrent for other agencies—authorized or not. The agencies often issue documents for foreign tourists to carry out activities in blithe disregard for the rights of livestock or the profound effects they may have on the environment. Others, including the national organization for water and forest management, urged the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and other competent bodies “to follow this affair until the end.”

By Yahia Hatim Rabat – Visitors and inhabitants of the city of Taif, 90 kilometers to the east of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, will be able to discover and enjoy Moroccan cuisine, crafts, and traditions in the Moroccan pavilion at Souk Okaz. The historical market dates to pre-Islamic times and has been recreated into a popular tourist destination.  Souk Okaz is one of the highlights of the Taif Season, lasting through the month of August, hosting shops that promote authentic local products from more than a dozen Arab countries. The Moroccan pavilion offers a range of cultural activities, including live music concerts every day from August 19 to 31.  There are 31 stores and stands offering Moroccan products, such as traditional clothing, ceramics, leather goods, sculptures, jewels, henna, olive oil, and argan oil. About 80 Moroccans are working the shops, said Al-Haj Abdul Ilah Al Rayes, who is in charge of the Moroccan pavilion in Souk Okaz.  The Moroccan pavilion also hosts a museum and a library with books written by famous Moroccan authors. As soon as visitors set foot in the Moroccan pavilion, a “guerrab,” a person who serves water in traditional metal cups from a special water container, welcomes them and offers them fresh water. Then, they can enjoy the talents of a calligrapher who writes words and sentences on demand, or listen to a “hakawati,” a storyteller, who narrates traditional legends and myths.   The pavilion also offers Moroccan cuisine. Restaurants serve traditional Moroccan dishes, including tajines in many forms—lamb and prunes, seafood with lemon, couscous or chicken with olives, pastilla, and harira soup. Visitors can also savor Moroccan mint tea, served with a collection of traditional Moroccan sweets. Visitors had different reactions after their visit to the Moroccan pavilion. An Egyptian visitor tweeted: “Moroccan pavilion is one of the best pavilions, especially the calligrapher who makes calligraphy for free and offers gifts. This man was very heartwarming.” Another visitor tweeted: “Moroccan pavilion is the worst, I prefer Tunisian and Jordanian ones” but refrained from explaining the strong view. كيداير الزين؟ لا باس عليك 🇲🇦🙄

Rabat – Alsa-City Bus aims to create 1,750 direct jobs with its set of new buses, which started operations in the Rabat region on Wednesday, August 21. The general director of Alsa-City Club, Alberto Perez, said that  the company will “create 1,750 direct jobs with the means we have set up.” He said that the new buses generate “positive feedback from users.” Perez added that 150 new generation buses were designed to meet environmental standards. The general director of the bus company added that the buses are equipped in accordance with international technical standards for safety and comfort. The new buses are equipped with four surveillance cameras per bus, air conditioners, and WI-FI access. The new buses replaced those provided by the transport company, Stareo.  A joint venture between Moroccan company City Bus and Spanish company Alsa, Alsa City won the tender in January 2018 to manage the Rabat-Sale public bus system.  The contract promises a MAD 10 billion investment into the bus transport system in the region (approximately $1.2 billion) over the next 15 years. The contract includes bringing over 300 new buses to Rabat-Sale.

Rabat – Plenty of people around the world have added Morocco to their list of dream destinations. Tons of other people can’t even locate it on a map–and don’t care to. For the people in between, who are on the fence about whether or not they should venture into the unfamiliar terrain of North Africa, here are ten reasons to visit Morocco.  Security The primary concern for many globetrotters is the assurance of safety in a given country.  Morocco is often referred to as “a good house in a bad neighborhood.” I personally would not recommend referring to the continent of Africa as a bad neighborhood, but perhaps the saying brings you some comfort. The primary takeaway is that Morocco is very safe for travelers.  The greatest threats tourists will face in Morocco are scammers, catcallers, and the occasional petty thief. Rumors of dangerous anti-Western sentiment have little basis. To my fellow women: no, you will not be stoned to death for revealing your shoulders or holding hands with someone of the opposite sex. And no, you don’t have to wear a hijab.  Tourists should follow the safety precautions they would take in any other country: keep your valuables where you can feel them, and don’t walk through busy areas with priceless goods in tow. If you tend to be a nervous or stressed traveler, there are dozens of top-rated travel agencies that will arrange your transportation, accommodation, and guides.  Hospitality and Accommodation I’m sure you’ve heard about Arab hospitality, so let me introduce you to something even better: Amazigh hospitality. You should expect to be treated with kindness throughout the entire country, but when visiting an area that proudly touts its Amazigh heritage, you will notice how warm and welcoming its residents are. The hotels and desert camps in the country’s south are especially top-rated.  Speaking of hotels, Morocco has some great options for accommodation that won’t break the bank. You will find beautiful riads, which are traditional houses, in every major city. Both modern and classic hotels are also available, as are cheap hostels for the more adventurous type.  You’ll have no trouble finding accommodation with pools, spas, gardens, restaurants, or fitness centers—though these luxuries will be reflected in the nightly room price.  No matter where you stay, you will surely note the gorgeous Moroccan decor.  Shopping Morocco’s famous souks make for an interesting shopping experience, to say the least.  Souks can be extremely crowded, noisy, and confusing. Be prepared to leave your comfort zone and watch out for pickpockets and scammers.  Don’t let these warnings scare you off—Moroccan souks are exciting and beautiful, and getting lost in the maze of colorful streets can be an extraordinary experience.  In big cities, there are sections of the souk that sell “exotic-looking” clothes, jewelry, accessories, and other wares that appeal to tourists. These areas are less crowded than the regular markets but significantly more expensive.  You will undoubtedly see grossly overpriced goods, from scarves to rugs to Argan oil. The city guides who take you to “authentic” craft co-ops make a commission from your purchases, so don’t expect them to help you haggle. I suggest reading up on others’ experiences in Morocco to get a grasp of what you should be paying for souvenirs, as well as food and other services. A trip to the souk is a worthwhile endeavor, even if you are too intimidated to actually buy anything. The colors, smells, and sounds of the bazaar will surely make for an unforgettable experience. Nature and Climate Don’t let the palm trees fool you—Morocco is not a tropical locale. It does, however, boast a temperate climate that can be enjoyed during any season.  Summer travelers should consider a stay along the Mediterranean or Atlantic coasts; Tangier and Essaouria are two particularly notable summer destinations. The further inland you go, the hotter you will be. You are advised to steer clear of the desert during the summer. Rain falls throughout most of Morocco from November to February, and coastal cities are particularly cold during this season—you won’t find a warm winter getaway here. On the bright side, the vegetation is in full bloom during the rainy season. Winter travelers will be amazed by the gorgeous flowers and foliage Morocco has to offer.  Winter conditions in the mountains are harsh but make for a great ski trip. There are several top-rated resorts to accommodate skiers in the Atlas Mountains. Morocco’s mountains are also a popular destination for hikers, rock climbers, and other adventure-tourists during the other seasons.   The diverse landscapes of Morocco include snowy cedar forests inhabited by Barbary Macaques, barren mountains with jaw-dropping views, lush oasis valleys, quiet desert dunes, sprawling beaches flanked by ancient fortified walls, and metropolitan cities looming over ancient medinas.  You will need at least two weeks to experience everything the country has to offer, but you can focus your efforts on the areas that pique your interest if you’re short on time.    History Morocco has an extraordinarily rich and diverse history. The presence of a Muslim kingdom in Morocco dates back to the year 789, while the indigenous Amazigh people have inhabited the land since prehistoric times.  Once home to major hubs in the Trans-Saharan trade route, Morocco was traversed by Mediterranean, Arab, Saharan, and Sub-Saharan communities.  You will find remnants of the Roman, Arab, and French presences throughout the kingdom. Less noticeable but equally as important are the legacies of the ancient Amazigh, Iberian, and Sephardic Jewish populations.   With several recognized UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Morocco is the perfect place for a history junkie. If you love old structures as much as I do, you will surely appreciate the massive coastal fortresses, crumbling oasis towns, and ancient medinas throughout the country.   Culture, Cuisine, and Crafts If you travel to Morocco in hopes of experiencing a foreign culture, you certainly won’t leave disappointed. There are boundless opportunities to immerse yourself in Morocco’s unique blend of African, Middle Eastern, European, and native Maghrebi influences.  Your experience in Morocco will be greatly enhanced by some pre-departure research. The native Imazighen are more than desert- and mountain-dwelling “Berbers.” The history, traditions, and grievances of Morocco’s indigenous people are worthy of thoughtful exploration. Wherever you travel in the country, you’ll be exposed to traditional food, drink, music, dance, art, and craftsmanship.  Try the famous mint tea and sample some Moroccan cookies, breads, and cakes. I highly recommend lbinyi (crunchy donuts with granulated sugar), spiced onion rghifa (a savory, doughy flatbread), and chebakia (fried pastries drenched in honey).  Morocco has a variety of traditional tajines, which are cooked using a method that is unique to North Africa. I love anything sweet, such as lamb and apricot or beef with prunes and almonds. A tajine of meatballs and eggs with bread makes a great breakfast, lunch, or dinner.   Friday afternoon couscous is a valued Moroccan tradition and a necessary culinary experience. Typical varieties include vegetable couscous and tfaya. I prefer tfaya, but that’s just my sweet tooth talking again.     In major tourist spots, meals are sometimes enhanced by traditional song and dance performances. Morocco’s diverse heritage influences its abundance of music varieties, such as Guedra (of the Tuaregs), Ahwash (of the High Atlas tribes), and Gnawa (named for the Maghrebi ethnic group). In the country’s famed medinas you will find skilled painters, weavers, tanners, blacksmiths, potters, carpenters, and welders. The impeccable craftsmanship of these artisans is captivating, and you will most likely be able to ship pieces home if you find you can’t live without them. Keep in mind that some cultural experiences you may encounter as a tourist are performances that have been exaggerated to indulge you. They are not necessarily falsified, but be careful not to let yourself be clouded by Orientalist fantasies. The dancing monkeys, fortune-tellers, and snake charmers you may have read about are simple theatrics—you’d be hard-pressed to find a Moroccan who affiliates them with his or her culture.  A successful trip to Morocco requires careful research and preparation, but don’t let this intimidate you.  Although it is still a developing country, Morocco presents a gorgeous getaway for families, couples, and solo adventurists. And with its decades-old tourism industry bolstered by a myriad of reputable travel agencies, the Kingdom of Morocco is secure, welcoming, and ready to host you.

Rabat – According to the Directorate of National Meteorology (DMN), the heatwave started on August 23 and will persist until the end of the week. Temperatures will gradually decrease by the start of next week. The areas of Sous, Tadla, El Haouz and Rhamna will face particularly high temperatures. In the central and southeastern regions, as well as the inland regions, temperatures will range between 41 and 47 degrees. As for coastal areas, temperatures will only reach between 28 and 33 degrees Celsius. Temperatures between 35 and 40 degrees Celsius are forecast for other inland areas, especially the Atlantic plains, Chaouia, and eastern mountain slopes. The DMN attributed the high temperatures to the hot airwaves called “Chergui.” The dry and hot airwaves come from the Sahara desert, passing by the southern provinces to reach the center of the country. The DMN assured that this rise in temperatures is normal for this period of the year, occasionally witnessing hot airwaves. Temperatures will begin to decrease starting August 25, particularly for the Atlantic coast, while the rest of the regions are expected to see a gradual decline starting August 26, according to the DMN. The Directorate stressed the need to avoid sun exposure for long periods, especially from noon to 5 pm. It also urged the population to pay closer attention to the elderly and children and to drink plenty of fluids. The General Directorate of Civil Protection (DGPC) emphasized the necessity of emptying cars from gaseous materials, lighters, soft drinks, perfumes, and batteries in general. It also recommended people not to travel in the morning and to avoid overfilling tires. The DGPC also requested citizens provide water in their windows, around bushes, fences, farms to help thirsty birds, cats, and other animals.

Rabat – In 2018, the Moroccan real estate market saw a 4.8% increase in the number of transactions and stagnation of prices overall, according to the annual report of Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM). The residential assets sales increased by 3.3%, while land prices jumped by 8.7%, and those of assets for professional use by 9.6%. Prices remained steady for all three categories, said the report presented Monday, August 19, in Tetouan, before King Mohammed VI, by BAM governor Abdellatif Jouahri. Real estate prices in Marrakech fell by 5.3%– the largest decline since the introduction of the price index in 2006. Residential assets also fell by 2.5%, land by 7.2%, and assets for professional use by 1.4%. The number of transactions showed a downward trend which started in 2015, falling by 15.7%. All three categories recorded a decrease of 19.9%, 0.9%, and 37.6% respectively. In Casablanca, real estate prices increased by 1.3% overall, by 1.5% for residential, and 0.9% for land, while professional property depreciated by 1.2%. Real estate transactions in Casablanca declined by 3%. The decline was due to the 6.6% drop in residential sales. Land and business property transactions, however, increased by 8.6% and 16.7% respectively.  In Tangier, both prices and transactions improved with a rise of 16.3% in residential sales and 1.8% in prices.  In Rabat, prices rose by 3.6% after falling by 1.1% in 2017. There was a decline of 3.8% for residential, 8.5% for land, and 1% for professional use properties. Sales increased by 26.1% for residential and 25.8% for real estate, while those for professional property fell by 4.8%.

Rabat – Shortly before 5:30 am on a Thursday morning, Mohammed and Jamila Bakkari are woken by the call to prayer coming from the large mosque across the street from their Temara apartment.  After praying, the couple will either go back to sleep, get ready for the day, or go for a run with their friends. Today, they go back to sleep.  At 9 am, they wake up a second time. Mohammed showers and helps his wife prepare breakfast. They eat together and leave a portion for their youngest son, who is still sound asleep, before driving to Rabat with large reusable bags in tow. It’s time to do some shopping for tomorrow’s couscous.  Mohammed and Jamila, my future in-laws, arrive at my apartment in Mabella just after 10 am. Mabella is a small but lively neighborhood just outside the center of Morocco’s capital city. My fiancé and I meet his parents outside our building, and the four of us walk towards Mabella’s old quarter. It takes us less than three minutes to reach the souk.  The place is packed. Thursdays are popular shopping days, as families prefer to keep the ingredients for Friday’s couscous fresh. Ideally, shopping is finished before 1 pm so as to avoid the sweltering afternoon heat.  There are a few types of Moroccan couscous, but typical families most often prepare vegetable couscous topped with meat or chicken for Friday’s meal. It’s savory, filing, and inexpensive. The vegetables used in this dish can include tomatoes, cabbage, potatoes, turnips, carrots, chickpeas, courgettes, and pumpkin.   In a lot of Moroccan households, most of the family’s shopping is done by the woman of the house while the man is away at work.  The Bakkaris do this differently.  Jamila shops for household items, clothes, shoes, cleaning supplies, and toiletries. She knows where to go, who to trust, and precisely what these items are worth.  Mohammed is an expert at navigating Morocco’s food markets. He knows exactly how to determine the quality of the goods being sold and negotiate a fair price. He buys a lot of items in bulk through his connections with vendors, which helps him save money. Thanks to his flexible work schedule, Mohammed always makes sure his family has what they need.  Mohammed has never been to Mabella’s souk before, but the unfamiliarity of this marketplace doesn’t intimidate him. No matter where he goes, he never falls for a rip-off.  In order for Mohammed to secure a fair deal, though, my fiancé and I must walk ahead of his parents as they approach vegetable vendors and inquire about prices.   As a ghostly pale foreigner, I stick out like a sore thumb—especially in this neighborhood, where tourists seldom venture. Some merchants will see me and assume that the family I’m walking with is wealthy, thus prompting them to declare a higher price.  Although Moroccans are known for their bargaining skills and Mohammed is no exception, haggling quickly loses its charm in busy souks baking under the summer sun. In these conditions, arguing over prices can actually be quite exhausting, especially when you’re hauling around a cumbersome shopping bag. This problem is easily avoided. My fiancé and I simply have to appear as though we’re not with his parents.  After a vendor gives his price and Mohammed decides if it’s fair, he calls Jamila over to help him pick out the produce. They can tell which veggies are good just by touching them.  The Bakkari’s key to saving money in the souk is patience and teamwork. When the couple goes shopping together, they’re a force to be reckoned with.  In Mabella’s souk, Mohammed and Jamila act as a team. My fiancé and I watch as his parents split up and visit multiple sellers of the same product to compare prices and the quality of the goods. When they reconvene, the couple determines which vendor has the best deal.  Rarely do they settle on the very first price they’re offered.  Throughout their more familiar stomping grounds in Temara, Mohammed and Jamila have established friendships with the merchants offering the best quality of goods. Although some top vendors are stationed quite far from home, the trip there is well worth it.  In some cases, Mohammed uses different criteria to manage his purchases.  “Even if they don’t have the lowest price, I support them because they are kind to me,” he says of his favorite merchants. “Character means more to me than money. I prefer to buy from people with good hearts.” In Mabella’s souk, however, he has to make his purchases based on quality and price.  For tomorrow’s couscous, he needs pumpkin, cabbage, carrots, and potatoes. While we’re here, he also wants to pick up onions, tomatoes, peppers, pears, and mangoes. He will buy the chicken for the couscous closer to home to ensure it isn’t tainted during the journey back to Temara.  Luckily, we have four pairs of hands to carry all these goods.  We head back to the apartment and prepare a meatball tagine for lunch. Mohammed and Jamila drive home after two hours of eating, chatting, and cleaning.  This laborious Thursday morning is somewhat unusual for Mohammed and Jamila, as Jamila usually prepares tfaya on Friday’s.  Tfaya is a sweeter variant of couscous made with caramelized onions, raisins, chickpeas, almonds, and meat or chicken. Mohammed buys the dry ingredients in bulk at the beginning of each month, so he only needs to buy the meat and onions for the dish every week.  Although the vegetable couscous is made with fresher and more plentiful ingredients, the raisins and almonds used in tfaya can rack up a steep bill. Consequently, tfaya is usually only prepared for special occasions and family gatherings. While it may be more expensive than the vegetable couscous, it is easier to serve to large crowds. Regardless of which type of couscous being prepared, gathering the ingredients is a universal Moroccan experience requiring patience, bargaining skills, and a sturdy bag.  But this is, in fact, a labor of love. While the moments spent enjoying the flavors of the dish may be fleeting, the memories of shopping, cooking, and eating with family should be cherished.

Rabat – The Spanish acting government approved on Friday, August 23,  €32 Million to back Morocco’s efforts to curb irregular migration. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the latest grant seeks to “support efforts made by the Moroccan authorities to fight against irregular immigration, smuggling of migrants, and human trafficking.” Spain, added MAP, believes that shared responsibility is necessary to fight the irregular migration flows. The aid is on top of another grant of  €26 Million approved by the Spanish government on July 5. Spanish activism in favor of Morocco’s government at the European Union also led to the approval of a €140 million grant. Khalid Zerouali, director of immigration and border surveillance at the Moroccan Ministry of the Interior believes that “the €140 million is a start; it will not fix the problem, but it is a welcome gesture.”  “We also intend to work bilaterally with Spain and Europe in a long-term program,” he added in an interview published earlier this month by  Eldiario.es. Both countries faced pressure due to the border crisis. The migration surge also urged Spain to supply Morocco with equipment such as radars, vehicles, and 15 drones to help improve migration control, reported Malaga Hoy on August 12. In July, Zerouali said that Morocco has foiled more than 40,300 irregular migration attempts since January 2019. Zerouali said that the number of foiled irregular migration attempts represent a 25% increase from the same period of 2018.

Rabat – Morocco World News sat down to talk with up-and-coming actor, Brice El Glaoui Bexter, about his soon to be released film Redemption Day, what’s next for cinema in Morocco, and how being raised by an iconic Moroccan artist made him who he is today. Redemption Day, currently in post-production and awaiting release in 2020, is a harmonious collaboration between Hollywood and Morocco’s cinema industry and marks a step forward for Brice’s career. Brice plays the role of Younes Laalej, a BCIJ officer who teams up with a US marine to rescue an archeologist captured by terrorists in Morocco. The BCIJ stands for Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation and is well-respected internationally for its counterterrorism efforts. The film, by Moroccan director Hicham Hajji with mostly Hollywood actors, gives center stage in Morocco in an unprecedented way. Not only using its scenery as a backdrop supposed to represent Syria or Afghanistan, the film makes Morocco a key part of the story, as well as highlighting the BCIJ’s famed track record in combatting terrorism. Brice described filming the movie not only the best experience of his life, but also a very different experience from his previous films. “We were able to make the film a very ‘Hollywood Movie’ with all the A-listers in the cast,” he said. The film also stars Canadian actress Serinda Swan, known for her roles in Tron and Percy Jackson, both blockbuster films. Alongside her is Gary Dourdan, who made his name on the hugely popular show CSI. “Morocco was so much more involved in this project, because usually, production companies come to Morocco and co-produce just part of the movie and then the movie goes back to France, England or America,” Brice said. “But this movie, this movie belongs to Morocco. It was 80% filmed here, and 80% produced by private Moroccan investors as well,” he continued. “We had all these A-listers, but an entirely Moroccan crew.” The movie’s crew, composing mostly of Moroccans based in country’s cinema capital, Ouarzazate, gave a boost to the local industry, providing jobs for local film students breaking into the industry and giving them the chance to be on the crew of a major Hollywood film. “The movie was a step forward for a lot of people that got involved in the project, and definitely for Morocco as a whole because we’ve never produced a movie like this in Morocco or even the Arab world in general.” “The movie brought a lot of investment to Morocco itself. Since the King brought a tax rebate for foreign films in Morocco, it’s been a great incentive for more movies to be filmed in Morocco,” he said. Brice was referencing a 2016 finance law that makes foreign films eligible to receive 20% cash-back if its expenditures in Morocco are at least MAD 10 million and the film provides at least 18 days of work. “That incentive is bringing in 30 to 40 million euros a year to Morocco, and it has been great for the country,” he said. “It’s a win-win for everyone, it’s great for both Morocco’s economy, film producers and local talent.” “The Moroccans on set are very well paid, and it’s still much cheaper for producers than bringing in workers from overseas, they win by saving costs and we win by boosting the local film industry.” Brice again reiterated the film’s aim to put Morocco at the forefront, both by including a Moroccan crew and director and making Morocco a center plot point. “We’re putting Morocco back on its level, showing the way it is evolving positively at the moment,” he said. “In any action movie, the FBI or Interpol is at the forefront. But the director wanted to put out a different vision of Morocco, so we showcased the BCIJ.” “We love seeing Morocco in movies, but it’s always either depicted as Syria or a poor and struggling country, but Morocco is booming right now and the BCIJ is a superpower so we think now is the right time to be showcasing it,” Brice pointed out. ”We’re getting involved in international political matters, and the world has never been ready for such a movie.” “With globalization on the rise, the world is ready for different movies than they were 20 years ago when films were very focused on American issues. “ “That model is changing, and now viewers are ready for movies that offer a different palette with more cultures and people.” Brice added he hoped a multitude of viewers across the world will be able to “see a bit of themselves in this movie,” thanks to the multicultural cast and plot points. Although Brice has featured in big productions before, such as upcoming Australian adventure film Miss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears, Redemption Day is the biggest step forward in his career thus far, and he felt the pressure. “This is my biggest project yet, I play one of the lead roles, I’m probably the second most on-screen,” he said. “I feel like I’m also carrying a lot of weight, I have to deliver something good.” “Out of everyone in the cast, I was definitely the least experienced. They all have 25 to 30 years of experience in front of the camera.” Andy Garcia, for example, who Brice also shared the Redemption Day set with, broke into the acting scene in the late 70s and has since featured in iconic movies such as The Godfather and Oceans Eleven, the latter of which garnered him an Oscar nomination. “I had to work harder to get the results they get, but it was a great learning process to be able to do that with people who I watched when I was younger gave me a lot of confidence,” said Brice. “The first few weeks were definitely a little stressful, but everyone was so nice that I eased into it. Gary Dourdan especially was amazing, it was like having a big brother on set.” When asked what Brice what’s next in his career, he said he was hoping to move from Rabat, where he grew up, to Los Angeles, “the Mecca of Acting.” “But if I ever get there, it will always be thanks to Morocco, and for that, I will always be grateful,” Brice was quick to add. He said that no matter how much he travels, as he receives jobs from his agent in London, Paris, and Spain, one thing he loves is that so many of the films lead back to Morocco anyway as part of filming. “30% of the time, the international castings I get include Morocco as a film location, and I love that,” he asserted. Brice, who has an English sounding name thanks to his British father, has mixed European and Moroccan heritage but grew up in Rabat, surrounded by Moroccan culture, thanks to Hassan El Glaoui, his famous painter of a grandfather who raised him. Brice credits El Glaoui, one of the most iconic Moroccan artists of all time, for inspiring him to pursue his dream of acting. “He raised me since I was two years old, so he was more of a dad to me than a grandfather,” explained Brice.   “He taught me that it’s not just because you have a famous artist for a father that you get to be one too, but when you’re so close to someone who has succeeded in a very tough domain, it gives you a little more belief in the journey.” “Being so close to him made me believe that my dream was accessible. It was not an easy process by any means, but now, a few years later, I see my stubborn side that believed in my dreams so much paying off, and it’s all thanks to him,” Brice told MWN. “Being surrounded by someone whose work touched so many people and who was so applauded motivated me to do the same.” A year on from his grandfather’s death, his paintings continue to touch people in the way Brice mentioned. A 5-month exhibit of El Glaoui’s work at the National Museum of Mohammed VI just ended this month, and the exhibit saw over 30,00 people pass through its halls. “When you’re raised by such a person, your whole environment is very creative. That allowed us to never stop dreaming,” said Brice.

Rabat – Earlier this month, Brazil declared a state of emergency over the rising number of fires in the Amazon, and despite a worldwide outcry, the fires continue to burn. So far this year, almost 73,000 fires have been detected by Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE), with a sharp spike in July and August. The number is an 83% increase from last year. While some of these fires are naturally occurring events, Brazilian scientists believe that at least 50% of the fires are set by loggers and ranchers to clear land for cattle. Environmental agencies have attributed the spike in deliberate fire setting to Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro relaxing environmental policies and regulations in favor of economic growth. The Brazilian federal government has not provided any major organized effort to fight the fires, and on Thursday, August 22, Bolsonaro said the Brazilian government lacks the resources to fight the fires. Bolsonaro, a longtime climate change skeptic, has outrighted disputed the cause of the fires, instead claiming that environmental groups have purposely set the fires to make his government look bad. “On the question of burning in the Amazon, which in my opinion may have been initiated by NGOs because they lost money, what is the intention? To bring problems to Brazil,” the president told a steel industry congress in Brasilia. When asked if he had any evidence to back this claim, Bolsonaro said he had none – just a hunch. The Amazon rainforest is frequently referred to as the “Earth’s lungs,” thanks to the huge amount of carbon dioxide the rainforest absorbs to produce 20% of the world’s oxygen. If too much of the rainforest is destroyed past the point of return, carbon dioxide level’s in the atmosphere will rise significantly, causing the hole in the ozone layer to grow and climate change to worsen. People worldwide have expressed concerns over the fires and the possible environment affects, with the hashtag #PrayforAmazonia trending worldwide on Twitter. World leaders have also stepped in voice their concerns, urging the Brazilian government to act quickly. French President Emmanual Macron called for the issue to be discussed at this week’s G7 summit, because “our house is burning.” Canada’s President Justin Trudeau responded in support, saying world leaders need to “#ActforAmazon” for the sake of future generations. I couldn’t agree more, @EmmanuelMacron. We did lots of work to protect the environment at the #G7 last year in Charlevoix, &amp; we need to continue this weekend. We need to #ActForTheAmazon &amp; act for our planet — our kids &amp; grandkids are counting on us. https://t.co/KwaR8Eevq5 — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) August 23, 2019  The UN’s Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also called on Brazil to take action, expressing his “deep concern.” I’m deeply concerned by the fires in the Amazon rainforest. In the midst of the global climate crisis, we cannot afford more damage to a major source of oxygen and biodiversity. The Amazon must be protected. — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) August 22, 2019  Average citizens worldwide have also been vocal about the issue, with pictures of the rainforest burning being share on mass and petitions being created calling for change. One Brazilian petition, created by environmental group Avaaz asking the government to halt illegal deforestation has already received a million signatures.

Rabat – The judicial police in Fez, in collaboration with members from the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST), have arrested a couple involved in the trafficking of psychotropic pills. The couple, aged 26 and 33, were in possession of 2,040 psychotropic pills, a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said. The police arrested the man, who already has a criminal record, and his wife on a bus coming from Nador, a city in eastern Morocco. Police searched the couple’s luggage and seized counterfeit alcohol and money they suspect to be from drug trafficking. DGSN’s statement said that police put the suspects in custody for further investigation. The arrest of the two suspects comes after the Moroccan police in Fez aborted three drug trafficking operations across the city last week. Police arrested three suspects involved in the drug trafficking operations, including a 17-year-old suspect. The operations are part of Morocco’s crackdowns on drug trafficking operations across Morocco. In May, Morocco’s Administration of Customs and Indirect Taxes (ADII) said that the number of psychotropic drugs seized in Morocco increased from 140,000 in 2017 to 836,808 in 2018.

Rabat – The Moroccan equestrian team participating in the 12th African Games won a gold medal in team show jumping on Thursday, August 23. The Moroccan equestrians gave Morocco its eighth gold medal in the competition, which began Monday, August 19, in Rabat and continues until Saturday, August 31. The team scored 1.84 points at the Dar Es Salam Equestrian Sports Complex and Tbourida, ahead of Egypt with 3.23 points, and Algeria with 60.97 points. In the rankings, Zimbabwe finished fourth with 69.99, Tunisia fifth (106.17) and Tanzania sixth (154.82). In a statement to the state-owned press agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Moroccan equestrian Abdelkebir Ouaddar said he was very proud to have been able to offer a gold medal to all Moroccans. “We managed to win this medal thanks to the efforts of all the riders who played with a serene state of mind and as a team,” added Ouaddar. Morocco has won seven other gold medals in judo, taekwondo, and snooker. The vice-president of the African Confederation of Equestrian Sports, Algerian Fahima Sebiane, hailed Morocco’s “outstanding” level of organization of the African Games. Morocco took over the hosting of the games just months ago after Equatorial Guinea pulled out as hosts. Sebiane continued to pay tribute to the Moroccan organizers and considered them as  “extremely powerful.” “We want to sustain the organization of championships and meetings at the African level to promote horse riding in the continent,” said Sebiane.  Sebiane is also the vice president of the Algerian Equestrian Federation. Morocco is hosting the African Games in the cities of Rabat, Sale, Temara, Casablanca, Benslimane, and El Jadida, with the participation of nearly 6,500 athletes.

Rabat –  Responding to the allegations of family members of some imprisoned activists posted on some websites and social media, the General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR) has asserted that the behavior of some prisoners in the Ras El Maa prison in Fez was contrary to the regulations in force. According to a DGAPR corrective received by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the prisoners allowed three fellow inmates to benefit from vouchers at the grocery store. Exchanging vouchers is not permissible under the regulations of the management of canteens and stores inside prisons. The DGAPR explained that these vouchers are usable only by each specific inmate. Prisoners are not allowed to give them to other inmates. The DGAPR corrective comes in response to accusations made by the father of the prisoner Nasser Zefzafi on social networks.  On Nasser Zefzafi’s Facebook page, which his family manages, a post reads: “Yesterday, we were surprised by the arrival of an intelligence agent from the DGAPR, Suhail al-Taibi, in order to search and question in a dispassionate and detective way about the way in which the detainees of Ras al-Maa prison receive family allowance.” The DGAPR also considered as unfounded the allegations of ill-treatment and torture spread on social networks by the brother of a prisoner identified as MI, who is imprisoned in the Sale II local prison after his participation in the Hirak Rif movement. The general delegation stressed that it constantly guarantees that its employees properly treat the prisoners and enable them to enjoy all their rights in accordance with the law. It also emphasized that it tries to take disciplinary measures against any employee suspected of violating the guidelines. Concerning accusations that the DGAPR did not allow a prisoner identified as AY, imprisoned in Tangier, to attend the funeral of his father, the DGAPR explained that the prisoner had requested an exit authorization but reconsidered his decision at the last moment after a phone call with his family. The delegation pointed out that authorizations to attend funerals of relatives are a normal administrative procedure granted to all prisoners, without exception. The DGAPR denounced the spread of false allegations through social networks and said that it will deal firmly with all those who try to interfere with the normal running of the penitentiaries in order to serve their own agenda.

Rabat – The authorities the city of Ceuta have decided to extend the suspension of crossings at Tarajal II in order to carry out the rehabilitation and expansion of the Spanish side of the border. Although it was expected that the contraband crossings, suspended since July 25, will be resumed starting September 3, the Spanish government confirmed that this activity will be interrupted until further notice. El Faro de Ceuta reported earlier today that the suspension of these crossings will not affect the crossing of people, tourists, and cars. The government noted in a press release that the contraband activity will be resumed once technicians determine that the border’s infrastructure is safe enough for these activities. The suspension decision aims to enhance the fluidity of the border for the entry and exit of neighboring tourists, according to Ceutaactualidad.  Moroccan authorities agreed on the decision in order to facilitate the Moroccan diaspora’s return to their countries of residence, especially as it coincides with Eid al-Adha. Possible end of contraband crossings? The decision brings back to public attention the longstanding controversy surrounding the Ceuta-Morocco merchandise smuggling. In February 2019, the director-general of the Moroccan Administration of Customs and Indirect Taxation, Nabil Lajdar, said that he supports a “radical” solution to “definitively” put an end to contraband border crossings with Melilla and Ceuta. Speaking at the Moroccan House of Representatives, Lajdar said that the prohibition of the entry of smuggled products into Morocco could be done gradually over the next five or ten years. Lajdar estimated the value of the products entering through the Ceuta border between MAD 6,000 and 8,000 million per year (between 550 and 730 million euros). In terms of taxes, this is the equivalent of a loss of MAD 2,000 and 3,000 million (between 180 and 270 million euros). “These are amounts that the State treasury loses, and if we add Melilla’s case, the figure is doubled,” he said. Lajdar also stated that this “acceptable” activity is now attracting people from central and northern Morocco. El Faro de Ceuta suspects that this “temporary” suspension of contraband activity may be the start of the actual end of this Moroccan-Spanish commercial activity.

Rabat –  Yachtsmen from Spain, Portugal, Gibraltar, Morocco, and the US are participating in the Gibraltar Morocco Yacht Rally to support the Red Cross. The rally started Friday, August 23, when the yachtsmen sailed from Gibraltar to the Tanja Marina Bay in Tangier, Morocco. The event’s Facebook page said it will run until August 26. The Gibraltar Chronicle quoted a statement from the organizers saying the rally continues to attract “increasing numbers of participants.” Boatshed Gibraltar organized the event and “persuaded Alcaidesa Marina and Tanja Marina Bay to step in and sponsor the rally” in 2019. The  Gibraltar Chronicle noted that participants raise funds for the Red Cross by bidding on prizes. “Participants in the rally will be able to bid for many valuable prizes including a James Foot Gibraltar watercolour, a folding bicycle, a haul out at Alcaidesa Marina and a Watford Football Club shirt autographed by captain Trevor Deeney and his squad,” the report said.  The Gibraltar Broadcasting Cooperation (GBC) reported that two years ago the rally raised  £11,000 for the Red Cross. Organizer John Alcantara said the time that the 30-mile journey takes depends on the type of boat.

Rabat – The Governing Council in Morocco adopted a new draft law on collaborative financing on Thursday, August 22.  As reported by Moroccan news outlet L’Observateur, the bill aims to strengthen financial inclusion, especially among partners in small projects, in order to support development. The law will ideally support economic and social development and allow for new investment opportunities, according to Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi.  The bill also hopes to ensure the mobilization of new sources of financing for small enterprises and young, innovative entrepreneurs. It should encourage the active participation of Moroccans in the country’s development projects “through a mechanism of simple, secure, and transparent financing,” El Khalfi stated at a press briefing after the council meeting. In addition, the bill seeks to “promote the liberation of the creative and cultural potential of young people and to enhance the attractiveness and influence of the Casablanca Financial Center,” according to L’Observateur.  The text of the bill defines the legal framework for collaborative financing and establishes a regulatory mechanism of collaborative financing activities. It also outlines the procedures for establishing and operating collaborative funding platforms and clarifies the specific rules for each of the forms of collaborative financing.

Rabat – Italian security services have expelled Salma Bencharki, the wife of Abderrahim Moutaharrik, a Moroccan ISIS fighter, for security reasons. Moutaharrik is a Moroccan kickboxer who received a six-year prison sentence in 2016 for terror charges. He is known as the “ISIS Boxer.” Italian authorities arrested the Moroccan fighter and his wife after an investigation showed they were planning to take their family from Italy to Syria. Moutaharrik and Bencharki have two children, aged 5 and 7. Moutaharrik was also planning a terror attack against the Vatican.  Bencharki finished serving her sentence of three years and four months and was deported to Morocco. Matteo Salvini, interior minister of Italy, signed the deportation order to expel Bencharki. Authorities stripped Moutaharrik of his Italian citizenship.  It is not the first time foreign governments have repatriated those convicted of terrorismor their wives to Morocco. In 2018, Belgium announced its decision to extradite a Moroccan Al Qaeda member known as the “most dangerous woman” in Belgium or the “black widow.” Malika El Aroud is the widow of a Taliban jihadist Abdessatar Dhamane. Belgium stripped the “black widow” of her citizenship and sentenced her to eight years in prison for her affiliation with Al Qaeda. Morocco’s counter-terrorism law gives sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years in prison to ISIS returnees. Morocco, however, does not take legal proceedings against the wives and children of repatriated fighters. According to the head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) Abdelhak El Khiame, women did not intend to leave Morocco to join jihadi movements. They only accompanied their husbands. The wives of ISIS fighters and their children are also subject to special measures in line with the “moussalaha” or the reconciliation program, aiming to integrate returning fighters into society. In 2018, Khiame shared statistics about the number of Moroccans estimated to have joined ISIS in conflict zones, such as Syria, Libya, and Iraq. Khiame said that 1,668 are believed to have joined the terror networks. That figure also includes the 200 or so who have already returned to Morocco. Khiame stated in October 2018 that since the creation of the BCIJ in 2015, Morocco had dismantled 57 terrorist cells. It arrested 3,129 people, 292 of whom had a criminal record, and foiled 361 terrorist actions. Morocco also carried out several crackdowns on terror cells this year.

Rabat – During a meeting on Thursday, August 22, the Moroccan government adopted the Children’s Rights Covenant of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a pact outlining the rights of the child in Islam. The covenant was first signed at the 32nd session of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the member countries of the OIC in 2005, but was just passed in Parliament this week. “The Pact of the Rights of the Child in Islam aims to protect the child within the family and strengthen the child’s status,” said Government Spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi in a statement to the press. The new pact makes it a fundamental right in Morocco for all children to be protected, to have free access to compulsory and secondary education, and to have access to disability care. The pact directly stipulates that refugee children have these rights as well as Moroccan-born children. “This pact aims to ensure a healthy and safe childhood, to cement free access to compulsory and secondary education for all children, regardless of sex, color, nationality, religion, etc., and to provide care for children with special needs,” El Khalfi said. The pact also says that children must recieve sex education that supports religious values during primary and secondary school, a controversial stipulation. “Every child close to puberty has the right to access a healthy sexual education allowing him to distinguish the lawful from the illicit according to the vision of Islam,” states Article 12 of the pact. The pact has received backlash from human rights groups. The Center for Human Rights and Democracy Studies (CEDHD) urged the government not to endorse the pact, saying it “undermines the provisions of the United Nations Convention to which Morocco acceded in 1993.” In a statement posted to its Facebook page, CEDHD questioned the need for the pact when the UN convention is already in place, which the human rights group defines as “the most prestigious international standard in this area.”  CEDHD also noted that the pact does not outline any ”monitoring or control mechanism,” thus putting the progress the UN convention made in Morocco at risk. “This pact may affect the progress made on human rights in our country and will effect the way we deal with these issues at a public policy level, as well as the procedures and approaches in place,” said CEDHD.

Rabat – On Thursday, August 23, Algeria’s supreme court placed in custody the former justice minister, Tayeb Louh, on charges of fraud and abuse of power under the rule of ousted President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The court also accused Louh of obstruction of justice, inciting to falsify official documents, and involvement in bias, according to Algerian state-owned news agency APS. The examining magistrate at the supreme court heard the charges against Louh, minister of justice from 2013 to 2019. The former minister was placed in custody as part of the wide-scale crackdown on corruption launched by the supreme court, according to a statement by the public prosecutor. On August 8, the court of Algiers announced the start of a preliminary probe into Louh over acts punishable by law. The court ordered the confiscation of Louh’s passport to prevent him from leaving the country. Through a series of protests, which began on February 22, Algerians have been denouncing the wide corruption in the country, calling for accountability and for an end to impunity enjoyed by elites. The Algerian protesters demanded a radical change of the whole “corrupt system,” including the dismissal of every official from Bouteflika’s era of 1999 to 2019. Several other senior government officials have been placed in custody, including Algeria’s two former prime ministers, Ahmed Ouyahia and Abdelmalek Sellal.

Rabat – The government of Guinea-Bissau has expressed “unconditional” support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. The statement is part of Guinea-Bissau’s determination to back Morocco’s Autonomy Plan submitted to the United Nations in 2007 as a political solution to end the dispute over Western Sahara. On August 22, Bissau-Guinean Minister of Foreign Affairs Suzi Carla Barbosa said that, along with the autonomy plan, her country also expresses full “support for the role played by the United Nations as an exclusive and consensual framework” to reach a lasting solution to the conflict. Barbosa made her remarks in a joint statement following talks with her Moroccan counterpart, Nasser Bourita, in Rabat on Thursday, August 22. Guinea-Bissau also reiterated support for Morocco’s territorial integrity at the 4th Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held in October  2018. In her meeting with Bourita, Barbosa also extolled the partnership her country has with Morocco, welcoming the “huge economic opportunities offered by both countries.” A statement of the meeting reaffirms Guinea-Bissau’s determination to develop bilateral trade and establish a “mutually beneficial economic partnership.” Data from the European Commission’s directorate-general for trade shows Morocco as one of the top trading partners for Guinea-Bissau in 2018. Excluding region member states, Morocco is the seventh biggest source of imports to Guinea-Bissau with a value estimated at €3 million The joint statement from Bourita and Barbosa emphasizes that “both sides urged economic operators in the two countries to conduct prospecting missions and participate in economic and trade events organized by the two countries.” The two countries aim to foster collaboration in agriculture, health, education, fisheries, infrastructure, and training. Education partnership In 2015, King Mohammed VI and Guinea-Bissau’s head of state Jose Mario Vaz signed 16 partnership agreements in several fields, including education. Under the partnership agreement on education, Morocco will grant scholarships and internship opportunities for students from Guinea-Bissau. The recent meeting between Bourita and Barbosa served as an opportunity to emphasize the importance of the agreement for students. Morocco has decided to increase by 50% the number of scholarships granted to Bissau-Guinean students from 80 to 120, Maghreb Arab Press reported. Morocco also vowed to support Guinea-Bissau’s determination to implement socio-economic development projects to strengthen peace and stability in the country.

Rabat – Pictures of a house built in the middle of the ramparts surrounding the old medina of Marrakech has triggered a wave of anger among the people of the red city. Taking to her Facebook account on August 14, Amel Mellakh, a researcher in tangible and intangible heritage, published photos showing a part of the rampart being destroyed to build a house. The rampart was built by Almoravide around the years 1126-1127.  Mellakh was frustrated that the historical sites, part of the city’s history and cultural legacy, were being demolished to make some more space for private houses.  “Built around the years 1126-1127 by the Almoravid dynasty, and especially under the orders of Ali Ben Youssef, the ramparts of Marrakech, in the form of a quadrilateral, formed a wall to protect the city from external attacks,” she explained. In the pictures shared online, the house can be easily spotted as it is located on one of Marrakech’s main avenues. According to Mellakh and other critics of the practice, who also vented their anger in social media posts, the randomly built house is considered as a disrespect to the city’s cultural heritage and wealth and harms the look of the ramparts. “Allo … band of uneducated, ignorant, blind … the ramparts in danger, worse, a situation where we risk great insecurity and threatens the existence of our history, ramparts in distress, our heritage is no longer threatened, it is destroyed,” she commented.  Mellakh later acted on her frustration by bringing the matter to public attention. The researcher has called on officials to act against what she views as a sacrilegious trend. Sadly, however, the authorities have so far turned a blind eye on the concerning situation of the ramparts of Marrakech. Reactions from internet users have been almost all pointed in the same direction. They all denounced the deliberate destruction of the city’s cultural and architectural heritage for the only purpose of building a house. People also raised questions on the role of the local authorities whose mandate makes them responsible for monitoring the respect of the development plan of the district under the authority of the ministry of interior.  They also put the responsibility on the Urban Agency of Marrakech. The agency is charged with executing zoning and developments plans and also controlling housing projects and ensuring their conformity with a specific area’s development plan. Marrakech is considered a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985.

Rabat – Cargotec subsidiary Kalmar has signed an agreement with container terminal EUROGATE Tanger  (EGT) to improve the performance of four ship-to-shore (STS) cranes from  Chinese machinery company Zhenhua Heavy Industries (ZPMC). In a press release,  Kalmar announced that the project is scheduled to start in the first quarter of 2020. Completion of the project is scheduled for the second quarter of 2021, however. “Kalmar will be responsible for the planning, engineering, and execution of the entire project, which involves heightening the four STS cranes by 11 metres and extending the booms by six metres. The upgrade will enable the terminal to serve mega-sized container vessels,” the statement said. The press release quoted CEO of EGT  Andrea Cervia who expressed satisfaction with the project. For the CEO, the investment is “the biggest since the commencement of operations in 2008.” The venture, Cervia added, will make EGT ready “from the second half of next year to accommodate the latest generation Ultra Large Container Ships with a capacity of 23,000 TEUs working up to 25 rows across.” Among the many goals of the investment is EGT’s ambition to “confirm and extend” its role as the “transshipment hub for the Western Meditteranean.” The investment would also enable EGT  to “continue to offer top-level service to” its customers,” according to CEO. EUROGATE Tanger is located  on the Strait of Gibraltar in Morocco, a strategic position to make the terminal a go-to destination  for markets in Africa, as well as in North and South America. The terminal will consist of “a quay length of 812 m, a terminal area of 400,000 m² [square meters] and a water depth of up to 18 [meters],”  said Kalmar. Eduardo Prat, Vice-President of Kalmar also commented on the signing of the agreement. “EUROGATE Tanger has been an important partner of ours for many years so we are delighted to be able to help them future-proof their operations ready for handling the next generation of mega-size vessels,” Prat said. He added, “Our track record and expertise in these kinds of crane upgrade projects is exemplary, and we are the only provider capable of completing the work in such a short timescale.”

Rabat – The Spanish Civil Guard has dismantled the international network engaged in trafficking protected species to Morocco. ‘Operation Fennec’ supervised by Europol, is the fruit of a coordinated investigation with the participation of Portugal, Slovakia, and Morocco. It has so far enabled the arrest of 10 alleged members of the criminal organization.  The Spanish Civil Guard also seized around 200 animals, including birds, mammals, and reptiles that were destined to be smuggled to Morocco, according to Spanish media.  The investigation was initiated after a complaint from a citizen to the NGO SEO / BirdLife which reported the information to the Civil Guard. The clandestine smuggling network had contacts in many European countries that provided them with protected specimens to illegally export them to Morocco.  After investigating the suspects, Spanish authorities found out that smuggled animals were stored in an animals shop in Fuengirola and in Ronda, both situated in the province of Malaga. Spanish media reported on the existence of an emerging market in Africa dedicated to selling illegal animals. Run by four people, one of the members of the network had judicial records in species trafficking and was responsible for acquiring animals from across Europe. To secure a pass at police controls, the network had a veterinarian who issued the corresponding health cards for exotic animals. Among the arrested individuals is a Moroccan national residing in the Spanish city of Melilla. The person is believed to have been responsible for animal distribution in Morocco and finding potential buyers via social media. To facilitate the border-crossing to Morocco, the network used mules between Melilla and Nador. No further details have been provided by authorities on the date of the trials.

Rabat – The Polisario leadership is not happy with the trajectory that things appear to be taking in the Western Sahara question.  On August 11, the Wall Street Journal published an article and a video on the latest developments in the UN-led process in the Western Sahara dossier.  Both the article and the video made the point that, as terrorism and other insecurity threats loom on the horizon in North Africa, especially at the Morocco-Algeria and Morocco-Mauritania borders, Washington is not very welcoming of the prospect of a new state in the region.  “But officials involved in the talks said the U.S. has made it clear that Washington won’t support a plan that leads to a new African nation. That tacit agreement might not go over well with the Sahrawi independence activists,” WSJ correspondent Dion Nissenbaum remarked in the article.  While this was the piece’s most shattering blow to Polisario’s statehood ambitions, another central takeaway from other recent reports on the matter is that the overwhelming perception in Washington and a great many other capitals is that the creation of a new state in North Africa will create more harm than good. As one should have expected, these arguments have stirred disappointment, rage, and outrage in pro-Polisario circles.  Earlier this week, on August 19, Joseph Huddleston from the South Orange Township in New Jersey, and apparently a Polisario sympathizer, and Kamal Fadel, the Polisario representative to Australia and New Zealand, responded to Nissenbaum’s report.  They hit back at what they said is an unbalanced narrative that gives more credit to the Moroccan side of the Western Sahara story rather than tell the whole truth of what is going on in the territory. Huddleston’s remarks were aimed at both the video and the article. While describing both items as “thorough and evenhanded overall” and congratulating Nissenbaum for “bringing attention to the oft-ignored conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front over the North African territory,” he reproached the story for not being objective enough.  For Huddleston, the report “wrongly asserts that an independent Saharan state would pose a risk to regional stability.” Rather than refusing the Polisario its wishes by obsessing over the potential terrorism haven the territory may turn into once the separatist front is granted its demands, he argued, the international’s community should focus on the apparently satisfactory gains that the Polisario leadership has obtained for its self-styled Saharan Republic.  “Western Sahara’s Sahrawi people have built an entire state apparatus. The Sahrawi Republic is a longtime member of the African Union and is recognized by dozens of countries. It wins lawsuits in international courts.  “The governing Polisario Front polices the area around the camps and has cooperated with international security efforts against trafficking and terrorism. The claim that an independent Western Sahara would likely be unstable and offer a foothold to Islamic State is misguided conjecture.”  Fadel, Polisario’s Australia and New Zealand ambassador, was even more vigorous in his disagreement with Nissenbaum. Calling out Morocco’s “illegal occupation” of Western Sahara, he directed the bulk of his outrage at the fact that the article was promoting the “dangerous” idea that “maintaining the status quo is the best option.” Sustaining the current status quo is, according to Fadel, an option that “Morocco has tirelessly lobbied for” in Washington and in other places that may influence the UN’s final take on settling the decades-long conflict. “But it [maintaining the status quo] would be dangerous for Western Sahara and the Maghreb region and costly for the UN and the US,” the Polisario official said. More than an opinionated reaction to the apparent outrage of WSJ’s points about Washington fearing the risks of instability associated with a Polisario-governed territory, or the Trump administration’s desire to honor its strategic friendship with Morocco, the comments from Fadel and Huddleston also speak of a forlorn attempt to silence or dispel what is perceptibly becoming a Morocco-friendly momentum  in the UN-led negotiations. Over the past months and especially since the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2468 in late April, the overriding idea among diplomatic circles with access to the goings-on of the UN process has been that referendum is no longer a practical way forward in ending Western Sahara’s political impasse.  One telling instance was the omission of referendum in Resolution 2468. Instead, the document called for  “compromise and realism,” two talking points that have long been an essential part of Morocco’s stance.  It also called on Algeria and Mauritania to shoulder more responsibility in negotiations, to be full-fledged participants in the political process rather than “third parties” or “neighboring states” with negligible weight when it comes to influencing the terms and outcome of the negotiations.  The document has consequently been perceived as advancing Morocco’s agenda. One unmissable illustration of such a widespread perception came late last month when Brahim Ghali, the leader of the separatist front, urged refugees in the Tindouf camps to “prepare for an inevitable war” against Morocco.  By his own admission, Ghali’s impromptu war speech was motivated by concerns over great powers’ support (mainly France and the US) for Morocco. Fadel summoned that line of reasoning in his rebuttal of the WSJ report. While he did not adopt Ghali’s belligerent tone, the Polisario representative suggested that the “Sahrawi people” were not ready to accept any solution outside of a referendum on self-determination. He spoke of the Sahrawis’ strong desire for statehood and self-determination, claiming that Morocco’s “occupation” has failed to win them over. He said: “Morocco has failed to win their [Sahrawis’] hearts and minds during its 44 years of occupation. They should be allowed to decide their future in a referendum.” The mention of a seemingly sizable international support for the separatist agenda is a distorted representation of the realty; it comes on the heels of a series of singularly dispiriting reports for Polisario.  In addition to the reports of the UN process’ momentum drifting away from pro-Polisario talking points, the past two to three months have seen a number of formerly pro-Polisario countries withdrawing their recognition of the Polisario-claimed state. These countries have embraced Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, describing it as the most serious proposal for a lasting political settlement.  But a standard, classical Polisario pro-Polisario move is the downright dismissal of the genuineness of Morocco’s resolution proposal, regardless of the strong consensus it boasts in the UN circles or the increasing number of governments it has convinced in recent years and months.  Even as Morocco has been applauded by international observers for its development projects for Western Sahara, drafted an Autonomy Plan that has been vastly lauded for its compromise and realism spirit, or invested herculean efforts in transforming its southern provinces and almost closing the socio-economic gap with the rest of Morocco, or won the support of locals and elected Sahrawi representatives who have been adamant that Polisario does not speak for them, the mantra has remained the same in pro-Polisario circles over the years. As far as the Polisario leadership is concerned, not only the WSJ piece, but any other reports of some kind of celebration of Morocco’s efforts towards sustainable settlement, including a strong local support in acknowledgement of the massive development efforts invested in Western Sahara, are a sobering reminder of the “lies” Morocco has been telling itself and the international community. For the secessionist front and its supporters, the point is to sell referendum as the sole alternative. Anything else—including outrageous reports about the front’ human rights violations, its plans to inflate the numbers of Tindouf refugees, or all the positives about Morocco’s legal and historical claims to the disputed territory—is simply beside the point. Their hope is that once this victimhood and “dismissing Morocco” narrative is given the weight it deserves, referendum will be back at the negotiation table.

Rabat – In a report published on August 19 by Greenpeace, an international non-governmental organization with environmental aims, Morocco ranked 25th in the list of countries with the most SO2 emissions in 2018. The results measured by NASA’s Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) show that Morocco emitted 216 kilotonnes (kt) of SO2 last year. Morocco also ranked 6th in the emission of this gas in the MENA region, behind Saudi Arabia (6th worldwide), United Arab Emirates (14th), Qatar (15th), Kuwait (17th), and Iraq (23rd) respectively. The ranking shows India as the top emitter of SO2, with an alarming 4,586 kt/year, followed by Russia, China, Mexico, and Iran. In Morocco, the industrial zones of Jorf Lasfar, Mohammedia, and Safi are among the highest emitters of SO2. Worldwide, the highest concentration of SO2 emissions is found at the Norilsk smelter, in northern Russia. The main source of SO2 emissions the burning of fossil fuels in power plants and other industrial facilities. Other emitting sources include industrial processes such as extracting metal from ore; natural sources such as volcanoes; and locomotives, ships and other vehicles and heavy equipment that burn fuel with a high sulfur content. However, 99 percent of SO2 in the air comes from human sources. An exposure to SO2 would cause irritations in the nose, the throat, and the airways, causing coughs, wheezes, shortness of breath, and a tight feeling around the chest. Those most at risk of developing problems if they are exposed to SO2 are people with asthma or similar conditions. Air pollution in Mohammedia is obvious, according to local pulmonologist Dr. Hamid Kerrat who was interviewed by Al-Araby Al-Jadeed in June 2018. “At times, black dust envelops the city and can be seen on car windows and house rooftops,” Kerrat said. Kerrat also said his office is always full of patients suffering from respiratory-system illnesses and asthma, where about 60 percent of his patients are children or teenagers who live near Mohammedia’s industrial zone. According to Kerrat, the harmful particles in the air are one of the main reasons why children and young people develop asthma. Senior analyst at Greenpeace Nordic, Lauri Myllyvirta said: “a shift to environmentally sustainable solutions away from fossil fuel energy could save “billions of dollars in health costs and thousands of lives every year.” “The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas is the largest source of emissions of SO2 resulting in disastrous air pollution and premature deaths.” “It’s fundamental that governments rapidly transition away from fossil fuels and set stronger emission standards as they shift over to sustainable alternatives,” she said. On June 2019, Morocco’s Secretary of State for Sustainable Development, Nezha El Ouafi, said that the economic cost of air pollution in Morocco is estimated at 1.62 percent of the country’s GDP.

Rabat – Morocco’s Tourism Observatory reported tourism an 8% rise in overnight stays in Marrakech in the first half of 2019 compared to overnight stays in 2018. The observatory recorded 3,967,857 overnight hotel stays from January to June, compared to 3,669,212 in the same time period last year. Hotel occupancy rates were also much higher, with the observatory marking a 63% occupancy rate in hotels during the period, compared to just 58% last year. One thing that did not change from last year to this year is the total amount of time tourists are spending in Marrakech. The rate has stayed at an average of 3 days. The ochre city of Marrakech has long been one of Morocco’s most popular tourist destinations, and every year the number of tourists rises. In the first 11 months of 2018, a whopping 2.4 million tourists flocked to the city. However, as tourism grows, the city has gained a reputation for overcharging and other scams, particularly in Jemaa El Fna square, an area hugely popular with tourists. As a result, the wali (governor) of Marrakech is taking firm measures to combat the problem and has launched a crackdown on overcharging restaurant owners, pushy snake charmers, henna tattooists, taxi drivers, and vendors who may taint tourists’ experience of Marrakech. Most recently, on July 3, Marrakech police arrested a snake charmer in Jemaa El Fna square for fraud and breach of trust after he charged a tourist €40 for a single photo. Additionally, the city sanctioned 39 taxis this year for overcharging, as well as seven restaurants and 70 street vendors.

Rabat – Interim president Abdelkader Bensallah recalled the Algerian ambassador to Morocco, Mohamed Salah Dembri, on Thursday, August 22. Dembri had been Algiers’ envoy in Rabat since 2009. Algerian news outlet Ennahar Online reported that the interim president replaced Dembri with Abfelazi Benali Cheri as ambassador to Morocco. Benali Cherif served before as the spokesperson of the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In addition to Dembri, Bensalah recalled several other ambassadors, including Abdelkader Msdoua, who was posted in France. Bensalah replaced him with Abdellah Ba Ali. Algeria also appointed Milat Toufik as a new ambassador to Spain and  Tououahria Abdlekrim as ambassador to the UAE. Algeria also recalled and replaced its ambassadors to Tunisia, the US, and the UK. The purge of Algerian diplomats came suddenly without explanation from Algeria. It is not the first time, however, that Algeria has sacked a slew of officials after the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Gaid Salah, the chief of the Algerian army, has sacked many military officials recently. Khaled Nezzar, the former minister of defense in Algeria, accused Salah of “eliminating all” opposition figures. “Gaid Salah prides himself on having a double cap and believes he can afford anything. This arises from a sick mind that should be reduced at all costs and quickly,” Nezzar recently said.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi has said that vocational training is an “effective tool” to enable youth to quickly access the job market. Amzazi expects vocational training to encourage people to create their own businesses and to generate income. The minister’s statement comes after King Mohammed VI urged youth not to underestimate vocational training as an approach to reduce youth unemployment in both rural and urban areas. The King said, “Passing the baccalaureate exam and going to university is not a privilege; it is just a phase in the education process.” Fewer new job opportunities opened in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) said on August 11 that only 7,000 new jobs opened in this period compared to 117,000 new jobs a year ago. Morocco now is facing the challenge of integrating the growing number of young people into the economy and society. Amzazi acknowledged that young people are “increasingly affected by unemployment.” The number of jobless people without training or education is estimated at over 2 million people, Amzazi said. Amzazi said that offering training to youth would successfully integrate youth into the globally competitive market. The Moroccan government vowed to create a roadmap and legal reforms to improve vocational training to ensure that Moroccan youths have skills better matched to the needs of both the public and private sectors. In April, King Mohammed VI chaired a meeting in which Said Amzazi presented a plan for the development of vocational training and the creation of “cities of professions and skills” across Morocco. The new cities will focus on training in line with each region’s potential, argued Amzazi. Amazazi said that the national roadmap would be an opportunity for non-students without a job or training and for youth working in the informal sector. The National Office for Vocational Training and Promotion (OFPPT) is an institution with many schools in Morocco. It provides training in several fields, including commerce, accounting, aeronautic construction, and social aid. The institute is a “major player” in economic and social development, according to the Ministry of Economy and Finance.  The institution’s mission is to improve people’s competitiveness and promote employment among young people from underprivileged backgrounds. Amzazi said only 25% of baccalaureate holders go on to vocational training while 75% enroll in Moroccan universities. “The ministry will take new measures to reverse this trend,” Amzazi promised.

Rabat – French football club Dijon FCO announced on Twitter on Wednesday, August 21, that it has recruited Moroccan international footballer Hamza Mendyl. Mendyl is on an initial loan to Dijon with an option to buy from German club Schalke 04. The left-back joined the German club in 2018 with a five-year deal, coming from French club FC Lille for €7 million. The 21-year-old player spent most of his year in the Bundesliga as a substitute, participating in only 9 matches. In his youth career, Mendyl played with Wydad football school in Casablanca before joining the Mohammed VI Football Academy in 2010. After spending five years there, FC Lille approached him. While playing for Morocco’s Under 20 national team, Mendyl appeared in 6 matches and scored one goal.  Mendyl has played 16 matches with Morocco’s national football team but has not scored a single goal. In May 2018, Herve Renard, then coach of Morocco’s national football team, called him up to play the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.

Rabat – President of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) Fouzi Lekjaa has stepped down as the chairman of the Moroccan football club RS Berkane. Chairman of the club since September 2009, Lekjaa announced his decision on Wednesday, August 21, saying that stepping down from the position should not be surprising. “It is an opportunity to give way to a young president with good skills,” he said. Former RS Berkane vice-president, Hakim Benabdellah, will succeed Lekjaa. “It was a surprise as the decision was taken within 48 hours,” Benabdellah said. Elected in 2014 as the FRMF president Lekjaa, 49, also serves as a vice president of the African Confederation of Football (CAF), a position held since July 2017.  In July 2019, the CAF executive committee appointed Lekjaa as its second vice president after the General Assembly of the confederation met in Cairo, Egypt. Last season was significant for RS Berkane as the football club managed to win the 2018 Throne Cup in Morocco. The football club also reached the final of the 2019 CAF Confederation Cup against Egyptian football club Al Zamalek in May. Benabdellah also expressed satisfaction with Lekjaa’s vision to give a new spirit to the club. “We had a meeting with the president and he convinced us of his vision.  Stepping down from his position does not mean that Lekjaa’s presence will shrink in the club. In contrast, Lekjaa will remain very close to the club and he will be working in other workshops.”

Rabat – On Wednesday, August 21, Morocco’s Bank Al Maghrib announced the release of a commemorative banknote  of MAD 20. The banknote’s release celebrates the 20th anniversary of the King Mohammed VI accession to the throne. Morocco celebrated Throne Day on July 31. The central bank said that the new banknote is “characterized by a vertical design, which carries a photo of King Mohammed VI.” The back of the notebank includes drawings of some of the major projects completed under the leadership of the King, such as the “Mohammed VI” bridge, the solar power plant Noor II in Ouarzazate, the Mohammed VI satellite, and the high speed train, Al Buraq. The achievements, according to the statement,  represent “different aspects of a contemporary Morocco committed to taking the path of progress.” “At least 10 robust security elements were included on both interfaces, most notably microscopic texts and anti-scanning patterns that were inserted in different parts of the paper,” the bank said. Bank Al Maghrib said that the security elements aim to protect the banknote from counterfeiting. The bank said that it will issue a limited number of the MAD 20 commemorative banknotes in September 2019.

Rabat – The “Green Morocco” Plan (PMV), the infrastructure program for Morocco’s primary sector, agriculture, has already reached the majority of the objectives set by the government for completion before 2020. In 2016, the plan exceeded a million hectares of land planted with olive trees. By the end of 2018, it achieved several other objectives such as the production of cereals and fruit trees. The summer of 2019 marked a new achievement, the strengthening of localized irrigation.  This objective is one of the three major components of the Irrigation Strategy developed in the framework of the PMV, alongside the promotion of public-private partnerships and the extension of irrigated areas. Irrigation Strategy  The National Program of Water Economy in Irrigation (PNEEI) is part of the PMV. Its objective is to equip, in localized irrigation, nearly 50% of the total agricultural area across Morocco. It aims to reduce water stress, considered as the main limiting factor to the improvement of agricultural productivity. The PNEEI program consists of a massive shift from surface and sprinkler irrigation to localized irrigation, over an area of nearly 550,000 hectares for a period of 10 years.  This means an average equipment rate of nearly 55,000 ha/year. The strategy’s development witnessed a period of stagnation in 2018 when fewer than 10,000 hectares were newly equipped, while the annual average between 2008 and 2017 was 40,000 hectares. At the beginning of 2019, however, the total area equipped with localized irrigation increased, exceeding 550,000 hectares, the initial objective of the strategy. “Green Morocco” Plan Moroccan agriculture developed considerably thanks to the “Green Morocco” plan, inaugurated by King Mohammed VI in April 2008. The PMV project aims to make agriculture one of the first sectors of productive development and to modernize it. It also intends to promote agricultural investment, ensure food security, stimulate exports of agricultural products, and promote local products. The PMV aims to transform agriculture “into a modern, value-added, high-productivity agriculture that meets the demands of the market,” says the State’s department of communication. The plan encourages private investment and development of  Moroccan agricultural exports and industrial activities. It also focuses on improving the living conditions of small farmers and fighting against poverty in rural areas. For this purpose, the plan relies on increasing agricultural incomes in the most vulnerable areas and promoting solidarity farming through farmers’ cooperatives throughout Morocco. Since its creation, the PMV  has largely contributed to the creation of agricultural cooperatives in various branches of agriculture. It has also developed cooperation between the State and the professionals of agriculture through livestock improvement projects, intensifying agricultural mechanization, and managing the water economy.

Rabat – Paleontologists from the UK’s National History Museum, in collaboration with their Moroccan counterparts, have discovered a new species of stegosaurian dinosaur. Not only is it the oldest definite stegosaur ever found, estimated to be 168 million years old, but it is also the first stegosaur to be found in North Africa. Previously, stegosaurs have been found in North America, Asia, and Europe. The species has been named Adratiklit boulahfa, a tribute to Morocco. The name is derived from the Berber words for mountain (Adras) and lizard (tiklit). Boulahfa refers to the mountain where the specimen was found, in Morocco’s Middle Atlas. The study was led by Dr. Susannah Maidment, a dinosaur expert at the museum. “The discovery of A. boulahfa is particularly exciting as we have dated it to the Middle Jurassic,” said Dr. Maidment in a statement from the museum. “Most known stegosaurus date from later in the Jurassic Period, making this the oldest definite stegosaur described and helping to increase our understanding of the evolution of this group of dinosaurs.” The landmark discovery could possibly lead to even further revelations for paleontologists, as more dinosaurs bones could be uncovered. “What is exciting about this is that there could be many more armored dinosaurs to find in places that until now have not been excavated,” added Dr. Maidment.

Washington D.C. – The timing of the interview was a shock for viewers. That the video was aired on the day that Moroccans were celebrating the 66th anniversary of the King and the People’s Revolution, was an affront to Morocco and its people. August 20, 1953, holds a special importance in the hearts of the Moroccan people.  It signaled a major shift in Moroccans’ struggle against the French protectorate, and by extension against the Spanish in northern and southern Morocco, including in Western Sahara. The current territorial dispute would not have existed had not France and Spain signed a secret accord in October 1904.  By virtue of the agreement, Spain was given full possession and sovereignty over a large swath of southern Morocco, including Western Sahara. This historical fact has been systematically overlooked in the traditional narrative about the conflict.  By airing an interview with the leader of a separatist movement- which has been used for four decades as a proxy by Algeria to stymie Morocco’s ambitions to complete its territorial integrity- Alhurra TV has shown clear bias in its reporting about the conflict, and a total disregard for the feelings of millions of Moroccans.  What raises even more questions about the rationale behind such an interview is that it comes during a period of stagnation. There have been no major developments in the conflict in recent months. Since the Security Council adopted Resolution 2468, there has been zero progress in the political process. More still, the chances of seeing significant progress in the foreseeable future are very slim, following the resignation of now former UN envoy to the Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, in May.  The only developments to take place in the region in recent months are the series of arrests that the Polisario has made against its political opponents and the hunger strikes that many political prisoners in the Tindouf camps have been observing over the past three months.  Casting Morocco as the villain Against this backdrop, the intention and the agenda of the interview was clear-cut. It was a thinly veiled opportunity for  Ghali to appear as a respectable leader and the head of genuine liberation movement. Speaking to the journalist, he styled himself as the advocate of a people who have been victimized by a country intent on perpetuating their suffering in the Tindouf camps. It was, then, not surprising to see a one-sided interview where the interlocutor was given free rein to lash out at,  and demonize its adversary .  Ghali could not have dreamed of a better opportunity, especially in the regional and international context in which the interview was aired. The Polisario  has been losing steam in recent years and has suffered a number of setbacks. Among them, the recent report of the UN Secretary General and subsequent resolution of the Security Council, which ended the myth of “liberated territories,” long propagated by the Polisario. In the same vein, the Security Council is progressively moving towards considering Algeria fully-fledged party  to the conflict.  Meanwhile, many countries that previously recognized the self-styled Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), have either suspended or withdrawn their recognition. Malawai, Panama, Haiti, Paraguay, Mauritius, Barbados, El Salvador,  Zambia, and Suriname are among a long of list of countries that have withdrawn their recognition of the self-proclaimed SADR.  In addition, the Polisario has been beset by a growing protest movement in the Tindouf camps, with an ever increasing number of Saharawis questioning its leadership. To top it all, there have been a number of reports, such as the recent report in the Wall Street Journal, suggesting that the US opposes the establishment of a new state in southern Morocco. The former Mauritanian President, Mohamed Ouled Abdel Aziz spoke along the same lines earlier this year when he told Palestinian journalist Abdelbari Atwane that neither the US nor the EU are in favor of the creation of a state between Morocco and Mauritania. Soft-ball journalism It was appalling to see the journalists asking the Polisario leader easy questions to which he responded in the same way as Polisario leaders have always done: that the Saharawis have been the victims of Morocco’s expansionist agenda. He argued that the Saharawis have nothing to do with Morocco and would never accept the option of autonomy, because they are not Moroccans. He gave the predictable answer that Morocco is the main party to blame for the deadlock in the political process because it has persisted in its attempts to prevent the holding of a referendum of self-determination to allow the Saharawis to decide their fate. Simply put, the Polisario leader was given a golden opportunity to question Morocco’s commitment to the UN political process and to dismiss Morocco as a “regime” that has been lying to its population and the international community “to the point that it starts believing its lies.” Ghali, who took on the mantle of a head of state, went as far as describing Morocco as an “undisciplined” member of the African Union, who seeks to create problems, instead of working towards advancing the AU development, security and prosperity agenda.  Had the Polisario leader been in front of an impartial, professional and truth-seeking journalist who sought to provide the audience with even-handed views about the matter at hand, the journalist would have challenged Ghali. For example, he would have told him that, contrary to his allegations, Morocco plays a leading role in the development agenda in the AU by being one of the leading foreign investors on the continent.  A true, impartial journalist would also have told Ghali that Morocco plays a prominent role in guaranteeing food security in Africa. This role was lauded only last week by Nigerian Muhamady Bouhari who tweeted his praise for Morocco’s role in bringing Nigerian agriculture to a higher level.  Morocco’s goal in ensuring food security across the continent is poised to grow in the future through the many agreements it has signed with African countries, including Nigeria and Ethiopia, where Office Cherifien of Phosphate will build multi-billion-dollar fertilizer plants.  Had the journalist’s main aim, and the interview’s main goal been to enlighten the audience about the multifaceted aspects of the conflict, and Morocco’s growing role as heavyweight in Africa, he would have mentioned the leading role Morocco has played over the past six years in speaking about migration on behalf of Africa in international forums, and calling on the international community to shoulder its responsibility in helping Sub-Saharan Africa cope with the issue of undocumented immigration.  While Algeria has been accused of dumping thousands of African immigrants in the desert, and an Algerian minister even accused the immigrants of causing the transmission of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, Morocco has launched two campaigns to regularize the situation of undocumented immigrants. More than 50,000 Sub-Saharan immigrants benefited from these two campaigns, turning Morocco into the first north African country to take such a measure. At the regional and global level, Morocco has also been at the forefront of the fight against terrorism. Morocco’s anti-extremism initiatives include the  spread of the noble values of Islam through education. For example, over the past four years, Morocco has trained more than 3,000 imams from several African countries.  All these facts refute the allegations that Ghali made against Morocco, but the interviewing journalist was not interested in providing an honest and impartial report to Alhurra’s viewers.    Additionally, at no point did the journalist try to interrupt Ghali or challenge him with hard or embarrassing questions, or even facts that contradict his allegations. No questions were asked about the reasons behind the Polisario and Algeria’s refusal to allow the UNHCR to conduct a census of the population in the Tindouf camps. Neither did the journalist try to challenge Ghali’s claim that the Saharawis are not Moroccans by pointing out that many founding members of the Polisario, such as Bashir Dkhil, Brahim Khalil, Omar Hadrami, defected and returned to Morocco over a decade ago, and have since denounced Algeria’s hijacking of the Polisario.  No questions were posed either about the series of human rights abuses the Polisario has committed in recent months against political opponents, nor its heavy-handed policy to stifle dissent in the Tindouf camps. Human Rights Watch denounced these violations in a report it released last month.  In the report, HRW called on the Polisario to free three detainees, who were arrested and jailed without due process. Polisario detained the three activists for simply denouncing “absence of dialogue” and the “lack of alternatives to repression”. They also also said Polisario’s “corrupt leadership” was “trembling [in reaction] to what is happening to their masters in Algeria” and demanded that the Polisario show more willingness to engage with Morocco to find a solution to the conflict.  Brushing evidence under the carpet No questions were asked about Ghali’s views on the protests taking place in Algeria, and whether he fears that a democratically elected president would stop providing diplomatic political, financial, and military support to the Polisario movement. Instead the journalist chose to ask a trivial question about whether the political situation in Algeria would have any impact on the latter’s support for the Polisario.  When the journalist asked Ghali about the reports documenting the systematic embezzlement of humanitarian aid devoted to the Tindouf camps, the Polisario leader dismissed them as mere lies “invented and propagated” by Morocco. while Ghali engaged in a tirade against Morocco, the journalist failed to interrupt him or challenge his claims by citing the report conducted by the European Union Anti-Fraud Committee, known as OLAF.  The report was conducted between 2003 and 2005 but was only released in 2015. It documented, with irrefutable evidence, how Polisario and Algerian leaders have been misappropriating the humanitarian aid destined for the camps for the past four decades.  The heavily redacted report gives damning and troubling details on how Algerian and Polisario officials have resorted to all sorts of schemes to enrich themselves to the detriment of the very people they claim to defend and represent. The report documents how the Polisario takes high quality donations, such as milk, to sell on the black market in Mauritania and Mali. The high quality produce, intended for the Tindouf camp’s inhabitants, is then replaced with lower quality goods. The profits of the enterprise go straight into the pockets of the Polisario leadership.  In addition to the embezzlement schemes, the Polisario used Moroccan prisoners to build several administrative facilities and then billed international donors for the construction of the infrastructure, as if the manpower was provided by the Saharawis themselves. Alhurra’s links with the UAE Many Moroccans must be wondering why Alhurra TV has all of a sudden decided to shift its editorial line on the Western Sahara and give the Polisario a platform to demonize Morocco and market itself as a genuine liberation movement that has been engaged in a struggle to recover its territory.  The interview is reminiscent of the report aired by the Dubai-based Al Arabiya TV last January, in which there was a clear pro-Polisario narrative. The common denominator of the two reports is the hidden hand of the UAE and its determination to retaliate against Morocco for not siding with the Saudi-led coalition against Qatar.  It has become an open secret in recent months that Alhurra TV has come under the grip of the UAE through an alleged, undisclosed link between the channel’s original owners and the Middle Eastern country. For almost a year, readers and viewers of Alhurra have noticed a marked and substantial shift in the channel’s reporting about the Middle East, with the spotlight being shined on countries that don’t align with the UAE agenda.  The vice-President of Middle East Broadcasting Network (MBN), which owns Alhurra, Alhurra Iraq, Radio Sawa, Alhurra.com; RadioSawa.com; Irfaasawtak.com; MaghrebVoices.com; ElSaha.com, is none other than Jordanian Nart Bouran. Bouran previously worked for seven years as the head of the Abu-Dhabi-based Sky News Arabia.  Immediately after his resignation from Sky News over a year ago, he set out to establish his new work team in Alhurra headquarters in Springfield, Virginia, bringing with him many of his former colleagues form Abu-Dhabi.  That Alhurra’s editorial line shifted immediately after it was taken over by Bouran is very telling. Viewers can be left in no doubt about which country is calling the shots at Alhurra, and the agenda it is now pursuing. With the airing of yesterday’s interview,  the new direction of Alhurra and its perspective on the Western Sahara issue were drawn into sharp focus for Morocco. This ultimate provocation to the Moroccan people is evidence that Morocco can no longer rely on the lip service that some Arab countries have paid to the kingdom’s position on Western Sahara.  The Al Arabiya and Alhurra’s episodes demonstrate that countries which, until very recently, were thought to be indefectible Moroccan allies, are ready to strong-arm Morocco and stab it in the back if it does not follow their diktats and aligns with their agendas. The Moroccan government should take note and act accordingly to prevent any party from undermining its strategic interests, its national security, and stability.

Rabat –  These changes include the ratification of the CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women) in 1993, the reformation of the Moudawwana in 2004, constitutional changes for gender equality in 2011, and as well as countless others. While women are guaranteed more rights in a legal sense, there has arguablybeen minimal progress within their day-to-day lives. Reasons for this disconnect are active resistance, lack of awareness, and the patriarchal stronghold within the country. This work will explore the positive aspects and limitations of a few of the legal changes in Morocco that shape the status of women within the country. Changes to the family law, Moudouwwana The changes to the Moudawwana in 2004 were extensive and progressive. Among the most significant were: raising the minimum age for marriage to 18, permitting a wife to divorce her husband for domestic violence, abandonment, abstinence, or not following a condition in their marriage contract. The changes also allowed spouses to inherit from each other. The reforms also changed the laws relating to men taking multiple wives, a husband can now only marry a second wife with approval from a judge (Human Rights Education Associates). The Moudawwana did not abolish the institution of polygamy but instead implemented a strict set of guidelines. A judge is able to grant permission to those who want to marry another wife only after they present detailed documentation of their finances, valid,signed consent from their first wife or wives, and proof that all their wives will receive equal treatment. The reform has successfully reduced the number of polygamous marriages in Morocco. The abolishment of repudiation is an equally important change to the family code. A husband is no longer entitled to divorce his wife through repudiation and women are able to file for divorce for the reasons listed above. The changes in 2011 to the constitution include Article 19 stating, “men and women have equal civil, political, economic, social, cultural and environmental rights and freedoms” and “the state shall work towards the establishment of parity between men and women. » Morocco’s parliament recently reealed a penal code that allowed rapists to escape prosecution by marrying their victims. The change came two years after sixteen-year-old Amina al-Filali committed suicide after being forced, by her parents and a judge, to marry her rapist. Subsequently, Article 475 of the penal code became the subject of international debate and placed Morocco under intense scrutiny, forcing the country to make a change, albeit a particularly slow one. These changes are all significant strides for women’s rights in Morocco, but still leave much to be desired in terms of their implementation and reforms that were not made. Inheritance law dilemma The laws of inheritance have been a growing, contentious issue in the Muslim world. The traditional laws derived from the Qur’an were preserved in the most recent Moudawwana of Morocco. Changes to the inheritance laws have faced fierce resistance because of their specificity in the Qur’an. The sacredness of the words make them nearly impossible to question, but this has not stopped Moroccan feminists from trying to create a dialogue and implement change. Saida Kouzzi argues : “This law of inheritance was based on the fact that men were the head of the households, which is not the case anymore as many women are the ones who provide for the family or at least contribute in a significant manner.” Moroccan society does not function exactly as Islam dictates. Men do not always provide for the women in their families, as they should; more frequently, women have no relations with men and/or have an independent source of income. Families have been working around the law by leaving their property in the name of their children, especially the girls. Ultimately, if any changes to the inheritance laws are to be made, the religious and conservative sides of Morocco must be appealed to. Aida Alami asserts that the argument for change needs to include the fact that Islam is based on the concept of justice and thus there must be room to reinterpret the texts to be in line with the idea of justice. While many feminists, amongst other citizens, strongly desire, or are open to, consider changes to laws of inheritance, many Muslims reject the reform because of a desire to preserve tradition and follow the Qur’an’s clear orders. Muslims in the country opposed to the reform most certainly include women, even when the current laws have detrimental effects on them. This kind of understanding can also be applied when considering the legality of marital rape. It is not illegal or recognized as a crime in Morocco. Fatima Mernissi outlines the Islamic understanding that the only legitimate sexual intercourse occurs between married people, that marriage guarantees sexual satisfaction for both husband and wife, and that men and women are penalized for failing to provide sexual services to each other. This framework dictating the nature of sexual relationships within marriages exists to prevent zina or illicit sexual intercourse outside of marriage. Those who are most likely to engage in zina are sexually frustrated individuals, who are considered dangerous to members of the Muslim community (Fatima Mernissi). With this in mind, it may be hard for some individuals to understand a woman’s refusal to engage in sexual intercourse with her husband to the extent that they would consider sex, while she refuses, as rape. There is in fact an understanding that the man is entitled to withhold  material goods from his wife if she refuses his sexual advances (Fatima Mernissi). In an ideal world, husband and wife would happily engage in a sexual relationship with each other, but unfortunately, this is not always the case and the law must reflect this inconsistency. There is a long road ahead in Morocco for changing social attitudes and creating an atmosphere of open mindedness for reinterpretation of holy Islamic texts in order to legally guarantee women’s rights. Resistance to reforms To further understand resistance to reforms in the name of women’s rights, one must consider the history of the feminist movement in Morocco. Moroccan feminism grew out of the wealthy and urban ranks of women from Fez. These women all had fathers who were members of the Istiqlal party, which viewed women’s progression as a way to progress society at large. The advancement of women thus became a necessary stepping-stone towards modernization. For example, Hassan Ouazzani called for equitable inheritance laws because he viewed them as a necessary step towards establishing a “modern egalitarian society” not because the current laws are harmful to women. This notion of women’s rights for the sake of progress became problematic in the imaginary of many Moroccans, especially when considering their relatively newfound independence from various colonial powers. During and after the French protectorate period in Morocco, there was a rejection of western influence and change. This resistance to western ideals is one of the motivating factors, which delayed and prevents necessary changes in Morocco. Preservation of the patriarchal society Preservation of the patriarchal society is often enforced, not only by the average citizens of Morocco, but also by those in power. According to a data report from 2010 by the Justice Ministry, in 90% of cases, judges have granted permission for the marriage of minors. This is six years after the changes in the Moudawwana. Some may find a way around the law while others  may genuinely not be aware of the amendments. This issue extends to various other legal changes that the judges and people either refuse to enforce or remain ignorant of. According to Noureddin ELKhayaty, implementing the reforms throughout Morocco has proven to be a difficult challenge. Leadership Féminin conducted a study which revealed that 87% of women in six different rural areas of Morocco were unaware of the changes to the Moudawwana (Fatima Mernissi). Rural areas where men’s, and especially women’s, illiteracy rates are high are less likely to be aware of the changes. As a side note, even women who are aware of the changes in the law may still refrain from invoking their rights or reporting crimes against them for fear of various social consequences or lack of resources. Depending on one’s location and literacy level, some citizens, especially those that live in rural communities, may not be aware of the new laws and their new rights. Laws specific to marriage in the Moudawwana are particularly questionable in their effectiveness because rural communities do not always have access to court systems and legal contracts. Final word The most recent legal changes in Morocco in the Moudawwana and constitution are helping build a framework for protecting women’s rights, but more steps should be taken in order for the changes to be effective in everyday life. While changes to laws are extremely important, implementation and awareness of these changes is vital to their success. While women’s rights in Morocco have made significant gains in a legal sense, there is still work to do to achieve justice for women in everyday life.

Rabat – The Ministry of Health has refuted the findings of a report issued by database website numbeo. The online ranking lists Morocco’s healthcare system last on a list of 89 countries. The ministry issued a  statement  on Wednesday, August 21, emphasizing that the report lacks “scientific accuracy and the standards adopted by international organizations and competent authorities in the preparation of such reports.” “The data on which the countries were classified, including Morocco, lack scientific and objective accuracy and cannot be scientifically adopted to assess the level of health care at the national level,” added the ministry. The Ministry emphasized that the methodology used in the report also lacks credibility and does not meet the standards of organizations, especially the World Health Organization (WHO). The report, according to the ministry, is based on incorrect data and “not statistically represented to assess the national health system.” The Ministry also advised Moroccan news outlets against “inaccurate data and false reports “ by Numbeo. The ministry added that Numbeo is not affiliated with any international accredited institution for health statistics. The ministry concluded its statement by emphasizing the important “progress of health care, despite some constraints.”  The ministry added that the progress enabled Morocco to achieve important results in several areas, including the reduction of maternal mortality by 35% and children under five by 28 % between 2011 and 2018. Numbeo’s findings are based on a survey made through the contribution of  only 125 people. The narrow test group calls the survey’s reliability and accuracy into question. While Morocco acknowledges challenges in the health sector, several reports listed Morocco higher than a number of Arab and African countries, including the Health Assessment Questionnaire without Disability Index in 2018. The index ranked Morocco in 112th place ahead of Paraguay, Nigeria and South Africa.

Rabat – Police in Meknes arrested on Tuesday, August 20,  a suspect for his alleged involvement in hacking bank accounts and electronic websites. The police arrested the suspect thanks to  intelligence provided by the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST). The suspect was the subject of a search warrant from the National Criminal Police Brigade. Police opened an investigation after transaction reports at Moroccan banking institutions showed illegal access to electronic systems. The suspect allegedly hacked and robbed sums of money from the accessed accounts, a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said. A preliminary investigation identified the 30-year old suspect. Police seized a batch of computer tools, electronic stage media, and an unspecified amount of money. Police also seized transfer receipts. Police placed the suspect in custody pending further investigation into the circumstances of the case. The operation followed similar arrests of suspects involved in data hacking and blackmail. In July, Moroccan police arrested eight members of a criminal network who illegally accessed people’s electronic personal data for blackmail. The criminal network had engaged in hacking of social media accounts and using the contents, such as personal videos and photos, to blackmail the users into giving the hackers large amounts of money.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI addressed a speech to the Moroccan Nation on the 66th Anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the People. The Royal Speech aired on August 20.  During the royal speech, King Mohammed VI reiterated Morocco’s struggle with social disparities and the necessity to tackle the issue. The speech echoed a previous call in October 2017 when the King gave the opening speech of the autumn parliamentary session. The monarch then pointed out that the current development plan was unable to “reduce social and inter-regional disparities…and could not ensure social justice.”  In tonight’s speech, the King expressed his hopes that the development model, in its new version, will constitute a solid basis for a new social contract with unanimous support from the State and its institutions, the private sector, political unions, associations, as well as all citizens. The renewal of the development model aims to improve the living conditions of Moroccan citizens and to reduce social and spatial inequalities. The King indicated that the most disadvantaged categories of the population live in rural areas and in urban peripheries. “These segments of the population need further assistance, and greater attention should be paid to their conditions. Continued action is also required to respond to their pressing needs,” He added. The King explained that his preoccupation with social disparities across Morocco has been the drive behind his calls for the development of rural communities.  The King called for the facilitation of rapid access to basic social services, and the provision of the necessary support for schooling, and the fight against poverty. King Mohammed VI also emphasized that, in order to fight social disparities, Morocco launched the ambitious National Program for the Reduction of Disparities in Rural Areas. The King pointed out that the Kingdom allocated in the region of MAD 50 billion for the program’s implementation for the period of 2016-2022. However, the responsibility for social development does not fall on the State alone. The King addressed the populations concerned and incited them to take initiative to improve their living conditions and change their social situation. For this purpose, this must use the various means at its disposal. “One of the possibilities is to make sure they benefit from access to education, which is available throughout the country, and from vocational training opportunities and social welfare programs,” said the King. The King’s speech emphasized that the potential of rural communities must be exploited, with, as a priority, the Sulaliyat communal agricultural lands. King Mohammed VI recommended the mobilization of these lands for agricultural investment projects. The Sulaliyat lands were recently the subject of three important bills. The bills were unanimously adopted by the House of Representatives. These lands have long been a source of debate as women, also known as Sulaliyat, have been struggling for more than 10 years for equal rights of ownership. However, he clarified that “government efforts on their own will not suffice to ensure the success of such a major operation.” He insisted on the need for full coordination between the sectors concerned. The King called for using “the opportunities and possibilities offered in fields other than that of agriculture, such as rural tourism, commerce, and local industry” in order to “boost and encourage private initiative and self-employment.”

Rabat – In his speech for Revolution Day, King Mohammed VI encouraged Moroccan youth not to discount vocational training. The King recommended vocational training as a means to reduce the unemployment rate and social disparities, particularly in rural areas.  The King recalled that Morocco  has already put in place a national program to reduce social disparities with a budget of MAD 50 billion for the period 2016-2022. The program seeks to improve access to  education, vocational training opportunities and social welfare programs in rural areas of the kingdom. The King also emphasized the importance of reinforcing the agricultural sector. He  also drew attention to the need for development of rural tourism, commerce, and local industry to bo boost self-employment. The King insisted that a focus on vocational training approach  could serve as a concrete solution to reduce unemployment among youth, not only in rural areas, but also in urban areas. Morocco’s government has been facing pressure due  to unemployment rate. The low rate of employment has more severely affected rural areas due to the lack of job creation. The High Commission for Planning (HCP) said in a report earlier this month that cities created fewer job opportunities in the second quarter of 2019.  Morocco’s national economy created 7,000 job opportunities in this period compared to 117,000 jobs created a year ago. HCP finds that the unemployment rate stood at 8.5% in the second quarter of 209, compared with 9.1% a year earlier. “The number of unemployed people has declined from 1,103,000 to 1,026,000, following a drop of 77,000 in unemployed people,” the HCP said.  The unemployment rate in urban areas declined from 13.7% to 12.4%. The rate of unemployment, however, rose  in rural areas by 3.3% (+3%). Battle unemployment with vocational training To tackle unemployment, especially in rural areas, the King encouraged Moroccan youth to turn to vocational training. King Mohammed VI argues that vocational training will help to raise the rate of employment through the integration of Moroccan youth into the job market. .  The King said that “Passing the baccalaureate exam and going to university is not a privilege; it is just a phase in the education process.” He explained that receiving vocational training would open opportunities for professional integration and social stability. In 2018 and 2019, the sovereign chaired several meetings to urge the government to find concrete solutions to unemployment through vocational training. In today’s speech, the King said that he will continue to emphasize the importance of vocational training and manual labor role in achieving the integration of young people. The government has recently shared positive statistics, echoing King Mohammed VI’s argument on the efficiency of vocational training to curb unemployment. In December 2018, secretary of state for higher education  Khalid Samadi said that people who gain qualifications from vocational training schools are more likely to find jobs. Samadi said that a research report by the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training found that 63 % of students with vocational qualifications find jobs within nine months of graduation.  The official said that the study sampled 20,000 students. For the King, fields such as handicrafts could be a source of “income and a means for a dignified life for the people involved in it.” The King also said that  tourism and agriculture as well as agri-business related occupations help to increase employment. “Promoting vocational training is now an urgent necessity, not just to create employment opportunities, but also to enable Morocco to meet the challenge of economic competitiveness and keep abreast of global developments in various fields,” the monarch said. Between 2015 and 2018 Morocco opened 27 training centers across Morocco, Minister of Education Said Amzazi announced in January.  The minister added that the number of scholarships granted to vocational trainees increased by 177% between 2018 and 2019. He also believes that the quality of vocational training in Morocco is improving.

Here follows the full text of the royal speech: “Praise be to God, May peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, His Kith and Kin Dear Citizens, As is the case every year, we are commemorating the anniversary of the glorious Revolution of the King and the People with the same feeling of pride. This is an opportunity for us to reminisce about what this commemoration stands for, namely collective mobilization and commitment to the values of patriotism, sacrifice and mutual loyalty. I want this to be a continuing, ever vibrant revolution, whose torch is passed on from generation to generation. My revered grandfather, His late Majesty King Mohammed V – may he rest in peace – so aptly pointed out, upon his return from exile, that he had come back from the minor struggle only to engage in the major one.
His comrade-in-arms, my venerable father, His late Majesty King Hassan II, faithfully pursued that struggle, devoting his life to the establishment of the democratic institutions of the modern Moroccan state, in light of the country’s policy in the economic, social and human rights sectors. I have myself been carrying the torch to complete the mission, keep the trust and serve my people – a mission in which I take great pride. Dear Citizens, I have sought to put the Moroccan citizen at the heart of the development process, making sure Moroccans are the ultimate goal of development. To this end, I have systematically adopted an inclusive, participatory approach when addressing the major issues of the nation to make sure all key stakeholders are actively involved. It is the same objective I seek to achieve through the creation of the ad-hoc committee for the development model, which I will soon ask to tackle this crucial issue. The committee’s mission will be threefold: remedial, proactive and forward-looking; the goal is to look to the future with great confidence. I should like to emphasize in this respect the national character not just of the Committee’s task, but also of its recommendations and of the development model we aspire to – a model that will be one hundred per cent Moroccan. The committee will be expected to propose appropriate implementation and monitoring mechanisms, in addition to measures to make sure Moroccans will fully embrace the proposed model and collectively seek to ensure its success. I look forward to seeing the proposed development model become the cornerstone for the establishment of a new social contract in which all stakeholders will be involved: the state and its institutions as well as the driving forces of the nation, namely the private sector, political parties, trade unions, civil society organizations and the citizens. I want the new development model to serve as the backbone of the new phase, whose guidelines I set out in the last State of the Nation Address: a phase whose key features will be accountability and a comprehensive take-off. Dear Citizens, The purpose of revamping the development model and of the projects and programs launched is to ensure Morocco’s advancement, improve the citizens’ living conditions and reduce social and regional disparities. In fact, the segments of society most affected by difficult living conditions reside, for the most part, in rural areas and in the suburbs. These segments of the population need further assistance, and greater attention should be paid to their conditions. Continued action is also required to respond to their pressing needs. For this reason, I have called, time and again, for measures to promote development in rural areas, through income-generating activities, employment opportunities, faster access to basic social services, in addition to school enrolment measures and initiatives to combat poverty and vulnerability. The ambitious national program to reduce disparities in rural areas, to which a budget of nearly 50 billion dirhams has been earmarked for the period 2016-2022, is part of that endeavor. The populations concerned need, for their part, to be proactive in order to change their status in society and improve their living conditions. One of the possibilities in this regard is to make sure they benefit from access to education, which is available throughout the country, and from vocational training opportunities and social welfare programs. At the same time, all resources in rural areas should be tapped, particularly communal agricultural land (sulaliyat land), which l have asked to be used for the implementation of investment projects in the agricultural sector. It should be emphasized, in this regard, that government efforts on their own will not suffice to ensure the success of such a major operation. Indeed, government efforts must be supported by private sector initiatives and projects to inject strong momentum into agricultural investment projects, jobs and services, particularly in rural areas. I should like, in this regard, to stress the need for close coordination between the sectors concerned. In the same vein, we should make the most of the opportunities and possibilities offered in fields other than that of agriculture, such as rural tourism, commerce and local industry. The aim is to boost and encourage private initiative and self-employment. In this regard, I wish to insist, once again, on the importance of vocational training, especially in villages and suburban areas, to provide youths with skills, and thereby enable them to enter the labor market and contribute to the country’s development. Passing the baccalaureate exam and going to university is not a privilege; it is just a phase in the education process. It is even more important to receive training that opens up prospects for professional integration and social stability. I will continue to emphasize the role of vocational training and manual labor in achieving the integration of young people: • be it in the area of handicrafts, which is a source of income and a means for a dignified life for the people involved in it; • or in the area of agribusiness and agriculture-related occupations, which need to be concentrated in production areas, taking into account each region’s assets and specificities; • and also in the area of providing the qualified human resources needed in the tourist and services sector as well as in connection with the new jobs in Morocco in the car industry, in aeronautics and in modern technology. Promoting vocational training is now an urgent necessity, not just to create employment opportunities, but also to enable Morocco to meet the challenge of economic competitiveness and keep abreast of global developments in various fields. Dear Citizens, The community is like a solidly built house; the middle class constitutes its strong foundations, and the rest of society its other components. In recent years, a middle class has, by the grace of the Almighty, emerged in Morocco and is turning into a productive force as well as an element of cohesion and stability. Considering its importance in the life of the community, the middle class ought to be preserved. Measures should also be taken to strengthen it, expand its base and promote social mobility to and from the middle class. These challenges cannot be met unless higher economic growth rates are achieved, more wealth is created and fair distribution of that wealth is ensured. The average growth rate achieved by Morocco during the last two decades is a cause for optimism. This was accomplished in spite of the fact that our country is ranked using the same criteria and standards as for gas and oil-producing countries. Regardless of the discussion on growth rates and figures, what matters most is to seek to overcome the obstacles impeding the achievement of high economic growth rates that contribute to prosperity in society. On a different level, I believe that full and optimal implementation of advanced regionalization and administrative devolution is one of the most effective mechanisms that can help boost local productive investment projects and enhance regional equity. However, despite the efforts made and the legislation adopted, many matters are still being dealt with in Rabat, at central government level. Consequently, the rate of project implementation is slow, and some projects are quite simply abandoned. I therefore call on the government to make this issue a priority, tackle administrative shortcomings and make sure highly qualified human resources are made available at the regional and local levels to address the challenges of the new phase. Responsibility is shared. We have now reached a stage in which no hesitation or mistakes are allowed – a stage during which we must come up with solutions to the problems standing in the way of development in our country. Let me say, at this point, that we should not be ashamed of weaknesses or of past mistakes. Rather, we should benefit from them and learn the lesson to tackle shortcomings and make sure we are on the right track. Dear Citizens, The purpose of the glorious, epic event of 20 August was to liberate the homeland and secure its independence. That epic event has been reinforced by the greater struggle we have been waging for the progress and prosperity of Moroccans. I pledge to continue to carry the torch, for there can be no loftier sign of loyalty to the souls of our honorable martyrs, nor any greater motivation to serve the citizens and fulfil their legitimate aspirations. My revered ancestor, Prophet Muhammad – may peace and blessings be upon him – said: “No man earns anything better than that which he earns with his own hands. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.”

Rabat – It was a media bombshell, the news that stirred up policy circles in Washington DC, scandalizing some and pushing others to ask for accountability: Maria Butina, an alleged Russian spy, had unrestricted access to the most powerful conservative circles of American politics. Faced with robust evidence from American intelligence, Butina pleaded guilty in late 2018, acknowledging that she used her solid relations with the National Rifle Association (NRA) to lay the groundwork for a more Kremlin-friendly US leadership.  The story reverberated in the entire American commentariat, shocking conservatives and outraging liberals. the Washington Post reported, Politico fumed, the New York Times pointed fingers, all of them sounding accusatory and slightly vindictive even as they strove to remain attached to objective and emotion-free reporting.  For a country like the US, known for its media deeply affected by the divisive dichotomy of conservatives vs. progressives, there was an unfamiliar aura of agreement to the NRA-Keene-Butina story.  Shying away from the usual Republican-Democrat ideological complexion of American politics, all major publications pointed out that David Keene, the former NRA president and still influential board member of the organization, was critical to the unfolding of the Butina scandal.  Keene was the focal point of the NRA’s romance with top Russian figures, including Alexander Torshin, the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia and Butina’s “handler,” according to reports. In a lengthy investigative effort on the “decade-long Russian campaign to… influence the outcome of the US presidential elections,” Rolling Stone uncovered the centrality of Keene in paving the way for Butina and her “handler” to “infiltrate” America’s conservative circles.  “Leading the American cohort was the NRA’s president, Keene, who delivered his address promoting Russo-American unity,” the newspaper said of the high-profile inauguration ceremony of the Right to Bear Arms, Russia’s NRA-inspired gun-activism group that Burtina created prior to traveling to the US. But that was only 2013 and, as later events would reveal, the cozy relationship between top Russian figures and the Keene-led NRA was only beginning. In December 2015, Keene, heading a delegation of senior Republicans, including some key figures of Trump’s presidential campaign, attended another Right to Bear Arms event in Moscow. The event came as a suggestion that a marriage between the two groups had, by then, been consummated. Keene reportedly requested John Bolton, who was then a top NRA official, serving as the body’s international affairs subcommittee, to record a supportive video for the event. Burtina was indicted in July 2018, having pleaded guilty of using her NRA ties “on behalf of the Russian Federation,” using her guns-related activism to “tilt the Republican Party in a pro-Kremlin direction.” But, one may be tempted to ask, why does it matter to Morocco that Keene was part—supposedly unwittingly— of Kremlin-okayed operations to further Russian interests? How is an exclusively US domestic issue, or a potential feud with Russia, relevant to Morocco? The answer, as suggested to the Daily Beast by a European intelligence officers in the wake of the Keene-Butina-Kremlin story, lies in the fact that Keene led a body, the NRA, whose influence is second to none in terms of setting America’s conservative agenda and sponsoring the political aspirations of most Republicans, be it for winning the White House or seats in both US congressional houses.  “The NRA is quite powerful, so when you look to influence US politics, you should consider them as a convenient target,” the anonymous European officer said.  The Washington Post reported on December 13, 2018, that the NRA spent some $30 million in 2016 as part of its efforts to help Donald Trump win the presidential election.  Given the established influence that donor’s money has on Washington policymaking, $30 million says a lot about the type of clout that the NRA may have on the Trump administration, despite reports of minor signs of fissures after news emerged of the Russia-NRA story.  What makes the Keene story particularly salient to Moroccan interests is that in Keene’s eventful career as a Washington lobbyist, Algeria has featured quite prominently in the big picture.  When the Butina scandal broke out, Keene was already on Algiers’ payroll to advance Algerian interests in US policy circles.  The former NRA president is influential in the highest echelons of the governing  Republican party. And with a $ 30,000 per-month contract, Keene is especially expected to influence the general narrative on Western Sahara in Algiers’ and Polisario’s favor, the central mission being to paint Rabat in as bad a light as possible. The strategy, usual in such cases, seeks to promote the legitimacy of the Polisario’s “victim” and “colonial occupation” narrative. But can there really be a Keene effect on US’ Sahara position? Or has there already been one? “President Trump,” Bloomberg recently reported, is a “big fan of the NRA.” While that is supposed to say a lot, there is a lot more to the story, judging by recent developments in Western Sahara. In the latest UN Security Council voting on the mandate of MINURSO, the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, the council, reportedly upon US’ request, decided to renew the mission’s mandate by only six months. The move was unprecedented, as the usual renewal length was one year. Later reports indicated that the until-then unheard-of-move to cut the MINURSO mandate may have been orchestrated by John Bolton. The New Yorker called it the “Bolton effect,” citing diplomats who endorsed the narrative that Bolton was indeed the mastermind of the US’ MINURSO move.  But for all Bolton’s seemingly pro-Polisario sentiments, he cannot, as a US official, cross some sensitive thresholds. Morocco is a strong US ally and, between allies, some things never change, no matter who is in power. But Keene can cross such dangerous thresholds, the heart of a typical lobbyist lying where the funds lie, even if that means, as the Butina case has shown, going against US interests for personal gains.  Meanwhile, Keene was virtually left untouched, even if few in Congress have called for “deciphering” and giving more resonance and a broader platform to exposing how lethal a number of his actions have been US interests while he keeps on adorning his public persona and statements with patriotic and “American values”-laden tropes.   Most importantly perhaps, at least as far as Rabat is concerned, Keene’s recent contract with Algeria is hardly the first time that the veteran Republican influencer has expressed sympathy for the Sahrawi “cause.”  In December 2010, Keene penned an op-ed on supposed misconduct by Moroccan security forces in a “peaceful refugee camp” in Western Sahara. “Guns blazing,” Keene said in the piece, “Moroccan forces broke up a peaceful encampment of Western Saharans.”  Morocco’s Western Sahara claims, he went on to argue, constitute “a less-than-accurate narrative” solely convincing “as long as those to whom it is sold don’t discover that it is little more than fiction.” The article unsurprisingly struck an emotional chord, garnering tense reactions.  Among the flurry of responses, both pro and anti, one pointed out that, as a veteran Washington lobbyist, Keene has few qualms about “seriously distorting [the] truth” when money, in this case his huge paycheck from Algiers, is involved. But even more challenging to Keene’s article was a December 9, 2010, New York Times report. “A fog of rumors and propaganda has helped obscure the fact about what happened here last month,” the Times wrote, referring to claims like Keene’s that Moroccan security officers had stormed a refugee camp and killed dozens. “The truth, it soon emerged,” the Times report continued, “was virtually the opposite: knife-wielding gangs from the camp attacked unarmed Moroccan officials, killing 11 of them.” The sweeping-under-the-rug-style of denial seems to be a favorite Keene trope, for that is exactly how he reacted to the responses to his 2010 op-ed. Even though the reality on the ground did not support the narrative his piece had sought to promote, Keene’s response was as brazen as it was audacious. Keene denied being a pro-Algeria lobbyist. But, as far as post-2007 developments in Western Sahara are concerned, Keene’s denial of his lobbying for Algeria was hardly the most critical part of his response.  “The World Court and the United Nations agree with Algeria and the Western Saharan position on this question,” he wrote. The statement was downright ignorant to the fact that Morocco’s 2007 Autonomy Plan had by then been welcomed by the UN Security Council, especially France and the US, as “serious and credible.” Jibing at Morocco in his Hill op-ed, Keene remarked: “Controlling the narrative becomes even more important when few Americans are familiar with the facts.” Perhaps Keene was talking more about his own relationship with the facts than he was about Morocco’s supposed game of twisting the reality in Western Sahara, a Moroccan official who requested anonymity told Morocco World News. Whereas PR gurus like Keene are more concerned with cherry-picking and fact-twisting to “control the narrative,” Morocco is convinced that it has to proceed smoothly and patiently to win as much international support as needed to make its position prevail, the source continued. But where does Morocco get that confidence, the assurance that even an impeccably well-paid aggressive PR giant like Keene will not prevail? “Because historical evidence is on our side, and more and more countries are waking up to the reality that Morocco’s autonomy plan is serious and the only politically feasible alternative,” the source argued. This optimism may have been buttressed by the “good news” that recently came from Washington, with President Trump signing a Morocco-friendly 2019 spending bill. Most recently, there have been subsequent reports that the Washington and the Trump administration do not in any way plan to torpedo the strong, strategic alliance with Morocco.  However, Washington is yet to go beyond a verbal, in principle support of Morocco’s stance, and a shrewd lobbyist like Keene is bound to take this to that mean US support for Morocco is far from a foregone conclusion.  Between December 2018 and April of this year, Keene and his wife and business partner, Donna Wiesner, “met with the who’s who of GOP decision-makers.”  According to lobbying disclosure forms from the Department of Justice, Keene attended a sizable number of Republican political events in that period, meeting with as many as 40 members of the highest echelons of America’s governing party. Predictably, among the GOP figures Keene met are Patrick Lehay and Senator Inhofe, two of the US’ most strident, loudest pro-Polisario voices in the US Senate, in addition to some members of the Trump administration.  But also central in Keene’s contract with Algiers is writing articles and issuing press content to “facilitate a greater understanding of Algeria’s concerns and positions on various issues.” This is a coded way of saying that Western Sahara is the piece de resistance of Keene’s pro-Algeria lobbying.  Through rebranding, or agenda setting, or narrative claiming, the point of such a mission is to launch venomous, ferocious attacks on the opposing side’s stance. More specifically, the endgame is to shift popular opinion around Western Sahara from UN-moderated territorial dispute to decolonization battle. “If Americans knew more about what Jim Baker, John Bolton, and elected officials like Senator Inhofe have learned about the ongoing human disaster in the Western Sahara,” Keene wrote in his latest tirade against Morocco, “all of Rabat’s lobbyists and diplomats would lose their ability to keep the US from stepping up pressure to force their country to live up to its promises.” The piece, published in the American Spectator, a conservative outlet, is a passionate vindication of Algeria-backed secessionism in Western Sahara. He continued: “The problem is that few Americans even know that Africa’s last colony exists. After discussing the issue recently during a radio interview, my host broke in to say, ‘I’ve never heard anything about this until today.’ He will hear far more about it in the future …” At its most profound, the substance of Keene’s visceral anti-Rabat rhetoric, his vow that his radio host “will hear far more about it [Western Sahara] in the future” is a faithful echo to the faux humanitarianism of most of Polisario’s American friends, most notably including Keene himself and Senator Inhofe, whom he tirelessly mentions in his Western Sahara hit pieces.  Reading through that recent Morocco-bashing piece from Keene, there is a glaring silence on the latest, significant breakthroughs accomplished in the past months under Horst Kohler’s supervision. Oblivious to what many observers have acknowledged as impressive socio-economic transformations in regions like Laayoune and Dakhla, Keene presents the whole of Western Sahara like some godforsaken corner left, unchallenged, at the mercy of Morocco’s colonial greed and expansionist ambitions.  What about the deep history of the disputed territory? What of the overwhelming consensus over the seriousness and feasibility of Morocco’s autonomy plan? What does keene have to say to those whose support for Morocco is entrenched in their fear of the inescapable security and stability challenges associated with secessionism in a region known to be on the radar of terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State?   But asking such questions is to invite Keene to provide the kind of answers he has no intention of engaging with. For the very fiber of his lobbyist, financial interest-driven thinking is to do what is needed to keep his contract, to accumulate financial incentives from his public pronouncements of passion for or genuine interest in “just causes.”  It is easier, more convenient to throw in Morocco’s way the most classical pro-Polisario tropes like “occupation” or “Africa’s last colony” than admit the contradictions of Polisario’s “Sahrawi nationalist cause.”  At the same time, while it is often warranted to reproach Morocco its suspicion of “journalists, academics, and NGO activists who may hold pro-Algeria secessionist views on Western Sahara,” the painful truth is that Keene’s advocacy solely hinges on the economic benefits he gets from throwing Morocco under the bus. Money, not a heartfelt interest in the painful lives of Tindouf camp refugees, is the distinctive benchmark of Keene’s publicly expressed passion for Western Sahara, of his espousal of the “Sahrawi cause.”  When discrediting Morocco, Keene is faithful to the pro-Polisario propensity of embracing the woke, third-worldist enthusiasm about saving “the wretched of the earth,” or the downtrodden of Western Sahara. Undergirding this ubiquitous rhetorical tool among advocacy specialists is the effectiveness of alarm sounding in the form of a boiling sense of rage, or the undimmed outrage of a stouthearted people battling against the disastrous yoke of colonial occupation.  “Over the years dozens of U.S. Congressional and Senate delegations have visited these camps and come away convinced that the promised referendum is the Sahrawi’s only hope of ever regaining their homeland and freedom,” Keene said of the pervasive misery in Tindouf in his American Spectator piece.  He explained his own espousal of the pro-Polisario narrative as an intimate act of rebellion, a genuine interest in the welfare of Tindouf refugees. “I first visited the camps fifteen years ago and my daughter served for about six months as a volunteer in them a few years later.” Further: “My concern for what I saw then and have learned since has led me to agree to work with the Algerian government on this and other issues of concern to Algiers because through the years Algeria, while eschewing any interest in the Sahrawi land, has hosted their refugees and worked with the parties to support their desire for the right to determine their own future.” This is effective as an agenda setting, a public action galvanizing device in a global affairs environment more driven by perceptions than facts, whether they be historical or present.  But it goes without saying that Keene’s affection-cloaked proclamations are more about performance than personal affiliation: The moment Algeria finds a more effective lobbyist and terminates its contract with Keene, the former NRA president will most probably throw himself in the embrace of the next bidder, his next client–rather than continue the fight for the cause of his professed “friends in the desert.”  Keene’s sincere-sounding concern would have been defensible, even admirable had he been a pro bono lobbyist for a cause he dear to his heart, to his socio-political identity. As a lobbyist who makes his living by taking on another’s burden and concerns and making them his (as long they are bound by a client-advocate covenant), however, Keene’s every move in the Western Sahara case most likely follows the “what will I get in return” mindset.  For all his self-righteous finger-pointing and lamentations about “Moroccan occupation,” Keene sees Algeria, Polisario, and “the Sahrawi” as his clients–and nothing else.  Keene’s, fundamentally, is a self-serving rage that has very little to do with a disinterested investment in bettering the painful lives of the subjugated other.

Rabat  –  Moroccan football player Mehdi Carcela has allegedly turned down an offer from Qatari football club Al Sailiya. The Belgian news outlet, La Dernier Heure (DH), reported that the football player is attached to his Belgian club.

Rabat – Mayor of Rabat Mohamed Sadiki announced that the much needed new buses will take their first passengers on August 21. Sadiki took to his Facebook to announce the news on Tuesday, August 20. “I have been asked several times by several national media outlets in recent days (…) about the delay of the launch of operations of the new buses. I have repeatedly replied that the new buses will be launched soon as I could not give a specific day due to some necessary arrangements, ” said the mayor. He added that now he can bring good news to the inhabitants of Rabat, as the launch of operations of the new buses will start on August 21.  The new Alsa-City Bus buses will replace the current fleet run by Stareo.  Stareo has been serving citizens in Rabat and its twin cities for many years. Alsa City, a joint venture between Moroccan company City Bus and Spanish company Alsa, won the tender by public transport provider Al Assima in January 2018 to manage the Rabat-Sale public bus system. The contract promises a MAD 10 billion investment into the bus transport system in the region (approximately $1.2 billion) over the next 15 years. The contract includes bringing over 300 new buses to Rabat-Sale.

Rabat – American cosmetics brand Nars, in its traditional fashion, has caused a stir with a raunchy campaign for its “Morocco” lipstick shade, a nude color with cinnamon tones. The lipstick is part of Nars’ “After Hours” collection. The campaign, posted to the brand’s social media accounts, shows the lipstick molded into a phallic shape before melting into the shape of a traditional lipstick bullet. Adding to the sexual tone of the campaign is the caption: “When the nudes keep you up at night.”   When the nudes keep you up all night. Reach the dawn with Morocco Lipstick, a warm cinnamon. #NARSAFTERHOURS A post shared by  NARS Cosmetics (@narsissist) on Aug 11, 2019 at 4:08pm PDT  The video has received mixed reactions on social media. Some didn’t appreciate the overt sexuality of the campaign, calling it inappropriate since the campaign could be exposed to children. I’m tired of NARS overly sexualising makeup it’s so unnecessary and tacky, just stop https://t.co/bG3nTpA5uS — Blossom💸 (@cle_eaux) August 13, 2019  Others respected the brand’s bold choices and pointed out this is nothing new. The brand is famous for its sexual shade names, like the iconic “Orgasm” blush, and lipsticks “G Spot” and “Deep Throat.” Nars know sex sells and they’ve stuck to it, eg. their product names – ‘orgasm’ palette, ‘deep throat’ blush, ‘climax’ mascara. It works for them, doesn’t come off tacky and gets people talking. Genius. https://t.co/y4B5TzTQZC — MABINTOU (@MABIN2_) August 12, 2019  watching people freak out over this like Nars hasn't been using sex appeal in their brand marketing and concepts since inception is hilarious https://t.co/PwhcXbajCQ — nickntv on twitch ♡ 🏳️‍🌈 (@NickNMedia) August 12, 2019  The campaign can be considered a successful one: as the saying goes, any publicity is good publicity, and the phallic lipstick lit up Twitter.

Rabat – Social media has been alight recently with complaints of restaurants, bars and hotels overcharging in Morocco, particularly in the North, where tourism is rife during the summer season. Moroccans are taking to social media to share photos of receipts with shocking prices. One receipt, in particular, is raising eyebrows, showing a bill of over MAD 5000 from L’Orizon, a seafood restaurant in M’diq, a Mediterranean town in between Ceuta and Tetouan. Another bill from the same restaurant, this time for MAD 1245, is also making rounds on the internet. The picture was posted on Facebook by Jawad Chafik, a member of the Socialist Union of Popular Forces in the Moroccan Parliament.  احذروا هذا المكان/المصيدة..اليوم أسيدي، و بمناسبة عيد ميلاد الشابة وئام، قلنا ما فيها باس نخرجوا مع المدام و لوليدات… Publiée par Jaouad Chafik sur Jeudi 15 août 2019 In his post, Chafik warned others against the restaurant, calling the owners “bloodsucking vampires.” He added that the restaurant must be the best in Africa to charge MAD 1000 for a kilo of fish. The politician’s post quickly went viral, receiving 3.5k shares. The owner of the restaurant, in the middle of unexpected controversy, took to Facebook to hit back against Chafik’s post on August 17. “Dear clients, just like you we have seen the post from the politician calling us bloodsucker,” said L’Orizon. “We received the gentleman and his family, 6 adults and 3 children, and they ordered 4 entries, 6 dishes , and desserts, at an average price of 140 dh per person.”  Chers clients, nous avons vu comme vous un post d un deputé qui se plaignait de la  chereté de notre restaurant et nous… Publiée par Lorizon sur Samedi 17 août 2019 The restaurant asserted that Chafik was fully aware of the prices when he ordered the food, as they are clearly displayed on the menu he read from. The post then claims that Chafik caused a scene when the bill came nonetheless, threatening to use his position as a politician to harm the restaurant’s image if the price was not lowered. Wanting to further defend themselves, the restaurant prepared the amount of food Chafik ordered on that day to show it was not a small amount. “Dear customers, after the controversy a few days ago, we decided to prepare the order that was published on the receipt worth 1245 dhs,” the post read. “We let you contemplate the pictures of the dishes with a breathtaking view of the Mediterranean. Our institution has values, of which transparency is the pillar,” said L’Orizon. “The entire team works to achieve excellence in terms of service and dishes. Our cuisine continues to innovate to improve and adapt to our customers.”  Chers clients, aprés la polémique survenu il y a quelques jours, nous avons décidé de preparer la commande qui a été… Publiée par Lorizon sur Lundi 19 août 2019 However, the restaurant’s posts did not do much to dampen the controversy, with outrage continuing on social media. “A food bill for a few minutes in a restaurant in the North is equal to a professor’s salary for a month.. and they wonder why the goal of 10 million visitors to Morocco has not yet been achieved!!” read one post with over 60 shares.

Rabat – Human Rights Watch (HRW) has finally commented on the “arbitrary” arrest of its leading member Ahmed Benchemsi. On August 9, Algerian security services arrested the Middle East communications and advocacy director at HRW at 2 p.m. The security services held him captive for ten hours. Authorities also seized his passport. The passport was not returned to him for ten days. Algerian authorities deported him on August 19, according to HRW. The organization condemned his arbitrary arrest. They also denounced the treatment of Benchemsi by the Algerian security services who prevented him from contacting anyone. “They held him without allowing him to contact anyone, confiscated his cellphone and laptop computer, and ordered him to provide his passwords to unlock both devices, which he refused to do.”  Kenneth Rooth, executive director of HRW said that Benchemsi was in Algiers “simply doing his job observing human rights conditions.” HRW commented that Benchemsi’s arbitrary arrest “and mistreatment send the message that authorities don’t want the world to know about the mass protests for more democracy in Algeria.” HRW said that Benchemsi entered Algeria legally, disclosing his professional affiliation when asked. “He had visited Algeria three times previously since 2017 for Human Rights Watch.” The organization said that it did not make any public announcement in order to end “Benchemsi’s ordeal as quickly as possible.” When released at midnight on August 9, the security services asked Benchemsi to report to a police station. The police then asked for the passwords of his electronic devices. “When he refused, they gave him a summons to return the next day.” “Algerian authorities returned his passports and electronic devices before he boarded the plane. He entered Morocco without incident,” HRW reported. HRW also condemned  Algerian authorities for not notifying Benchemsi of any charges against him, and for arresting him and seizing his electronic devices and passports. HRW also claimed that Algerian police did threaten him with physical violence, “but did not physically mistreat him.”

Rabat – International NGO the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has called on the Moroccan government to “respect” the process of medical students. In a press release, published on August 19, the NGO expressed support for the medical students and condemned the “arbitrary measures taken by the authorities against them.” The medical students have been carrying out protests and strikes since March. They are protesting against poor medical training conditions, as well as the government’s decision to privatize medical education services. In the statement, the human rights NGO said that it has been following the situation of medical students with concern. “The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor is following with concern the protests of medical students at faculties of medicine in the Kingdom of Morocco and the unjustified arbitrary measures taken by the authorities against them,” the NGO wrote in its press release. The Geneva-based organization also called on the government to respect the protests of the medical students. For the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, Morocco should work to “find serious and reasonable solutions” to strengthen public universities against the privation of medical studies. The NGO also attacked the Minister of Education and Vocational Training, Said Amzazi, who has repeatedly called for the students to take the final exams. He has threatened to fail those students who continue the boycott. “Those who will take the exams are welcome, and those who will miss it should shoulder their responsibility,” said Amzazi. In response, the NGO said it deplores the “government’s threat against 18,000 students to fail or expel them because of their protest.” The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor also condemned the suspension of three professors for supporting the students’ protests.
 The ministry’s statement to suspend the professors reads: “due to your breach of professional commitment… you have been suspended from work with the suspension of your salaries.” The NGO condemned the suspension of the professors and called on the government to  “bring back the three academics to work without conditions, especially that the decision to arrest them violates the most basic rights guaranteed by the Moroccan Constitution and international conventions.” It also recalled that the Moroccan constitution grants the right to peaceful assembly and freedom to express opinions during peaceful protests.

Rabat – Khaled Nezzar,  the Former Algerian defense minister has directly attacked Algerian military chief Gaid Salah in a publication he shared in Algerian news outlet Algerie Part. Nezzar also spoke about the purge of Algerian military officers led by Gaid Salah throughout the months of crisis in Algeria. The popular movement in Algeria emerged after former Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced his intention to run for a fifth term as the head of state. The decision caused frustration among citizens, who had been calling for Bouteflika and his allies, including Gaid Salah, to step down from power. While several officials surrendered to the demands of Algerian citizens, Gaid Salah is still determined that a dialogue could help end the crisis. Salah is intent on keeping controlling Algeria’s army. Algerian protests, however, are persisting in their protests for a democratic country, and the removal of all elements of the Bouteflika regime from power.  “Gaid Salah prides himself on having a double cap and believes he can afford anything. This arises from a sick mind that should be reduced at all costs and quickly,” Nezzar wrote. Nezzar explained that his accusations against Gaid Salah have no political objectives. “My retirement in 1993  shows my complete disinterest in power. It is not now, and at my age, that I would seek to play any political role,” said Nezzar. He added that he refuses to live the last days of his life without denouncing the way  his country is “being abused.” Nezzar also spoke about the beginning of Salah’s military career. “His career was quite ordinary.” In the 70s in Tindouf, Nezzar said that he discovered that Salah was blamed by colonel Mohamed Salah Yahiaoui for abandoning troops without support during the Amgala I battle. The battle between Algeria and Morocco took place on January 27, 1976, in the oasis of  Western Sahara, 260 kilometers west of the border with Algeria. “Poor soldier, Gaid Salah will be discredited sooner or later. He retained his position thanks to his political loyalty, which he believed he had acquired from Bouteflika,” Nezzar said.

Rabat –  Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita, met with his Sierra Leonean counterpart, Nabeela Tunis, on Monday, August 19th, in Rabat. The meeting aimed to discuss ways to enhance bilateral cooperation between the two countries in all areas of common interest, including the promotion of regional and continental peace, economic progress, and human development. The two ministers expressed their satisfaction with the progress of the cooperation between the two countries since the Second Session of the Joint Commission of Cooperation between the two countries held in Rabat in 2008. Bourita commended Sierra Leone’s “remarkable development,” and reaffirmed the readiness of Morocco to support the Sierra Leonean efforts to further boost development. Tunis praised the Moroccos efforts in contributing to the peace, stability and prosperity of the continent. She also expressed the importance that the Sierra Leonean government attaches to maintaining good relations with Morocco. The two ministers agreed to hold regular consultations and to support each other on issues that concern the fundamental interests of the two countries. They also agreed to hold the next Session of the Joint Commission of Cooperation between the two countries in the Sierra Leonean capital, Freetown. The Sierra Leonean minister reiterated her country’s “continued support” for the territorial integrity of Morocco, praising “the efforts made by Morocco through the Autonomy Plan to find a peaceful and political solution” to this issue. Sierra Leone, which withdrew its recognition of the self-styled Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in 2003, is only an example of a number of other countries that do not recognize SADR., Barbados, Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, among others, have all declared their support for Morocco’s territorial integrity.  Read also: Moroccan Government: Withdrawals of SADR Recognition Will Continue

Rabat – A Moroccan driver violently rammed the Moroccan side of the Ceuta border on August 13. The incident was caught on camera by a bystander who published the video on Youtube. Moroccan police unsuccessfully tried to detain the driver, who crossed into Spanish territory.  One of the Moroccan officers pulled out his weapon while another was unsuccessfully trying to break the driver’s window.  Despite all the officers’ attempts, the driver was able to cross the border, entering Ceuta at high speed in his bruised Volkswagen Polo. According to Elperiodico, usually, one or two similar “kamikaze” incidents occur annually in Ceuta. “Drivers pass through the border of El Tarajal, ramming the barriers with their cars, or taking advantage of the slightest police inattention,” says the Spanish daily. Elperiodico reports that “the Moroccan national tried above all to avoid being arrested in Morocco, at the price of committing a crime in Spain.” The driver was stopped on the sea road bordering Ceuta’s El Chorrillo beach after colliding with several cars. The car did not contain any drugs or loot of theft, only a large knife.  Elperiodico indicated that the territory the driver managed to reach was on an anti-terrorism alert level 4. “His escape may have ended in tragedy,” says the news outlet.

Rabat – Ivanka Trump, daughter and advisor  to US President Donald Trump, has praised Morocco’s efforts to ensure equality between Moroccan women and men in terms of inheritance. Trump’s daughter took to her Facebook to send a special thanks to the Moroccan government and to the Moroccan ambassador to the US, princess Lalla Joumala. On Monday, August 19, Ivanka wrote that the US applauds the “Moroccan government for this important step towards the adoption of inheritance law amendments, and look forward to supporting their full implementation.” She also expressed satisfaction with the leadership of the Moroccan ambassador to the US princess Lalla Joumala, and the work of the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative.  “ W-GDP [Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative] will continue to support women’s land rights and I appreciate the strong leadership of HH Princess Lalla Joumala,”  she posted. W-GDP aims to reach “50 million women in the developing world by 2025 throgh US government activities, private-public partnerships, and a new, innovative fund,” according to the White House. The message comes a few weeks after the House of Representatives unanimously adopted  three bills related to communal agricultural land (sulaliyat).  The three bills have been described as a “long awaited reform” by the Minister Delegate to the Minister of Interior, Noureddine Boutayeb. The official said in July that the adoption of the draft texts is the result of “several achievements and developments during the last years.” A long awaited reform The three bills have been described as a “long awaited reform” by the Minister Delegate to the Minister of Interior, Noureddine Boutayeb. The official said in July that the adoption of the draft texts is the result of “several achievements and developments during the last years.” The draft laws took into account the aspirations of rights holders, including women also known as sulaliayt. The women have been struggling for more than 10 years for equal rights of ownership. The bills are also in accordance with royal instructions. In October 2018, King Mohammed VI  said that it is “necessary to find appropriate legal and administrative mechanisms to facilitate rights holders’ ownership of some of the fallow land.” The monarch added that “this must be done according to specific conditions that take into account the actual implementation of projects, the need to curb the excessive fragmentation of agricultural land and the provision of the technical and financial support needed.” Since King Mohammed VI ascended to the throne in 1999, the promotion of women’s rights has been on his agenda. Morocco introduced  a new family code to grant more rights to women in both marriage and divorce. Morocco also introduced the 2011 Constitution, which made gender equality one of its priorities. Article 6 of the constitution stipulates that the“public powers work for the creation of the conditions permitting the effectiveness of liberty and of the equality of citizens [feminine] and citizens [masculine] to be made general [generaliser], as well as their participation in political, economic, cultural and social life.” Article 19 also emphasized the need of equality between both men and women. “The man and the woman enjoy, in equality, the rights and freedoms of civil, political, economic, social, cultural and environmental character.”

Rabat – Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, gave her fans and supporters a lesson in Moroccan cooking while praising the use of medicinal cannabis. In the nine-minute video, posted on Facebook by a fan page under the name “We love Mrs. Sara Netanyahu,” the Prime Minister’s wife prepares Moroccan-style vegetarian meatballs alongside Tal Gilboa, a vegan animal rights activist, and the official advisor for animal affairs. Gilboa asked Netanyahu what she thinks of cannabis. “Cannabis is a very important thing for sick people, for those who suffer,” Netanyahu replies. “There really are people who need cannabis… and medical cannabis is a blessing, and I only hope that as many people as possible can access it,” she added. Netanyahu’s comments come in the wake of new laws being put in place last July by the Israeli Ministry of Health, facilitating access to cannabis medical purposes in Israel. Sara Netanyahu’s son, Yair, recently caused a stir among Moroccans in May after he called on Arabs and Muslims to “free occupied Arab Islamic lands” beginning with Ceuta and Melilla. He posted the statement to his 28,600 Twitter followers, saying “Dear all Arabs and Muslims, Want to free occupied Arab Islamic lands? Here’s a good start!” Attached was a map of the Spanish enclaves in Morocco. The tweet received 1,200 replies, the overwhelming majority disagreeing with the 27-year-old’s statement.

Rabat – Tomorrow, August 20 marks the 66th anniversary of the King and the People’s Revolution Day, a date that carries more than just details of a local history.  Morocco marks this date annually to remember the efforts and the resistance of Moroccan people against French colonial rule. On August 20,  1953, the French colonial power forced King Mohammed V into exile to Corsica. French authorities then exiled him to Madagascar in January 1955. The colonizers, however, were not aware of the attachment and respect Moroccan people had for their Sultan. Moments after France announced its decision to send the Moroccan Sultan into exile, tens of thousands of citizens across all regions of Morocco rallied to protest the move.  According to historical sources,  French authorities exiled the ruler for his resistance. The monarch had refused to sign a “pact of surrender,” writing French domination over Morocco into law. French authorities exiled the King with plans to replace him with  Mohammed Ben Arafa, a sultan born in 1886. However, the French colonizers had not been expecting wide resistance from  Morocco’s National Liberation Army. Through their staunch resistance against the French colonial authorities, the Moroccan people, and more particularly the Moroccan Liberation movement,  showed their love and loyalty to the sultan and to their country.  Mohammed V’s exile ended after  27 months on November 16, 1955, when the sultan returned to Morocco to reign as King. On the return of King Mohammed V to Morocco, he began negotiations with France for independence.  One year after his return, Morocco gained its independence in March of 1956.  Despite the passage of over 60 years, the new generation of Moroccans still remembers this significant date. It’s importance to Moroccan history continues to reverberate. In 2017, King Mohammed VI said in a speech to commemorate the revolution day that the date is more than “just a landmark event in Morocco’s history. That event reverberated across the Maghreb and the rest of Africa as well.” The King also believes that the Moroccan revolution inspired other African countries to rise up against their colonizers. “Thanks to its spontaneous, popular character, and the values of sacrifice and loyalty underpinning it, it inspired liberation movements in the Maghreb and across Africa,” King Mohammed VI said. Morocco’s independence from France did not mean the end for the country’s battle for sovereignty over its own territories. Morocco had to fight, first for the freedom of  Tarfaya from Spanish rule, which it gained in 1958, and then, for Sidi Ifni.  The Spanish were reticent to give up their strongholds in southern Morocco for economic reasons. Spain finally returned Sidi Ifni to Morocco in 1969, after protracted negotiations. However, this did not end Spain’s colonial hold over southern Morocco. Spain retained control over Western Sahara, intent on establishing a satellite state to maintain its grip in the region.           Led by the late King Hassan II, son of Mohammed V, the 1975 Green March served as a catalyst for the reunification of Morocco with Oued Eddahab on August 14, 1979. After several years of intense negotiation between Morocco and Spain, as well as the United Nations, Spain finally relinquished it hold over Western Sahara. Spain still holds the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in northern Morocco. Morocco’s ongoing struggle for sovereignty over its territories continues to this day. Rather than the army of freedom fighters, Morocco is now mobilizing its diplomatic forces to gain support from the international community on the question of Western Sahara. For Morocco, establishing internationally recognized sovereignty over Western Sahara is the key to finally achieving a unified, whole, and independent nation.

Rabat –  Moroccan Health Minister Anas Doukkali met, on Sunday, August 18th, with Chinese officials from the National Health Commission. At the meeting, held during the visit of the minister to the University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Shanghai, the minister and the Chinese officials discussed the possibility of creating a Chinese-Moroccan center for traditional medicine in Casablanca in the future. The director of university hospitals in the Chinese National Health Commission mentioned that the potential center would specialize in traditional medicine in its three dimensions: treatment, training, and scientific research. He also noted that this institution would be a reference center in North Africa. The Moroccan health minister emphasized the importance of opening up to the Chinese experiences in the field of traditional medicine, adding that Morocco has great potential in the field of medicinal plants. He also announced a future agreement to implement training sessions in this domain, between the University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Shanghai and Hassan II University in Casablanca. The meeting was held on the sidelines of the 2nd Chinese-Arab Health Forum, which was organized in Beijing, from August 16th to 18th, and represented an opportunity for Chinese officials, health ministers, and other representatives from different Arab countries to exchange experiences in the domain of health. The project, which is still in the conception phase, would be part of the “Belt and Road Initiative”, a global development strategy adopted by the Chinese government. The initiative aims to develop infrastructure and investments in 152 countries and international organizations. It would also consolidate the friendly, collaborative relationship between Morocco and China. Bilateral relations between the two countries were strengthened after King Mohammed VI’s visit to China in May 2016.

Rabat – Used to the cool supermarkets and boutique delis of London, Oxford and Dorset, I found shopping in the markets of Derb Sultan quite a shock. I regularly set out to buy tomatoes and parsley and came back empty-handed, overwhelmed by the noise and confusion, and struck dumb by the shouts of the vendors. The embarrassment of coming home having bought nothing and having to tell my husband I had, again, failed in a simple task due simply to ingrained Europeanness and timidity was too much. I found a supermarket through a quick Google search and began to do my shopping at Acima. A two-hour round trip on foot. Having always been a reasonably adventurous person, I couldn’t stand having been beaten by Moroccan markets. I woke up one morning and decided that today I would go out and buy something, even if it was just one clove of garlic. Determined, I put on my shoes, picked up my raffia shopping bag and headed for the door. “Acima?” my husband asked as he saw me walk past his office. I nodded, I was not going to tempt fate by telling him I was going to conquer the market place.  Setting off, with a steely resolve down the road that leads from the butchers’ market next to our flat, towards the covered spice and olive market, I dodged the blankets and wheeled carts, laden with vegetables, fruit, cleaning equipment, herbs, and even turtles. At this point, feeling confident and optimistic, I strode into melee. As I passed, the vendors screamed prices and offers. “Ashraaa, ashraa” they cried continuously, waving their wares in the faces of shoppers as they try to find a path through the crowds. Struggling to find a gap to negotiate the crowd of shoppers and the ever-moving hand carts, I looked desperately around for an escape route but was not going to give up that quickly. Ducking under the umbrella of a wheeled pineapple cart, I took a shortcut into the covered market. The distinctive smell of chicken feces permeated the air but as I turned down a second, shaded, corridor, the smell of olives and pickled vegetables took over. The sheer choice was overwhelming. Stalls upon stalls were covered in olives of different colors in different marinades and the proprietor of every stall stared down at me, offering tasters, greetings, and cries of “Madame, madame, shoofi, shoofi” look, look!  I considered trying to purchase MAD 5 of mixed olives, turned to look at the nearest vendor who immediately lurched forward “Oui, oui, Madame, Madame, Bonjour, Hello!” Suddenly, the words in French, English or any other language seemed to have disappeared from my head. I felt as though I had shrunk, like Alice in Wonderland, to the size of a mushroom. I felt that my voice wouldn’t reach the ears of the dozens of olive purveyors staring down at me. Chickening out, I thought perhaps some onions would be a better idea.  Exiting the market through a side gate, I turned towards the vegetable vendors in a neighboring street. Here there were women’s voices calling the prices; offering shelled peas, parsley, carrots, and every type of herb. Perhaps this would be easier, I paused to consider some onions on a cart presided over by a kindly looking old woman, but, just as I opened my mouth to speak, a donkey dragging a cart of potatoes, fresh from the blad (countryside), almost ran me down. Swerving, I found myself next to a stall selling plastic kitchen items.  “Bonjour, ca va?” said a voice in my ear. Turning, I saw an unknown man, who I presumed was the proprietor. I smiled and carried on walking. The man, who was not the plastic bucket vendor but had other intentions, followed in hot pursuit. “Mademoiselle, ca va?” he said, louder this time, reaching out for my arm. Jerking it away, I sped towards the end of the road, it was quieter, there were fewer people. I paused to breathe, then hurried home, defeated.  Being defeated by a market was just absurd, I told myself sharply. So the next day, I put on my fiercest face and set out to try again. I negotiated the moving stalls, ignored the shouts, and even managed to smile at a neighbor and say “Labass?” how are you? Finally, in the relative tranquility of the covered market, I chose a stall at random and approached. Immediately, the proprietor, a tall man with a white beard, sprang to his feet “Bonjour, oui, bonjour, oui?” he cried. I stood my ground and quietly asked “Afuk juj dirham touma”, MAD 2 of garlic please. The transaction was a success, I walked away from the stall clutching my two small bulbs of garlic and feeling extremely proud of myself. Thrilled with my success, and feeling as though I could manage any transaction now, I walked home, head held high, and boastfully showed my treasure to my husband as soon as I got through the door.  As time went on I became bolder and bolder. It started with the odd spice, but by the end of a month, I bought vegetables, went to the butcher, and even went so far as replacing our broken tagine.  However, pride comes before a fall, and it was not long before I realized that the vegetable vendors, spice purveyors, and even the man who sells tagines had been taking me for a ride. One morning, having checked my purse, I realized that I didn’t have enough cash for my outing, so I asked my husband to provide. He gave me MAD 20, “that’s not enough,” I said, rather irritated. “I thought you were going to buy vegetables,” he responded questioningly. “Why do you need so much money?”  A trip around the market with my husband showed me the error of my ways. While he could buy several onions, tomatoes, potatoes, and parsley for under MAD 15, I had been spending double that amount on half the produce. That evening, more than a little downcast, I decided that the only way forward was the supermarket where the prices are fixed. My husband, however, had other ideas. He advised haggling. Tourists generally kept to Habous, on the other side of the school. Knowing that whatever I wore, my face and voice would always give me away as a ‘tourist,’ I had to make it clear that I was not to be taken advantage of.  Once more into the breach! The next day, having cut through the covered market to the vegetable stalls on the other side, I filled a tub with vegetables and then handed it over to the vendor, a short woman wearing a tea towel as a headscarf who smiled with blackened teeth. She looked me up and down, as though weighing up what she thought I could afford. Taking in the sunglasses and the fitflops, she asked for MAD 35. No, too expensive. I turned to leave, abandoning the vegetables, my face set. “Humstache,” fifteen, she called after me. I accepted. The first try had been a success.  The longer I lived in the area, the easier it became. The vegetable vendors and stall proprietors started to recognize me and, I think, appreciated or laughed at my slightly underwhelming efforts to speak in Darija. I became a regular at the same vegetable stall and the woman with the blackened teeth even engaged in small talk with me about the seasonal vegetables.  I started to frequent the same spice stall in the covered market, and, eventually, the proprietor even sent his daughter to our school. I successfully bought meat, and became a regular at the hanout, corner shop, across the street. While I’m sure the prices I was quoted would not be the same for my husband or any other local, they did seem to get lower and lower and, by the end of two years, I began to feel almost as though my status as a ‘tourist’ was beginning to wane.  We have since moved to Essaouira where I will absolutely not fall into old supermarket habits, despite having yesterday been charged MAD 50 for two tomatoes and a bottle of water at my local hanout.

Rabat – Morocco has allegedly ranked a low on Health Care Index from the global database website, Numbeo. The ranking listed Morocco last on the list in terms of health care. Venezuela and Iraq ranked  88th and 87th, respectively. South Africa tops the list in Africa as it ranks 49, followed by Tunisia 59th, and Algeria 68th. In addition to the ranking, Numbeo also shared the findings of a survey, which studied Moroccans’ reactions to health care in Morocco. The survey shows that people have low confidence on speed in completing examinations and reports at Moroccan health centers. Moroccans are also not satisfied with “friendliness and courtesy of the staff” and with “responsive in medical institutions”, and cost to the patient. The survey, however, is made through the contribution of  120 people, which raises questions about the reliability of Numbeo. Reliable ranking? While the Moroccan government has acknowledged the deficiencies in the health sector, several reports have listed Morocco higher than several Arab and African countries. In 2018, Morocco ranked 103rd at the  Legatum Prosperity Index. The index showed that Morocco dropped  15 places on health, but listed Morocco ahead of several other countries, including Senegal, Zambia, Guinea, and South Africa. Morocco also positioned itself in a significant spot on the Overall Best Countries ranking in 2019. The ranking listed Morocco as the 42nd out of 80. Morocco also ranked 29 in the 2018 World Health Organization’s Ranking of the World’s Health Systems. Morocco was listed ahead of Canada 30, Finland 31st, and  Australia 32nd.    The Health Assessment Questionnaire without Disability Index in 2018 also ranked Morocco in 112th place. The report measures the health system performance for 191 countries. The list shows Morocco ahead of several countries, including Palestine, Paraguay, Cape Verde, Nigeria, South Africa, and Mongolia. Health crisis  In 2018, President of the Court of Auditors Driss Jettou submitted a report to King Mohammed VI  on the government’s performance in implementing social programs and reforms.  The report found several irregularities in the health sector. Jettou also shared alarming loopholes in medical services, such as the lack of specialized doctors and specialized medical services. The situation led King Mohammed VI to address Morocco’s health care issues in several events and speeches. In April, the King said that “reforming the primary health care system should be one of the main pillars of this drive, together with the Kingdom of Morocco’s commitment to press ahead with efforts to achieve universal health coverage by 2030.”  In response, the government promised to give more priority to supporting social policies and reducing social and spatial disparities in the 2020 budget draft bill. Saad Eddine El Othmani, Head of Government earlier this month emphasized the importance of improving and generalizing health care services, guaranteeing citizens access to quality services and ensuring conditions that preserve their dignity. The crisis in the health sector led to protests by doctors and medical students throughout the year. Last week, the Independent Union of Public Sector Physicians (SIMSP) called for public doctors to strike, continuing the crisis in Morocco’s medical sector. The doctors protested against the lack of working conditions in the public sector and for an increase in wages.

Rabat – The Moroccan Institute for Fisheries Research (INRH) has launched a call for bids for the construction of a new coastal research vessel. The estimated budget for the project is over MAD 25 million. According to INRH criteria, the ship will be 20 by 6.5 meters. It will sail alongside the Moroccan coastline, with a few deep-sea incursions. It will carry a team of scientists in addition of a crew of INRH personnel to handle sailing and operating the ship, bringing the total number of passengers at 12 for short term coastal missions, and four for longer missions of over 24 hours. The ship’s research missions will help provide reliable information on the size and variety of fish populations present in Morocco’s waters. This will, in‌ ‌turn, assist in guiding the country’s fisheries and conservation policy, preventing overfishing, and making sure the country’s marine resources remain available for future generations, thus realizing the INRH’s core mission of building a sustainable fisheries model for Morocco. In addition to marine research, the INRH also works to improve the overall fishing industry through market and supply chain research. The institute works with both large corporations and small scale, independent fishermen, many of whom still rely on traditional methods, in order to optimize their while preventing overexploitation.

Rabat – In February 2019, the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) decided not to recommend the use of Smecta for children under two, or to pregnant and breastfeeding women. In recent weeks, the recommendation caused concern in Morocco. Medical professionals and users of the medicine alike, want clarification on whether the medicine is safe for adults, and whether it will remain on the market in Morocco. According to ANSM’s website, this recommendation applies to all diosmectite medications used to treat diarrhea, gastric burns, or gastroesophageal reflux disease. The recommendation targets Smecta and its generics. The cause of concern is the presence of lead in these clay-based medicines. Highly absorbent, clay obtained by soil extraction for medical purposes captures many impurities and small amounts of heavy metals, such as lead, naturally present in the environment. Despite the cleaning process the clay undergoes to be transformed into drug, tiny quantities of the metal persist. Following new international recommendations on drug-acceptable thresholds for heavy metals, the ANSM asked laboratories marketing clay-based medicines to ensure that there is no risk of lead passing through blood in treated patients, and especially in children. In response, IPSEN Laboratories provided a clinical study on the subject. The results indicated that there is no risk of lead passing into the blood of adults treated with Smecta for 5 weeks. However, ANSM states that this risk can not be ruled out for children under two. Therefore, it is recommended as a precaution not to administer Smecta or its generic Diosmectite Mylan to children under 2 years of age. In 2018, Smecta ranked fifth in IPSEN ’s sales reaching €126 million in revenue, says Statista website. The ANSM’s recommendation caused concern and confusion in Morocco. Dr. Mohamed Lahbabi, president of the Confederation of Trade Unions of Pharmacists of Morocco (CSPM), explained to Moroccan channel 2M.ma that “the ANSM has only recommended to no longer prescribe Smecta to children under two.” Lahbabi also criticized the “false information” relayed by certain Moroccan newspapers and news sites. He further reprimanded “the amplification of the ANSM’s warning and of the information relating to the prohibition of sale and withdrawal of Smecta from Moroccan pharmacies.” World Health Organization (WHO) defines lead as “a cumulative toxicant that affects multiple body systems and is particularly harmful to young children.” WHO considers that “there is no known level of lead exposure that is considered safe.”

Rabat – The ship “Al Amir Moulay Abdallah,” built in the framework of Moroccan-Japanese cooperation, provided oceanographic services to the Moroccan Government and has severely deteriorated in recent years. National Institute for Fisheries Research (INRH) acquired the ship in 2001. According to INRH, the “Al Amir Moulay Abdellah” Research Ship is dedicated to small pelagic (fish living in waters near the surface below 200 meters deep) surveys and oceanographic campaigns. The oceanographic campaigns allow for the collection and monitoring of the main parameters of the marine environment, and the eggs and larvae of the pelagic species. According to Huelva información, the ship arrived in Huelva on August 13.  Spanish company, Desarrollos Navales Astilleros De Huelva SL will carry out the repairs. The company specializes in the repair and maintenance of ships. Repairs to the ship will include the application of high-pressure water jetting on the entire ship’s structure. Water jetting will serve to remove the significant amount of oxidation damage to the ship due to the salinity of the environment. The Spanish company will carry out further repairs on the ship, such as painting, treatment of the steel structure, and the updating of all its mechanics and pipe networks.  Francisco Gallardo, Head of Development Shipyards of Huelva, told Huelva Information, “what we do now is try to repair broken things; for example, when we hoisted the ship, some cables were broken due to the ship’s long-time neglect and lack of  maintenance.” Huelva informacion reports that the ship’s repair will take 25 days,  the equivalent of about 5,000 hours of work.

Rabat – Israeli forces killed three Palestinians in the north of the Gaza strip. The death of the three Palestinians came after three rockets were “allegedly fired” at Israel from the blockaded enclave, according to Al Jazeera. The Israeli response to the alleged rocket attack killed three Palestinians civilians and seriously injured a fourth.  On Saturday, August 17, Israeli forces posted on twitter that they have opened fire against “suspects” from Gaza. Israel also attacked parts of the northern Gaza Strip via helicopter and tank, Al Jazeera reported. Gaza Health Ministry, according to Al Jazeera, announced that Israeli forces have killed 300 protesters and wounded  17,00 others since the start of “the weekly Great March of Return” demonstrations in 2018. The demonstration started in March 2018. It calls for the right of Palestinians to return to their homes after they were expelled during the 1948 founding of Israel. The recent Israeli assault came a week after Israeli forces invaded Al Aqsa mosque compound and assaulted Palestinian worshippers during Eid Al Adha prayers on Monday, August 11. The forces used tear gas, sound grenades, and rubber bullets to drive worshippers out of the holy site, as dozens of Jewish settlers came to mark what they call the holiday of Tisha B’Av. The assault resulted in at least 14  injuries among Palestinians.

By Yahia Hatim Rabat – The National Foundation of Museums (FNM) has put three sculptures on display in front of the Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art. The special exhibition is in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of King Mohammed’s ascension to the throne.  The FNM worked in coordination with the Wilaya of Rabat and the City Council to designate spaces to display the three sculptures. The display of these sculptures represents an invitation for the public to discover the museum and its surrounding area. The FNM believes that free, accessible art can transform public spaces.  These artworks also serve as a preview of the first international biennial exhibition of Rabat.  This exhibition organized and financed by FNM will exhibit the artworks of 60 female artists from 30 different countries.  It will take place in different places across the capital. The Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, the Villa des Arts, the Art Gallery Espace Expressions CDG, the Oudayas Museum will all display installations as part of the exhibition. The exhibition will, taking place between September 10th and December 10th, 2019. The most famous of the sculptures on display is the “Horse with Bridles”, created by the Colombian figurative artist and sculptor Fernando Botero. Born in 1932 in Medellin, Botero is known for his signature style, called “Boterismo.” The style usually depicts people and figures in exuberant mass and volume.  Botero’s large-scale sculptures have been displayed in the streets of a number of cities around the world, including New York, Paris, London, Moscow, Florence, Madrid, Singapore, and Tokyo. Not far from Botero’s imposing 3 meters high and 2 tonnes heavy bronze sculpture, a triptych of polished black marble sculptures by the Moroccan artist Ikram Kabbaj is also on display. Born in 1960 in Casablanca, Kabbaj is one of the most important sculptors in the Arab world.  Advocating for the integration of sculptures in public spaces, Kabbaj has organized international conferences that brought pieces of art to the streets of El Jadida, Tangier, Fez, Essaouira, Taroudant, and Assilah. Kabbaj has also exhibited her work several times in Morocco and abroad. The third and final sculpture on display is the “Maasai Warrior”, sculpted by the Senegalese sculptor Ousmane Sow. It portrays a warrior holding a shield and a spear. Born in 1935 in Dakar, Sow was inspired by photographs of the Nuba people of southern Sudan and began work on a series of larger-than-life sculptures of muscular Nuba wrestlers in 1984. Sow then moved on to portraying other ethnicities such as Maasai people, Zulu people, and Native Americans.  Sow’s work has been exhibited internationally and he was elected as a foreign associate member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The display of these sculptures comes as part of an FNM campaign, on a royal decree, to facilitate access to art for the public and make art more inclusive across the kingdom.

Rabat – The Wall Street Journal’s report, analyzing  Washington’s position on Western Sahara, has resulted in wide international media coverage. Tanzanian newspaper Daily News has commented that the position of the US administration will be a great disappointment for Polisario’s leadership. The newspaper explained that, according to the WSJ report, the US has made it clear that it will not support the establishment of a new state in southern Morocco  The Tanzanian paper also extolled Morocco’s huge efforts to boost the development of its southern provinces, including in the city of Laayoune. The “official” news agency of the Polisario Front has claimed that the author of the WSJ publication, Dion Nissenbaum, relied exclusively on his conversation with the Moroccan Foreign Affairs Minister, Nasser Bourita to inform his article. However, the publication clearly stated that “officials involved in the talks said the U.S. has made it clear that Washington won’t support a plan that leads to a new African nation.” Several other African news outlets widely shared the WSJ’s report, including Le Journal du Cameroun. The news outlet reported that Trump’s administration said that it is aware of the situation in the Sahel and the Sahara. “Aware of the dangers posed by Polisario, the White House is determined to put an end to this conflict” Le Journal du Cameroun said referring to the WSJ report. Africa Press said that any attempt  to “derail the UN process could cause discontent and destabilize one of the most stable regions on the planet.”  The  WSJ mentioned in its report, published on August 11  the approach adopted by John Bolton, who seeks to end the mission of the peacekeeping operation in Western Sahara, otherwise known as MINURSO. WSJ used a statement from an interview with Bourita, who argued that MINURSO’s presence in the region is necessary to keep the region safe from terror threat. “Is the danger to the U.S. from 230 people from MINURSO or…. the fact that the Islamic State and al Qaeda are able to attract people from Indonesia, from Casablanca and elsewhere?” Bourita said. In addition to the report, the Wall Street Journal also published a video in which its national security reporter Dion Nissenbaum spoke about his recent visit to the region. Aware that no Western reporters have been allowed in the area, the reporter said that he was invited by the Moroccan government to discover how the North African country is seeking to end the conflict. Nissenbaum said that, while the Polisario and separatist activists want independence, the US and Morocco don’t see that as a possibility. “A new state in Africa could in fact be more insecure,” he said.

Rabat – An Algerian court has ordered the expulsion of Ahmed Benchemsi, Advocacy and Communications Director for Human Rights Watch (HRW) the Middle East and North Africa division. The court ruled that Benchemsi entered Algeria without any official authorization to act as a representative of HRW, local media said.  An investigation allegedly indicates that his trip to Algeria was “part of a foreign agenda aimed at infiltrating” the popular movement or Algerian Hirak. Algerian security services arrested Benchemsi on Friday, August 9 during the 25th week of Algerian protests. The continuous protests in Algeria are part of the Algerian popular movement against the government and Algeria’s army chief Gaid Salah. Algerian news outlet TSA said that the police released Benchemsi at midnight on Friday, August 9, after several hours of detention.  Benchemsi, the founder of Moroccan news outlets Telquel and Nishan, has criticized human rights issues in the  MENA region. In March, Benchemsi published “An Algerian Spring Day,” a piece in which he described the situation surrounding peaceful protests. The publication came after he and one of his colleagues attended one of the protests. Benchemsi’s recent visit to Algeria, however, was not an official mission. Al Watan news outlet reported that “It is true that Benchemsi was not in Algeria on an official mission.” HRW has not yet commented on the arrest nor the release of its leading member.

Rabat – Morocco’s permanent representative to the UN, Omar Hilale, has visited Denmark to inspect the Supply Division Warehouse of the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF).  Hilale is president of UNICEF’s executive board and made the visit with the secretary of the executive board, Hai Kyung Jun of South Korea, on Friday, August 16. The ambassador visited the warehouse in Copenhagen, Denmark, to “ensure that its activities meet the needs and priorities of children and their families,” according to state-run news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Hilale met the warehouse’s director, Etleva Kadilli, who spoke with him about the warehouse’s work. UNICEF’s mission is “to save children’s lives, to defend their rights, and to help them fulfil their potential.” The UN organization operates in 190 countries and territories to promote children’s health and education. The organization also works with children facing conflict and disaster. The Copenhagen warehouse provides 38 different kits, many of which are used in emergency situations. After assembling the kits, UNICEF sends them to “remote schools, health posts or camps,” according to MAP. With over 20,000 square meters, the UNICEF warehouse is the largest humanitarian warehouse in the world. UNICEF bases its supply division in Copenhagen but also has warehouses in Panama and the UAE. UNICEF is currently working in Morocco with the Ministry of Health to reduce child mortality, especially among Morocco’s rural population and the poor. The 2011 National Survey of Population and Family Health (ENPSF) found that children born in rural areas are more likely than those born in urban areas to die before their fifth birthday. Children born into the poorest 20% of the Moroccan population are twice as likely to die before their first birthday as those born into the wealthiest 20%. UNICEF also works with the government of Morocco on education outcomes, child safety, and social inclusion. Ambassador Hilale will address the next UNICEF meeting in New York in September to report on his visit to Copenhagen.

Rabat – Couscous is also a traditional meal in Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania, and Libya, and North African Jews also brought the dish to Israel. Throughout Europe and North America, instant couscous, which is pre-steamed and dried, has found widespread popularity as a healthier alternative to rice and pasta.  While the origins of the dish are disputed, most sources point to the Imazighen, who are the indigenous people of North Africa. After Islam reached the Maghreb in the 7th century, eating couscous after Friday midday prayers gradually became an authentic Moroccan tradition. Couscous has been a staple in the North African diet for centuries, and remains so today.    The various “couscous wars” over the true genesis of the dish point to the importance of couscous in the national heritage of the Maghreb and beyond. Most notably, Morocco and Algeria tend to quarrel for recognition of ownership over the dish.  Despite this dissent, couscous truly belongs to no one and everyone—its cultural significance cannot be confined to modern conceptions of borders and nations.  Just as the history of the Amaizgh people cannot be bound to a single bordered territory, the cultural legacies of North Africa’s natives trespass contemporary political and social spaces.   In Morocco, Friday couscous constitutes more than just a nice meal. In this communal society, the tradition is especially valuable as it provides regular opportunities for families to gather.  “The taste of couscous reminds me of my family,” says a 22-year-old man from Rabat. “Fridays aren’t complete without it.” On Fridays in Morocco, children and teens have the afternoon off from school, and many businesses and offices close for a few hours to allow employees to enjoy the meal–some workers even get the whole day off. Not everyone stops working, of course, but the streets become rather empty as Muslims head to the mosque for prayers.     When prayers are over, the calm abruptly ends. The unlucky drivers that happen to be passing by a mosque after the final sala inevitably get stuck in a swarm of worshippers heading home or stopping to pick up dessert at the fruit carts that gather around mosques during prayer. As soon as everyone arrives at home, the meal is served. Couscous can be rolled into balls and eaten by hand or with a spoon. Regardless of one’s personal method, proper couscous etiquette includes washing your hands thoroughly before eating and sticking to your own section.  After the meal, families snack on fruit, take naps, lounge, and chat at home for hours. Most will venture out to a cafe to meet with friends, run some errands, pray again, and then return home for tea time between five and seven. Others have to go back to work, but not until a few hours after eating.   Moroccan couscous has come to be associated with the country’s renowned hospitality. The meal has been enjoyed by tourists and travelers for decades, and even celebrities and public figures have declared their love for the traditional meal.  Spending a Friday in Morocco is the best way to experience first-hand the country’s mouth-watering cuisine, as well as the more casual side of the country’s variable atmosphere.  Apart from the post-prayer rush from the mosques, Fridays in Morocco are rather calm–that is, until the souks, streets, and other social spaces come alive after the sun goes down.  Although Friday is not an official day of the weekend in Morocco like it is in other Muslim countries, relaxation, for many, begins after enjoying a generous heap of couscous.

Rabat – ShangaiRanking has released its 2019 Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), a list that compiles the world’s best universities from a selection of 4000. This year, no Moroccan universities made the cut of the top 1000. The top 10 universities are mostly American, with Harvard University in Boston taking the number spot. The UK also snagged spots in the global top 10, with the University of Cambridge placing at number 3 and the University of Oxford at number 8. Only 15 African universities placed in the top 1000, one less than last year. South African and Egyptian universities represent most of the African universities that ranked, accounting for 13 of out the 15. As for universities in the North African region specifically, only one university placed, Tunisia’s University of Tunis El Manar, ranking in the 801-900 global class. The university was also the only African francophone university to rank. The Shanghai list assesses academic and research performance, including alumni and staff winning Nobel Prizes and Fields Medals, as well as highly cited researchers, to make its selection. Papers published in the Nature and Science journal and papers indexed in major citation indices are also taken into account. This naturally means that English speaking universities are favored in the ranking.

Rabat – The perfect combination of argan oil , ground almonds and honey is an ideal accompaniment to baghrir, bread, or anything you choose. Better than Nutella, or peanut butter, Amlou is a must for every kitchen. Argan oil, which is produced predominantly in southern regions of Morocco, is a key ingredient in today’s sweet, and nutty delicacy. The oil with its distinctive, nutty taste can be used in salads, tagines, and simply for dipping bread, however, when mixed with ground almonds it’s positively addictive. Most commonly found in the Souss region, known for its abundance of Argan trees, argan oil can be purchased throughout Morocco in souks, hanouts, cooperatives, and even supermarkets. A sweet paste or dip, Amlou is a delicious addition to any breakfast table and goes particularly well with baghrir, hersha, msmen, or bread. I have to admit, I even eat it on its own with a spoon when no one’s looking! Amlou is made at home by women using a stone mill to grind almonds, then they add argan oil and honey to form cohesive paste or dip. but anyone can make it without the stone mill by using a food processor to crunch the almonds into a silky-smooth paste. Once you know how to make Amlou, you’ll have no need for chocolate spread, nutella, or peanut butter. Just a few basic ingredients: :
500 grams of almonds 250ml of argan oil 125ml of honey Here’s how you mix it: : Put the almonds on a baking sheet and roast it in the oven for 15 minutes or until crunchy and golden brown. Let the roasted almonds to cool a little bit. Grind the almonds very well using a food processor until they are powdered, then add oil and while blending until you get a smooth and cohesive paste. Add honey and mix well then keep it in a covered jar in a drey and cold place. For those who prefer a less sweet flavor, hold back on the honey. Shake or stir the amlou before every serving. Taste the nutty, sweet deliciousness and enjoy!

Rabat – Blood collection centers across Morocco are lacking donations, leading to a critical shortage, according to the National Center for Blood Transfusion and Hematology (CNTSH). Khadija Lahjouji, the Deputy Director of the CNTSH, told 2M nationwide stock of blood bags is only 3802 blood bags, only 4 days worth. She added that large cities such as Casablanca, Rabat, Fez, and Marrakech are most affected by the shortage. Morocco encounters this problem every summer as people leave for vacation. “Summer is the time of the year when there are the fewest donors, in general, because people go on vacation,” said Lahjouji. The shortage comes despite a nationwide campaign in June to collect blood in mosques in Ramadan. The program was launched in collaboration with the Mohammed VI Foundation for the Promotion of Social Work by Religious Officials. The program was a great success, with CNTSH saying that it had even more donors than it could manage, but the shortage has nonetheless hit Morocco as the summer draws on. The shortage also hits Morocco outside of holiday period. In February, the Minister of Health Anas Doukkali initiated a national campaign calling on citizens to donate blood due to increasing demands in hospitals. The Ministry of Health stated that the annual need for blood has increased by 22 percent since 2012, while the number of yearly donations reaches no more than six percent. The Ministry added that “donating blood is a responsibility for all”, and aims to raise awareness concerning the importance of blood donors to patients in hospitals.

Spanish news outlet Horto Info has reported that Morocco exported 426,07 million kilograms of tomatoes to the European Union between October 2018 and May 2019. The number represents a 10 % increase in exports compared to the previous campaign. The main markets are France with 288,15 million kilograms in the 2018-2019 season, representing an increase of 7.76% compared to the last campaign. In the 2017-2018 campaign, Morocco sold 267,38 million kilograms to France. France paid Morocco a total of €378,02 million for the cargo. Morocco exported 59,35 million kilograms of tomatoes to Spain, an increase of 26,52% compared to the previous campaign. Morocco received a payment of €55,92 million for the tomatoes cargo from Spain. Morocco sold  46,91 million kilograms of tomatoes to Spain in the 2017-2018 season. Both France and Spain are among Morocco’s top trade partners in the European Union. In January, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) shared statistics from the European Statistics Office, emphasizing that Moroccan exports to Spain increased by 5.4 % during the first 11 months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Spain is  also the biggest importer of Moroccan goods  and takes in 41.6 % of all goods Morocco exports to the EU imports. France takes in 28.6 %, Italy 6.3 %, the UK 4.8 %, Germany 4.4 %.

Rabat – The Royal Armed Forces (FAR) will start the selection of conscripts chosen to perform the mandatory military service for the 2019-2020 year on Monday, August 19. FAR said in a statement that it will select 15,000 conscripts to perform this year’s military service. The statement also called on all people summoned to reach the military units mentioned  in the notice they received an on the date specified therein. FAR recalled that the 17 military units spread throughout Morocco are mobilized to accommodate the conscripts and transfer them by military coaches to training centers located in the cities of Larache, Al Hoceima, Bouarga Dakhla, Laayoune, Meknes, Agadir, Casablanca, Raza, Ojda, Errachidia, Kenitra, Ouarzazate, Mediouna, Tadla, and Guelmim. The statement quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) added that  several commissions will deal with the files of the conscripts. The military service for the 2019-2020 year will begin on September 1. Conscripts aged 19 to 25 are eligible to perform the mandatory military service. People with financial dependents or disabilities will be exempted from the military service. However, people over the age of 25 who were previously exempted can still be called up until the age of 40 if the reason for their exemption is no longer relevant. In June, the Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit said that the number of people who filled in the census forms to perform the military service has reached 133,820,  including 13,614 female volunteers. Last year in August,  a government statement announced that Morocco will re-introduce the military service after it was abolished in 2006. Before the reintroduction of the program, Moroccans were subject to 18-month military service in accordance with Royal Decree 137-66 in 1966. In 1999, however, Morocco reduced the length of service to 12 months. For Morocco, the compulsory military service seeks to “promote patriotism among the young, within the framework of the correlation between the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.”

Rabat – David Keene is at again. In an opinion article published on August 10, the Algeria-paid lobbyist vilified Morocco’s reputation and presented Algeria as the friend and savior of what he describes as Africa’s “last colony.” Keene built his case in the article on a single, sad event that occurred in the aftermath of the final of the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN), when reported clashes between the Moroccan police and pro-Polisario activists in Laayoune caused dozens of injuries and two deaths. Capitalizing on that incident, Keene presents Morocco as a “military, colonial regime” doing everything to ensure that news of its purported atrocities in the territory never reach the outside world, especially the United States. “The problem is that few Americans even know that Africa’s last colony exists,” Keene said. From one post-CAN incident, Keene’s readers are told that, by and large, Morocco is a colonial “invader” and a violent “regime.” Keene also seems upset by the fact that Rabat’s public relations strategy has been working in the US. “Rabat has spent millions of dollars on lobbyists and others in Washington to convince policymakers to do nothing” on the Western Sahara dossier. But he added, Morocco’s lobbying and diplomatic efforts in Washington have recently met with unfriendly winds after President Trump appointed John Bolton as his senior national security adviser. Rabat knew that the “troubling” appointment of Bolton would soon expose its “fiction” and “conspiracy theories” to the international community, according to Keene. In the process of presenting Morocco as the main culprit for the diplomatic stalemate that has characterized the UN-led negotiations on Western Sahara, the article exaggerates the appeal of the separatist Polisario Front as well as the seemingly humanitarian compassion of its Algerian backers. Keene says that “more than eighty” countries recognize the Tindouf-based Polisario “government,”when the number is not even close to forty in reality. A quick internet search would have shown Keene that while 77 countries have in the past expressed their support for “Saharawi self-determination,” only 35 have recognized the Polisario self-proclaimed Sahrawi Republic. But Keene was only interested in bashing Morocco, presenting it as a colonial occupier with no legal or historical claims to Western Sahara. Keene recently signed an extremely juicy lobbying contract with Algeria. The contract includes propagating pro-Polisario narratives in Washington, to influence US public opinion. According to the supplemental statement submitted to the Department of Justice’s Foreign Agents Registration Act unit last June, David Keene held over 40 meetings with members of the US Senate and of the Trump administration between December 15, 2018 and April 22, 2019. But his article presents his own stance on the “Sahrawi cause” as a result of his compassion and sympathy for the misery and poverty he says Sahrawis have been made to suffer in decades. “My concern for what I saw then and I have learned since,” he said of a trip to the Tindouf camps he made some fifteen years ago, “has led me to agree to work with the Algerian government on this.” This humanitarianism-cloaked activism, or save-the-world rhetoric is ubiquitous in US circles, including American evangelicals, close to the Polisario leadership. But where America’s evangelical humanitarians are politically and ideologically motivated in their crusade to advance Polisario’s narrative, Keene’s avowedly anti-Morocco rhetoric stems from the $30k a month lobbying contract binding him to Algeria, Polisario’ main political and military backer. Nowhere does Keene’s article mention the tense scrutiny the separatist front is facing for embezzling the humanitarian aid to the people living in dire conditions Tindouf  as well as reports of glaring violations of human rights in the Tindouf Camps, including torture in prisons and criminalization of political dissent. Keene also failed to even fleetingly mention the fact that a number of countries that once supported Polisario’s agenda have recently shifted allegiances, saying that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is more “serious,” “credible,” and more politically feasible. But more disconcerting still, although Keene’s article was published on August 10, days after the Polisario leadership called for war because “great powers support Morocco,” it remarkably omitted that episode. Keene also knowingly pushed aside a single fact that has been driving most of the debates on the Western Sahara issue over the past months: for security and stability reasons, the US and other countries with a notable say in the UN negotiations are more favorable to Morocco’s stance. The Wall Street Journal reported on the issue last Sunday. But the idea was already public knowledge back in April, when the UN Security Council adopted what has been widely described as a pro-Rabat resolution. But Keene, only interested in meeting the requirements of his lobbyist engagements, glaringly ignored reports about Morocco’s Autonomy Plan being lauded by an increasing number of countries, including some which used to side with Polisario. In Latin America, where Polisario used to boast almost unanimous support, Morocco’s “sincere” and “credible” efforts towards settlement have ended up convincing a number of governments to side with its stance. This has been described by some observers as a “diplomatic remontada,” with Brazil, Surinam, Chile, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic all embracing Morocco’s stance in the past two months alone. Brushing all these developments out of the picture, Keene insisted instead on the now dismissed “Bolton effect” idea reported by the New Yorker’s Nicolas Niarchos in December of last year. The suggestion that Bolton’s sympathy for the separatist front may overturn the traditionally strong US-Morocco ties and eviscerate Morocco’s Western Sahara agenda has largely become part of the diplomatic furniture in recent months. At least since March of this year, a series of reports have concurred that Washington helped Morocco to draft its autonomy plan and plans to stand by it. But Keene disagrees. In his reckoning, the “Bolton effect” is still a thing. “With the U.S. taking a more aggressive stance, the Trump Administration and the man Morocco hopes it can continue to ignore may end up freeing Africa’s last colony,” he said.

Rabat – In June 2019, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank Group released a private-sector diagnostic in Morocco titled “Creating Markets in Morocco.”  The document analyzes the Moroccan market making several recommendations. The aim of the diagnostic is to “stimulate private sector growth”, create jobs, and improve skills by strengthening “market competition for the benefit of the private sector”. The document recognizes that “private companies and, ultimately, consumers, are penalized by the shortcomings of the institutions and the regulations on the protection of competition.”  IFC’s comparative analysis of prices of major consumer products showed that prices are higher in Morocco than in other countries in the MENA region. The analysis reports that “the results of a national empirical evaluation comparing prices of bottled water in Morocco with those in the MENA region and beyond tend to show that prices are indeed significantly higher in Morocco.” According to IFC, empirical results indicate that the average prices of bottled water in Morocco are about 17% higher than those from a group of MENA countries. “Even after controlling factors that may affect prices such as per capita income, the cost of imports, or the tariff rate, the prices remain higher than the norm,” states the analysis. When comparing prices between major cities, the results of the analysis suggest a large price gap. “Inhabitants of Casablanca pay for bottled water on average about 50% more than residents of similar cities in the MENA region.” The IFC also recalled the boycott campaign launched in April 2018 against Les Eaux Minéraux d’Oulmes, dairy products company Centrale Danone, and the fuels company Afriquia. These companies were  “accused of practicing ‘exorbitant’ prices, between two and three times higher than in some European and Asian markets,” concluded the IFC. Bottled water boycott in Morocco The boycott began on April 20, 2018, when online activists launched campaigns on social media against three renowned brands: Afriquia gas, Centrale Danone and Sidi Ali. Besides the high prices of the companies’ products, citizens supporting the boycott also accused the brands of monopolizing the Moroccan market. Following Centrale Danone’s announcement, Morocco’s boycotted mineral water company Les Eaux Minerales d’Oulmes, after more than nine weeks of silence, confessed that the campaign caused a “drop in its revenues for the first half of 2018.”

Rabat – Habib Al Sayegh, editor-in-chief of the UAE daily Al-Khaleej, has condemned all Arab invitations to visit Israel. In a recent editorial, he strongly denounced the suggestion of open relations with the “Zionist state.” He also denounced the justification of Israel’s actions against Palestinians and demanded the boycott of Israel’s advocates. Al-Khaleej is among the oldest newspapers in the UAE. It is published in Sharjah and has always referred to Israel as the “Zionist enemy.” In one article, Al Sayegh said that “voices rise here and there, rushing to Israel, aiming to visit and support it, expressing their sincerest signs of love and loyalty.”  “Although we recognize that these voices are few and with limited impact, they are, as is apparent, increasing fast and perhaps the reason is us turning a blind eye,” Al Sayegh added. He also stressed how these voices should not be ignored or overlooked. He continued, “some have even taken shameful positions which no sane person would take.” Arab visits to Israel Last July, the Saudi blogger Mohammed Saud visited Israel at the invitation of its Foreign Ministry. He was harassed and cursed at while visiting the Temple Mount in Jerusalem’s Old City. A video of the incident shows a child spitting at Saud while others yelled at him to leave.  Al Sayegh described Saud, “who called himself Saudi media” as miserable when he was expelled from old Jerusalem. For Al Sayegh, the blogger deserved what “Jerusalem Arabs did to him.” The UAE editor-in-chief has criticized a number of figures, such as Anwar Eshki, Saudi Intelligence General, and Abdul Hamid Al-Ghabin, a Saudi writer, who failed, despite great efforts, to promote visits to Israel. Eshki had stated, in May 2018, on BBC that “Palestinians are Saudis, we do not have to defend them… and Israel had never assaulted Saudi Arabia despite being suspected of being an enemy.” Al Sayegh also sharply attacked Kassab al-Otaibi, a former Saudi dissident, and described him as “the worst of all, who dared deny the sanctity and importance of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the importance of Jerusalem as the eternal capital Palestine.” He further wondered “who authorized the normalizers (those in favor of normalizing relations with Israel) to speak on behalf of everyone?” stating that “no one has the right to talk on behalf of all Saudis or people of the Gulf, and then choose whether Israel or Iran is the enemy.” “Israel is a real and natural enemy to us, as it is the enemy of our Palestinian brothers,” he affirmed. Al Sayegh continued, “Israel, which did not fire at us once, is the enemy all Arabs have been united against, even if just with their hearts, conscience, and speech, indifferent to the transformations of the world around them.” “Israel is the 1948 ‘Nakba’ (Palestinian exodus), the 1967 ‘Naksa’, the massacres of Bahr El-Baqar, Qana, Sabra, and Shatila. Israel is the thorn planted in our throats and the strange piece forcibly attached to us.” Al Sayegh concluded by saying, “we dislike Israel, the idea, the project, the danger, the impact, the fear, and the racist religious entity, and we do not want to visit it. We support our Palestinian brothers in Palestine and everywhere.” Israel and the Gulf countries  According to The Times of Israel, “though Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and UAE condemned Jerusalem for deadly Gaza clashes, relations have been quietly warming up.”  The Israeli news outlet affirmed that despite Arab states resoundingly condemning the killing of more than 50 Palestinians in the Gaza protests of May 2018, “behind the scenes fears over Iran have divided Arab leaders, with some willing to quietly reach out to Israel.” In an article by TheNewsArab, Suzan Quitaz reported that “despite both countries’ (Israel and Saudi Arabia) efforts to keep their relationship as covert as possible, there are well-documented reports indicating extensive behind-the-scenes diplomatic and intelligence cooperation between the two countries, in quest of mutual goals.” In an interview Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman gave to The Atlantic Magazine in spring 2018, he stated: “there are a lot of interests we share with Israel and if there is peace, there would be a lot of interest between Israel and the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council).”  More recently, at the ceremony held on May 14 to mark the relocation of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Jared Kushner said “from Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond, many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people.” “In confronting common threats and in pursuit of common interests, previously unimaginable opportunities and alliances are emerging,” he added. According to The Jerusalem Fund for Education and Community Development, This week, the UAE participated in “Iniohos 2017,”a joint military exercise with the air forces of Greece, Italy, the United States, and Israel. The UAE also participated in the “Red Flag” exercise in Nevada. “The UAE’s collaboration with Israel goes beyond these multiparty training exercises,” says Mohamed Mohamed, Executive Director of The Jerusalem Fund and Palestine Center. “In 2015, Israel established its first diplomatic mission in the UAE in order to represent itself at the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), which is based in Abu Dhabi,” he continued.  As the Gulf countries draw closer to the US, and therefore Israel, amid tension with Iran, the Al-Khaleej editorial is not the only voice to call for Arab support in Palestine.  Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit also called on Arab countries to support the Palestinian Authority to overcome the stifling economic pressures facing the Palestinian government. Morocco’s position Despite participating in the Manama conference on the US-led Middle East peace plan known as the “Deal of the Century”, Morocco maintained its “constant” position on the Palestinian cause.  During Jared Kushner’s visit to Morocco on July 31, Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita emphasized  that the country is steadfast in its stance to support the establishment of “an independent, sovereign, and viable Palestinian state, with East Jerusalem as its capital.”

Rabat – While Baghrir can be bought for one of two dirhams at most local shops, served warm, straight from the pan nothing can beat them. Considered one of the most traditional Moroccan recipes, Baghrir is an Amazigh (berber) delicacy. The almost bite-size, fluffy pancakes are characterized by the small holes that appear on the surface while cooking. Like the British crumpet, the holes allow the spongy pancakes to soak up butter, honey, Amlou, or even soft cheese with olive oil. It is Served for afternoon tea, supper, and breakfast Baghrir are comforting and warm; however, when making them precision is key. The batter should be neither too thick, not too thin. Here’s my recipe for a perfect Sunday morning. Let’s start with the ingredient: 350 grams of fine semolina 150 grams of white flour 1 tablespoon of baking yeast 16 grams of baking powder 1 teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon of sugar (optional) 800ml (3 cups and a half) of lukewarm water Now you’ve carefully measured your ingredients for that perfect batter, let’s get started: Sift the semolina, flour, sugar, salt, and yeast into a bowl. Add 600ml of water then mix well. Put the mixture in a blender and mix for three to five minutes.  Keep adding the rest of the water little by little and mixing, until you reach the desired consistency. The batter should be the consistency of crepe batter. In a warm place, let the batter rest for 10 to 15 minutes or more until bubbles form on the surface. Pour some batter (enough to cover fully the surface of the pan) onto the warm pan using a small ladle, then heat on a gentle setting. Cook the Baghrir till you notice holes on the surface as the batter dries. You do not need to flip. Repeat until you have used all the batter.  Now take a seat, a cup of tea, and a Baghrir smothered in melting butter. Switch on your tablet, your television, or pick up your book and enjoy.

Casablanca – For as long as I can remember, I have been trained to adopt a read-and-answer approach to reading texts. Students also, and since primary school, have developed this unhelpful attitude towards reading comprehension. As a teacher, I found that I was trapped in the read-and-answer approach, and students could effortlessly predict the lesson: read and answer. I had never noticed the barrenness of this approach. It is a trap. I have come to realize that asking students to read the text, explain paragraphs, and answer the comprehension questions is not teaching reading. In a reading lesson, students need to learn comprehension skills. Reading is not only about decoding symbols, it consists of several levels with different challenges. It is like climbing a ladder; each step represents a skill that students should learn so that they can keep going. Students, during early school years, should be provided with lots of activities to build those skills. Baccalaureate students, in general, find themselves stuck at the first step—reading the written words. They seem to focus merely on how to read the words. They read but do not understand. Students often have the misconception that to understand a text they should understand every word. Likewise, some teachers adopt the same belief. Consequently, they fall in the trap of explaining every word, pre-teaching vocabulary, taking a lot of time, and then asking students, who did not make an effort, to answer the comprehension questions. Reading is way beyond asking some students to read aloud. Actually, they do not need to read aloud unless the teacher’s objectives include pronunciation. Instead, before answering comprehension questions, students need to learn how to decode the printed words, analyze them, know what the words mean, and recognize them in a context. Our students have developed a negative attitude towards difficult words. Instead of dealing with them, they tend to avoid them. Surprisingly, they keep reading without having the slightest idea of what the text is about; they do not really worry about this part because they know that the teacher will explain everything. Students do not know that they can approach new words positively and, in most cases, ignore them. It sounds strange, but it is considered a basic word-attack skill, according to Christine Nuttall, a policy expert on English assessment in her book “Teaching Reading Skills in a Foreign Language.” Yet, students cannot apply this rule every time because ignoring some words may make comprehension difficult. There are some techniques that can be used to deal with the new words, called “word-attack skills.” One of these skills is “sight recall,” when students recognize a word as soon as they read it because they have come across it before. Another is “context clues”: Using other sentences in the context, pictures, and the reader’s familiarity with the subject of the reading text. Finally, “structural analysis” depends mainly on the ability of the reader to recognize prefixes and suffixes. In “The Basal Reader Approach to Reading,” Robert Aukerman, a dean at an American teachers college, wrote, “Learning word-attack skills alone is not enough, since reading involves more than just identifying the words that the graphic symbols represent. In order to comprehend, a reader has to relate his or her experiences and knowledge of how a language works to the words that have been decoded.” Teachers should not expect students to pay attention to topics they are not interested in. So teachers should study their students’ interests through a kind of questionnaire before selecting the texts and take the textbook units into consideration. The reading texts and the activities should be purposeful. They should target students’ experiences and interests. To teach students to think rationally, teachers must use comprehension teaching in teaching other skills even before teaching reading. And in order to improve students’ thinking abilities, there should be some reasoning in every task they work on. Merely reading and finding answers to questions is not comprehension. The meaning is not there, in the text, waiting for students to decipher it. The meaning is attained through interaction between the text and the reader. That is why pre-reading activities are of high importance because we can trigger any experience that is related to the topic. Students find the texts easy when they meet their prior knowledge. Thought-provoking questions are what students need to improve comprehension skills. Taking reading from a mind-challenging activity to a mechanical activity should be discouraged because reading is not about finding answers. It is about developing the ability to reason, deduce results, discuss ideas, and know the how and the why. That would definitely change students’ attitude towards reading. After reading, teachers can help students think by 1) meeting with them individually; 2) having them illustrate favorite events by drama or drawing; 3) asking about cause-and-effect relationships; 4) tasking oral reports on topics of special interests; 5) helping students construct their own questions from the reading; 6) doing activities to find the main idea of the text, list details related to the main idea, make and justify inferences, and draw conclusions; and 7) having students prepare short oral or written summaries related to other topics. In her book “Learning to Read,” reading scholar Dina Feitelson says, “The ability to interpret depends not on the cognitive domain alone but also on the readers’ attitudes, his receptivity to new ideas, and his prejudices, as well as his interest in the material read and his motivation.” The problem EFL learners face is that they read English using the same method that they use with Arabic or French, languages they already use. But when the text is in English, a language they use solely in the classroom, the task becomes more difficult. Even if they decode the written forms of individual words, readers may find that the words do not go together in any pattern that is familiar to them, according to “The Basal Reader Approach to Reading.” Culture is another crucial factor. The relationship between the reading and students’ culture has a direct impact on reading. The value the students’ culture places on reading and how they learn to learn is important. Students tend to transfer their reading habits from one language to another. According to Ralph Staiger, the executive director of the International Association for Reading, reading habits affect comprehension more than the nature of the language. It is extremely difficult for students to change the way of learning that they have been trained to adopt throughout their school life. There should always be a reason for students to read a text. Students must be taught to read for the main idea and for details. They should also learn how to skim, to scan, to read critically, to outline, and to use the dictionary. In order for students to develop reading and comprehension skills, they must get a lot of practice with easy texts. Textbook readings are linguistically difficult; that is why they resort to translation which slows down the development of most reading skills. The reading texts are unsatisfactory especially in the early years. The texts are not sufficiently related to students’ experiences, the level of difficulty is not generally suitable, and the questions do not involve enough use of reasoning. Textbook readings are practically adjusted to teach language. So if the unit is about shopping and the present continuous tense, the text will contain vocabulary and certain structures. But the need for the text to have a message is neglected. This does not necessarily provide students with appropriate input to use their reading skills. I believe that this is one of the reasons that reading lessons are boring. There is a difference between a language lesson and a reading lesson. A reading lesson should not be entirely devoted to teaching language; instead, it should be a source of information and entertainment, and it should convey a message as well. Students are hardly exposed to any reading outside the textbook. Instead of giving texts that students find boring, why not give students the responsibility for the reading comprehension classes by agreeing on an extra set of readings that are related to the textbook units? Students have different interests; therefore, they should be allowed to choose what they want to read. Students will have no excuse if they do not participate in discussions or get bored during reading classes. At the end, I want to stress the importance of teaching study skills in early school years. Students are highly in need of knowing how to study. The majority of them do not know how to be students. They do not have any idea how to take notes, be organized, designate a study area, think positively, create a study group, and read actively. They need those tools and skills in every subject and throughout their whole life. Most students do not have any objectives or any vision for the future. Our target, as teachers, should be creating independent learners who can rely on themselves to achieve their objectives.

Rabat – My name, skin color, and position do not matter. My beliefs, manners, and purpose do. “I am not who I think I am. I am not who you think I am. I am who I think you think I am,” said American sociologist Charles Horton Cooley.  I stand as a citizen of the world every single day and will do so until my last day. I come with you bearing nothing but boundless humanity, compassion, and love in my heart. I am more than willing to understand where you come from, too. I assure you my currency is kindness, and my true allegiance is to honor and respect.  My culture is what “others” me to you, just as your “otherness” is what identifies me different from you. No matter who we are, neither you nor I are here to judge others, for we are just as imperfect and just as lost! In a world where more than 7 billion people speak 7,000 different languages, who we are at our core matters more than who we are becoming!  Human is what we should be and love is what we should strive to see. As Jason Silva, an American filmmaker, put it, if you would look upon this world from a universal standpoint, you would see “no lines dividing nations, no geographical subdivisions, no flags, or racial divides or disputed territories.” You would only see Earth, this innocent celestial body floating free, “the womb on which we all dwell.” Morocco and the US have a lot more in common than their peoples think. Although Morocco has undergone a myriad of peaks and valleys, it has witnessed glorious civilizations. Home of the Amazigh (Berber) and land of the patriotic as it is, it has also been an exotic land for the Romans, the Arabs, the French, the Spanish, and the Portuguese.  For the last couple of decades, it has been one of the most mesmerizing destinations of North Africa, welcoming tourists and travelers from all corners of the world. Its cultural and linguistic diversity makes it take after the US. Arabs or Imazighen (Berbers), French or Spanish, be they Muslims, Christians, Jews, or non-affiliated at all, all live together in harmony. If anything would awe its visitors, it would be the rich cultural heritage and the promising projects of Morocco’s modernity and authenticity. Whoever visits Morocco never fails to acknowledge the vibrancy of its lifestyle, the hospitality of its warmhearted people, and the open-mindedness of its spirit, from its arts and crafts, its different colors of music, and its different literary genres to its museums and delicious cuisines. Nevertheless, it is with the deepest sadness that I see cultures being enslaved by the vicious games of neo-liberal capitalism and corrupt politics. Cultures are meant to identify us from one another, not bring about discrimination and hatred against each other.  You and I “are more alike … than we are unalike,” American poet Maya Angelou said, for we are naturally predisposed to be kind and compassionate, not evil-driven, and different, not indifferent. Although we are sadly oppressed, our voices shall be free-willed and deafening and our hearts forevermore true and fearless.  Should you ever forget, remember, we all share a thread of the divine and are meant only for the sublime. We may not choose our birthplace, our parents or whatever life throws at us, but we ultimately choose who we become. Change is the only constant in the universe, for we can only journey into becoming ourselves. Traveling beyond our culture is the only way, I believe, we can find and love ourselves, for only through others can we truly meet who we are.

Rabat – Managem, a Moroccan mining company that specializes in precious metals, cobalt, and other minerals, announced on Thursday, August 15, that its turnover for the first half of 2019 has declined by MAD 300 million compared to July 2018. Managem attributes the drop in net income to a significant decline in the prices of cobalt, zinc and copper. “In an industry marked by uncertainties that continue to weigh on the world economy, metal prices saw a significant change at the end of June 2019, compared to the same period of the previous year,” said Managem in a statement. The average price of cobalt, notably, is down 62%, and all companies in the mining sector have been affected by these changes, added Managem. The company aims to mitigate these negative changes in the second half of 2019 by expanding its gold production capacity in Sudan. The company will also increase its silver production by 35%, and Cobalt production by 36%. The company is also active in other countries including Cote D’Ivoire, Mali, Conakry, Gabon, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, “Managem, confident in the strength of its foundations and in the recovery of markets, will maintain its profitable growth prospects by deploying efforts to improve operational performances and by pursuing the implementation of its development program,” concluded Managem. Managem has been subject to scandal recently, after speculation that the company was smuggling gold out of Sudan without authorization. In May 2018, the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces intercepted a Moroccan aircraft with an 84-kilogram haul of gold ingots belonging to Managem for an allegedly invalid license. However, the incident was soon cleared up, and the confiscated gold was returned to the company. Managem said that Sudanese authorities “acknowledged our scrupulous compliance with regulatory procedures.”

Rabat – The National Society for Hunting, Sustainable Development has strongly denounced the alleged hunt of more than 1,400 quails in Marrakech in just one day by several men from the Gulf. One of the men filmed himself as he was showing dozens of quails on the floor. The man was speaking khaliji (Gulf Arabic), while he was expressing satisfaction with the hunt. In response, the National Society for Hunting posted a statement on its Facebook page, describing the hunt as  a “massacre.” “ A video documenting the massacre of Gulf Arabs against the right of livestock on the outskirts of Marrakech spread a wave of anger among citizens and the National Society for hunting.”  The organization also called for the opening of the investigation into the case. The statement said that the act also caused frustration among a number of hunting associations in Morocco, which denounced the incident after they received the video. The organization urged the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to issue a statement to condemn the action.

Rabat – Moroccan envoy to Canberra Karim Medrek has praised  the contribution of the Moroccan community in Australia. In an interview with SBS Radio,  Medrek said that there are nearly 10,000 Moroccans residing in Australia. The community is most present in Sydney and  Melbourne. “There also some Moroccan families who live in small cities, such as Brisbane, and Queensland,” Medrek said. The diplomat said that “the Moroccan community is well integrated into the Australian society.” He added that most of the Moroccans living in Australia are highly educated compared to Moroccan communities in other countries. “Moroccans living in Australia are good ambassadors for Morocco and contribute to their country’s radiation,” the ambassador said. Medrek said that there are many Moroccans occupying important positions in Australia, including a doctor who teaches  water resources management at the University of Western Australia. Without naming the Moroccan man,Medrek also mentioned that there is also a Moroccan businessman who leads the Arab-Australian Chamber of Commerce and contributes to the development of trade and economic relations between Australia and the Arab countries. The ambassador also  mentioned a Moroccan cook who opened a Moroccan restaurant in Sydney 20 years ago. “Morocco and Moroccan culture are strongly present in Australia through Moroccan music, Moroccan cuisine, and Moroccan dress,” he said. Australian ambassador agrees Morocco and Australia maintain good diplomatic relations.  Australian ambassador to Rabat Berenice Owen-Jones told Morocco World News on Thursday, August 15,  that she “agrees” with the Moroccan ambassador. “I have met many Moroccans from all walks of life that are proud to call Australia home and are making a great contribution to Australian society.” She said that the number of Australians in Morocco is much smaller: a few hundred, but “the ones I have met all say how much they love it here- despite being 18000 km from their country of origin.” She added, “Each one has a unique story to tell.” Morocco and Australia maintain good diplomatic relations.  Australia opened its embassy in Morocco in 2017. The opening of the embassy helped enhance cooperation between Rabat and Cannebra in several areas, including agriculture. “Australian exports comprised around AUD 40 million [MAD 272 million], mostly in wheat, meat and paints, and imports from Morocco were valued at around AUD 57 million [MAD 338 million], including fertilisers, clothing and vegetables,” the Australian envoy told Morocco World News in 2018.

Rabat – On August 15, the 40th anniversary of the recovery of Oued Eddahab, the Wali of the region of Dakhla-Oued Eddahab launched and inaugurated several development projects in Dakhla. The projects are part of the implementation of the Southern Provincial Development Program (2015-2021). The Wali, Lamine Benomar, accompanied by a number of elected officials, local officials, and civil and military personalities, attended the inauguration of the new Dakhla corniche which cost MAD 14 million. He also reviewed the progress of Dakhla’s urban upgrade program which has cost MAD 1.5 billion since 2008. Consisting of 24 projects, the program focuses on three areas, namely “Housing and urban upgrading”, “Basic equipment” and “Network adapted equipment”. It aims to improve the quality of urban planning and contribute to the economic, social, and tourist development of the region. Benomar also launched public lighting works on Avenue Mohammed V, which will be completed within six months over a length of 9,900 kilometers. The goal of this project, totaling more than MAD 14.79 million, is to ensure the safety of pedestrians and drivers and improve the development of the urban area of ​​Dakhla. As part of the partnership between the Wilaya of Dakhla-Oued Eddahab, the Regional Council, and local authorities,  the Provincial District of Dakhla National Security and the regional command of the Royal Gendarmerie received vehicle grants from the Wilaya. Both security forces received two vehicles. In July, the Wali granted an ambulance and a mobile medical unit for the benefit of the Regional Directorate of Health. The Regional Academy of Education and Training also benefited from a minibus for school transportation. The Wali and the accompanying delegation also reviewed the construction of the MAD 14.64 million covered hall and the construction and equipment of proximity playgrounds (MAD 8.36 million). At the “Al Walaa” cultural complex, the Wali inaugurated a contemporary art exhibition entitled “From Paris to Dakhla” suggested by foreign artists (two French and one Brazilian) and composed of 26 paintings and 9 sculptures.

Rabat  –  The Moroccan and Spanish governments have issued a statement to express their satisfaction with the recruitment of Moroccan farmers for the 2018-2019 strawberry and red fruit picking campaign in the Spanish province of Huelva. The statement announced that Spain recruited 14,583 Moroccan farmers for the campaign. “The displacement of 14,583 Moroccan nationals as part of a regular, orderly, and secure migration process, has been positive for countries of origin and destination,” said the statement. The statement added that the agricultural season in the province  is a “very important factor for economic development and employment, where 5 million, working days have been declared.” The statement comes amid an ongoing scandal surrounding sexual assault allegatations against managers in the strawberry fields. Several female Moroccan workers have come forward with accusations of sexual assault and harrassment.  In July, the New York Times quoted several Moroccans, who said that they were subject to alleged sexual assault and rape. “He pressured her to have sex, promising her a better life and working conditions,”  the online paper wrote. The victim, who is now pregnant, said that she feels “depressed” and is ”scared to look for work.” Another woman told the Guardian that her experience in the fields were the worst in her life. They also claimed to have stayed in unhygienic conditions, despite having been shown photos at the recruitment centers. Despite all the reported allegations,  the Spanish and the Moroccan governments appear to be satisfied with their annual  agreement. In the joint statement, the two governments said that they have “introduced improvements in the management and monitoring of the campaign, by increasing the number of meetings and the frequency of contacts, which made it possible to set up an appropriate organization allowing the gradual arrival of people who come to work according to a schedule established depending on the needs expressed by the sector.” The statement also  said that both Spain and Morocco made “very significant efforts to meet extremely tight deadlines.”

Rabat – On August 14 this week, Morocco commemorated the fortieth anniversary of the recovery of Oued Eddahab, a historic moment in Morocco’s struggle for territorial integrity. On that day in 1979, a group of religious leaders and tribal chiefs from Oued Eddahab, in the Dakhla region, met the late King Hassan II at the royal palace in Rabat to express an abiding sense of national pride and belonging. Coming just four years after the Green March, the move from Oued Eddahab’s religious and tribal representatives symbolized “an unwavering desire to preserve national unity,” according to a MAP report. “The date of August 14 1979 will remain forever engraved as a memorable step in the process of completing the kingdom’s unity,” MAP asserted. The assertion was hardly an overstatement, considering the spirit and the circumstances that surrounded the episode. The delegation that met King Hassan II 40 years ago made it clear, in their vows to “reunite with the motherland,” that they had been driven by commitment to the Moroccanness of the Sahara region. The delegation was uniquely articulate in how it envisions the future for the region: reunited with Morocco. The organizing principle here was the undimmed urgency of countering separatist narratives that Rabat’s actions and very presence in the region are fundamentally exploitative and not in any significant way beneficial for locals. At the center of the counter narrative sits the notion, the basic truth, that many locals in the region feel deeply attached to Morocco and want reunification with the kingdom. This has come to define a notable part of Morocco’s diplomacy over the past five years or so. Put another way, the renewed momentum now said to be surrounding Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is in many ways a direct consequence of the path taken forty years ago by clerics and tribal leaders from Oued Eddahab. It speaks of how strongly a varied and vocal contingent of locals wished for reunification with Morocco. This is tellingly corroborated by a whole section in the UN Secretary General’s latest report on Western Sahara. The document mentions how Morocco’s 7.7 billion development plans in Laayoune and Dakhla regions, for example, have been approvingly received by a sizable chunk of the local populations. “In Laayoune, Dakhla and Smara, my Personal Envoy met with a large number of locally elected officials. They highlighted developments in the education, health and economic sectors and stated that the people west of the berm were grateful for the support received from Morocco, particularly the US$ 7.7 billion development plan,” the UNSG said in the report. He added, more in tune with the Oued Eddahab spirit: “My Personal Envoy also convened meetings with civil society representatives, who presented a wide range of views, in Dakhla and Laayoune. “Some expressed full support for the Moroccan autonomy plan and urged the United Nations to find a political solution that would allow the people in Tindouf to return to the homeland and benefit from the development seen in the territory. “They expressed gratitude for Morocco’s financial support which had improved infrastructure, education and health services in the territory, and had increased awareness for human rights.” Needless to say, part of the success of Morocco’s new, proactive Western Sahara diplomacy involves showcasing the colossal development funds it has poured in the region to enhance living standards and the quality of life. But this can also be taken as a step to fulfilling the promise made to Oued Eddahab representatives four decades ago about the motherland’s readiness to integrate and develop the area. The ensuing development projects have, in turn, helped assuage the sense of embattled national belonging, settled historical grievances, and rekindled the Morocco-supporting spirit that drove the Oued Eddahab episode in the first place. Earlier this year, around the time of vociferous, Polisario-initiated opposition to the Morocco-EU agreements involving waters and coasts off Western Sahara, a group of Sahrawi representatives petitioned against what they saw as unfounded separatist allegations. Morocco, the petition hammered, “is the only representative of our interests and our will.” Like the initiators of the Oued Eddahab recovery four decades ago, the petitioners called Morocco “our homeland” and expressed “genuine attachment” to the kingdom. But the petition’s point about Rabat’s development plans was particularly reminiscent of the Oued Eddahab spirit. It energetically dismissed pro-Polisario accusations of “colonial exploitation,” drew attention to Morocco’s “new development model” for the region, and, like forty years ago, pledged undivided allegiance to Morocco. “Since our country completed its territorial integrity by recovering its southern provinces, it has made significant efforts towards their sustainable development. Noticeable progress made in our southern provinces as the result of our country’s efforts to make development, both at large and in our regions, our top priority,” the petition said. Anniversaries typically invite celebration, remembrance, and reflection. Morocco may not have loudly celebrated the 40th anniversary of Oued Eddahab. But August 14 will always offer, at least so far as Moroccan diplomacy is concerned, an opportunity to assess what has been done right or wrong in the intervening years since—with a prospective eye on what to do next to ensure the total, effective national reunification that drove the Oued Eddahab chapter. If the latest developments are any indication, the future looks rosy for that 1979 reunification dream. The current situation in the decades-long impasse in Western Sahara may not exactly be a reflection of the Oued Eddahab spirit, but signs are reassuring for what the situation may be a decade or so from now, especially with Morocco’s Autonomy Plan now in the ascendancy in diplomatic circles, settlement negotiations.

Rabat – In coordination with the General-Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST), Fez judicial police aborted three drug trafficking operations across the city. Police also arrested seven people and seized 7,079 pills of ecstasy as well as other drugs.  The first operation resulted in the arrest of two suspects carrying 3,999 hallucinogens and a sum of money thought to be revenues of drug trafficking. Police later arrested a taxi driver who they suspect is involved in the case.  In the second operation, police arrested a 17-year-old female traveling by bus in possession of 2,080 hallucinogens. Police were also able to arrest the main suspect and a third suspect who was carrying a tear gas bottle and a large sum of money suspected to be gains from their trafficking operations. The third police operation led to the arrest of a  final suspect who was on a bus coming from Tangier and carrying 1,000 different kinds of hallucinogens.   The adult suspects remain in custody under the supervision of the Prosecutor’s Office while the 17-year-old minor is under surveillance. Investigations into the case are ongoing in order to arrest possible accomplices in the trafficking operations.

Washington D.C. – The Wall Street Journal’s report on the Trump administration’s stance on Western Sahara has brought the issue back to the front of international consciousness, three months after the Security Council adopted Resolution 2468. The resolution renewed the United Nations mission in Western Sahara, known as MINURSO, for six months until October 31, 2019. The last three months have been marked by a stalemate in the political process, especially after the resignation of Horst Kohler, the personal envoy of the UN Secretary-General for the Western Sahara. The most important point in the Wall Street Journal report is the US government’s refusal to establish an independent state in southern Morocco. Although the report’s author did not explicitly mention which US entity stressed Washington’s opposition to the establishment of a new state in southern Morocco, what he said dispels the fears Morocco has had since the appointment of John Bolton as national security adviser to the US president. Bolton can’t effectively oppose Morocco Bolton’s positions on Western Sahara are well-known. He supports resolving the conflict through a referendum on its status, and he helped draft the 1991 settlement agreement leading to the ceasefire and the 2001 and 2003 proposals of the Secretary-General’s personal envoy, James Baker. Given this, observers in Morocco were concerned that the UN-sponsored political process would witness an unprecedented shift in favor of Algeria and Polisario. However, almost 18 months after John Bolton‘s appointment as national security adviser, events proved that no matter how strong a US official’s personality and positions on any issue may be, they cannot go it alone or take positions contrary to US interests. Neither can they make decisions without the traditional interagency review, involving agencies like the State Department and the Department of Defense. The US decision-making process on foreign policy is complex and subject to checks and balances. Any major foreign policy decisions should align with the general orientation of US foreign policy and the country’s strategic interests. In an analysis published in September last year, I had stressed that Bolton’s appointment would not adversely affect Morocco’s interests and its consistent position on the Sahara issue. I argued that the White House is not the only player in the decision-making process, and that this process is subject to lengthy internal debates involving many stakeholders within the US government: the White House, the State Department, and the Department of Defense. And we cannot forget the influential role of Congress. In the case of Morocco, given the country’s strong relations with the US and its role in maintaining the stability of North Africa and the Sahel and in combating terrorism and extremism, it is unlikely that the United States would make a decision that could undermine Morocco’s position on Western Sahara. US fears instability in Western Sahara The prevailing impression of many US observers is that the creation of a state in southern Morocco could destabilize the region, making it even more exposed to the threat of terrorism, possibly jeopardizing US interests in North Africa, the Sahel, and sub-Saharan Africa. Behind the scene deliberations in the Security Council over the past 18 months have shown that Morocco has not only been able to prevent any development contradicting its consistent position, but has also been able to achieve new gains. The most important achievement has been the inclusion of Algeria in recent Security Council Resolutions 2440 and 2468 and the Security Council’s gradual shift to considering Algeria as a key party in the conflict. Morocco has also maintained the support of the US House of Representatives despite it being under the Democratic party’s control following the November 2018 elections. Given the position that successive US administrations have taken on Western Sahara, including those of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump, the Wall Street Journal’s report should not be regarded as a new breakthrough, but as reflecting an established fact. In an interview with Palestinian journalist Abdel Bari Atwan in April, former Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz pointed out that the United States and Europe do not support the idea of a state between Morocco and Mauritania. He said that behind the scenes, negotiations over the dispute are in Morocco’s favor. How the US views the Autonomy Plan A declassified US State Department document, prepared by the Moroccan ambassador and made public in recent months, asserts that the United States was behind the decision to shelve a self-determination referendum and had asked Morocco since 1999 to elaborate an autonomy proposal for Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty. A diplomatic correspondence dated March 2, 2006, from the US embassy in Rabat shows how William Jordan, then director of the US State Department’s Office of Near Eastern Affairs, said during meetings with officials of the Moroccan ministries of foreign affairs and the interior in February 2006 that the United States was waiting, with great interest, for Morocco to unveil its autonomy plan and present it to the Security Council. During the same meetings, the official explained that the US, like many other countries, believes that the establishment of a state in Western Sahara “was likely unviable and that a more realistic settlement was one that accorded the Sahrawis a significant measure of autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty.” Jordan clarified that, after the resignation of UN envoy James Baker, the UN political process entered a new phase and that the US “looked forward with eagerness to Morocco’s autonomy plan so the focus could shift to negotiations.” This was the context that paved the way for Morocco to submit its Autonomy Plan to the Security Council in April 2007. Since then, the United States has on many occasions expressed its support for the Moroccan Plan considering it “serious, credible and realistic.” The US position did not change even in the most difficult times of Morocco-US relations during President Obama’s second term. However, while expressing this tacit support for Morocco over the past 10 years, the US has not translated it into an official policy. Can the US effectively back Morocco? The question one should ask is if the US was willing to provide unwavering support to Morocco, would it be able to make the Autonomy Plan the basic framework for the UN political process? Based on the past, this goal would be difficult to achieve as the US cannot impose its own views on the other permanent members of the Security Council. The US’ failed attempts over a decade ago to turn the Moroccan Autonomy Plan into the basis of negotiations gives us a glimpse into what would happen if the Trump administration decided to unambiguously support to Morocco. In 2007 and 2008, the Bush administration tried to make the Autonomy Plan the basis of the political process. However, then Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice’s efforts, prior to the adoption of Resolution 1754 in April 2007 and Resolution 1783 in October 2007, were opposed by Russia, the United Kingdom, as well as Spain in its capacity as a member of the Group of Friends of Western Sahara. Rice’s third attempt to impose Morocco’s proposal in April 2008 had the same outcome. If the Trump administration tries to impose Morocco’s proposal, it would face the same hurdles. Russian opposition Assuming that France will support any US decision in favor of Morocco, it is very unlikely that this position would receive Russian backingt, for two important factors: Russia’s friendship with Algeria and opposition to the US. Russia and Algeria share strong relations, especially at the security, military, and energy levels. Despite all the efforts Morocco has made in recent years to strengthen its ties to Russia, including King Mohammed VI’s visit to Russia in March 2016, Russia is still closer to Algeria. Relations between Moscow and Algiers grew stronger since President Valdimir Putin’s visit to Algeria in March 2006. During that visit, Russia agreed to write off Algeria’s $4.7 billion debt to Russia on the condition that Algeria spend the same amount on Russian military equipment and services. As a result, Algeria signed a $7.5 billion agreement to buy Russian military hardware. The agreement was regarded as the biggest military contract in Russia’s history since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Between 2006 and 2007, Algeria’s military purchases from Russia totaled $15 billion. In 2011, Algeria signed another defense contract worth $13 billion. According to the Stockholm International Center for Peace Research, Algeria is the biggest Russian arms importer in Africa, absorbing 50% of Russian exports, and was the third in the world between 2007 and 2016. According to Algerian news outlet Tout Sur l’Algérie, 80% of military imports come from Russia. In addition to the defense sector, the two countries are also linked by an array of cooperation agreements in the fields of trade and investments, the fight against terrorism, nuclear energy, and gas. Algeria and Russia worked hand in hand to stabilize the price of crude oil following the collapse of its price in 2014. The second factor that will prompt Russia to oppose any US endeavor in line with Morocco’s stance is Russia’s keenness to revive the US-Russia rivalry of the Cold War. In this sense, Russia will thwart any US plan to impose its agenda in areas where Russia seeks to play a key role. Russia’s commitment was clear when it delayed the vote on Resolution 2414 in April 2018. The draft resolution favored Morocco and sought to hold Polisario responsible for fueling tensions in the region of Guerguerat and the buffer zone. By delaying the vote on the draft resolution, Russia tried to make Morocco share responsibility for the tension. Russia also abstained from voting on the resolution which, for the first time, called on the parties of the conflict to “to achieve a realistic, practicable and enduring political solution to the question of Western Sahara based on compromise.” Russia adopted the same position on Resolution 2440 and Resolution 2468, which were the first times a Council resolution mentioned Algeria and called on it to play its role in the political process. It’s up to Morocco and Algeria Due to the politics inherent to the Security Council, the opposing interests of its five permanent members, and their eagerness to defend the interests of their allies, the chances that the United Nations will eventually broker a political solution that meets the aspirations and demands of all parties are very slim. It is a foregone conclusion that the solution to this conflict is in the hands of Algeria and Morocco. As long as Algerian leaders have no political will to turn the page and lay the building blocks for a strong Maghreb Union which offers opportunities for economic integration and sustainable development, there will be no realistic solution to this dispute.

Rabat – The Minister of Foreign Affairs  and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita has received Qatari ambassador to Morocco Fahad Ben Ibrahim Al Hamad Al Mana. The envoy handed his credentials as ambassador of Qatar to Morocco during the meeting held on Wednesday, August 7, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. A statement from the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs  said that Al Mana had previously held the post of ambassador to Argentina, as well as other positions at the Qatari Foreign Ministry. Morocco and Qatar maintain strong diplomatic relations, especially after the Moroccan government offered humanitarian assistance to Qatar when the Saudi coalition imposed a blockade on the Gulf country in 2017. Doha and Rabat continue to strengthen diplomatic relations.

Rabat – The ski resort of Oukaimeden is expected to be redesigned in order to attract 500,000 visitors annually by 2030. In its August 16 edition, L’Economiste newspaper noted that the Wilaya of Marrakech-Safi has allocated a MAD 204 million development plan for the site. In May 2019, the headquarters of the Wilaya of Marrakech-Safi held a meeting in the presence of the Minister of Tourism Mohamed Sajid in order to review the development plan. The plan aims to make Oukaimeden a sustainable tourist destination and make it more attractive to Moroccan and foreign tourists. The plan also intends to guarantee lasting activity throughout the year, so that the ski resort’s activities go beyond the four-month period of snowfall. The newspaper also recalled the current deplorable state of the site. It specifically pointed out the difficulty of access to the resort, a unique station in Africa. According to L’Economiste, the plan considers two management models: either the creation of a Rural Development Company for mixed management or the assignment of the concession to a private operator. The goal is to proceed with a safe upgrade, a professionalization of services. The plan includes the development of the lake, zip lines, an amusement park, and a karting course. L’Economiste suggested that the national park of Toubkal and the astronomical observatory be part of the development plan. The daily also suggested facilitating access to the resort via gondolas, as is done in major ski resorts around the world. Oukaimeden is a ski resort in the Atlas mountains near Toubkal mountain, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Marrakech, Morocco.

Rabat – The Delegated Ministry for Moroccans Residing Abroad (MRE) and Migratory-Related Affairs has adopted a draft partnership agreement with the Council of the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region in favor of Morocco’s diaspora. The adoption of the partnership agreement will allow the establishment of a reception center for Moroccans living abroad (MRE).

He added that the Moroccan presence in Europe is stronger than on other continents. Benatiq made his remarks during a press conference held on July 25 to launch a 300 performance theater tour designed for Moroccan diaspora.

In December 2018, viral footage showed the dramatic chase of a go-fast boat with four alleged traffickers on board. Spanish law enforcement used a  helicopter and two other boats to continue the pursuit, which came to an end in the Costa Del Sol, southern Spain. Spanish police then arrested two Moroccans and a Spaniard. The driver of the boat, however, managed to escape. The four individuals are believed to be members of a drug trafficking network that smuggles cannabis from Morocco to Malaga.

Rabat – The Royal Football Federation (FRMF) introduced Vahid Halilhodzic as the new coach of the Moroccan national football team. The president of the FRMF, Fouzi Lekjaa, announced today, August 15, that the federation reached an agreement with the Bosnian sportsman who will succeed French coach Herve Renard. The announcement comes after FRMF reviewed a three-name shortlist featuring German Gernot Rohr, tFrench Laurent Blanc, and the Bosnian coach. Earlier this week, international media reported that Blanc had rejected Morocco’s offer, without giving more details on the Frenchman’s reasons. Halilhodzic’s  coaching resume  is not to be underestimated. The67-year-old Bosnian coach has already had an impressive international career. “I hope we can achieve the best things  together with Morocco even at the financial level,”  said the Bosnian man, laughing along with the press conference attendees. “I get sick when I lose something,’ Halilhodzig said when he was asked about the race for coaching the Atlas Lions. Halilhodzic has worked as a manager for many international football clubs and teams, including Paris Saint Germain, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Japan, and most recently Nantes. The FRMF will pay the Bosnian coach a salary of MAD 800,000 per month.    “I made the difficult decision to leave the club for personal reasons … I’m leaving for another sporting project. I would like to thank the supporters of Nantes for their support and affection,” wrote Halilhodzic on August 3 on Facebook . The post suggested that the Bosnian sportsman already had plans to leave Nantes for Morocco’s Atlas Lions.

Rabat – In response to separatist provocations over recent months, Morocco is moving to strengthen its presence in Guerguerat, an area between Morocco and Mauritania which Polisario views as part of its self-styled state. According to Maghreb Intelligence, even if the move did not come with the traditionally triumphant announcements that have characterized the media offensives and counter offensives in the Western Sahara dispute, it was Rabat’s direct rejoinder to recent provocations from the separatist Polisario Front. Citing “sources close to the dossier,” the outlet explained Morocco’s move as a subtle riposte to Brahim Ghali’s recent call on Tindouf camps refugees to prepare for an “inevitable” armed confrontation with Morocco. “Despite Brahim Ghali’s gesticulations,” Maghreb Intelligence headlined, “Morocco continues to strengthen its presence in Guerguerat.”
But, the piece goes on to establish, Rabat’s response is not merely a military-minded move. In addition to increasing its military personnel in the region, Rabat is planning social housing construction projects for the benefit of both the additional military contingent to be deployed and the local population in the area. The riposte is a two-armed move aimed at highlighting both Morocco’s readiness to counter any attacks from the Polisario Front, while also showcasing the colossal investments in improving living standards in the area. According to Maghreb Intelligence’s sources, the contracts for completing the two projects—building social housing for both the Moroccan military personnel and local populations—have been awarded to local companies. This will also result in creating jobs in the construction sector for the duration of the projects. In his call for war late last month, the Polisario leader argued that Morocco has had the upper hand in political settlement negotiations over the past years. “Morocco is unyielding because they know they have the support of great powers,” Ghali said. Meanwhile, increasingly appearing to have shifted the focus of its actions in the region from military presence to more social welfare-minded plans and proactive public diplomacy, Morocco has heavily invested in development projects in the region in recent years. This has resulted in an increasing wave of support for Morocco’s stance, with recent reports pointing to an almost overwhelming consensus over Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the most “credible” and “serious” pathway to a lasting settlement.

Rabat – Two restaurants in Marrakech’s Jemaa El Fna Square, both managed by the same person, have lost their license to operate after reportedly charging a group of foreign tourists MAD 5000 for dinner. The incident happened in early June, and the tourists filmed the debacle to show to authorities. Upon receiving the shockingly high bill, the infuriated tourists demanded to be shown the price for each individual dish. The manager, unaware he was being filmed, began to bargain with the tourists. They eventually settled on the tourists paying MAD 3000, all the money they had on them. According to daily paper Al Akhbar, the Wali of Marrakech launched an inquiry upon hearing about the incident. The commission responsible for the inquiry found that the actions of the restaurant manager “harm the image and the tourist reputation of the city.” Authorities have sanctioned 5 other restaurants for overcharging and issued 70 warnings to street vendors. The sanctions and license removals are part of an initiative by the Wali of Marrakech to crackdown on overcharging in the famous square. As well as overcharging restaurant owners, tourists have complained of pushy snake charmers, henna tattooists, taxi drivers, and vendors which taint their experience of Marrakech. Most recently, on July 3, Marrakech police arrested a snake charmer from Jemaa El Fna Square for fraud and breach and trust after he charged a tourist €40 for a single photo. Tourists also regularly complain about taxi drivers. Some refuse to run the meter, instead, making up prices on the spot depending on how much they think the passenger will be willing to pay. This year, 39 taxis have already been sanctioned. The effect scammers and overcharging have on the historic site becomes abundantly clear on tourists forums, such as Tripadvisor. Reports of henna artists grabbing the hand of tourists when they are off-guard are common. The tattoo artists then attempt to charge tourists as much as €150 euros for the tattoo they did not consent to. Snake charmers reportedly do the same, draping their snakes over the necks of unwitting tourists and then asking for exorbitant amounts, similar to the incident mentioned above. “Do not make eye contact with any performers in the square! They are mental!” one Tripadvisor user said. “During our first hour in Marrakech, my husband stopped to look at the snakes, one ended up around my neck. Then they hassled us for a tip, even though they forced the snake around my neck.” “We had no dirhams on us as we only just arrived. They insisted we had to tip them for good luck, and wouldn’t leave us alone. I gave them £1 and still, he was not satisfied said he wanted paper English money,” the traveler complained. “I am not impressed with the tipping/begging culture going on. We are not made of money just because we are from the UK.” It’s important to note that many of the forums are also full of tourists noting the hospitality and kindness Moroccans are known for, adding that the scammers of Jemaa el Fna were the only exception.

Rabat – Algerian authorities are refusing to grant permits to truck drivers delivering humanitarian aid from Spain to Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps. Pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara reported on Wednesday, August 14, that some families “complained about the delay in the arrival of gifts and humanitarian aid coming from Spain.” Humanitarian aid is traditionally sent by Spanish families and members of the Sahrawi community  to the Sahrawi residents of the Tindouf camps before Eid Al Adha. The news outlet reported that truck drivers arrived in the Ghazaouet Port in Algeria on August 1. The truck drivers, however, were not able to deliver the humanitarian aid on time. Algerian authorities are withholding the license, meaning that the drivers have been stuck at the port since August 1. “The bus drivers spent [ Eid Al Adha] holiday at the Algerian port of Ghazaouet away from their families.” The drivers, according to Futuro Sahara, have all the official licenses granted by the “Sahrawi institutions.” “It became necessary to contact the Algerian Foreign Ministry to find a solution to this ongoing issue.” Throughout the year, Sahrawis have been protesting against lack of freedom of movement. The embezzlement of funds and humanitarian aid has been an ongoing issue in the camp. It remains to be seen whether this shipment of aid will reach the families in the Tindouf camps.. Dozens of Sahrawis have been condemning malnutrition in the camps, expressing surprise at finding donated merchandise on display in Algerian shops. In February, The president of the Canary Sahrawi Forum, Miguel Angel Ortiz, condemned Polisario’s embezzlement of aid corruption in an opinion piece published by  La Provincia. The  author said that a new scandal broke within the Tindouf camps following the misappropriation of some €2.5 million of humanitarian aid from the international community for Sahrawis living in Tindouf camps.

Rabat – Brenton Tarrant, the gunman in the Christchurch mosque terror attack has addressed a hateful letter, which was later posted on 4chan, a message board website. 4chan is known for posting views of white supremacists,  CNN reported. New Zealand’s Department of Corrections issued a statement, acknowledging that it was a mistake to allow the letter to be sent. The administration admitted that the letter should have been withheld. “We have never had to manage a prisoner like this before,”  New Zealand’s Corrections Minister Kelvin Dais said. He added that he does not “believe that corrections should have allowed this letter to be sent and have sought assurances from them that there will be an enhanced process from now on.” CNN published extract from the letter which was sent to a supporter in Russia. “I have no concern about myself and I only worry for Europe’s future,” Tarrant wrote. “I only hope our people can survive the coming demographic shift,” he added. The letter was sent to an address in Russia, a country which Tarrant also wrote at length about, before it was posted to 4chan. The letter, according to the Guardian,  can be “read as a ‘call to arms’ for white supremacists worldwide.” The 28-year-old Australian man  pleaded not guilty to 51 charges of murder, 40 of attempted murder and one terrorism offense in the Christchurch High Court on June 14.  He carried out the attack on March 15, when he broadcast the terror attacks on two mosques in a live on Facebook live. A trial has been scheduled to begin on May 4, 2020, and prosecutors estimate it may run for up to six weeks. In New Zealand, it is legal for prisoners to send and receive mail. “The prison director may withhold a prisoner’s mail in a ‘very limited range of circumstances,’” CNN reported. NZ’s Muslim community frightened The Guardian quoted the general secretary of the Linwood mosque in Christchurch  Faisal Sayed. Linwood mosque was one of the two mosques attacked by Tarrant, where he killed seven. Sayed said that the letter caused frustration among the community. “It’s truly frightening, and frankly, we’re shocked. It’s unbelievable,” said Sayed.   He also  said that he is worried about the “repercussions of this. He could be forming other groups, or inspiring other attacks. People are feeling very worried, and truly scared.”  “Shouldn’t he be subject to special circumstances in prison?” he asked.

Rabat – Controversial Moroccan pop star Saad Lamjarred announced his return to Morocco in an Instagram video yesterday, August 14, causing a stir. Lamjarred seemed in good spirits in the video despite his ongoing legal troubles, blowing a kiss for the camera. “Tomorrow, god willing, I’ll be coming back to Morocco for a visit!” he wrote. He did not say how long the visit will last.  The singer has been in Paris for the past few years, living freely but unable to leave France due to legal issues after a series of long rape complaints. Despite the controversy, Lamjarred has still found success with his music, as his fanbase in Morocco remains loyal. His latest single, “Ensay” (“Forgotten,”) a duet with Egyptian star Mohamed Ramadan, has received more than 90 million views on YouTube since its release on July 19. Lamjarred’s legal troubles arose when a young French seasonal worker, Laura Prioul, filed a rape complaint against the Moroccan pop star in October 2017, saying Lamjarred “ruined her life by forcing himself upon her after he had rejected her.” Police arrested Lamjarred, who then spent six months at the Marriott Champs Elysees prison in Paris. He was released in April 2018 on bail under electronic surveillance. Police arrested the singer once again in August 2018 in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France, after another young woman came forward and filed a rape complaint against him. On September 18, the singer went back to jail after a prosecutor appealed the release and the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeals’ revoked his baill. The court then released Lamjarred in December. The rape complaints in France come as part of a long history of allegations. Lamjarred was first accused of rape back in 2010 in New York, but US prosecutors later dropped the case when the plaintiff withdrew. The singer has left the Moroccan public divided, with many calling for a boycott of his music on Moroccan radio. The hashtag #Masaktach (I will not be hushed) went viral on social media, as part of the call on Moroccan radio stations to join the boycott initiative. However, Lamjarred still has a loyal fanbase. In September 2018, fans launched a petition calling on his former lawyer, Eric Dupond Moretti, to come back and “save Saad’s future.” “Saad Lamjarred, the Moroccan pop star, needs the help of Maitre Dupond Moretti, to get out of the claws of the trap in which he fell, on behalf of all the fans, we ask you to sign this petition which will be addressed to this illustrious lawyer. Our heartfelt thanks,” wrote the initiator of the petition. The petition was signed by more than a thousand of Lamjarred’s fans.

Rabat – The city of Tangier cleaned up 7,000 tons of garbage during the Eid al-Adha sacrifice earlier this week. Eid al-Adha was celebrated this year on August 12.  Along with the companies contracted to provide waste collection and street cleaning, the city performed the cleanup over two days.  Tangier returned to “normal” as early as midnight on the day of sacrifice, city officials said, according to the state-run news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). On the first day of Eid al-Adha, the Eid of sacrifice, every Muslim family that is able to sacrifices a ram or a goat. While Moroccans carefully cook and consume most parts of the slaughtered animal, there is inevitably some refuse left over that must be disposed of. Last year, Casablanca employed as many as 2,300 cleaners to deal with the abundance of garbage over the Eid al-Adha holiday. Nearly half of the cleaners were hired just for the occasion.

Rabat – Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari, under whose tenure the West African country has considerably improved its relationship with Morocco, has expressed his desire to continue partnering with the North African country. In a tweet yesterday, August 14, on Nigeria’s plan to rekindle its agriculture and expand national output, President Buhari spoke warmly of Morocco’s contribution. “We are taking our focus on agriculture to the next level,” President Buhari announced. “In our first term, we partnered with Morocco to revive abandoned fertilizer blending plants across the country.” So far, the cooperation has been crucial in the creation of an initiative, the Anchor Borrowers’ Program, with the task of providing “cheap credit to small scale farmers.” As much as it empowers small scale farmers by providing them with loans and familiarizing them with modernized, advanced tools, the Nigeria-Morocco cooperation is ultimately aimed at helping the giant West African nation achieve food security. The Nigerian president explained: “We also developed the food security program that provided capital to large scale food processors to enable them to off-take the grains produced by smallholder farmers. All of these, and more, aimed at addressing the value-chain issues confronting agriculture in Nigeria.” Buhari’s comments further cement Morocco’s growing reputation in African countries as a reliable partner in terms of expertise sharing and assistance in development sectors such as agricultural policies. In the agriculture sector, especially, Morocco’s OCP, a giant in the global market of phosphates and fertilizers, has been an essential actor in the perceptible food security and sustainable development impetus across the continent. Since creating its continental subsidiary—OCP Africa— in February 2016, the Moroccan company has made it its calling to take the driver’s seat in what it hopes will be a green African revolution in the coming years. In addition to signing agreements with governments across the continent to build fertilizer plants, OCP Africa has created programs to assist local farmers as well as scholarships in agriculture-related domains to train the continent’s future decision-makers in the field. President Buhari’s comments come just a month after those of former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo, who also presented Morocco as an indispensable player in Nigeria’s and Africa’s aspirations to modernize agriculture and attain food security. The former Nigerian president hailed Morocco as an inspiration to other countries in the continent and acknowledged the kingdom’s role in the realization of a number of intra-African projects over the past months. President Obasanjo also urged other countries to replicate Morocco’s trajectory in terms of food security and sustainable development. In his tweet, President Buhari asserted that the next four years will see the introduction and implementation of “policies that will support cultivation and consumption of locally produced food items.” The Nigerian economy, he stressed, “stands to benefit a lot” from the cooperation with Morocco. The advantage for Nigeria includes job creation as well as “expansion of our rural economy.”

Rabat – Moroccan pilgrims who finished  the rituals of Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, this year will start returning to Morocco on Friday, August 16. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the first group of Moroccan pilgrims who will return to Morocco will be divided into three flights.

The ritual marks the end of the Hajj Pilgrimage in Mina. Tens of thousands ofMuslims from different countries worldwide chant “Allah Akbar” (God is great) and throw stones at pillars or “jamrat.” The three pillars, called jamarat, represent Satan in Mina. Pilgrims pelt seven stones at each pillar. The ritual honors the prophet Abraham’s stoning of the devil, who attempted to convince him to disobey God’s order. The prophet’s determination to obey God and sacrifice his son Ishmael overcame the devil’s temptation, according to the Qur’anic account. Just before Abraham sacrificed his son, God provided a male goat to sacrifice instead to honor Abraham for obeying God’s command. Hamou Ouehli, the secretary of state for Rural Development and Waters said that the Moroccan pilgrims performed the Hajj rituals in “peace and serenity and under very normal conditions.” Ouehli led the Moroccan official delegation for pilgrims this year. The number of Moroccan pilgrims who performed the Hajj in 2019, is estimated at nearly 32, 000 pilgrims. Saudi Arabia said that the nu overall number of Hajj this year reached 2,489,406, including 1,855,000 pilgrims from abroad.

Rabat – At least 843 migrants died while crossing the Mediterranean Sea to Europe between January 1 and August 8, 2019. The majority of those, 578, died while attempting to cross at the “central Mediterranean” route, which extends from Libya to Italy. The figures, from the International Organization for Migration’s Missing Migrants Project, indicate the incredible risks migrants take when making the passage.  One in six migrants attempting to reach Italy in 2019 have died, a UNHCR communications officer, Marco Rotunno, told the BBC. At the same time as deaths  of migrants taking the central Mediterranean route are rising, Italy has been increasing its restrictions on migrant-rescue operations. The Italian Parliament has introduced penalties on humanitarian boats engaged in the search and rescue of migrants. The boats are not allowed to dock in Italy with migrants aboard. The government can seize the rescue boats and fine captains €1 million. Rotunno noted his agency is “very very worried about the search and rescue capacity in the Mediterranean Sea that has been very very weakened in the last few years.” Italy’s new restrictions are backed by its far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini. Salvini has been serving in the role since June 2018 and is known for his anti-migrant stance. While the central Mediterranean route to Europe has claimed 578 lives, the western route, from Morocco to Spain, has seen 208 migrants die so far in 2019. The majority of the deceased migrants died just in the months of January and March. The combined death rate for crossing the Mediterranean, including western, central, and eastern passages, is actually slightly lower in 2019 (1.2%) than in the same months in 2018 (1.5%).

Rabat – Saudi pro-Israel blogger Mohammed Saud continues to stir backlash in the Arab world with his controversial videos on his love to Israel. In a recent interview, the blogger spoke about his trip to Israel and how much he was lucky to have the opportunity to travel to his “dream country.” When asked about his first trip to Israel, Saud said that he had ever experienced such a feeling before. “I heard about Israel from Google, Youtube. I did not expect my dream will come true. I don’t know how to express my feelings. Very wonderful -like i’m in heaven,” he said.  The Saudi blogger said that what he experienced there is contrary to what the media portray.  “It’s not right at all. It’s very amazing,” Saud said, claiming that there is coexistence between people of different religions. He said that everything is “perfect” about Israel, claiming that Israel wants peace in the Middle East. The recent controversial video comes a few weeks after  Palestinians drove the blogger out of the Al Aqsa Mosque compound in the occupied East Jerusalem. The blogger angered Palestinians after he posted a video expressing love for Israel and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In May, Saud also shared a video where he expressed his desire to visit Israel. “I wish there was a diplomatic relationship between my country and Israel. We have a lot to do to make our Middle East greater than ever.  Please support peace and I invite all of you to visit my country, and hopefully, I can visit your country. Thank you so much and God bless you.”

Rabat – Australia’s New South Wales (NSW) Police Force have identified the victim of the stabbing in Sydney which took place on Tuesday, August 13. The victim, 24-year-old Michaela Dunn, died after a man went on a stabbing spree in Sydney’s central business district (CBD). Police described the stabbing spree as “6 minutes of terrifying carnage.” Today, Wednesday, August 14, police released a statement saying the young woman had sustained injuries and was pronounced deceased at the scene, an apartment in the CBD. “The family of the woman whose body was located in an apartment in Sydney CBD yesterday have requested privacy,” the statement said. “While her family appreciate the support offered by the community, they have requested their privacy at this difficult time.” Dunn was allegedly stabbed to death when Mert Ney, a 20-year-old who police say has a history of mental illness, went on a stabbing spree on Tuesday. The police investigation found that Dunn was known to the suspect and they had been in contact via telephone that day. The exact link between the two is yet to be determined. Police added that Dunn was working as a sex worker, and Ney may have visited the apartment for an appointment. A 41-year-old woman, unknown to Ney, was also stabbed in the back in a hotel lobby, but she survived the attack and is currently in hopital. Police say she is lucky to be alive. Ney remains under police guard in hospital after he was detained by several members of the public who chased him after he jumped on the hood of a car, brandishing a bloodied knife. The men, who used cafe stairs and a milk crate to subdue Ney, have been lauded as “heroes of the highest order” by police. Ney’s motives have not yet been confirmed by Australian authorities. Although he was arrested carrying a USB with information about terrorist attacks and extremist ideologies and allegedly shouted “Allahu Akbar,” police currently believe he did not have any known links to terror groups, and that he acted alone. However, NSW Police Force Commissioner Mick Fuller told media this morning that a full investigation into the Ney’s motivation behind the stabbing rampage could take weeks or even months. “What he has on social media, what we can find in his bedroom may shine a light… on what his intent was,” said Fuller. “If we can link him to terrorist activities, the offences would see him locked away for a very, very long time.” Fuller also called on the Australian public to come forward if they have any knowledge on Ney’s life and movement leading up to the attack. “If a person has seen him… go to any place of worship please come forward,” he said. Ney is likely to be charged tonight or tomorrow with murder and serious assualt charges, with more charges to be tacked on if terrorist links are discovered further into the investigation.

Rabat – The Algerian Committee for the Opening of the Alerian-Moroccan Land Border has fulfilled its commitment to hold a peaceful sit-in to urge both the Moroccan and Algerian governments to reopen the border between the two countries. On August 13, a group of activists held a sit-in at the Colonel Lotfi Border, condemning the continuous closure of the border between Rabat and Algiers. One of the activists said that it is necessary for the two countries to reopen the border for the people. The activist said, “We arrived here at the  Colonel Lotfi Border to say in one voice that it is a must to open the border between Morocco and Algeria.” “There is no political, moral or historical justification for closing the border for decades. Today there are two peoples who should be saved from gangs’ rule. Today, we are asking with a loud voice that these borders must be for our Moroccan brothers,” the activist added. The activist concluded his statement, saying “long Live Algeria, long live Morocco, long live the peoples of both countries. The border between the two countries has been closed since 1994 after Rabat imposed visa regulations on Algerian citizens. Rabat’s decision came following a terrorist attack on the Atlas Asni Hotel in Marrakech. Lawyer Fatima Ezzahra, one of the activists who attended the peaceful sit-in, said that the protest aims to remove the security barrier implemented at the border of the two countries to become one people “as what we have always been.” The Algerian committee’s call for a peaceful sit-in came after King Mohammed VI renewed his call for more dialogue with Algeria in his Throne Day speech on July 29. In the speech, the King said that Morocco  will continue its commitment to the “policy of the outstretched hand towards our Algerian brothers, out of loyalty to the bonds of rooted in brotherhood, religion, language, and good-neighborliness that have always existed between the peoples of the two sister nations.” There is speculation that Algeria has started to study the possibility of reopening the border with Morocco.  Earlier this month, Independent Arabia quoted a source, who said that Algerian sovereign authority” is consulting with academies on the reopening of closed land border with Morocco. The authority ordered a study to discuss the “most effective way to open land border.”

Rabat – The Peruvian Council of Solidarity with Sahrawi People has called for the immediate release of three detained Sahrawi activists. The three activists have been in prison since June after their arrest for participating in protests to condemn human rights violations in the Tindouf camps, Algeria. La Razon, a Peruvian news outlet quoted a statement in which the council condemned the arrest of Moulay Aba Bouzid, Fadel Braka, and Mahmoud Zidane. The statement said that the three activists  have been “unjustly accused of alleged criminal acts and treason.” The charges, according La Razon, could lead to serious sentences, including the death penalty. The statement, signed by the president of the council Ricardo Sanchez Serra, also said that the three Sahrawis are “subject to harassment and intimidation.” The three activists have been protesting human rights abuses and the lack of freedom of movement, as well as corruption in the camps. La Razon said that the three activists also criticized the “tyranny of the Polisario Leaders.” In response to the arrest and continued incarceration of the three activists,NGOs such as Human Rights Watch (HRW) have condemned the arbitrary arrest of the three activists. The NGO found that there is no clear reason for the three men to be put behind bars other than their denunciation of the Polisario’s human rights violations in the refugee camps it administers, according to Lama Fakih, HRW’s Middle East and North Africa director. Mexican parliamentarian Antonio Ortega Martinez also addressed a letter to the Algerian ambassador to Mexico to express concerns over the arbitrary detention of the  three activists. The Peruvian council, which has long supported the Polisario Front, issued a statement in May, emphasizing that  “self-determination” and “independence” are no longer a viable option for the Western Sahara conflict. According to the council, the separatist path is “neither realistic nor pragmatic and does not respond to a mutually acceptable solution.” In February, the president of the council called on the Polisario Front to accept Morocco’s Autonomy Plan submitted to the UN in 2007 as a political solution to end the conflict. Sanchez Serra said that the support the autonomy plan received from international powers including the US confirms that the Autonomy Plan“represents a potential approach to satisfy the aspirations of the populations of Sahara.”

Morocco and Adidas worked together for seven years, the contract began in 2012. Last year, ahead of the 2018 World Cup, Moroccan football fans expressed disappointment over the Adidas kits for the Atlas Lions. The jerseys received a great deal of online criticism from unimpressed Moroccans.

Rabat – A 65-year-old man is being hailed internationally for his quick and courageous thinking during a terrorist attack on a mosque in Norway. On Saturday, a far-right extremist opened fire at the Al-Noor Islamic Centre in Baerum, west of the capital, Oslo. The attacker was wearing a helmet and body armor, and carrying several weapons, according to witnesses. There were three people inside the mosque at the time. No one was seriously injured, thanks to the brave actions of Mohammad Rafiq, a retired Pakistani air force officer. Irfan Mushtaq, the mosque’s director and one of the three people inside the mosque at the time, described the dramatic scene to the BBC. “This guy came to the door, and our hero, was very fast to react,” Mushtaq said. “He had just sat down to read the quran, and he got up and started moving towards the terrorist attacker, even though the attacker was shooting at the time, and took control of the attacker from the front.” Rafiq successfully managed not only to pin the attacker to the ground but disarm him, even though the attacker shoved his finger into the 65-year-old man’s eye. Mushtaq and the other worshippers rushed to help Rafiq and successfully subdued the man. Rafiq’s lawyer, Abdul-Satar Ali, told the Washington Post in a telephone interview his client suffered injuries to the head, hand and eye during the incident. “There is no doubt that the swift and firm response from the persons inside the mosque stopped the aggressor,” acting Police Station Chief Rune Skjold said in a statement. “These persons showed great courage.” Thanks to the efforts of worshippers, police apprehended the attacker, who has been identified as 21-year-old Philip Manshaus. Police also found the body of his 17-year-old stepsister at his residence after the attack. Manhaus has been charged with attempted murder for his attack on the mosque, and the murder of his stepsister. According to his defence lawyer, Unni Fries, he is denying the charges and refusing to speak to investigators. He appeared in court in Oslo on Monday, August 13, covered in bruises and scratches, presumably from his confrontation with worshippers in the mosque. The judge gave police permission to hold Manshaus in custody for an initial four weeks while he is investigated. According to Norwegian authorities, Manshaus had “expressed hostile attitudes against immigrants” prior to the attack. Authorities also said that they are investigating the authenticity of posts under Manhaus’ name. The posts announced his planned attack and referenced both the recent Christchurch and the El Paso attacks by far-right extremists. Norway’s Conservative Party Prime Minister, Erna Solberg, called the incident a “direct attack on Norwegian Muslims,” in a statement on Sunday, August 11. She also vowed to combat Islamophobic hate speech. The attempted attack is reminiscent of one of the deadliest mass shootings in recent years, when far-right extremist Anders Breivik killed 88 people in an attack on a summer camp near Oslo. Brenton Tarrant, who is accused of murdering 51 people in a terrorist attack on a mosque Christchurch in March, made references to Breivik in his manifesto. Just this month, another terrorist with anti-immigration and white-nationalist beliefs, killed twenty people in a shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas on Saturday, August 3. He posted a manifesto online entitled “The Inconvenient Truth,” warning against the supposed dangers of mass immigration, claiming that Hispanics will eventually take over the economy and government in the US.

Rabat – Spain has joined the US in its opposition to the creation of a new, independent state in Western Sahara. The Spanish government reportedly made the move on August 1, on the sidelines of the inauguration ceremony of newly elected Mauritanian president Mohamed ould Cheikh El Ghazouani. Josep Borrell, Spain’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, headed an “important Spanish delegation” at the event in Nouakchott, Mauritania’s capital, Moroccan outlet Le 360 reported. According to the Moroccan newspaper, the Spanish minister met with a number of high-ranking Mauritanian officials, including the president elect, to reiterate his country’s commitment to maintaining security and stability in the land corridor between Mauritania and Morocco. During his audience with President El Ghazouani, the newspaper noted, the Spanish minister “stressed the importance of the Spain-Mauritania relations.” In subsequent statements by the Spanish ministry of foreign affairs and cooperation, Madrid renewed its “attachment” to maintaining peace, security, and stability in the “strategic region of the Maghreb.” While the socio-economic ties between Morocco and Spain are second to none in the Mediterranean basin across the Maghreb, Mauritania is also a strategic partner for Madrid. As with Morocco, fisheries, the fight against transcontinental criminal networks, as well as joint efforts against irregular migration are the pillars of the bilateral links between Madrid and Nouakchott. Central to Madrid’s opposition to the creation of a new state in the land corridor between Morocco and Mauritania are profound concerns over security and the looming, constant threat of terrorist groups. “For Spain, this is essentially a Morocco-Mauritanian border requiring efforts from both countries to put together a joint forces with the task of monitoring the heavy road traffic and merchandise circulation between Europe, Morocco, and the rest of Africa,” the Moroccan paper explained. The news comes months after Spain reproached Algeria for “mischaracterization” and “misunderstanding” of its position on Western Sahara. In response to reports, attributed to the Spanish ambassador to Algeria, that Algeria and Spain “share similar opinions” on the Western Sahara issue, the Spanish government denounced the reports and denied being of the same opinion as Algeria. “What happened was a misrepresentation of our ambassador’s statements on Western Sahara,” said a spokesman of the Spanish ministry of foreign affairs. The spokesperson said that the European country’s “commitment to the UN process remains constant and unchanged.” As far as Morocco is concerned, the past few months have been rife with good news for the North African country’s position on the Western Sahara conflict. In addition to its autonomy plan being widely regarded as “serious” and “credible,” the country has recently convinced a new cohort of countries to support its stance. But perhaps the latest, most defining piece of good news for Rabat has been that of Washington being opposed to the establishment of a new state in Africa. “But those hoping to raise their flag over an independent Western Sahara are likely to be disappointed by the Trump administration. It has made clear in private talks that the U.S. backs Morocco in its opposition to the creation of an independent nation,” the Wall Street Journal reported last Sunday. The American paper quoted “Moroccan and Western officials involved in negotiations,” all of whom made the point that, mostly from a security and stability point of view, Washington favors Morocco’s Autonomy Plan over the creation of a Polisario-ruled state.

Rabat – In an interview with Eldia.es, Ahmed Moussa, the Consul-General of Morocco in the Canary Islands, stated that Morocco supports Spain “in the fight against irregular immigration, terrorism and all kinds of illegal traffic.” In the interview, published on August 14, Moussa denounced “the radicalism and terrorism now significantly present in Africa and at the top of the country’s list of challenges.” Moussa was asked if the increasing presence of terrorist groups in the Sahel area jeopardizes the security or economy of the country. “Morocco is a model of stability and security in Africa and in the Arab world,” Moussa replied. The Consul-general also affirmed that “the best way to guarantee freedom and human rights is to establish effective security mechanisms.”  He stressed how radical and terrorist acts “do not represent true Islam; Islam is peace, tolerance, cohabitation, and love of humanity.” “We consider these acts radical thoughts which lead to something hateful, terrorism,” he continued. Moussa further highlighted Morocco’s counter-terrorism efforts saying, “we condemn terrorism; we are part of the United Nations Counter-terrorism Committee, and we cooperate with Europe in the matter.” Asked if he agreed with the death sentences for the three main defendants who slaughtered two Scandinavian tourists in December, the Consul reiterated that “justice is an independent autonomous power in Morocco.”  On December 17, 2018, Moroccan authorities found two bodies of Scandinavian tourists beheaded in Imlil near Mount Toubkal. Three of the 24 suspects arrested were sentenced to death. The remaining suspects were sentenced to between 5 and 30 years imprisonment. Moussa added that “the Moroccan court applied the law in force in Morocco against the perpetrators of that heinous crime condemned by the entire Moroccan and international community.” He continued to congratulate the security forces for their exemplary efforts to stop the perpetrators of such crimes in record time. As part of Morocco’s counter-terrorism strategy, the country participated for the period of July 24 – August 8 in Interpol’s counter-terrorism program, Neptune 2. The country has taken an approach to fight terrorism not only through security measures but also through tackling the radicalization of the youth and the spread of extremist thought. In 2018, Morocco’s General Delegation to the Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR) launched “Moussalaha” program.  Moussalaha (reconciliation) aims to reintegrate prisoners into society after a process of “deradicalization” in which prisoners reconcile with themselves, then with the religious text, and finally with society.

Rabat – Spanish news outlet Malaga Hoy reported that Spain has sent 750 vehicles, 15 drones, and dozens of radar equipment sets to Morocco to help improve migration control. The news outlet published an editorial on Tuesday, August 12, which praised Morocco’s collaboration with Spain in migration border control. The editorial reported that the collaboration has resulted in a “significant decrease in the arrival of migrants to Spain.” Malaga Hoy said that 13, 326  irregular migrants arrived in Spain, “almost 9,000 less than in the previous period.” The online paper also recalled Spanish activism in favor of Morocco’s government at the European Union, which led to the approval of a €140 million grant. “The Council of Ministers approved the sending of another €30 million to Morocco from the Contingency Fund,” Malaga Hoy added. The editorial team of the paper said that there should be shared responsibility between the countries of origin and the recipient countries. “We must collaborate with African countries (…) to stop migration,” the paper said. Morocco’s efforts to curb irregular migration have received praise from Spanish news outlets over recent months. Earlier this month, ABC news outlet said that Morocco’s efforts helped slow irregular migration in Spain.  The month of July ended with a significant decrease irregular migration, ABC said. The news outlet added that in July security services intercepted 2,362 migrants at sea compared to 7,885 in the same period in 2018. The number of aborted attempts in July represents a 70% decrease. Morocco considers Spain one of its major partners in the fight against irregular migration. Director of immigration and border surveillance at the Moroccan Ministry of the Interior Khalid  Zerouali said that “together with Spain, we work for the best interests of minors.”  “We are a responsible country prepared to welcome these children, if they are truly ours, we must first identify them to make sure they are Moroccans,” he explained. On August 13, European Border and Coastguard Agency Frontex said that the “number of detections of illegal border crossings on Europe’s main migratory routes rose 4% from the previous month to around 10 500.” The agency added that the total for the first seven months of 2019 was “30% lower than a year ago at around 54 300.” Frontex said that the Eastern Mediterranean remained the “busiest” route in Europe with nearly 5,800 irregular migration attempts detected last month.

Rabat – In an interview with Eldiario.es published on August 11, Khalid Zerouali, director of immigration and border surveillance at the Moroccan Ministry of the Interior discussed Morocco’s immigration policy. Zerouali started by highlighting how “border security is the responsibility of all countries; all countries must contribute to make the fight against cross-border crime an effective fight.” Answering a question on Moroccan-Spanish collaboration on migration, he described the two countries’ relationship as “exemplary” and “a model of cooperation between the south and the north.” Explaining Morocco’s measures, he said “we work with mixed maritime patrols between the Royal Gendarmerie and the Civil Guard, air and land and cooperate in the exchange of information to fight against [criminal] networks.” He also stressed how “working together creates trust” between countries. As for European funds allocated to Morocco for better migration control, Zerouali believes that “the €140 million is a start; it will not fix the problem, but it is a welcome gesture.” “We also intend to work bilaterally with Spain and Europe in a long-term program,” he added.  According to the immigration director, the funds are divided into two parts, €30 million of the first €70 million was received in May 2019. By the end of summer, Morocco will receive two separate grants of €10 million. “The remaining €70 million includes €30 million from the International Center for Migration Policy Development [ICMPD] and €40 million from the Agency of Spanish Cooperation,” says Zerouali. “We have explained the need for material, and thanks to these organizations we will be able to acquire that material,” he further added. The migrant crisis in Europe Eldiario.es also asked the director about Ceuta’s new border fences. He clarified that “it is a project that began in 2016 following an evaluation which concluded that the devices had to be improved.” “The improvements will be not only in [the border fence with] Ceuta, but gradually throughout the country,” says Zerouali. For Zerouali, such changes are necessary, especially as Morocco suffers greater migratory pressure after the route through Libya was closed due to conflicts. “Part of what is happening in the region is the combination of a series of factors stemming from the migration crisis in Europe in 2013 and 2014,” says Khalid Zerouali. Stressing Morocco’s role in the migration crisis, Zerouali affirmed that “at a time when it was scary and countries closed their doors, Morocco and the king had the courage to regularize migrants.”  He further enumerated Morocco’s achievements in the matter saying that “50,000 who have a residence card are entitled to free health same as Moroccans…we have hosted 9,000 to 10,000 children and about 1,200 regularized migrants are studying vocational training courses.”  “We have granted between 7,000 and 8,000 university scholarships, and we collaborate with many NGOs that work in immigrant insertion,” he continued. Zerouali also pointed out that “the reality is that we have done a lot. We cannot do more than we do, not even for Moroccans. We are not a rich country.” On the issue of child repatriation, Zerouali stated that “together with Spain, we work for the best interests of minors.” “We are a responsible country prepared to welcome these children, if they are truly ours, we must first identify them to make sure they are Moroccans,” he explained.

Rabat – Moroccan international football player Hakim Ziyech has revealed that he had the opportunity to join Germany’s giants Bayern Munich. In an interview with Dutch news outlet AD, the football player expressed satisfaction with the extension of his contract with  Dutch football club Ajax Amsterdam. Ziyech also confessed that he had the opportunity to join Bayern Munich, but the German football club took too long to offer its deal. The football player said, “If a club wanted me, they could have made their move. I think everybody’s seen what we did with Ajax and what my role was in that success.” Ziyech also spoke again about the offer he rejected from Sevilla, emphasizing that he would “rather stay at Ajax.” “I could have waited for Bayern Munich, a year. But it felt like the right moment to clarify my situation, both for Ajax and myself.” He added that a transfer “was never the holy grail for me. If the right club doesn’t come along, so be it. I signed a new deal and will definitely remain at Ajax this season.” Despite all the tempting offers and interest he received, Ziyech said that he is now focusing on t what he hopes to achieve with his football club this season. Ziyech, whose contract has been renewed until 2022, said that “Last season we had unforgettable moments together. Moments like those are the reasons why I want to play football. He joined Ajax in 2017.

Rabat – As part of a diversity program sponsored by the City of Philadelphia, the Moroccan flag was raised in front of the city hall in an official ceremony on July 15, intended to celebrate Moroccan Americans. The ceremony was held in the presence of city officials, and, strangely, the Moorish Science Temple of America. No Moroccan representatives or diplomats were present. The Temple said the ceremony was for the benefit of “all people of Moorish descent reaffirming their pursuit of Justice, Liberty, and Independence,” and “dedicated to the descendants of the Moroccan empire in the Americas.”  “Welcome to Philadelphia, home of the Moorish American community,” said a Temple representative, at the start of the ceremony, donning one of Morocco’s fez hats, all members of the Temple are required to wear. “We are here today to celebrate Morocco day in the spirit of Moorish independence,” continued the Temple member. “Today we honor the principles of love, peace, freedom, and justice.” Grand Sheik Azeem Hopkins-Bay, from the Moorish Science Temple of America, then took to the stage. “I give praise to Almighty Allah because this day would not be possible if it wasn’t for the will of Allah,” said Hopkins-Bay. “I also give honor to Noble Drew Ali, the founder of the Moorish Science Temple of America, for reintroducing us to the Moorish flag, that is over 10,000 years old,” he continued. The Moorish Science Temple of America was founded on the premise that African Americans are descendants of the Moorish people, and thus Islamic by faith. The group was founded in Chicago, which its founder, Drew Ali, believed would “become a second Meccca.” Today, the Temple members refer to Ali as the “Great Prophet.” The group also claims to possess a secret part of the Quran that confirms this belief, which they refer to as the “Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America.” The group pledges allegiance to the Kingdom of Morocco and King Mohammed VI. The group, chosen to officially represent Morocco at this event, has been subjected to negative press and speculation since its founding in 1913, and was at one point labeled as a cult by the FBI. Its members have also been known to file false legal documents in various municipalities around the United States. The documents include fake liens, deeds, and property claims. However, the Moorish Science Temple has disavowed any affiliation with those filing the false documents, calling them “radical and subversive fringe groups.” Some found it strange that the Moorish Science Temple of America was chosen to represent Morocco at the official event. The Temple has no official affiliation with Morocco and there were no Moroccan nationals present, although the Temple members claim to hold “Moorish nationality.” The Temple members also referred to the flag as the “Moorish flag,” not once referring to it by its official status as the Moroccan flag. One viewer of the video contacted Morocco World News to express his disbelief of the situation. “The people presented as Moroccans are African Americans from a sect. The city representative talks about Moroccan Americans in her speech but the people around her have nothing to do with Morocco!” he said. “How can something like this happen at a very official event, and are the Moroccan American community aware of this imposture?” he asked. After the Grand Sheik’s speech, a City Representative of Philadelphia, Sheila Hess, took to the podium. “It is a great honor to be here today to celebrate the Moroccan community within our city of Philadelphia,” she said. “Today’s ceremonial flag-raising is a celebration of the many contributions and achievements with ties to the beautiful nation of Morocco,” Hess continued. It is again important to note that the Temple does not have ties to Morocco. “Our Moroccan American community is part of our treasured diversity and is a shining example of the success of our founder’s vision to create a city that is a beacon of tolerance and freedom,” said Hess. “Mayor Jim Kenney, who could not be here today, has issued a proclamation making today, (July 15) Morocco Day in the city of Philadelphia.” Hess then read an excerpt from Mayor Jim Kenney’s proclamation. “The city of Philadelphia is proud to be the home of choice for many people of the descent of the nation of Morocco,” read the proclamation. While the Temple representing Morocco at the ceremony believes all African Americans are Moors descended from northwest Africa, this contests the generally-accepted origins of African-Americans. “The Moroccan-American residents proudly share their heritage with their fellow Philadelphians, and over generations have greatly impacted our population, our culture, our political landscape, religious diversity, the economy, and the arts scene in our city,” continues the proclamation. “I, Jim Kenney, Mayor of the City of Philadelphia, declare July 15 Morocco Day, and we urge all citizens to be aware of the many contributions Moroccan-American residents, who are such an integral part of Philadelphia’s continued development and vibrancy,” finished the proclamation. After Hess and the Grand Sheik posed for a photo-op, the flag-raising ceremony began. Once the flag had been raised, the Grand Sheik Azeem Hopkins-Bay led a march in front of the city hall with other members of his congregation. “We are the Moors, the Mighty Mighty Moors!” chanted the group.

Rabat – Several neighborhoods across Moroccan cities found themselves with no water available on the day of Eid al- Adha. Suppliers cut off the water in Casablanca, Safi and its neighboring villages, Ouazzan, Oujda, and Fez. Citizens report that water suppliers gave them no prior notice. “We were not told they would cut it off, we would have prepared and saved some yesterday,” says one citizen in a Youtube video documenting the situation in Fez. The video shows a number of people traveling to a well-water source (13 kilometers away from Fez) to fill as many receptacles as possible and loading them onto their cars. Another citizen expressed his frustration with the city’s water supplier, “we’re thirsty, no water to drink, and above all that, our houses are in a despicable state with all the waste from Eid’s sacrifice.” “I’ve never seen such a thing, this feels like the 70s; we can’t even use our bathrooms! We shouldn’t have these issues anymore,” another complained. One of the people at the water source near Fez even considered the situation “a catastrophe” saying that “it would have been understandable if it was a technical issue or the first time such a situation has occurred, but this is the second or third year that this happens.” Almost every year, people in different regions wake up on the day of Eid to find that their taps are dry. In 2018, Moroccan citizens took to the streets to protest the recurrent issue. The affected towns included Tinjdad in the eastern region, Ait Milk in the southern Souss-Massa region, Taounate in the northern Rif Mountains, and Ksar el-Kebir in northwest Morocco. Ksar el-Kbir’s citizens protested the lack of water by hanging sheepskins on the gate of the region’s water distributor, Radeel.

Rabat – Polisario is not only facing the pressure from the families of the detainees, but also from international politicians and observers. Pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara reported that Mexican parliamentarian Antonio Ortega Martinez has strongly  denounced the ongoing detention of three Sahrawi activists. According to the same source, the Mexican politician addressed a letter to the Algerian ambassador to Mexico to express concerns about the deteriorating health of the three political detainees. The pro-Polisario outlet recalled that the Polisario Front arrested Moulay Aba Bouzid, Fadel Braika and Mahmoud Zidan over 50 days ago. So far no official charges have been brought against them. The Polisario arrested the three opposition activists in June when they were participating in protests in Rabouni to condemn human rights violations in the region. To protest their arrest, the three activists have been on  hunger strike for more than two weeks. The hunger strike has caused their health to deteriorate significantly. Martinez expressed frustration about abuse, and the arbitrary measures taken against the three detainees during interrogation. The arbitrary arrest of activists opposing the Polisario Front has been so far overlooked by major international news outlets. The Associated Press (AP), Agence France Press (AFP) and Reuters- which usually report on any alleged human rights in Western Sahara, in southern Morocco- have been conspicuously looking the other way and provided no press coverage about the fate of the three Sahrawi activists.  Al Quds news outlet reported on the fear and frustration of Sahrawi movements over the arrest of opposition activists without clear reasons. Al Quds said that the Sahrawi Initiative for Change blamed the leader of the Polisario Front, Ibrahim Ghali, for the situation of the detainees. The initiative also warned that the “three detainees have reached a critical stage as they declared their decision to refrain from drinking water.” The Sahrawi initiative is not the only movement to warn against the ongoing situation of the the three activists. The Sahrawi Khat Shahid “the Line of the Martyr” movement- a movement that has long declared its opposition to Polisario leadership, denounced its nepotism and corruption, and questioned its legitimacy and its handling negotiations with Morocco and- has also addressed a letter to the United Nations, urging it to intervene to end Polisario’s violations and arbitrary detention of Sahrawi activists.

Rabat – In recent weeks, talks over the future of the UN-led initiative in Western Sahara have centered on the challenge of replacing Horst Kohler, the UN special envoy who unexpectedly resigned in May for “personal reasons.” Almost four months since the German diplomat vacated a post where he helped rekindle hopes of a much-awaited historic diplomatic breakthrough, the nagging question among Western Sahara observers or commentators has revolved around the typical “What’s next?” or “What now?” This was both a rhetorical question and a genuine interrogation, one that seemed to expect an answer that at once evoked uncertainty and reservation. In both instances there seemed to be a niggling suggestion that the sudden resignation of the one who many thought held the keys to a towering diplomatic victory in the Western Sahara stalemate could resurrect seemingly buried hostilities and set the entire UN-moderated process decades back. In short, lurking beneath these assumptions and speculative questions was a profound worry that all the laudable progress made under Kohler’s supervision could end up being for nothing at all. These fears materialized some four months later when, out of the blue, and as the UN seemed busy finding a more effective way of monitoring the respect by all parties of UN-imposed status quo, Brahim Ghali, the leader of the separatist group in Western Sahara, called for an “inevitable war” against Morocco. The gesture was as dramatic as the theatrical tone in which it was delivered. More than a rhetorical outburst at an enemy one wishes to annihilate, however, Ghali’s feisty video message seemed to be coming from a position of insecurity, or disillusionment, or frustration. It had the not-a-big-deal flair and the desperate tone of a plucky underdog determined to pick a fight against a giant foe it knows it cannot defeat. In the usual “heroic victim” trope underdogs are so deft at deploying, Ghali seemed to argue that even if victory was far from assured against a “relentless” and great powers-backed Morocco, going to war was more of a matter of patriotic nobility and “obligation towards the fatherland.” “It is now clear that these peace negotiations are getting us nowhere,” he said. But what followed was far more evocative. Morocco, which has typically responded to Polisario attacks, something one commentator dubbed the “hollow war drums” to be expected whenever the horizon points towards prospective UN talks, did not this time respond to Ghali’s provocation. Outside of the sometimes alarm ringing news reports in various Moroccan outlets—including this one—Rabat issued no rejoinder to Ghali’s message. Why did Ghali sound desperate in his determination to go to war, while Morocco’s silence suggested confidence and composure borne of an apparent belief that the attack was a non-event? The answer, if one were to believe the recent reports on the latest developments in the conflict, is the growing perception in informed diplomatic circles that the international consensus is overwhelmingly drifting away from condoning the creation of another state in Africa. After suggesting that there is a “renewed interest” in the Western Sahara conflict amid looming talks about the mandate of Polisario, the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) recently reported that the current momentum is overwhelmingly in Morocco’s favor. Reporting from Laayoune late last week, Dion Nissenbaum, the security reporter for the WSJ, revealed—or rather confirmed, because the idea has been floating around since March—how all existing indications seem to point towards a Morocco-friendly political settlement as the most feasible outcome of the UN-led peace talks. A key factor in Polisario’s desperation that the outcome is all set to support Morocco’s stance is the notion that Washington, even as it still seems to be playing its double card of frustrating neither of the conflicting parties, believes that the region is better off as an autonomous territory under Moroccan sovereignty. “But those hoping to raise their flags over an independent Western Sahara,” Nissenbaum wrote of Sahrawi nationalists who at the beginning of this year appeared to pin their hopes on John Bolton’s known pro-Polisario sympathy, “are likely to be disappointed by the Trump administration.” Even with a national security adviser who has made abundantly clear on countless occasions his sympathy for the separatist narrative, or the fear—rather reasonable—that a Democrat-dominated House of Representatives would make things particularly hard for Rabat, the mood and behind-closed-doors whispers among diplomats suggest that supporting an alternative other than Morocco’s comes with the “risks” of causing more havoc and exacerbating “discontent in one of the few pockets of stability in North Africa.” Washington, Nissenbaum writes, “has made clear in private talks that it backs Morocco in its opposition to the creation of an independent nation.” Ghali’s apparent desperation is based on the idea that if the separatists stand by and do nothing, or put all their eggs in the UN negotiations basket, they are sure to end up participating in a contest fixed in advance to suit Morocco’s aspirations. “Morocco is unyielding because they know they have the support of great powers,” the Polisario leader said in his “inevitable war” declaration. Less than a fortnight later, however, the same Ghali who seemed irreversibly resolute in his call to “take radical measures” was now extolling the virtues of negotiation and dialogue. Extending to Morocco what seemed by all evidence like a performative friendship hand, Ghali turned into a “peace and cooperation” preacher. Ghali invoked “reconciliation” with Morocco as a “neighboring state.” Morocco and Polisario, Ghali uncharacteristically argued, should “move together to build the region and achieve the aspirations of its people for peace, stability, and development.” This felt fundamentally different from all previous declarations from Ghali, even the ones in which he was not as overtly bellicose as in the call for war. It was a surreal turn of events, albeit one that did not sound very different from the usual Polisario rhetoric. Essentially, Ghali’s offer was for Morocco to recognize the separatist group’s legitimacy over the disputed territories, something he knows does not make any sense from Morocco’s vantage point. To Rabat, it was buck-passing all over again, and hardly a genuine call for dialogue. Once all the recent developments are factored in, Ghali’s dialogue offer reads more like the chief separatist going back to playing the victimized, powerless underdog genuinely interested in talks with an interlocutor only seemingly interested in having what it wants. MINURSO’s mandate expires in October, and the idea is that Ghali’s peace offer may be capitalized on in pro-Polisario circles as yet another indication of Morocco “turning down” an offer for lasting settlement. Another reading may be that this was perhaps the Polisario leadership being forced to reckon with the fact that there is a need for a change of strategy amid increasing momentum around Morocco’s autonomy plan. The perception of defanged pro-Polisario rhetoric and enlivened Moroccan agenda among briefed diplomats is inherently a scary prospect for the separatist front. “Morocco has spent millions transforming Laayoune,” Nissenbaum’s article recalled. Over the months, the acknowledgment among foreign diplomats and businessmen of Rabat’s invested interest in developing the Laayoune and Dakhla regions has played a vital role in the noticeable paradigm shift, the increasing consensus around the “credibility” and “feasibility” of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. In a decades-long conflict where settlement debates have until now been marked by a cacophony of discordant voices, the idea of a consensual—or almost—drift towards a thoroughly pro-Morocco denouement is a festering pain in the neck for the separatist narrative. As such, both Ghali’s triumphant call for war and his conciliatory “cooperation” and “good neighborliness” speech seem to stem from the disillusionment that, as former Mauritanian president Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz put it in April, “The West, Europe and the US, do not want another state geographically separating Morocco and Mauritania.” Also at issue here is the dazzling velocity with which the diplomatic discourse seems to have changed. In January, especially after the New Yorker’s Nicolas Niarchos published his “Bolton effect” article, the fashionable, almost overwhelming, suggestion was that Morocco was lagging behind in convincing the US to unequivocally support its agenda. Washington may not have thrown its entire weight behind Rabat. It seems to be engaging in an intricate game of reaching the final, planned outcome without unforgivably frustrating the other party. Months after the fuss around the disruptive force of the “Bolton effect,” however, the idea that a senior American diplomat, however well versed in diplomatic dealings, or no matter how influential, could single-handedly upend the traditional, centuries old US-Morocco alliance now comes out as laughable at best.

Rabat – The Former Algerian defense minister, Major General Khaled Nezzar, is facing charges in Switzerland. NGO Trial International has accused him of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Algeria. The NGO announced on Twitter that hearings for the Nezzar case will resume in September. In addition to the NGO’s charges, Algeria’s military court of Blida also issued red notice or an international arrest warrant against the former defense minister. In June 2018, the Swiss Federal Criminal Court (FCC)  said that “there is no doubt that [Khaled Nezzar] was aware of the acts committed under his orders” in the early 1990s. La procédure pénale à l’encontre de #KhaledNezzar se poursuit en #Suisse. Les auditions reprendront en septembre 2019. Nezzar est accusé de #CrimesDeGuerre et #CrimesContrelHumanité commis en #Algérie. https://t.co/WspAI8aiBP — TRIAL International (@Trial) August 12, 2019  FCC also overturned a decision of the Office of the Attorney General (OAG), which tried to dismiss the case. Trial International also said that Nezzar was “aware of the countless crimes committed under his command.” “In five years of investigation and after hearing dozens of witnesses without ever raising the issue of the existence of an armed conflict, the decision to shut down the case was just incomprehensible,” Pierre Bayenet, the plaintiff’s lawyer  said. The lawyer was among the attorneys who appealed against the OAG’s dismissal, according to Trial International. The NGO maintained that  Nezzar was in charge of “troops who committed countless abuses” in Algeria during the “black decade” in 1992-2000. Trial International filed a complaint against Nezzar in October 2011.  Police in Switzerland then put him into custody.

Rabat – The Ministry of Royal palaces has announced that King Mohammed VI will no longer celebrate his birthday with the official annual ceremony at the royal palace. The celebration is traditionally held every August 21. The day is also a landmark to celebrate Youth Day which commemorates the  contribution of youth in Morocco. The decision comes a few months after the Ministry of the Royal Household called on institutions across Morocco to commemorate the Throne Day without undue extravagance on July 30. July 30 marked 20 years since the start of King Mohammed VI’s reign. The King was born on August 21, 1963 and will celebrate his 56th birthday this month.

Rabat – Australian police arrested a man who stabbed a 41-year-old woman in the back using a large butcher’s knife in Hotel CBD in Sydney on August 13. “At this point, it seems that the attack was not due to provocation, but we remain open-minded as we move forward in the investigation,” commented Gavin Wood, a police spokesman.  According to Agence France Press (AFP), the perpetrator, running in the street, tried to attack several other people while shouting “Allahu Akbar.” The police reported collecting several testimonies from eyewitnesses who said the suspect shouted “Allahu Akbar.” However, police are yet to determine the motives behind the attack.  A Tweet by Andrew Denney shows the man jumping on the roof of a car screaming “Allahu Akbar” (“God is the greatest”) and “shoot me in the f*** head!” Just witnessed incredible bravery from members of the public and ⁦@FRNSW⁩ officers chasing down a man on a stabbing rampage in Sydney’s CBD. He is now under arrest. ⁦@7NewsSydney⁩ pic.twitter.com/wNKatejHVp — Andrew Denney (@Andrew_Denney) August 13, 2019  However, ABC News reported that the police did not consider “the incident terror-related, the suspect had no known terrorist links, and he was acting on his own.” ABC News also reported that the police confirmed that the suspect had a history of mental health problems, and is believed to have escaped from a mental health facility a few days earlier. Police indicated that the victim was in a stable state and that there are apparently no other victims “despite the man’s several attempts to stab others.” However, the body of a 21-year-old woman showing several stab wounds was found in an apartment complex on Clarence Street, a short distance from where the man was arrested. According to the Guardian, “the man was carrying a USB drive containing documents espousing “terrorist ideologies” and detailing mass casualty crimes, including recent attacks in North America and New Zealand.” Before his arrest, the man was restrained by bystanders, considered ‘heroes’ by the police, using cafe chairs and a milk crate. The suspect, who also sustained injuries, was taken to hospital. He is expected to be charged with murder and serious assault charges. “If it becomes a terrorist incident, obviously there will be other charges in relation to that; it’s an evolving investigation,” Mick Fuller, the police commissioner said.

Rabat – This morning, my six-month-old cat named Doha escaped from my El Youssoufia apartment in Rabat.  Since I moved to the apartment in early June, Doha has spent hours lounging and sleeping in the large, unscreened windows, completely unsupervised. She has never expressed an interest in actually going outside—until today. Today I experienced every indoor cat owner’s worst nightmare. My fiance was frantic, and he raced out the door as I watched her frolic in the garden from our first-floor windows. I tried to lure her back inside with toys and food, but she wasn’t interested.  In the distance, I saw Ricky, a big orange cat with a wonky eye, creep through the barbed wire fence into the garden. He was heading straight for Doha. Shouting obscenities, I raced around the apartment looking for something soft but heavy to throw at him should he get too close. I grabbed the rubber lid from a can of cat food and dashed back to my post.  Amine, my fiance, was outside, but the gate to the garden was padlocked and the elderly woman with the only key was nowhere to be found. After trying unsuccessfully to maneuver through the barbed wire, he scaled the gate.  When Amine landed on the other side, Ricky got spooked and ran away. I released my weapon, relieved that Doha was just seconds away from being back inside.  Except she wasn’t. As Amine approached her, she bolted. She had no plans to come quietly, and darted under a padlocked door into a junk-filled alleyway that luckily had no exit.  After a few minutes of anxious waiting, Amine broke through the rusted door to the alley where he found Doha locked in a staredown with Sheila, the hefty blue-cream calico who had claimed the territory around our corner of the building. A notorious fighter with the scars to prove it, Sheila goes after any female cat who gets too close.    Startled by Amine’s belligerent entrance, Sheila hightailed it out of the alley. Doha, too, was about to make a run for it, but she got distracted by a sound behind her. Only because of this brief moment of vulnerability was my fiance finally able to grab her.  Today I realized that my cat was in heat.  She went outside not because of boredom or curiosity but to look for a mate; she wanted not to be free but to be impregnated. This instinct put her in danger—she could have easily gotten lost, been attacked by another cat, or hit by a car—and nearly gave my poor fiance a heart attack.  This unnerving ordeal taught us an important lesson about owning a pet: Sterilization is an urgent necessity.     Benefits for household pets All unsterilized animals are driven by the instinct to mate, but domesticated household pets face enormous risks when pursuing these natural tendencies.  Male and female cats and dogs will wander until they find a suitable partner, making them vulnerable to fights with other animals; dangerous weather conditions; cars and trains; insect bites; diseases and infections; hunger; and being unable to find their way home.  Many pet owners unfortunately lose their animals due to this instinct to mate— and to the potentially life-threatening health issues that affect unsterilized cats and dogs.    Female cats and dogs are prone to uterine infections and breast tumors, “which are malignant or cancerous in about 50 percent of dogs and 90 percent of cats,” according to the ASPCA.  “Spaying your pet before her first heat offers the best protection from these diseases.” Unsterilized male cats and dogs can develop testicular cancer and various prostate problems.  The sterilization of cats and dogs is recommended by all veterinarians, as it significantly improves health as well as behavior in both males and females.    Unsterilized male cats, or tomcats, regularly mark their territory with a pungent urine spray and usually exhibit aggressive behavior. Tomcats who are free to go outside the house are likely to get into fights with other males, which puts your cat in danger. They will undoubtedly mate with unsterilized females, thereby directly contributing to the overpopulation of your neighborhood.  Unsterilized female cats, known as queens, also flaunt undesirable behaviors. Most notable is the constant yowling when in heat, and they may also mark objects with urine during this period. If an unsterilized female housecat is allowed outside, she will most likely come home pregnant. If she cannot roam outside at will, her scent and noises will attract tomcats to your property. Unsterilized or intact male dogs are often more aggressive than other dogs and far more difficult to train. Like tomcats, intact dogs mark their territory with urine. They also may engage in inappropriate or unsettling behavior such as masturbation or mounting people, animals, and inanimate objects.  Unsterilized female dogs will bleed when in heat, which stains carpets and furniture and requires constant cleaning. They may also endure false pregnancies during which their nipples produce milk. They will also attract intact males, and can get pregnant if left unsupervised.  Hormonal animals in the house are generally a nuisance. However, no matter how annoying they may be, these behaviors are natural responses to hormonal fluctuations. They cannot be corrected using disciplinary measures.   Sterilizing your pet will not solve every behavioral issue, but eliminating the desire to mate curtails plenty of unwanted and potentially dangerous exploits in cats and dogs.  Ideological approaches to sterilization While there are many recorded benefits to sterilization, some Muslims wonder if this procedure goes against their religion.  Some Islamic scholars, or ulama, believe that sterilization interferes with God’s creation, and that good Muslims should not even keep animals–particularly dogs—as pets. Buying and selling dogs and cats is actually considered haram by some jurists, as is spending an excessive amount of money on caring for or celebrating animals.   Alternatively, some ulama believe that animals can only be sterilized if they are going to be used for food at some point. This, of course, excludes household pets such as cats and dogs.  Other scholars maintain that sterilizing animals is permissible so long as it does not hurt the animal, and some argue that sterilizing animals is actually necessary to prevent their suffering.  These pro-sterilization scholars use the reality of overpopulation to justify this reasoning.  In developed and developing countries alike, thousands of unwanted cats and dogs are euthanized in shelters and culled in the streets on a daily basis. Sterilization prevents the birth of unwanted animals that will eventually be neglected, abused, or killed. In this sense, it is permissible—and necessary.  Public health benefits In Morocco, where there are as many unwanted animals as there are people, street cats and dogs are suffering.  A large-scale sterilization program is the only solution to Morocco’s cat and dog overpopulation problem. By reducing the overall number of litters born—to both household pets and strays—the general population of unwanted animals will decrease. Reducing the population of cats and dogs will greatly benefit the public. The spread of rabies and other diseases be curtailed, animal waste will be less prevalent in residential areas, and traffic accidents caused by wandering cats and dogs will decrease. Additionally, the daily nuisances such as fighting, barking, and mating that are associated with strays will dwindle. Successfully combating Morocco’s animal overpopulation is also dependent on pet owners, which means that sterilization procedures must become more accessible. Morocco needs more veterinarians, pet-related medical expenses should be scaled to the cost of living, and pet owners must be informed of the responsibility they have to spay and neuter their companions.   While several independent animal welfare organizations are working to sterilize and vaccinate local stray populations, most cannot afford to pursue comprehensive TNR (trap-neuter-return) programs. A true solution must be initiated by the government, supported by the public, and bolstered by pet owners.

Rabat – If a Moroccan friend invites you to attend Ed Al Adha celebrations, don’t you dare say no!  The feast is one of two Islamic holidays celebrated across the world annually. Besides the importance of Eid Al Adha in Islam, the atmosphere of the celebration differs from one country to another. In Morocco, citizens feel the vibes of Eid Al Adha weeks before as equipment needed for the celebration inundates Moroccan souqs, including knives, barbecue grills,  and skewers. Eid Al Adha is also when the chef of every home in Morocco amazes his or her family with the best dishes. The first day is typical as most Moroccan houses prepare the same meals: entrails, or tkalia, and grilled lamb’s liver, “boulfaf.” When the procedure of sheep skinning and slaughtering is over, mothers, daughters, and sons help to clean sheep intestines used to prepare the famous traditional tkalia. While some people may find the idea of eating sheep entrails a little stomach churning, this is a staple in most Moroccan homes. Using the entrails means nothing is wasted. When cleaned thoroughly, with lots of water, the preparation starts. The main ingredients to prepare the traditional meal are stomach, intestines, lungs, and spleen. Women usually cut all of the ingredients into square inches. The first phase is putting the main ingredients in the pressure cooker to boil for approximately15 minutes  in water and salt. Later, the cook will reduce the quantity of water and leave only what is needed for the sauce. Of course, the spices are the main key for every delicious bite, and tkalia includes all the colorful ones. The cook uses black pepper,  cumin, salt, garlic, turmeric powder, red pepper, chili, coriander,  olive, and vegetable oil and leaves to simmer until it is ready for serving it with homemade bread or mekhmar (flatbread). Tkalia is not only served during Eid Al Adha, but it is also served on normal days. The taste, however, differs as the atmosphere of celebrations can have a special influence on the food you eat. Delicious barbecue smoke Be prepared to smell delicious smoke from the barbecue grills out of almost all the houses. In addition to tkalia, most of the Moroccan people also prepare grilled lamb liver, known as boulfaf. If you are suffering from high cholesterol or blood pressure, it is preferable to avoid this meal as the liver is usually covered with sheep fat. The dish is not so difficult in terms of preparation.  The cook will need two main ingredients: fat and livers. Traditionally, the cook will put the liver in a barbecue grill until it is semi-cooked. Later, the cook will cut the liver into inches and wrap them in sheep fat, before threading them onto a skewer. Each skewer can include five to six pieces which can be so sufficient. The dish is usually served with red chilli pepper, cumin, and salt. Moroccan tea is also one of the key elements used in Eid Al Adha. It can be served either before or after the food to help digest these delicious delicacies.

Rabat – Er Rihani, a 22-year French-Moroccan business student, has chosen to take an unconventional gap year. Rihani has challenged himself to cycle from Paris, where he studies at ESCE, all the way to Beijing. He started the trip in June, and has already made it to Mongolia. Rihani, who has always had a taste for adventure, goes on a bicycle trip every year. In 2015, he rode from Nantes toIreland, then Paris to Copenhagen in 2016. In 2017, he took a 44-day trip from Paris to Tangier, a 3,000 km distance. In 2018 he went even further, cycling from Aix-en-Provence to Istanbul, a 4,000 km trip. But this trip is by far his most ambitious yet, adding up to 12,000km in total. He told HuffPost, he will pass a dozen countries along the way, making it a trip many can only dream of. Rihini also told HuffPost that ESCE Paris offered to help fund the expensive trip, for which he is incredibly grateful. “It’s nice to see that a school supports the projects of its students and accompanies them in their achievements,” he said. However, the dream trip is not without its challenges. Rihini said he has “never been more aware of the force of nature on man.” He has faced heavy rains, which last all day long, “turning the countryside into mud hell and cities into wave pools, as well as violent winds coming from the front and sometimes draining sandstorms.” When asked by HuffPost what is the best part of his trip, he answered quickly: people. “I have shared nights, meals and discussions with people from all backgrounds and stories of life just as beautiful, crazy and rewarding as each other,” he said.

Rabat – Upon his arrival at the Hassan II mosque, a Royal Guard unit stood in tribute and greeted King Mohammed VI. After the Eid prayer, the Imam (leader of the prayer) emphasized the deep meanings of Eid Al Adha, celebrated in the first ten days of the month of Dhu al-Hijjah. This is a sacred month in the Islamic calendar in which the Hajj pilgrimage takes place. “This holiday is an opportunity for parents to teach their children the religious and social meanings of this blessed day, a symbol of sacrifice,” the Imam added. The king was then greeted by the heads of Islamic diplomatic missions in Morocco. Afterward, the King performed the ritual of sacrifice, following the tradition of Prophet Mohammed (pbuh). The Imam then proceeded to the sacrifice of the second sheep on behalf of the Moroccan people. At the end of the ceremony, the king returned to the Royal Palace. The head of the government, the presidents of the two Houses of Parliament, the King’s Councilors, and senior officers of Royal Armed Forces, among others, congratulated the King on this sacred day. King Mohammed VI also sent messages of congratulations to the Heads of State of Islamic countries. In these messages, the King sent His best wishes of more prosperity and well-being.

Rabat – The Sahrawi Khat Shahid “the Line of the Martyr” movement addressed a letter to the United Nations, urging it to intervene to end Polisario’s violations and arbitrary detention of Sahrawi activists. The letter, published by several local media outlets, condemns the arrest of Mahmoud Zidan, Fadel Braika, and Moulay Aba Zid, whom the Polisario Front arrested during their participation in a protest in June. Quoted by several local news outlets, the letter called on the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, to save the detained Sahrawis. The letter added that the Polisario Front carried out the crackdown  without informing the detainees of why they were being arrested. The movement recalled that the activists have been carrying out a hunger strike i protest of their arbitrary detention. The letter also quoted Aba Bouzid, who in a leaked recording, asserted that the activists would continue their hunger strike until death if they were not released. The letter continues to emphasize that the detained activists did not give any cause for arrest, “except that they have expressed their views against corruption and the lack of democracy of the Polisario leadership.” “They were kidnapped, torture and thrown into small cells in a land where temperatures exceed 54 degrees.” The letter also warned that Algeria is to blame for the arrest and detention of the activists. Earlier this week, pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara said that Zidan and Aba Zid were hospitalized on Monday, August 5, as their health deteriorated due to their hunger strike. Despite the hospitalizations, the Polisario Front has remained silent on the case of the jailed activists, as well as on the disappearance of a leading Polisario member, Ahmed El Khalil. Despite the persistence of El Khalil’s family, the Polisario Front has not yet explained El Khalil’s whereabouts. The Polisario member has been missing for nearly 10 years. Algerian intelligence services and Polisario arrested him in 2009 after he was appointed to monitor human rights in the Tindouf camps in Algeria, where Polisario is headquartered.

Rabat –  Eid al-Adha, or the Festival of Sacrifice, is celebrated every year by Muslims around the world.  The Quranic story behind the holiday is awarded legitimacy in all three Abrahamic religions. However, only Muslims celebrate this tradition as a holiday.   The Muslim holiday is heralded as one of the most beautiful, exciting, and joyous occasions in the world. In Morocco, foreigners consider themselves lucky if they are able to experience it firsthand.  However, the longstanding tradition of sacrificing an animal to celebrate the mercy of God has been met with conflict in recent years as animal welfare activism becomes more widespread.  One might assume that the hostility towards the festivities of Eid al-Adha primarily comes from the West, where ethnocentrism and racism tend to criminalize anything related to Islam and the people of color who practice it.  Years ago, this would have been a correct assumption. However, Muslims have also begun disavowing the tradition of animal sacrifice as outdated, unnecessary, and inhumane.   Halal hypocrisy Muslim scholars and activists around the world are denouncing the animal sacrifices of Eid al-Adha and the festival’s position within the larger framework of “halal hyprocrisy.” Killing animals for food and other resources is permissible in Islam but must be done in a humane manner, in accordance with Islamic law. Halal slaughter should minimize the suffering of the animals in question.  Adhering to an ethical method of slaughter, however, does not exempt Muslims from perpetuating the suffering of animals. In a USA Today feature, Mohammed Ghilan, a student of Islamic jurisprudence, points out the Muslim hypocrisy of stressing halal meat while “contributing to the non-halal slaughter by consuming dairy and other animal derivatives.”  “How are you going to explain to Allah on the day of judgement your decision to support a system that is inherently cruel and violates the rights of animals?” asks Medium contributer Gabriel Abraham in a discussion of the meat, egg, and dairy industries. In the modern capitalistic world, the living conditions of the animals being sacrificed for Eid are not always on par with Islamic standards.   “The ways in which cows, sheep, goats and other animals are raised, handled, transported and slaughtered for food are inherently cruel,” argues PETA, the largest animal rights organization in the world. Animals in Islam (AII), an informative animal welfare website run by Islamic scholars, also condemns the Westernized factory-farming methods that have tarnished the halal meat industry.  “Currently, the high Islamic standard of compassion to animals is often violated by those who provide sacrificial animals,” according to one of the website’s scholarly articles on Eid al Adha. “These days, the numbers of animals needed [for Eid] are so high that the majority are imported from New Zealand and other countries,” another AII article states. “These animals are shipped in brutally overcrowded conditions where large percentages regularly die from disease, being trampled, or heat exhaustion.”  “This is not humane. This is not halal. And we can’t ignore this reality.” Tradition, family, and charity Despite the debate about animal welfare that is triggered by such a large-scale slaughter, the point of Eid al-Adha for many Muslims is not to celebrate the death of animals.  “Eid is a day of happiness and gathering. It symbolizes love, family, and helping others,” Mohammed, 57, told MWN. “Everything we do is for God.” Mohammed added that he personally cannot bear to kill the sheep himself, nor can his two adult sons. Fearing that a slip-up would cause the sheep pain, the family prefers to have a professional butcher stop by to do the deed. Many other families also elect this method, although traditionally the animal’s throat is cut by the man of the house.   For Mohammed and many other Muslims, the joys of the holiday have very little to do with the physical act of sacrifice. The symbolic significance of the sacrifice is lost on no one, but killing— no matter how painless or ethical it may be—does not come easily to all. For SFT Animal Sanctuary in Tangier, Eid al-Adha is primarily about charity.  “We at SFT help the poor everyday, because that’s what humanity is about,” reads a Facebook post from SFT’s official account. “We would never sacrifice a sheep because to us they are just as precious as any living being.”  “I believe, and I am sure, that getting close to God is not done with blood, murder, and violence but with humanity, charity, love, and mercy,” adds a post in Arabic by SFT Tangier’s Projet Hayat.  Whatever one’s personal position may be, the conversations surrounding the animal sacrifices of Eid al-Adha present a critical opportunity for self-reflection.  Especially in Morocco, where strays, pets, and working animals are regularly neglected and abused, discussions of ethics must also incorporate the animals not being consumed for food. During the holiday, families should consider where their sheep came from and if it has been raised in accordance with sharia. And those who classify Muslims as primitive and barbaric for partaking in animal sacrifice must take a look at their own eating habits.  Morocco World News wishes a blessed Eid to all.

Granada – Thousands of Moroccans living abroad (MREs) returning to Morocco for Eid al-Adha overwhelmed the Moroccan border with Ceuta over the weekend. As many as 295,000 Moroccans have returned to Morocco from Spain for the summer holidays since July 15, when Spain’s Operation Strait Passage (OPE) began. Each year, OPE facilitates the return of Maghrebis to their home countries. The weekend saw the operation’s busiest days as many Moroccans returned home for the Eid of sacrifice. Muslim families celebrate together God’s provision of a lamb for Ibrahim by sacrifcing a ram or goat. Lines of vehicles waiting to cross from Ceuta into Morocco inundated the border on Saturday, August 10. Many Moroccans had come across the Strait of Gibraltar from Algeciras to Ceuta by ferry. In Algeciras, some ferries left more than 30 minutes after their scheduled departure due to the large volume of vehicles. Officials anticipated the large influx of MREs, and there were no incidents reported in connection with the delays at Algeciras. In 1982, an “avalanche” of vehicles and people descending on Algeciras to take the ferry to Ceuta led the Spanish government to implement special plans for dealing with the numbers. In Algeciras, the government set up a special parking lot for vehicles waiting to board the ferry. Upon arrival in Ceuta, officials segmented vehicles into groups of 100 to navigate from the port to the border with Morocco. In Morocco, the government prepares annually for the return of MREs with Operation Marhaba. The operation coordinates the smoothe arrival of hundreds of thousands of Moroccans returning home for the summer holidays from Europe. Last month, the Spanish interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, said Marhaba was an “example of good coordination between the different public administrations and between neighboring countries.”

Rabat – While Morocco is known for a variety of sweet and savory dishes, including our moist corne de gazelles, made with ground almonds, Marrakech’s renowned Tangia, and the quintessential mint tea, perhaps the most famous of Moroccan dishes is the Tagine. Tagine is actually the name of the earthenware cooking pot. The tagine can be used to cook almost anything, from eggs, to ground beef, to bread. Today I’m going to show you a simple meat and vegetable recipe – once you have the basics you can do anything with a tagine!’ The tagine is cooked slowly at a low temperature, resulting in an aromatic, deep flavor and the all-important sauce to soak up with a chunk of warm bread. First of all, you will need:
1 kg of red meat, beef, or lamb
1 diced onion
1 peeled, diced tomato
3 peeled carrots, cut into wedges
2 potatoes, peeled and cut into wedges1 zucchini, cut in half lengthwise
150 grams of peas
A generous bunch of chopped coriander and parsley
1 teaspoon of ginger
1 teaspoon of salt½ teaspoon of turmeric½ teaspoon of ground black pepper
Few saffron stamens, soaked in cold water.
3 cloves of minced garlic
3 tablespoons of oil2 tablespoons of olive oil
Here’s you do it:
Put the meat, spices, and some parsley and coriander in a bowl, mix them well and leave to marinate for a few minutes before cooking.
Add oil, onions, and the meat to the tagine and place it on the stove and set the fire to a low heat. Cover the tagine and heat for 10 minutes. Stir frequently.
place the vegetables decoratively on top of the meat.
Add some more parsley, some salt and olive oil. Whenever I prepare tagine with lamb, I add some argan oil because it gives an amazing taste to lamb and a wonderful, nutty flavor to the vegetables.
let the tagine to cook for about 1 hour and 30 minutes.
Serve hot with bread! Simple, and delicious.

Rabat –  The leader of the Polisario Front, Ibrahim Ghali, has made an unprecedented call asking for “cooperation and reconciliation” with Morocco. At the 10th annual “summer universities” of the Polisario Front and the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), Ghali said that he is “extending” Polisario’s hands to the Kingdom of Morocco for “peace, reconciliation, cooperation, and good neighborliness.” He added that Morocco’s treating the self-proclaimed SADR as a brotherly country will “bring the two countries and two peoples, and the peoples and countries of the region, many more achievements and will be better than the consequences of following an unjust policy that violates legitimacy and history.” Ghali added that “it is time for [Morocco] to deal will all responsibility courage and wisdom with this natural and legitimate reality in order to move together to build the region and achieve the aspirations of its people for peace stability and development.” Ghali’s peace discourse came a week after he called forwar with Morocco. In a video published by pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara, Ghali announced his plan to implement compulsory military service in the Tindouf camps in Algeria where Polisario is headquartered to “prepare for the inevitable war against a relentless enemy.” The statement stands in contrast with his recent message for peace and reconciliation. Morocco, which sees its territorial integrity and sovereignty over Western Sahara as uncrossable red lines, is unlikely to accept Polisario’s fragmentary offer. King Mohammed VI recently reiterated Morocco’s principles and position on the conflict, emphasizing that the Autonomy Plan is the only solution to end the conflict. On the eve of the Throne Day on July 29, the King said that the celebration was “a most fitting occasion to reiterate our unwavering commitment to the Moroccanness of the Sahara, to our national unity and territorial integrity, and to full sovereignty over every inch of the Kingdom’s territory.” Morocco also believes that the Polisario Front, which has been violating human rights in the Tindouf camps, does not have the legitimacy to represent Sahrawis. Rabat has, therefore, has called repeatedly on Algeria to take responsibility to resolve the conflict, because it shelters and arms the Polisario.

Rabat – Moroccan police and customs officers arrested two women in possession of 11,700 psychotropic pills on August 9 at the Ceuta crossing point. The security services found the drug concealed inside milk cans under the clothes of one of the women. The two women were heading to Morocco on board a Spain-registered car. The suspects have been taken into police custody for further investigation to determine the circumstances of the case. Moroccan police at the crossing point at the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla are intensifying efforts to curb drug trafficking attempts. In May, Morocco’s Administration of Customs and Indirect Taxes (ADII) said that Moroccan security services  seized 836,808 units of psychotropic drugs in 2018 alone, including dangerous varieties, such as ecstasy and rivotril. The number of psychotropic drugs seized increased from 140,000 seized in 2017 to 836,808 in 2018.

Rabat – All over the world today, families, friends, and neighbours are gathering to celebrate Eid Al Adha.  Laughter and cheerful voices are warming homes across the globe and tables are  laid, heavy with succulent lamb dishes, local delicacies, and holiday treats. Children put on their best clothes and rush excitedly into the kitchen to see what delicious sweets await them, and their parents greet them with holiday kisses and warm embraces.  Meanwhile, in a field in France a young man wakes up in a tent, cold, and hungry, thousands of miles away from his family. A woman lies in a makeshift shelter on a Greek island, listening to her baby crying, wondering if she will ever see her husband again. A small child stands in the dust playing with a cardboard box, her only toy.  According to statistics from the UNHCR, there are currently 70.8 million displaced people in the world. 41.3 are internally displaced, meaning that they have fled their homes but remain in their country of origin, while 25.9 million have fled to a different country.  Of the 70.8 million, only 3.5 are officially classed as asylum seekers, meaning that the vast majority are living in refugee camps, detention centers, or simply on the streets.  In 2016, I celebrated my first Eid Al Adha, not in a Moroccan home or with my family, but with 30 or more Sudanese men, taking shelter in the sand dunes of Calais, France.  Until October 2016, the Calais ‘Jungle’ camp was home to in excess of 9,000 migrants and refugees. While the French authorities cite a much lower number, aid agencies on the ground including Auberge de Migrants and Help Refugees, who carried out a monthly census, published numbers as high as 14,000.  The sprawling camp was home to refugees and migrants from Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and even Morocco. With limited running water, poor sanitation, and no access to medical care, the thousands of refugees survived with only the clothes on their backs and donations of food and clothes from international aid agencies. It was an informal camp and there was little to no state involvement.   Despite the living conditions and memories of the horror which had caused many of the residents to flee their home countries, the excitement and joy surrounding Eid was palpable.  The Sudanese community began their preparations weeks ahead. These preparations involved the procuring of traditional ingredients, the washing and pressing of the only clothes they had using buckets and pieces of wood in the open air, and inviting friends to join them. I soon realised that, for them, Eid was not about the food or the sacrifice, but about sharing what little they had with those they cared about. Honored to be on the guest list, I too set about looking for something respectable to wear for the occasion. When the day finally came, laden with meat from the only halal butcher we could find, and hiding cooking equipment under school books, a friend and I arrived at the camp. The armed French riot police, as ever, wanted to search the bags and to see identification. With a permit from the French authorities, I had the right to enter the camp with teaching equipment but not with spices, bamya and several kilos of meat. Having eventually passed a rather aggressive search, we set off down the long dirt track towards the school where I worked, and where the Eid celebrations were due to take place.  No sooner had we lifted the heavy bags but a gang of young men materialized to help us, wearing crisp, clean, and mismatched clothes, and matching expressions of excitement. As we walked towards the compound, one young man, a 21 year old South Sudanese refugee named Ali, told me about what he would be doing were he still at home.  He explained that he and his brothers were responsible for sacrificing and skinning the sheep,and then his mother and sisters would prepare it while the men chatted and cleaned up the mess. Sweet tea would be served and fried doughnuts. He smiled as he recounted how they would laugh, and sometimes they played games too. What he did not say then was that they are now all dead.   When we reached the compound, I made immediately for the cooking area where a little man called Idris, a professional  chef in his own country, was already instructing several compatriots about the right way to chop onions. He was a rather taciturn individual and it was rare to get a smile from Idris, but he beamed as he saw the contents of the shopping bags. I was given instructions to prepare vast amounts of garlic, smashing it with olive oil in an empty plastic bottle.  The preparations took hours, while the sand swirled around in the cold breeze from the French coast. As we cooked in the makeshift shelter over a fire in an empty oil barrel, one of the Mohammeds, also from South Sudan and aged only 19, told me about playing football with the other boys in his village. An older man called Faisal sang Bob Marley songs as he swept the sand to remove the litter and debris that covered the open space.  Maliq, 25, sang the call to prayer as the other men washed their hands, feet, and heads, helping each other to wash using 5 liter water bottles they had filled at a water station about a ten minute walk away. A little late, Handal and Gamar arrived at the broken wooden gate, pushing a broken trolley filled with water bottles. Abandoning their cargo, they joined the washing ritual ready for prayer before disappearing into the makeshift Mosque, built from discarded pallets, cardboard, and blankets.  Prayers over, it was time for the long awaited meal. Gathering around the tables they had carried out of the little school room, they smiled and laughed as they ate, taking care to offer the choicest morsels to their guests. While sharing the long awaited feast, one could almost forget that we were in a refugee camp. Amidst the laughing, shouting, and eating, the reason that had brought us all to that place was forgotten. After the meal, an anticlimactic silence fell and we worked together for the clean up. When it was over, we made sweet tea and donuts.  As the light of day faded, so too did the celebratory atmosphere; the tables were returned to their places and the wind was already spreading litter across the sandy courtyard. We sat in silence around the fire in the oil barrel. I added extra sugar to a cup destined for the tallest of the Mohameds, a 20 year old who had been about to start at university before having to flee. “I miss my Mummy,” he said, as I passed the cup into his hands. This year, as I look forward to celebrating Eid here in Morocco, for the first time with my baby son, surrounded by our family and friends, I can’t help but think of all of those people around the world who are separated from their families; those who will not be able to hand a cup of tea to a loved one or share the joy of the celebrations with those closest to them.

Rabat – According to the Wall Street Journal, the US position on the Western Sahara conflict is clear.  The August 11 publication emphasizes that the US are firm in the belief that independence for the region will never work as a solution to the conflict. According to Moroccan and Western officials involved in negotiations, American officials have made it clear in private talks that the U.S. backs Morocco.  The US is also clear in its opposition to the creation of an independent state in Western Sahara, reports the newspaper. The author of the report argued that  that the Trump administration’s position could disappoint separatist activists  hoping to raise their flag in a declaration of independence. “Officials involved in the talks said the U.S. have made it clear that Washington won’t support a plan that leads to a new African nation,” the paper adds. The publication also recalls Morocco’s major concerns over  US National Security Adviser John Bolton’s view on Western Sahara. Bolton and Western Sahara “To the U.N., this tiny peacekeeping mission [MINURSO] is a success,” the paper writes, emphasizing that Bolton is “putting the weight of the White House behind  a contentious plan to resolve the Western Sahara conflict by turning the screws on the U.N. and trying to force the rival parties to cut a deal,” according to the WSJ. The American official  has made no secret of his desire to give a new impetus to end the political impasse that prevents the parties from reaching a mutually acceptable political solution. Viewed from Rabat, however, Bolton’s enthusiasm and personal involvement are regarded with apprehension in light of his past statements about and involvement in the conflict.    Bolton was part of the US State Department team that helped draft the 1991 UN settlement which contributed to ending the 16-year long conflict that pitted Morocco against the Polisario.  Bolton also worked with James Baker, former UN Secretary General Personal Envoy to Western Sahara between 197 and 2004. As such,  he participated in drafting the Baker Plan I, known as the Framework Agreement, in 2001 which Morocco accepted. Algeria and the Polisario opposed that agreement.  Bolton also played a prominent role in drafting the terms of the Baker Plan II in 2003, which Morocco opposed, because the deal included the option independence through a referendum of self-determination.  Morocco’s firm opposition led eventually to Baker’s resignation in 2004.  When Bolton was appointed US ambassador to the UN between 2005 and 2006, he failed to end conflict in line with his convictions. Ever since he left the government in 2006, Bolton has been vocal in blaming the failure of the UN-led process undertaken under Baker’s leadership on Morocco. He has also been vocal in criticizing the UN Security Council for not forcing Rabat to accept the deal. Bolton ranks among the rare  past and present US officials who support the holding of a referendum of self-determination to end the conflict. In light of Morocco’s opposition to the referendum, he called repeatedly for ending the  MINURSO’s mandate. In his 208 memoir Surrender Is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations, Bolton said: “MINURSO had failed in its central mission to conduct a referendum and was now actually an obstacle to Morocco and Algeria dealing with each other. Since it was clear that Morocco had no intention of ever allowing a referendum, there was no point in a UN mission to conduct one. Instead, and typically of the UN, MINURSO seemed well on the way to acquiring a near-perpetual existence because no one could figure out what to do with it.” Ever since he was appointed national security adviser to President Donald Trump, Bolton has tried to leave his imprimatur on the political process. In December 2018, Bolton dismissed the UN mission to Western Sahara, known as  MINURSO, for being ineffective and costly. Bolton expressed frustration that the Western Sahara conflict is yet to reach a satisfactory conclusion for either party. “Ladies and gentlemen, 27 years of deployment of this peacekeeping force, 27 years and it’s still there? How can you justify that? I have got to know over the years the Saharawi people, I have enormous respect for them, I have enormous respect for the government and people of Morocco and Algeria, is there not a way to resolve it?” Bolton said at a Washington, D.C., event. UN mission sustains stability In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita, argued that ending the UN mission in the region would have severe negative consequences for the region’s stability. Morocco has long warned that poverty and the dire conditions in the Tindouf camps, Algeria, could be a catalyst for the radicalisation of the region’s youth, pushing them into the arms of terrorist organizations.  “Is the danger to the U.S. from 230 people from MINURSO or…. the fact that the Islamic State and al Qaeda are able to attract people from Indonesia, from Casablanca and elsewhere?” Bourita said. The journal writes that  “Serious talks on Western Sahara amid the uncertainty appear unlikely and a U.S. plan to end the U.N. mission could create more turmoil,”the author of the WSJ report said.  “MINURSO is $52 million to keep stability, to keep a cease-fire in a region which is very difficult,” said Bourita. “No one has died since the cease-fire, which means this is the most cost-effective peacekeeping mission in the world.”He added, “No one has died since the cease-fire, which means this is the most cost-effective peacekeeping mission in the world,” he added.  In addition to the conflict, the publication also recalled Morocco’s commitment to the development of Moroccan southern provinces in Western Sahara, including Laayoune. “Morocco has spent millions transforming Laayoune, the former Spanish capital of Western Sahara, into a functioning desert town of about 200,000,” the paper writes. Political process under control  Despite the hopes the Polisario placed in Bolton to move the political process forward and to force Morocco to accept holding a referendum, and Algeria’s hiring of top lobbyists to sway the US administration, Morocco has so far succeeded in keeping the political process under control.  More still, the latest resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council in the past 12 months have been positive for Morocco, in that, for the first time since the start of the political process, Algeria is considered a party to the conflict in quasi equal footing with Morocco and the Polisario.  Both Resolution 2440 of October  2018 and Resolution 2468 adopted last April mention Algeria both in the preamble and the operatives paragraphs, which observers see as a significant change in the way the Security Council addresses the conflict. Morocco has long called for Algeria’s full involvement in the conflict and said on many occasions that Algeria is the party that arms the Polisario, supports its at the diplomatic, economic and military levels and without all that support the Polisario would not have lasted until now.

Rabat – The 2020 budget draft bill will give priority to supporting social policies and reducing social and spatial disparities, in addition to establishing social protection mechanisms, said Head of Government, Saad Dine El Otmani. Given that achieving these goals requires sustained and sustainable funding, the government is committed to promoting investment and supporting businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in order to boost economic growth, El Otmani pointed out in a guidance note on the 2020 budget draft bill. Priority will also be given to accelerating the implementation of reforms aimed at improving the mechanisms that will ensure a fair distribution of wealth (justice, advanced regionalization, tax reform), in addition to strengthening the effective management of public policies, he added. To this end, several measures will be taken, including the acceleration of the implementation of the education and training system reform, the gradual generalization of pre-school education, the strengthening of schooling social support as well as the role of education to help young people accessing the labor market, in addition to the implementation of the vocational training roadmap, which was presented to King Mohammed VI on April 4, 2019. El Otmani also stressed the importance of improving and generalizing health care services, guaranteeing citizens access to quality services and ensuring conditions that preserve their dignity. The note also highlights the need to speed up the implementation of the program aimed at reducing social and spatial disparities in the rural world, to accompany the 3rd stage of the Human Development National Initiative, to implement the commitments of the social dialogue agreement as well as to continue subsidizing commodities under the Compensation Fund. The text also focuses on the social protection system reform, including programs intended to support families, protect children and ensuring care for the elderly, in addition to the modernization and management of services provided to the Moroccan community living abroad and the implementation of the immigration and asylum national strategy.

Rabat – Nearly 32, 000 Moroccan pilgrims have performed Hajj (the muslim pilgrimage) rituals in 2019. A source from the Morocco official delegation, which flew to Mecca for pilgrimage, said that Moroccan pilgrims arrived in Mina, Saudi Arabia, in “favourable conditions and in all serenity,” according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). MAP added that Saudi Arabia mobilized tens of thousands members of Saudi security services to avoid stampedes. In 2015, a stampede caused the death of at least 2,000 pilgrims during the annual Hajj in Mina. International news outlets reported  that more than two million Muslims gathered at Mount Arafat  near Mecca to perform a major Hajj ritual on Saturday, August 10. Mount Arafat is the most significant stage of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. It is located on a plain about 20 kilometers southeast of Saudi Arabia’s Mecca. The holy site for Muslims is where the Prophet Mohammed performed his final farewell sermon on the mount more than 1,400 years ago. On the day, the prophet called on Muslims to pray to God for forgiveness and mercy. Rituals on Arafat end at sunset. Muslims performing the Hajj pilgrimage make their way at dawn on Arafat from Mina in Mecca to Mt Arafat. According to Islamic precepts, the pilgrimage  is not considered complete unless pilgrims ascend Mt Arafat. Like this year,  Nearly 2 million Muslim pilgrims from around the world converged at Mount Arafat l in 2018.

Rabat – Canada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, has released a video statement wishing Muslims in Canada and around the world a happy Eid al-Adha.  “As-salamu alaykum,” Trudeau said as he opened the video. “Today, Muslims in Canada and around the world will mark the end of the Hajj and celebrate Eid al-Adha.” “This holiday is a time for Muslims to come together to pray, share a meal and celebrate life’s blessings.” “It’s a chance to reflect on lessons of sacrifice, and values like service, compassion, and generosity,” he continued. “Muslim Canadians show us the best of those values all year round, whether it’s supporting a local charity or being there for neighbors in need.” “So today, let’s celebrate Canada’s Muslim communities, and the many contributions they make to shape our country for the better.” “Eid Mubarak, may peace and blessings be upon you,” he concluded. The message has been well received. “You are one of my favorite leaders of the current time! Eid Mubarak!!” said one comment. In June, Trudeau echoed asimilar message, wishing Muslims across the world a blessed Ramadan. He also used the annual message to pledge to fight against Islamophobia. “For many Muslims, these last few months have been difficult ones,” he said. “Communities have suffered hateful, Islamophobic acts of violence‒acts that have no place anywhere in our world.” He also expressed his commitment to stand up for the Muslim community: “We will always call out Islamophobia,” said Trudeau.

Rabat – The concepts of “Middle Power” and “Middle Power diplomacy,” developed by scholars out of international relations and diplomatic practice theories, help provide a conceptual framework for assessing Morocco’s contemporary diplomacy. From Traditional to Emerging Middle Powers The Middle Power concept has evolved significantly since the 20th century through constant diplomatic practice. Traditionally, Middle Powers comprised a narrow circle of established democracies that were industrialized and affluent, such as Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden. These countries shared the following features: support for liberal internationalism and multilateralism, adherence to good international citizenship, active provision of development assistance, and concentrated “niche diplomacy.” Over the past two decades, scholars have started referring to “new” or “emerging” Middle Powers, including countries like Brazil, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Qatar, and South Africa. These new Middle Powers share a commitment to multilateralism, but nevertheless hold distinct features. Oftentimes they are newly democratic states facing internal economic challenges, serving as intermediaries between developed and developing states through regional dominance in terms of hard power (through economic strength, military capabilities) and/or by projecting their diplomatic soft power, and holding leadership roles in regional institutions as representatives of the global South. Key Features of Middle Power Diplomacy Renowned scholar Gareth Evans focused on the concept of Middle Power diplomacy instead of Middle Powers. He did so in order to address the constantly evolving definition of Middle Powers. According to Evans, Middle Power diplomacy holds certain distinct features. The first is the ability to challenge the established position of stronger powers and negotiate balanced agreements through intensive bargaining and negotiation. The second is the focus on a niche diplomacy in line with their institutional capacities and credibility; instead of extending to the whole policy spectrum, their diplomacy concentrates on a specific field, sector, or country in which it operates. Third is the constant use of multilateralism to promote international policy tasks. This takes the form of reaching compromise positions to resolve disputes, forming coalitions with other states or through international organizations, and regional activism. Each of these features face certain limits, however. For one, Middle Power diplomacy will tend to focus on more than one niche, which unravels the niche concept’s relevancy. Promoting international policy tasks through multilateralism requires Middle Power diplomacy to hold sufficient weight and credibility in the international arena to encompass the discussion over an item on the international politics agenda, or for the Middle Power country to be entrusted with advocating on behalf of other countries. Finally, Middle Power diplomacy still requires the country to have certain elements of hard power such as a sizable economy, population, territory, and/or military, in order to ensure effectiveness over its diplomatic efforts. To what extent then does Morocco’s contemporary diplomacy fit within the conceptual framework of Middle Power diplomacy? Successfully Challenging a Stronger Power’s Position Through Persistent, Protracted Diplomatic Action In March 2016, Turkey and the EU entered into a historical agreement to regulate the inflow of migrants reaching the Greek coast through Turkey. Following three years of intensive negotiations, Turkey obtained significant gains. Similarly, over the past decade, Morocco has been facing a significant increase in migration from Sub-Saharan Africa and Syria. In light of shared concerns with the EU over addressing the migration crisis, Morocco found itself in a better position to negotiate for overall assistance from the EU. The new deal not only includes satisfactory financial arrangements, but also a set of comprehensive policy measures. In other words, Morocco managed to negotiate a benefical agreement in spite of the EU’s status as a stronger power. Likewise, Morocco was successful in increasing financial contribution from the EU for renewing the fishing and agricultural agreements between the two entities, as well as in applying preferential trade tariffs to products sourced from its Southern provinces. Moroccan diplomacy managed to successfully bargain with a stronger entity (the EU) by employing the tools of protracted negotiations, persistence, and issue linkage. Strengthening Morocco’s Multilateral Position Through Regional Organizations Moroccan diplomacy in recent years has increased the multilateral scope of its diplomatic action. Its growing visibility in international organizations is the result of an explicit policy to strengthen the country’s presence and influence within multilateral institutions through senior responsibility assignments. These influences have been exhibited in particular at the 72nd General Assembly of the United Nations, among others. Such action is significant in regional organizations following the return of Morocco to the African Union in January 2017 and the recent accession request to the Economic Community of West African States. Moroccan Diplomacy in West Africa: A Quest for Leadership When examining relations between Morocco and certain West African countries, namely Gabon, Guinea Conakry, Ivory Coast, Mali, Nigeria and Senegal, we understand how its quest for regional leadership translates into South-South economic cooperation, niche diplomacy, and the willingness to serve as an intermediary between greater and smaller powers. Morocco’s economic diplomacy has strengthened its involvement in the African continent over the past two decades, with three main trends underlying Morocco’s foreign direct investment: significant investment inflows by large Moroccan banks as well as commodities, construction, energy, and telecom companies into West African economies; a regional connectivity strategy to promote the Casablanca airport as a transport hub for travelers to West Africa; and the reinforcement of the partnership with Nigeria (another regional Middle Power) through religious diplomacy and a gas pipeline project. It is important to highlight that Morocco’s economic diplomacy goes beyond the achievement of an economic return or the recognition by all African states of Morocco’s sovereignty over its Southern provinces. Instead, it seeks to promote the development and stability of African citizens through mutually profitable cooperation and active solidarity. It pursues shared interests with its African counterparts. That is the only way to be perceived by other African countries as a regional leader rather than a hegemon. Another major feature of Moroccan contemporary diplomacy is using religious or faith-based diplomacy as a tool of niche diplomacy in Sub-Saharan Africa. Such religious diplomacy when used as a soft power targets shared objectives. It answers the needs of African states by training local religious scholars, prevents religious extremism by countering the influence of Wahhabism, and consolidates the preexisting moderate Malekite religious rite in Africa. Morocco’s diplomacy also offers its human capital and facilities to serve as an intermediary between West African countries and greater powers by advocating on their behalf on strategic issues such as migration. This effectively translated into hosting the Global Compact Initiative in Marrakech in December 2018, where the kingdom played a leading role as the rapporteur for the African agenda and then as conference chair. It also led to an agreement with the African Union to host in Rabat the new headquarter of the African Observatory for Migration and Development. A Subtle Balance The Middle Power concept is therefore relevant to analyze Morocco’s status in the context of international relations, and elements of Moroccan diplomacy fit well within the framework of Middle Power diplomacy. The country’s ability to strengthen leadership in the African continent whilst maintaining strong ties with Western allies will be key to consolidating its Middle Power status.

By Halima Ouamouch Rabat – This painful tragedy was covered by most of the Moroccan news outlets and attracted the attention of a large and angry public especially on social media.  It is noteworthy that Hiba was screaming and gripping the iron bars of her window while she was consumed by a merciless fire in front of a large crowd of helpless neighbors and passersby.    Hiba gained the sympathy and love of all Moroccans because nobody was able to save her.  Her mother was overpowered by the uncontrollable fires which stood between her and her own daughter.   On the street, the neighbors could only use their smart phones to capture the agony of Hiba and share it on social media.  Furthermore, the firefighters failed to be there on time. It is the firefighters who will be largely and unanimously criticized for their lack of engagement and sense of duty.   Since August 6, when this calamity exploded, Hiba has become a symbol of the weak citizen whose rights are usurped because of neglect and indifference.  Many social media users have condemned the carelessness of the firefighters as well as the callousness of the neighbors who lost their humanity when they raised heartlessly their smartphones in front of her. In the light of this sorrowful event, I have written the poem “My Name is Hiba and I am No More” which is an attempt to tell Hiba’s doleful story via the voice of Hiba herself.   My Name is Hiba and I am No More

I am playing in my room, 
Never expecting my doom.

While my toys are on the floor,
A giant fire is consuming my door.

As my walls are turning red,
I swiftly jump on my bed.

The flames are getting higher
And the room, hotter and hotter.

I miraculously leap to the Window;
I can finally breathe, it’s my willow.

My mom is screaming behind the fire,
Desperately trying to get me out of this mire.

Tremulously, I grip the Window’s iron bars
Over the flashes of countless passersby.

Sorry dad, I see you in the crowd,
Your face with tears has glowed,
But all wrapped in a shroud.
To you, I’ll always be bowed.

I wish I were a tiny bird to fly,
Into the open sky

Which I can only see
But will never reach even for a wee.

And my mom is grieving over me
While passive robots are filming me.

My back, my hair are smoldering,
The fire is mounting,
But my hands to life are still holding.

I am paralyzed and carbonized
While some of the crowds under my feet are galvanized.

Skinny slow firefighters are showering me,
But my mom is still grieving over me.

I am no more,
But I am sure,
I’ll be passed on, just like a lore.

Rabat – Dutch club Ajax Amsterdam has extended the contract of the Moroccan international football player Hakim Ziyech until 2022. Ziyech announced  the news in an Instagram post. “Last season we had unforgettable moments together. Moments like those are the reason why I want to play football,” wrote Ziyech. He added that the achievements of last season are part of the “reason why I want to improve my game and have more of those moments. The reason why I’m a proud [Ajax] player.” Ziyech had a contract with Ajax until the end of the 2020-21 season. The Moroccan playmaker received several offers from international football clubs, including Sevilla. There were also rumored offers from A-lister clubs like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Arsenal. The football player, however, rejected the offer, emphasizing that he is stick with Ajax to do his “very best on the field.” On the Sevilla offer, Ziyech said that the Spanish football club has the same level as Ajax. “I don’t switch Ajax for nothing,” Ziyech told Fox Sports. He added that he has not received the right offer yet. Several international football clubs  speculated that Ajax was in talks with German giant football club Bayern Munich. Ziyech is one of Morocco’s key players. He joined Ajax in 2017. In May, Ajax named Ziyech as its Player of the Year for his individual brilliance as well as his vital contributions to the collective flow  during Ajax’s success story in last year’s UEFA Champions League.

Rabat – On Saturday, August 10, women in Casablanca took to the streets to march in shorts as an expression of solidarity with the Belgian teens who have been in the headlines recently. The initiative, dubbed #YesWeShort, has been spurred on by many internet users in response to the harsh social scrutiny and public shaming a group of young Belgian volunteers recently faced for their choice to wear shorts as they helped build a road in Taroudant, in southern Morocco. The goal of the march was to “send a message to the obscurantists who want to impose extreme thoughts and destroy the image of our country,” said the organizers of the event.   #CKM_PANAFRICAN_FREEWEAR_INITIATIVEBRAVO LES FILLES BRAVO LES DAMES BRAVO LES FEMMES BRAVO  POUR TOUTES LES PARTICIPANTES ET BRAVO POUR TOUT LES PARTICIPANTS BRAVO À LA SÛRETÉ NATIONALE QUI A ASSURÉ UNE PRESTATION DE SÉCURITÉ DE PREMIER ORDRE BRAVO À TOUTES LES AUTORITÉS DE LA PRÉFECTURE DE CASABLANCA-ANFA BRAVO À MR LE GOUVERNEUR DE CASABLANCA-ANFA Rien à envier à Genève Washington New York ou Paris ou Tokyo ou Londres par la qualité de l’écosystème interactif de très très haute qualité avec la manifestation 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿✊✊🇩🇿🇩🇿🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦 Allah Alwatan Almalik 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇧🇪❤️❤️🇧🇪🙏👍🙏 Publiée par Khalid Chafaqui sur Samedi 10 août 2019 The event has received praise on social media, with users commending the women for doing something tangible to show solidarity with the Belgian teens. Excellente cette intifada de la jeunesse marocaine contre le diktat des obscurantistes qui veulent faire régresser la société #yesweshort Bravo pour leur courage, pour leur créativité et pour leur esprit d’initiative — Omar Dahbi (@OmarDahbi) August 10, 2019  The group of Belgian youth, from the organization Bouworde, came to Morocco to volunteer for the summer and was building a road in Taroudant. But the young volunteers unexpectedly found themselves in the center of media controversy this week. On Saturday, August 3, Moroccan news outlets shared videos and photos of the volunteers building a road in the remote village of Adar, east of Agadir. The girls were praised in the media for their initiative, but online comments soon took a turn for the worse. Some internet users were objecting to the teenage girls’ choice of attire. The girls were filmed wearing shorts and tank tops, while doing manual labor under the Moroccan sun, in the name of volunteering. One 26-year-old teacher from the north of Morocco posted on Facebook that “their heads should be cut off so that no one else dares to challenge the teachings of our religion.” He was arrested on Tuesday, August 6, by Moroccan police for inciting terrorism. As a result of the threats and the fear the controversy may have caused the students, Bouworde has offered the students the opportunity to return home early. Only 3 of the 37 volunteers accepted the offer to return home.

Rabat – An armed man opened fire at the Al Noor Islamic Center near Oslo, Norway, on Saturday, August 10.  The shooting  injured one person.  People in the mosque overpowered the gunman. The attacker, who has been described in reports as a “young white man,” was acting alone, according to the police. Police are investigating the shooting as a “possible terror act,” BBC reported on Sunday. Police also found a dead woman inside the house of the suspect. Al Jazeera reported that police were notified of the shooting at 2:00 p.m. local time. The police said that the victim sustained “minor injuries.” Prime Minister Erna Solberg condemned the attack, saying that “it should be safe to go to the mosque, church, or other worship places.” Irfan Mushtaq, the director of the mosque, told TV2 that “The man carried two shotgun-like weapons and a pistol. He broke through a glass door and fired shots.” According to a BBC report, the mosque has been putting “extra security measures” after the Christchurch terror attacks in March, when a man filmed himself shooting Muslim worshippers inside twe mosques in New Zealand, killing 51 in cold blood. . In 2017, 14% of Muslims experienced harassment, according to the 2017 European Islamophobia Report. The report said that “Islamophobia is severely impacting the lives of millions of European Muslims facing racism at university, in the workplace, the public sphere.” The report added: “ In addition to representing a threat to their physical life, this racism undermines their place in society and their sense of belonging in European nation states.”

Rabat – Morocco’s varied and beautiful landscape is reflected in the flavors of its cuisine. Throughout the year, we cook succulent meat dishes for celebrations, festivals, and family meals. Each region does this in a slightly different way. Before we look at the regional variations, let’s get to grips with the basics. The main ingredients for preparing “merqa” are meat and onions. Seasoned chefs make the dish rich and different through the addition of their personal choice of vegetables, fruits, and nuts to give it a distinctive taste and flavour. Personally, I like to boost the aromatic flavour with the sweet taste of caramelized apricots and aromatic spices. Prepared my way, the dish is traditionally served in ceremonies and special occasions, but can also be prepared for a lovely family meal. Different regions of Morocco and different families choose to accompany the meat and onion base with fruits such as prunes, quince, figs, and raisins. In the Atlas region of Morocco, especially the city of Midelt and its surrounding area, this dish is actually prepared with apples. The region is known for its ample production of apples and the sweet tasting, juicy fruit add a special something to the flavour of the meat. In autumn when the Moroccan date palms are ready, especially in the south east regions where the dates are abundantly available, we pick the dates and use these to complement the salty flavour of the lamb. International celebrity chefs such as Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay have published their take on this delicacy but I think it needs a Moroccan touch to make it really special.
Here’s my take on “merqa,” served with caramelized apricots and pineapple. Before we start, make sure you have a good pressure cooker! You will need:
1kg lamb or beef meat, cut into 3 sizable chunks (still on the bone)
3 white onions, finely chopped
3 cloves of garlic, minced
Small bouquet of cilantro sprigs
1 tablespoon of salted butter
½ cup of oil
1 teaspoon of salt
1teaspoon of ground turmeric
1teaspoon of ground ginger
¼ teaspoon of white pepper
1 tablespoon of granulated sugar
A pinch of saffron threads
2 tablespoons of ground, fried almonds For the most important part:
200 grams of dried apricots
200 grams of canned pineapple3 tablespoons of granulated sugar
2 cinnamon sticks
1 tablespoon of butter
Some fried almonds Now you’ve got all the ingredients ready:
In a bowl, mix salted butter, ginger, turmeric, white pepper, salt, saffron and garlic, then add meat and marinate well. In a pressure cooker put oil and marinated meat and cook over a medium heat for 2 minutes until the meat is brown. Add chopped onions, stir well and let cook for another 5 minutes. Add cilantro and 1 liter of boiling water. Cover the cooker tightly and cook for 45 minutes until the meat is tender. Uncover the pressure cooker and remove cilantro and 2 tablespoons of sauce. Add fried and ground almonds granulated sugar and let the sauce over low heat until the gravy is thick. Meanwhile: Put dried apricots in a pot, add a cup of water, the cinnamon sticks, and sugar. Simmer for 10 minutes then add 2 tablespoons of the meat sauce and cook for another 15 minutes until the apricots are tender and caramelized. When you’re ready to serve, place the meat and onions on a large plate, add some of the source and top off with the caramelized apricots, pineapple and some fried almonds.
Now sit down and enjoy the sweet-salty treat with some homemade bread and a table of soon-to-be satisfied guests.

Rabat – Israeli forces used tear gas to clear scores of Palestinians at the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, where worshippers had gathered for Eid Al Adha prayer on Sunday. They also fired rubber bullets to drive worshippers out of the holy site, as dozens of Jewish settlers came to mark what they call the holiday of Tisha B’Av. The Jewish holiday is traditionally marked by “an increase of Jewish visitors to the site,” according to Al Jazeera. As clashes erupted on the holy site, Palestinians  started chanting the famous slogan “ With our soul and blood we will redeem you, Aqsa.” Al Jazeera reporter Harry Fawcett said that the “gate was opened, but no non-Muslims were allowed in. There was this big standoff ad ten we saw the security forces move in to clear that standoff.” Police fired tear gas and sound grenades, injuring at least 14 people, according to reports. This is not the first time that Israeli forces have assaulted Palestinian worshippers in the Aqsa mosque compound. In June,  Israeli troops accessed the holy site with hundreds of Jewish settlers to mark what they call the “reunification of Jerusalem.” Al Aqsa mosque, built on top of the Temple mount, is the third holiest site in Islam.

Rabat – The drive from Casablanca to the remote valley of Ait Bouguemez, the starting point of the Mgoun summit trail, is long, 10 hours long, give or take time for lunch and a mint tea break. We leave the chaos of Casablanca’s traffic behind and head south-east towards the small regional capital of Beni Mellal on a shiny new, quiet freeway.  It’s mid-summer, hot and dry. We make a quick stop at a service station for a rooster, onion, and olive tajine, then we get back on the road. From Beni Mellal, we take a smaller sealed road south towards the little town of Azilal. The road then winds up into the High Atlas mountains, finally arriving at Ait Bouguemez. Ait Bouguemez, also called “the valley of happiness,” is green and lush. Ancient, giant walnut trees and thousands of apple trees grow in dense fields along the river-bed. The houses are almost all mud brick, forming a patchwork of square brown roofs near the river. Some, further away, hang off the base of the steep mountains like brown beehives.  When we arrive at dusk, we can see three or four other hiking groups, Moroccan and international, watching the sunset from the terraces of their guest houses. The sounds of crowing colourful roosters, braying donkeys, and laughing children carry from far through the still evening air. Ancient, giant walnut trees and thousands of apple trees grow in dense fields along the river-bed of the Ait Bouguemez valley.The mud brick houses form a patchwork of square brown roofs near the river. We booked our hike ahead of time through a Moroccan outdoor sports association, but you could just drive into Ait Bouguemez and organize accommodation and a hike from there. There are dozens of guest houses along the main road, each offering similar hiking packages. Our hiking package includes mules and porters. It’s a first for me and I can’t quite believe I won’t be carrying my own pack, or food, or water. Nor will I have to pitch my tent or cook dinner. By my standards this is “glamping!” We chose a four day circuit, but there are plenty of options for longer hikes, which would give more time to see and absorb all of the interesting things in the area.  There are dinosaur footprints, and ancient, mysterious, circular rock carvings that I would like to see, but I’m short on time so save these for my next visit. Our first day is a short three hour hike out of the valley, towards the base of the mountain range. The day is just long enough to stretch our legs and get into the groove of walking uphill. It is also long enough for both my shoes to fall apart. My hiking boots are 15 years old, close to the end of their life. I wasn’t expecting the soles to fall off on the first day of the Mgoun summit hike though. Lucky for me, our guide has come prepared with super sticky shoe glue. Crisis (or going home by mule) averted.   On day two things get a little more serious. Six hours of walking uphill, after 8.30am start. It’s steep, and hot, but beautiful. The mountain range behind us looks 2D, like a green and pink pastel drawing. I’m starting to wonder if I should have trained for this hike. Walking up four flights of stairs to the office everyday hardly counts. I’m quite happy to reach our second camp, the Mgoun summit base camp, in the early afternoon. Salad, sardines and bread taste more delicious than ever. And we also have a whole watermelon for dessert. Not something I would usually carry in my hiking backpack. One of the mules must be feeling lighter. At the base camp, there is a spring to refill water, and a mountain hut, with warm showers for a small fee. When the sun sets behind the mountains it starts to get cool, time for thermals and a down jacket, even in mid summer. It’s pitch black when we set off towards the Mgoun summit at 4.30am the next day.  It looks like we are the last group to get moving. I can see some head torches flickering away in the distance, already halfway up the first mountain range. When the sun finally rises after a few hours of hiking in the dark, we get a glimpse of Mgoun in the distance. The summit still seems very far away. This part of the hike is tough. I guess that’s to be expected when you climb a 4000 meter mountain. Mgoun is Morocco’s third highest peak, and while it isn’t a technically difficult hike, it is still hard work.  Like slow-motion ants, we make our way across a moon-like landscape. There is hardly any vegetation up this high, just never-ending sharp rocks, all different tones of grey and brown. It’s so windy on one of the mountain-faces that I can’t quite open my eyes properly, and have to admire the purple mountains below through half closed lids. Some hiking websites talk of epic winds and “flying rocks” at the summit. I can certainly believe this.  The view from the Mgoun summit up at 4071m is awe-inspiring to say the least. The rock formations are spectacular: folds of stone, slopes of loose rock fragments, and dramatic outcrops shape the landscape.  After the summit, it’s almost all downhill for the next day and a half. Down a scree slope, between sheer rock faces, following a ridge and through the valley down towards Ait Bouguemez. Gradually the vegetation comes back, small tufts of bright green grass on red clay earth, and lower down, we sit in the shade of a rare thurifera juniper tree. The numbers of trees is dwindling, as its branches and trunks make excellent firewood, in places where trees are otherwise sparse. The area around us feel remote, but when you look closely, you can see shepherd tents on the side of the mountain or down in the valley, and the occasional circular stone enclosures for keeping sheep and goats during the summer months.   Mgoun may be one of Morocco’s best kept secrets, but I hear from our guide that the area is becoming more and more popular. With good reason I think. The changing landscapes and dramatic rock formations of the Mgoun summit trail make it one of my top hikes of all time.

Rabat – “I’ll boil lavender with melha heya to clean the flat. You need to ward off the evil eye.” Said by Kiwi, our toothless femme de menage, looking fearfully over my shoulder at the small glass bottle, filled with a dead snail and strange herbs, that I had found on the doorstep that morning.  “It’s black magic. You should put garlic in the doorways,” interjected the elderly butcher’s wife, who had just stepped in to use the school toilets.  “What’s going on? Who put that there? Mohammed, did you see you put this here?” This was shouted by Nadia, (called the gorilla by her neighbours because of her aggressive nature and enormous stature) who had just dropped her adopted son at school, and was pleased to join the search for someone to blame.  Then the opposite neighbour leaned out of her second storey window to join the debate, “You don’t look well; it’s working already!” Throughout the protracted exchange I remained silent; partly because I had no idea why a bottle with a dead snail in it would cause such a reaction, and partly because it’s incredibly difficult to understand Darija at the best of times, but even harder when there are three women shouting at once.  This was a regular occurrence with my neighbours in the Casablanca district of Derb Sultan where I lived above my husband’s school until we recently moved to the more tranquil neighbourhood of Essaouira El Jadida. Deciding I needed to do something, I leaned over to pick up the bottle,  only to be violently restrained by Nadia (the gorilla). “Don’t touch it! It’s a curse,” she cried. This was my initiation into the strange world of black magic in the backstreets of Casablanca, a stone’s throw from what is known to locals as “the witches market,” where vendors sit in their stalls surrounded by hedgehog skins, strange herbs, and dead lizards. Coming from the UK, the concept of the evil eye and being cursed seemed a bit far fetched, however, the insistence of Kiwi and Nadia on the need to deal with the dead snail in a bottle swept me along. And now I came to think of it,  I did have a persistent headache… Preparing for her bi-weekly clean of our flat, Kiwi, said she had to go and pick up some supplies. I protested. We had plenty of cleaning products – but that was not what she had in mind. She returned from her errand, armed with lavender and a sort of rock salt, which I presume is melha heya. She proceeded to prepare the potion she said would cure my headache and after  that, enthusiastically scrubbed the floors and the walls with the lavender mixture, filling the flat with a clean fresh fragrance.  Kiwi explained that the lavender solution cleanses the space and wards off the evil eye, which would apparently make my headache go away. Her theory was that the snail jar curse was a manifestation of envy, and that I needed to be protected from the envious stares of our neighbours. When my husband came home at lunch time, he just laughed, telling me to throw away the dead snail, and that my headache was probably a reaction to the new gas water heater he had installed the day before.  Meanwhile Nadia, the gorilla, just released from prison for beating another woman over the head with a glass bottle, had other ideas. Convinced that I was the victim of a terrible curse, she banged on the door (not helping my headache) accompanied by a large woman with dyed black hair, wearing a leopard print dressing gown and carrying a capacious bag. The woman was apparently a ‘white witch’ and Nadia had brought her to perform an ‘Aldune’ purification – I still don’t know what this is exactly. I am told it is a form of spiritual purification using objects. The woman looked at the dead snail and informed me in broken French that I had been cursed by two individuals, one short and fat and one tall and thin.  At this point, my husband intervened, thanking Nadia for her concern but dismissing the need for her black-haired friend’s services. Offended, ‘the gorilla’ and her leopard- print-embalmed companion bustled away, leaving an opening for Mohamed, the little old man who lived across the road, to have his turn to speculate who had left the snail jar. He claimed he had seen an old woman he didn’t know lurking outside the building in the early morning, and launched into a long testimony which I didn’t understand.  The next morning, after an early night and a lot of water in case it was just dehydration, I still had a headache. When I went downstairs to open the door for the preschool students, I discovered a strange bundle of herbs and hair, which had been pushed under the door. Nadia, dropping off 4-year-old Yahyah, again told me not to touch it. She said, if my husband didn’t want the purification, I should at least protect myself by putting garlic in the doorways. It turned out she had come prepared and immediately began stuffing peeled garlic cloves into the corners of the front door frame. This, she insisted, would ward off the evil eye. Meanwhile, my husband had decided to move the gas canister out of the flat and suggested I visit his aunt for the day while he worked. When I arrived at her house, the aunt also remarked that I did not look well. I told her the story of the gas canister, the snail, the bundle of hair, and the headache and she too had a suggestion. Bustling off to look through the drawers of a sideboard, she came back with a small chunk of sandalwood. Burning this, she said, would make the headache go away.  So, having heated charcoal in a heatproof receptacle, she placed the tiny lump of wood on the glowing embers. Perfumed smoke began to drift into the air above us, sitting heavily near the ceiling. Then, to my surprise and confusion, she began to move the burning oud in circles around my hand, chanting quranic verses as she did so. Afterward, she explained to me that this, too, was a form of ‘Ruqyah acharaiya’, or spiritual purification using the power of God’s words.  That evening when I got home the gas canister had been removed to an appropriate location outside the flat. As I walked through the doorway with garlic in the corners, and into the lavender scented house, the opulent sandalwood odor still clinging to my clothes, I realized that my headache was gone.  While, rationally, all clues point to the removal of the gas canister, I’m afraid I can’t help but wonder…

By Abdellatif Labkadri Rabat – This article seeks to approach the topic under study from a linguistic vantage-point, namely that of linguistic determinism whose argument is as follows: The way a language is organized will determine how we perceive the world being used. That is, our language will give us a ready-made system of categorizing what we perceive; and as a consequence, we will be led to perceive the world around us only in those categories.  Proverbs exist in all human languages, for they, like other oral traditions, reflect people’s values, the way they think, and their attitudes towards their surroundings. Proverbs have high-frequency usage in many Arab and African countries as they are deemed to be vital devices through which wisdom is expressed.  According to the Oxford Word dictionary (1999), a proverb is “A short well-known sentence or phrase that gives advice or general truth about life.” This definition is developed, somehow, in the electronic Oxford Dictionary (2000) which defines a proverb as “A short pithy saying in common and recognized use; a concise sentence, often metaphorical or a literal in form, held to express some general truth. Similarly, Some English dictionaries give definitions to proverbs, for example: “Proverbs are the wisdom of the streets” and ” Proverbs are the children of experience.” Wolfgang  Mieder (1999) made an interesting survey, asking fifty-five ordinary people to write their own definition of the proverb on a piece of paper. The following definition is constructed on the basis of words that occur from four to twenty times in the collected definition: “A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional view in a metaphorical, fixed memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to  generation .” Though there is no definite agreement about the definition of the proverb, there is a general consensus about the elements that comprise a proverb, and the fact that proverbs exist in all languages. It is impossible to find a nation with no proverbs. “Who does not have problems, his wife creates them for him” and “Who follows women will achieve no success”. These two samples of proverbs are used frequently in the Moroccan vernacular (Darija). In fact, both of them denote the inferior status of the female gender due to women’s supposed tendency to create troubles and problems. Again, another saying that serves the same purpose is “Women are crooked and not straight”. The three statements, we have seen so far, epitomize the cultural bias against Moroccan women on the whole.  To add insult to injury, a further saying,  representing a religious belief, is; “Woman was responsible for man’s fall from paradise”. This belief is predominant in the mentality of men as well as of women. People maintain that it is a divine truth that is given by God in the Holy Quran. Yet, this view is downright untrue. Instead, it is a mere falsehood promoted by cultural bias.  The Quran nullifies this bias story in the following verse “then did Satan make them slip from the garden and get them out of the state (of felicity) in which they had been” (Bakara 35). Using the dual pronoun in the verse demonstrates that Adam and Eve are equally guilty and responsible for breaking the divine orders. Put differently, God portrays man and woman as equal without a distinction between one another. They are both responsible for their wrong and good deeds. Nevertheless, the laymen distort and misinterpret the sacred beliefs to fit their cultural needs, in which the male mentality is dominating and superior to that of women.              Among the proverbs which mirror the status of women as a sexual object in the Moroccan society is the following “a woman without children is like a tent without pegs”. To put this saying in its original context, it should be borne in mind that it is the kind of proverbs handed down from generation to generation, or precisely, from a mother to a daughter. It goes back to the pre-Islamic era when barren women were marginalized and disregarded for their sterility. This dark era was also shadowed by some evil deeds particularly in the Arab peninsula where girls were buried alive.  To top it all, the Jewish traditions and the Talmudic teachings recommend that believers keep away from the women who are not able to give birth to children. They consider them as inferior to their fertile peers. Coming back to the starting point, the proverb draws a simile on one hand between a woman and a tent; and on the other between children and pegs. Indeed, the term, tent, is not randomly chosen, but it symbolizes the ancient Arab home. It is also known that pegs are the supports by which the tent is maintained and kept still in stormy weather. Similarly, a sterile woman within a traditional family background can not be safe vis-à-vis a fertile one. This pushes me to conclude that the proverb under study clearly represents the role of women in the Moroccan society. Their function is just to produce children in the first place as chickens produce eggs. This, in fact, demonstrates the bias image of women in the eyes of a patriarchal society whose prioritized criteria are sexuality and fertility.     This section aims to expose a new facet of bias against the Moroccan women. Actually, the data collected, proverbs, question the reliability of women. In other words, some sayings recommend us not to trust women at all. A case in point is “women’s malice is mighty”. This statement is very common not only in the Moroccan society but also in all over the Arab world. The saying is utilized whenever the speaker wants to refer to women’s power to make evil. That is, a woman has the ability to harm and achieve whatever, whoever, whenever and wherever she wants. Tracing back this statement to look for its spring, I find out a Quranic verse, “…your malice is mighty” (Joseph, 29). Nonetheless, the laymen incorrectly interpret this verse without full grasp, not only it’s meaning but also to its context. To expound this matter further, we should consider the exact background of the verse. “ ..Your malice is mighty” are not God’s words, even though they exist in the Holy Book. Instead, it is a reported statement told by “Al Aziz”, the husband of “Zolikha”, the woman who attempted to seduce the prophet “Joseph”. Indeed, laypeople often do not differentiate between what is said by God Himself and what is reported by God about others. Thus, the use of this proverb which conveys religious proof r is a false pretext behind which the unfair cultural bias hides.  Unfortunately, this statement is still in use among Moroccans in as much as they are in need of it to transmit a negative message about women; and therefore, listeners or readers are invited to perceive that the further one comes close to women, the more unsafe he will be and vice versa.  In a nutshell, our language in general and proverbs, in particular, depict and shape our mindset, so we must be careful when we choose to express ourselves using words, simply because these words will be thoughts which will be beliefs which turn into acts.

Rabat – A leftwing Moroccan political party, the Party of Progress and Socialism (PPS), has issued a statement requesting a public apology for what it sees as the indignity and unfair criticism that a group of young Belgian volunteers recently faced from conservative circles in Morocco. News went viral earlier this week of a group of young girls from Belgium doing volunteer work paving a road in a village in the province of Taroudant, in southern Morocco. In a region deemed conservative, the girls’ attire sparked controversy. Footage that circulated online showed the young girls in shorts and t-shirts as they put cement on a street. Many conservative Moroccans felt offended by the girls’ choice of attire , saying it was inappropriate and offensive. In the girls’ defense, PPS says that the criticism the group faced was unfair and unworthy of Morocco’s democratic aspirations. According to the Moroccan party, the North African country has seen enough progress and political reforms in the past years for people to dress as they see fit. “In addition to harming our country’s reputation and the progress we have made in terms of individual freedoms, peaceful coexistence, and openness, these kinds of declarations constitute a deliberate incitation to extremism and the rejection of the other,” PPS’ statement said of the tide of criticism the girls encountered. For the leftist party, Morocco has chosen to project itself as an anchor of individual liberties and a safe place for diversity. While conservatives should be entitled to their way of life or life choices, the country’s recent reforms and aspirations to consolidate its democracy required them to respect others’ choices as well, according to PPS. The statement also pointed out that the type of judgment and public shaming the young Belgian volunteers experienced may discourage similar volunteering initiatives. The outsized condemnation of the girls’ attire and attitude is an indirect attack on the values and cultures of where they came from, PPS suggested. This, the statement went on to add, may sabotage Morocco’s thriving tourism industry as well as the country’s reputation for facilitating cultural exchanges and building social bridges. “The people who made those comments should take them back and publicly apologize,” PPS concluded. While PPS is perhaps the first major organized body to rise to the girls’ defense in an official statement amid tense controversy, the party’s points had already been raised by many Moroccans who have denounced the extremist rhetoric that some of the girls’ critics used. A member of Morocco’s ruling Islamist party faced backlash for appearing to use religious language to jibe at the girls and question the sincerity of their volunteering. But more telling was the reaction to the comments of a 26-year old school teacher who called for beheading the girls. Like PPS, many Moroccans warned that such extremist comments could harm Morocco’s reputation for openness, tolerance, and hospitality, and therefore scare off prospective European or Western travelers.

Rabat – Ahmed Benchemsi, Human Rights Watch’s Advocacy and Communication Director, has been arrested and taken into police custody in Algiers, according to Algerian outlet El Watan. According to the Algerian newspaper, police “intercepted” Benchemsi during yesterday’s protest in the streets of Algiers. He was subsequently taken to a police station somewhere in Algiers, where he is now being held in custody. Abdelghani Badi, Benchemsi’s attorney following the case, told El Watan that nothing clear has been said about the case. Badi highlighted the fuzzy circumstances surrounding the whole episode. “We do not know whether he will be released or detained for 48 more hours,” he said. As uncertainty surrounds the case, it appears for now that the Moroccan journalist was in Algiers for his own interest in witnessing firsthand, and perhaps reporting on, the ongoing Algerian revolution against the Bouteflika establishment. “It is true that Benchemsi was not in Algeria on an official mission,” El Watan noted. The founder of Moroccan papers Telquel and Nihsan, Benchemsi, who is also an American citizen, has been living in the US since 2010. He is affiliated with the Program on Arab Reform and Democracy at Stanford University. The Moroccan journalist has established himself over the years as a trenchant critic of MENA governments, as well as an incisive commentator on issues of human rights and democratic consolidation in the MENA region. His latest piece on Algeria, “An Algerian Spring,” explores the deep-seated frustration behind the ongoing popular uprisings, as well as the accusations of human rights violations that have been levelled at Algeria’s anti-riot police. Moroccan newspaper Le Desk has reported that Benchemsi went to Algeria from Morocco, “where he has been staying for the past few weeks.”
HRW has not yet reacted to the news of Benchemsi’s arrest.

By Barbara R Deraoui  Rabat – In my case, they had many names over the years. They have been both in my home country and overseas. In some ways, I think they help to define and shape our lives. Our streets may only be home to residences or maybe a mixture of shops, homes, and larger businesses. Some may be older, while others are new. There may be a lot of history tied to them. Some are tree-lined or have flowers or fruit trees while others are bare and pristine looking.  Streets are also defined by each country in which they exist. They even have their own personalities and style.  For example, some use a lot of signage while others have to be learned by memory or landmarks. Some are narrow or winding while others are wide and straight. My current street is well over 70 years old and hosts a nearby cafe with hotels and interesting shops. It is in the heart of Marrakech called  Gueliz.  It’s located by one of the main and busiest streets in the city called Mohammed V. It also serves as a connection between two larger streets. Because my street is centrally located many things needed for my daily life are within a short walking distance. This provides easy access for me to restaurants, shops, shopping centers, grocery stores; beauty salons and doctors to name a few.  I rarely have to venture very far to find what I need in the area, without having to drive. A convenience that can be rare in my home country where I usually drove. Besides the café/restaurant downstairs, our street has a hat shop that markets all around the country; several small shops that sell a little of everything; a pharmacy, and a shoe store.  One can find pretty much everything one needs of the basics without having to go to a larger store. Yet two large grocery stores: Carrefour and Marjane are less than ten minutes walking distance away. Several major national banks are also located nearby along with a well-known bakery. There’s even a place that sells prepared chicken meals right across the street.  Our street is decorated with many large trees that offer a bright green canopy shielding from the bright sun and heat. In season there are blooming jacaranda trees and orange trees. I am still pleasantly amazed when I walk up the street to see oranges hanging from the trees. Unlike my home country, on any given day from our balcony, I may see a horse-drawn carriage ride up the street or a vendor with a large mule pulled cart filled with fresh fruits or vegetables ready for purchase. Many of the restaurants and cafes nearby buy from them. The carriages are adorned with bright green and pink paint which helps them to stand out. In some ways, they remind me of the ones in New York City. On a clear day, I can see the Atlas Mountains off in the distance from the terrace. In the winter and spring, they are stunning with their snow-covered tops. From my vantage point, I can also survey much of the city for a distance with all its famous rose-colored buildings. Many a night after watering the terrace plants, I sit with my cat outside and watch the sun go down for the night. There is no question our streets serve as a host to our lives and witness our daily activities. They are a center point for us. Any day I can sit at a nearby cafe, sip my coffee and watch the world pass by.  Streets ground us to where we are and help to define our world no matter where we are.

Rabat – Morocco, represented by the Directorate General of National Security (DGSN), took part in the second International Transboundary Exercise ‘Neptune 2’. In July 2018, Morocco participated in ‘Neptune’, the first version of the exercise. The exercise was launched by the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) for the period of July 24 – August 8. ‘Neptune 2’ took place in several Mediterranean ports, including Tangier-Med, Tangier-Ville, and Bni-Anser (Nador). Interpol’s exercise included representatives of security services, law enforcement agencies, and border police from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Spain, France, and Italy. According to DGSN’s statement, experts from the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) and the World Customs Organization (WCO) also participated in the exercise. ‘Neptune 2’ aims to unify countries and participating organizations in their efforts to detect and fight the threat of terrorism by sea in the Mediterranean. The Exercise’s operations focused on strengthening cooperation in the field of exchange of information relating to the security of border posts, particularly between southern Europe and North Africa. “The operations also included reinforcing routine traveler control operations, careful verification of their travel documents in the area’s ports, control of travelers and goods transport vessels, and the use of Interpol’s databases in the area,” the statement added. According to DGSN, ‘Neptune 2’ control operations enabled the verification of travel and identity documents of 98,466 travelers on the shipping lines connecting southern Europe to northern Morocco. “A dozen Intercontinental transport vessels have been scrutinized, resulting in the seizure of passports which are the subject of a theft complaint or a notice of disappearance in unknown circumstances, both in Morocco and abroad,” added the DGSN. “This periodic exercise testifies to Morocco’s adherence to international and regional efforts to combat terrorist threats and cross-border crimes, and confirms the DGSN’s readiness to improve border control services as well as to cooperate with its counterparts in the Mediterranean region,” the statement concluded.

By Layla Dahamou Rabat – Internationally, Moroccan cuisine is known for tagines and couscous, as well as a variety of other savory treats, however, Moroccans have a notoriously sweet tooth. To accompany our delicious, refreshing mint tea we prepare a variety of sweet snacks, including Meskouta, or yogurt cake. While we do prepare elaborate and elegant cakes and desserts for special events, Meskouta is a staple in the Moroccan home. Every family prepares it in a slightly different way – some preferring to replace the yogurt with milk or even orange juice – today, I’ll let you into my family secret.  It’s a simple recipe, and all you’ll need for measurements is a cup of yogurt. My personal favorite, this is an easy cake to make and once you know the basics you can start adding your own touches.  4 eggs. 1 cup of yogurt, vanilla, or banana flavor. (110 grams). 1 ½ cup of sugar 1 cup of oil 3 cups flour16 grams baking powder (2 packets)  8 grams vanilla sugar (1 packet) or half teaspoon vanilla extract Preheat the oven, grease, and flour a tube pan or a round cake tin. In a large bowl beat the eggs with an electric mixer, add sugar, oil, vanilla, and yogurt and beat well until thick. Add flour and baking powder and beat with hand beater until the batter is smooth and thick. (you may add more flour). Pour the batter into the cake pan and bake the cake on very medium heat for 45 minutes or less. (don’t open the oven before half an hour). When the cake is ready, let it cool before removing it to a plate.  You can put some jam on the surface of the cake and sprinkle almond flakes or, as my family does, some ground coconut as a garnish. When the cake is cool, make a pot of thirst-quenching tea, sit back, and enjoy.

Rabat – Tunisia’s Liberal Party leader Mounir Baatour, an openly gay lawyer, announced on Thursday, August 8, that he will be running in the presidential elections, marking a first for the Arab world. Baatour’s bid for presidency marks “a first which will without a doubt be a benchmark in history,” his Liberal Party said. Baatour says he intends to pioneer LGBT rights in Tunisia, where practicing homosexuality is punished by law. The presidential candidate is also the co-founder of Shams, a group that campaigns against the criminalization of homosexuality. According to Shams, which tracks the number the arrests of LGBT people in Tunisia, convictions for same-sex relations rose by 60% last year to 127 from 79 in 2017. Shams also recorded more than 25 convictions in the first quarter of 2019. In 2013, Baatour was jailed for three months for “sodomy” with a 17-year-old student, an act he strongly denies committing with a minor. “I am openly gay,” Baatour told AFP. “I came out 20 years ago. I was jailed for three months for sodomy in 2013. There’s no shame for me. There’s no shame for any of us.” “The fact that I’m gay doesn’t change anything. It’s a candidacy like all the others.” “I have an economic, social, cultural, and educational program for everything that affects Tunisians in their daily lives,” he added. Baatour is one of 53 presidential candidates. The presidential election scheduled for September 15, will give Tunisia successor to Beji Caïd Essebsi, the late president who died on July 25, 2019. Although Baatour’s bid for the Tunisian presidency is acknowledged internationally as a step towards progressiveness, he has faced backlash from conservatives and Tunisia’s LGBT community alike. Last month, a petition against his potential candidacy was signed by numerous organizations for LGBT rights. “We think that Mr Baatour represents not only a threat but also a huge danger for our community,” the petition read. Tunisian Coalition for LGBT Rights also issued a statement last year distancing itself from Baatour. The presidential candidate attributes this to his support of normalization of ties to Israel, which the left in Tunisia is strongly against. However, Baatour continues to push himself forward as the face of LGBT rights. “I think we need to have a debate about homosexuality in Tunisia,” said Baatour, who identifies as Muslim but doesn’t practice. “I’m not talking about promoting homosexuality, just about decriminalizing it. Gay people don’t do anyone any harm. They should be free to do what they want with their bodies.” “If homosexuality is a sickness, then – even if I accept that – I have to ask, why are you putting sick people in jail?” he continued “When you put gay people in jail for three years, what, do they come out straight? No. So they must return to jail for a further three years and then for the rest of their lives.”

Rabat –  Algerian activists announced their decision to hold a peaceful sit-in at the Colonel Lotfi Border post on August 13. The gathering will serve as an opportunity for Algerian activists to urge both the Moroccan and Algerian governments to reopen the border between the countries. Mes Opinion published a statement from the  Algerian committee for the opening of the Algerian-Moroccan land border,  which called for a symbolic and peaceful gathering to allow people from both countries the right to freedom of movement. The statement said that people have long been patient “waiting for the opening of the land border.” The statement said that the decision seeks to end the suffering of the people, who have been facing this “abnormal situation” for too long. This is not the first time that a campaign has emerged asking both governments to reopen the border, which has been closed since 1994. Throughout the 2019 African Cup of Nations, Moroccan football fans have been celebrating Algeria’s wins during the competition. Algerians and Moroccans also celebrated the Algeria’s victory in the final of CAN at the border. Over the past two years, Morocco has taken positive steps towards reconciliation, asking for Algeria to engage in a frank and direct dialogue to end the stalemate between the two neighbors. Last year in November, King Mohammed VI made a dialogue offer to Algeria in order to revive bonds between the two countries. The King also  described the diplomatic ties between Morocco and Algeria as “not normal” and “much less than acceptable.” The King renewed his call in a speech on the eve of the Throne Day, saying that Morocco’s  will continue its commitment to the “policy of the outstretched hand towards our Algerian brothers, out of loyalty to the bonds of rooted in brotherhood, religion, language, and good-neighborliness that have always existed between the peoples of the two sister nations.” On August 3, Independent Arabia quoted a source who said that an “Algerian sovereign authority” is consulting with academies on the reopening of closed land border with Morocco. The authority    ordered a study to discuss the “most effective way to open land border.”

Rabat – A video posted on social media, on August 6, documented the moment a Fqih (Quran Teacher) beat one of his students (5-6 years old) inside the “M’sid” (traditional Quranic schools). Taoujni, a social activist from Agadir, explained that he tried to contact the child’s father, who apparently “agrees with the Fqih’s sadistic ways.”  In Morocco, a high number of parents and teachers believe that physical punishment is acceptable, even advised. People commenting on the video were divided between those who normalized the practice of violence against children and those who criminalized it. One comment said, “let’s be real, that stick wouldn’t even hurt; this new generation deserves more than that.”  “we’ve been hit with worse objects, and now I respect older people,” added the internet user. A second one described the scene as “normal” pointing out that “we’ve been disciplined this way; if these methods were still used, the new generation would have been much better, much more manly.” Another comment addressed the Fqih saying, “May God punish you! You savage animal; he is just a kid.” Supporting this view, another internet user threatened, “if that was my child, the teacher would have been dead already!” The death of Hiba (10 years old), on February 14, 2017, stirred nationwide controversy. Hiba’s parents accused her teacher of “slapping” her before “hitting her on the head with a stick,” for not learning that day’s lesson. Hiba was “punished” on January 17. Two days later, her parents noticed a swelling in her left eye, followed by headaches, then death. The regional delegate of the Ministry of National Education and Vocational Training in Meknes told Moroccan channel 2M that “the autopsy doctor said that the cause of death was an eye infection which the child was already suffering from and that the teacher’s blow couldn’t have been the cause.” The use of physical violence or insults against students has been banned in Morocco since 1999. In a note (n° 807/99 of September 23, 1999) Ismail El Alaoui, then Minister of National Education, had urged teachers to “avoid using any form of physical or psychological violence against pupils.” The Penal Code punishes beatings, injuries, violence, assaults committed against a child under the age of 15 with one to three years imprisonment (Article 408). If the assault results in death, even unintentionally, the penalty is 20 to 30 years imprisonment (Article 410).

Rabat – Bank Al-Maghrib, Morocco’s Central Bank, has announced measures to “ensure permanent availability” of cash at ATMs during the Eid week throughout Morocco. In a statement it recently shared on its official website, BAM urged Moroccan banks to take precautionary measures against possible “dysfunction” in the distribution of cash at ATMs. Eids (religious feasts) are generally period of high spending for Moroccans, often resulting in a cash drought at ATMs throughout the country. The cash shortage is even more pointed during Eid al-Adha, or the Festival of the Sacrifice, which always comes in summer and therefore coincides with holiday plans for Moroccans, with some summering in their hometowns or in holiday resorts in or outside Morocco. In addition, the financial component of the celebration, which includes buying an animal—mostly a sheep or a cow—and the social demand of traveling to be with family mean the Eid period comes with exceptional cash demands. BAM’s statement, dated August 8, revealed that the body has been taking preventive measures since mid-July to avoid the kind of cash shortage that the country experienced last year in the days before and after the celebration of Eid al-Adha. “In anticipation of the period of celebrations for the month of August,” stated the press release, “Bank Al-Maghrib has addressed a memo to banks… and asked them to take all the necessary measures to ensure permanent availability of cash at ATMs across the country.” The memo, which BAM says it sent on July 16, also urged banks to be vigilant in the implementation of the preventive measures “in order to avoid any potential dysfunction.” BAM’s statement also noted that the body organized in the past weeks a series of meetings with banks’ representatives to guarantee a full-fledged implementation of the measures discussed in its July mail. “For its part, Bank Al-Maghrib has taken all the necessary measures to ensure” it meets Moroccans’ cash demands during this year’s Eid period,” the statement reassured. This year, Eid al-Adha will begin in the evening of August 11 and end on Tuesday, August 13.

Rabat – Police and customs in Malaga blocked a refrigerated truck, suspecting the driver of smuggling hashish inside the Sardines coming from Morocco. The police and customs reduced the temperature of the refrigerated trailer to search the sardines cargo, El Pais reported Police were unable to find cannabis after search. However, when security services lowered the temperature on the 24,000 kilograms of sardines in the truck. The change in maintained temperature meant that the sardines became unfit for human consumption. The Import Health services at Algeciras port seized the sardines and disposed of them, having found that the cargo was no longer suitable for consumption. Read Also: Police in Nador Arrest Suspect Under National Search Warrant for Drug Trafficking Spanish company Procomar Alimentos is €18,500 in damages from the Spanish Ministry of Interior for a  “miscarriage of justice.” El Pais said that  customs and the Ministry of Justice in Spain refuse to pay the €18,500 damage claim “since it is a police action authorized by a judge.” The Spanish news outlet said that the authorities believe that the company is “obliged to bear the consequences of that decision, even if it was erratic.” A judge suspected that the drug trafficking network used sardines boxes to hide the hashish. Morocco and Spain have been intensifying their efforts to fight against both migration and drug trafficking.  Morocco’s customs and police have been thwarting drug trafficking attempts.  In July, Moroccan police in Tangier opened an investigation into the trafficking of 505 kilograms of cannabis resin aboard a commercial vehicle registered in Morocco. In August, in Tangier-Med port security services arrested a Moroccan driver for the attempted trafficking of 840 kilograms of Cannabis resin aboard a commercial vehicle registered in Morocco. Moroccan police in collaboration with customs services also seized 37.5 kilograms of cannabis resin in Ceuta.

Rabat – A US court sentenced top Hezbollah supporter Kassim Tajideen to five years in prison and ordered that he pay a fine of $50 million. Morocco’s security services arrested Tajideen in March 2017. The US Treasury listed Tajideen as “specially designated global terrorist” in 2009 for alleged financing of Hezbollah. The US has been targeting Hezbollah, as well as other terror groups deemed a threat to the region’s security. Tajideen’s arrest in Morocco flared tension with Iran, with whom Morocco cut ties in May 2018. Morocco accused Iranian ally Hezbollah of delivering military equipment to members of the Polisario Front in the Tindouf camps, Algeria. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said in May that tension between Morocco and Iran flared after Morocco arrested and extradited Tajideen to the US. Bourita also said that Iran “demanded that Morocco release him. We gave him to the United States and from that day there was a change.” In September 2018, the Moroccan official added that Tajideen was important to Iran because he was “linking” Iran and its proxy with sub-Saharan countries, especially “West Africa.” “This Mr.Tajideen who was captured in Morocco was laundering money in Africa. All the benefits to Iran from Hezbollah are being reinvested in Africa,” Bourita said in an interview with  US news outlet Breitbart News in September.

Rabat – Morocco’s Interior Ministry has released the first conclusions of the recent investigation into the death of a 7-year-old girl in a fire in Sidi Allal Bahraoui, a small town in the Khemisset Province in the Rabat-Kenitra-Sale region. On Sunday, August 4, shock spread through Morocco with the tragic news of a girl’s death in a blaze at her home in Sidi Allal Bahraoui . The 7-year-old girl, Hiba, lost her life in a fire caused by a low-quality telephone charger, according to reports. Testimonies from witnesses at the scene of the blaze sparked outrage among Moroccans. Chief among the reports was the fact that the rescue team came very late and fire fighters were under equipped once they reached the scene of the incident. Many lamented the “lack of professionalism” of Morocco’s emergency services, saying that the tragedy could have been prevented had the officers been on time and equipped. However, according to the preliminary findings of the “official investigation,” civil protection officers who came to the scene “duly discharged their mission” when they were called on to intervene. The report noted that testimonies from eye witnesses left out many important details. In the preliminary conclusions of the investigation, it is mentioned that the civil protection rescue team was first contacted by phone at 17:13, several minutes after the fire had started and was already spreading in the room. One striking revelation from the investigation is that, rather than the people who were on the scene of the event, it was an employee at a nearby café called for rescue. The man reportedly who called a friend of his who works as a firefighter. The firefighter then informed his colleagues about the incident and a rescue team was immediately sent to the scene, according to the investigation. A 6-member civil protection team was already present on the scene by 17:14, just a minute after receiving the information. That first rescue team came onboard a fire truck accompanied by an ambulance, the report noted. Another, more equipped and well-prepared intervention team arrived at 17:17. They immediately noticed the flames were “strong and violent,” and they started working to calm the flames and stop the fire from spreading to nearby buildings or apartments. By 17: 20, they had already “managed to bring the flames under control.” The report noted, however, that the strength of the flames and the inflammatory objects in the room were some of the factors that slowed the intervention, making it particularly difficult for the intervention to be successful in record time. But, the report added, the presence on the scene of “thugs” who interfered with fire fighters when they tried to increase water pressure slowed the intervention and impacted the outcome. The investigation is particularly adamant that the intervention team was fully equipped and acted as quickly as possible. One question, though, is why it was a nearby café employee, rather than the witnesses on the scene or family members of the deceased girl, who first contacted the firefighters, via his friend. According to investigation, the first witnesses called a wrong number when the fire broke out. They reportedly dialed 155 instead of 15 or 150. Contrary to eyewitness accounts from the scene, the investigation says that fire trucks were already loaded and rescue officers did not stop on their way to the incident in order to fill their vehicles.

Rabat – The National Office for Hydrocarbons and Mining (ONHYM) and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NPPC) shared aspects of the progress of the Morocco-Nigeria gas pipeline project with the Commission of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). NPPC hosted the meeting on Wednesday, August 7, in Abuja.   The meeting was an opportunity for Morocco and Nigeria to present their gas pipeline project and to examine methods of cooperation between ECOWAS, NPPC, and ONHYM. The cooperation seeks to discuss means to implement the project. Amina Benkhadra, director-general of ONHYM participated in the meeting along with experts from ECOWAS and NPPC representatives. The Director of Energy and Mining of ECOWAS welcomed the Moroccan-Nigerian gas pipeline initiative which will link the two countries and serve several others in West Africa. “ECOWAS is ready to work with Nigeria and Morocco for carrying off this structuring project.” ECOWAS believes that the pipeline is a unifying trans-regional project, which will contribute to achieving the objectives of the organization. The project, set to be 5,660 kilometers of pipeline aims to supply 15 countries in West Africa. Representatives of NPPC, ONHYM, and ECOWAS also heard a presentation on the main findings of the study on the gas project led by an international consulting firm. The meeting was concluded with the possibility of signing a Memorandum of Understanding between NPPC, ONHYM, and ECOWAS on the particulars of the cooperation. In addition to ECOWAS, Morocco also met with international experts to review the progress of the gas pipeline who expect it to be delivered in “record time.” ECOWAS’s satisfaction with the project could be a positive sign for Morocco in terms of the sub-regional body of West African States. The North African country is still waiting for a response regarding its bid to join the organization. Morocco’s ECOWAS bid is an extension of its strong belief in investing in intra-African exchanges and cooperative development projects. Morocco’s ECOWAS aspirations came in the immediate aftermath of Morocco’s African turn, when it officially returned to the African Union in January 2017. Morocco formally applied to join ECOWAS on February 24, 2017. In June 2017 in Liberia, the 15 leaders of ECOWAS agreed in principle to Morocco’s membership request, dubbing it “receivable” in the framework of the sub-regional body’s charter. According to Morocco, the bid to join ECOWAS “reflects the vision of his majesty, the King, to build a strong South-South partnership and to bring our efforts together to deal with economic and social challenges.’’

Rabat – The Japanese ambassador to Rabat, Takuji Hanatani, has reiterated his country’s support for the UN-led process to solve the Western Sahara question, saying that it is the most feasible option. Hanatani, whose comments came during a meeting yesterday, August 8, with Habib El Mali, the speaker of the Moroccan House of Representatives, said that Japan’s position on Western Sahara, which favors the UN initiative and Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, has “always been constant and unchanged.” As an important trade partner—Morocco is the second African destination of Japanese goods and investments— Ambassador Hanatani said Tokyo seeks to consolidate commercial and diplomatic ties with Rabat. This, he argued, means that his country “has never supported or recognized” the Polisario Front. The Japanese ambassador spoke at length about the promising prospects of bilateral cooperation with Morocco. He said that 68 companies are currently present in the Moroccan market and many more plan to invest in the North African country. In response, El Malki thanked the Japanese ambassador for his country’s steadfast support for the UN-led initiative in Western Sahara. He pointed out that Morocco is also a firm supporter of the UN-led negotiations to end the Western Sahara “artificial conflict.” Morocco, El Malki explained, has traditionally favored dialogue and negotiations over military hostilities. The remarks come against the background of a controversy in the Morocco-Japan relations after a Polisario delegation attended the Tokyo International Conference of Africa’s Development (TICAD) meeting in October of last year. The episode fueled speculation about Japan recognizing the Polisario-declared state in Western Sahara. But Tokyo has since relentlessly denied any formal links with the Polisario leadership. During a visit to Rabat in December of last year, Taro Kono, the Japanese Foreign Affairs Minister, said that his country “in no way… recognizes” the separatist front in Western Sahara. Meanwhile, such statements of support for Morocco’s Western Sahara stance may comfort the Polisario leadership in its conviction that the sympathy and support of the most influential voices in the international community have noticeably been swinging in Morocco’s favor. The separatist front’s leadership has recently declared being in preparations for an “inevitable war” with Morocco. One reason for the declaration of potential war , according to the group’s leaders, is the perception that Morocco is gathering significant support for its Western Sahara stance. Like Japan, many countries, including the US and France, as well as some traditionally pro-Polisario ones, have recently voiced support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. The broad consensus is that the Moroccan initiative, which is reflected in the UN plan for lasting settlement, is the surest and most feasible route towards a sustainable resolution of the decades-long conflict.

Rabat – Fourteen people, including ten Chinese tourists and four Moroccan nationals, sustained injuries after a 15-year-old minor drove a commercial vehicle without its owner’s permission in Fez. Preliminary investigations carried out by the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) showed that the 15-year-old did not have permission to use the vehicle. The owner of the commercial vehicle had given his keys to the minor so that he could bring bread in from the car. However, the 15-year-old took to the wheel.   The Chinese tourists were taking pictures in Bab Boujloud in Fez before the accident. Police opened a judicial investigation under the supervision of the prosecutor’s office. The minor and the owner of the vehicle will both be questioned as part of the investigation to determine the circumstances of the case. The legal minimum age for driving in Morocco is 18.

Rabat – A team of young Belgian volunteers who faced harsh scrutiny for their attire have been invited by the association Marock’Jeunes to enjoy a couscous as a sign of goodwill. The group of Belgian youth has come to Morocco to volunteer for the summer and was building a road in Taroudant, but have now moved on to Marrakech. Marock’Jeunes, wanting to improve the group’s impression of Morocco after the backlash, invited the group to not only enjoy a couscous but have a tour of the city today, Friday, August 9. The volunteers, from the organization Bouworde, have found themselves in the center of media controversy this week. On Saturday, August 3, Moroccan news outlets shared videos and photos of the volunteers building a road in the remote village of Adar, east of Agadir. The girls were praised in the media for their initiative, but online comments soon took a turn for the worse. Internet users were objecting to the teenage girls’ choice of attire, as they were filmed wearing shorts and tank tops, as they were doing manual labor under the Moroccan sun in the name of volunteering. One 26-year-old teacher from the north of Morocco posted on Facebook that “their heads should be cut off so that no one else dares to challenge the teachings of our religion.” He was arrested on Tuesday, August 6, by Moroccan police for inciting terrorism. As a result of the threats and the fear it may have caused the students, Bouworde has offered the students the opportunity to return home early. Only 3 of the 37 volunteers have accepted the offer to return home.

WAC to Appeal CAF’s Disciplinary Board Decision, Without FRMF Support WAC is believed to be acting alone to appeal the CAF’s disciplinary board decision, without the support of the Moroccan football governing body (FRMF). The governing body of Moroccan Club Wydad of Casablanca, headed by Said Naciri has decided to appeal the disciplinary ruling made by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) on Wednesday, August 7. The disciplinary board declared Esperance Sportive de Tunis the winner of the 2019 African Champions League Cup.  Wydad Casablanca has prepared an appeal file claiming the disciplinary board’s decision is invalid. The committee ruled that Wydad “withdrew” from the second leg of the African Champions League final. Wydad claims that they were forced to end the match due to the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) not working.  WAC argue that the disciplinary board is not the body competent to issue a ruling about the case, adding that this falls under the remit of CAF’s Organising Committee for Inter-Club Competitions and Management of Club Licensing Systems, reports Hesport.  In the appeal WAC officials question CAF’s decision to rule in favor of EST, saying that the ruling goes against FIFA rules.  Moroccan newspaper Al Massae reported on Friday, that FRMF has withdrawn its support for WAC’s case. There was no FRMF representative present during the CAF meeting, while WAC was represented by president Naciri and a small delegation. The CAF’s Disciplinary Board decided to rule in favor of the Tunisian club, Esperance de Tunis (EST), declaring WAC loser in the second leg of the Champions’ League final. The ruling, however, contradicts the initial decision to strip EST from the title, ordering the team to return the cup and the medals.

Rabat – A French court sentenced Italian-Moroccan Rajaei Moujahid, tried on charges of forming a gang with terrorist intentions and kidnapping children, to 8 years imprisonment. The prosecution had demanded six years in prison for the 37-year-old. In 2017, Moujahid went to Syria, where she stayed for nine months with her three children. According to RT Arabic, the Criminal Court held that the ruling was the “only appropriate punishment” for the woman’s conduct, and her “absolute denial of facts, to the point of denying the evidence of the file.” The woman traveled to Syria in March 2017 after the deadly armed terrorist attacks in France, accompanied by her 9-year-old daughter and her 7 and 5-year-old sons. The court pointed out that the woman, who was married at the time, joined a Syrian fighter of the “Ahrar al-Sham” movement, with whom she had maintained a long-distance relationship. She married the fighter upon her arrival in the province of Idleb in northwestern Syria.

Rabat – Deputy secretary-general of the Justice and Development Party (PJD) Soulaimane El Amrani has commented on his colleague’s statement against a group of Belgian volunteers. The Belgian group was spending the summer paving a road in a village in the province of Taroudant, southeastern Morocco. El Amrani said that his colleague Ali El Asri’s statement does not represent the party.  He argued that the party is only responsible for its official statements and positions from authorized officials. El Asri shared a post on his Facebook account, criticizing the tourists’ dress code, arguing that the Belgian girls were not appropriately dressed for building work. “Everybody knows how Europeans insist on preserving security measures in construction-related work sites, as a tourist is not allowed to access a worksite without wearing a suit, helmet, and gloves,” El Asri wrote. The parliamentarian explained that in the village near Taroudant, the residents would not be used to the choices of summer clothing as it is a conservative area. While Al Amrani said that El Asri’s views do not reflect those of the party, he said that the PJD respect “freedom of expression.” “Freedom of expression in the Justice and Development Party is preserved and respected to the extent of reverence,” he said. El Amrani added that  El Asri’s post does not carry any terrorist connotations. The girl’s attire quickly received criticism on social media. On Tuesday, August 5,  the National Judicial Police, in coordination with the Directorate General of Territorial Surveillance (DGST) arrested a primary school teacher from Ksar El Kebir for inciting terrorism in a comment. The teacher said that the girls should be beheaded for not respecting the dress code in the region. The controversy urged the Belgian organization Bouworde to cancel its volunteering projects in Morocco, based on the advice of the Belgian Embassy in Rabat. The organization has been working in Taroudant for more than 15 years..Bouworde sent groups of young volunteers to work on infrastructure projects in the area in collaboration with a local association.

Rabat – The draft law 15-97 on the right to strike, submitted to Parliament for approval, created tensions between work unions and the government. The draft law establishes the basic rules and principles of exercising the right to strike. The draft regulates who, when, and how workers can organize strikes within a new legal framework. Some unions have described the draft as “unilateral” as the government did not consult with them, in accordance with the Social Dialogue Agreement, before submitting the draft. The Social Dialogue Agreement, signed on April 25, stipulated the necessity of consultation between its three signatories, the government, work unions, and the General Confederation of Enterprises of Morocco (CGEM), on work-related issues. The agreement requires the three parties to consult each other regarding labor code issues. Consultations aim to create a balance between the needs of businesses, the fight against precarious employment, and the preservation of employees’ rights. Abdelkader Zayer, Secretary-General of the Democratic Confederation of Labor (CDT), told Assabah Newspaper on July 16 that “the government is seeking through the unilateral draft law to impose its decision and try to pass it through parliament, without the parties’ consensus.” Zayer also announced the start of a dialogue between unions in order to prepare an alternative draft based on ensuring the exercise of the right to strike. “If the government insists on passing the draft as it is, we’ll take on the streets, the best way to impose respect for the rights of workers,” he added. However, Ali Lotfi, president of the Democratic Union of Labor (ODT), speaking to Anadolu Agency, said: “we reject this draft because it handcuffs the unions and prevents them from exercising their constitutional and universal right to strike.” Lotfi also criticized the government’s referral of the draft to parliament “without opening a debate or consultation with the unions.” In its official statement, the Democratic Work Federation (FDT) called on all national trade unions to unite their position on the draft, and to stand against it through all legitimate means. FDT considered that “the draft contravenes the spirit of the 2011 Constitution.” “Instead of consolidating trade union freedoms and ratifying relevant international agreements, it makes the right to strike impossible and imposes fines and imprisonment penalties which would criminalize union membership,” said the FDT. Ahmed Bouhrou, former director of labor at the Ministry of Employment, told Assabah that “the strike cannot be regulated by law only.” “The current draft does not cover many professions such as miners and free services, which means that 40% are denied the right to strike,” he added. He also stressed that article 16 of the draft law “requiring the signature of three-quarters of workers before going on strike is exaggerated and is an indirect impediment to the freedom to strike.” Article 14 of the draft also considers workers participating in a strike temporarily suspended from work during that period. “They cannot be paid for the duration of the strike,” says the article. The draft further recognizes the obligation to establish a minimum service in some sectors such as health care and public utilities. The proposed draft also prohibits strikes in some vital sectors including national defense administration, Royal Gendarmerie, Royal Armed Forces, customs, prison administrations, and diplomatic and consulate employees.

Rabat – “WEAR YOUR SHORTS” reads the petition, which was launched yesterday on Facebook.  The petition, among other things, asks Moroccan politician Ali El Asri to step down because of comments he made on social media regarding a group of young Belgian volunteers. The volunteers from the organization Bouworde have caused a media controversy this week. On Saturday August 3, Moroccan news outlets shared videos and photos of the volunteers building a road in the remote village of Adar, east of Agadir. The girls were praised in the media for their initiative.  However, the girls’ attire, short shorts, was quick to receive criticism.  A 26 year old teacher from the north of Morocco posted on Facebook that “their heads should be cut off so that no one else dares to challenge the teachings of our religion.” He was arrested on Tuesday, August 6, by Moroccan police. A parliamentary member of the Justice and Development Party (PJD) Ali El Asri also criticized the group’s clothing, and suggested the group’s volunteer initiative had an ulterior motive. “Is it humanitarian or does it have other goals, bearing in mind the region is still well known for its conservatism and intolerance towards westernization and nudity?” he said on Facebook. The comments have angered many, and a group of four Moroccan political and cultural representatives have launched an online petition supporting the Belgian volunteers, condemning the teacher, and demanding the politician step down. “We assure these young girls of our support, our friendship, and our thanks,” the petition reads.  “[We] ask that the teacher be brought to justice for supporting terrorism, and that the deputy resign.”  “They are not Morocco!!!!” it emphasizes. “We can’t leave these types of comments without a response.” The writer Narjis Rerhaye, alongside the founder of the association “Marocains Pluriels” promoting diversity and tolerance, Ahmed Ghayet, political leader Ouafa Hajji, and the president of the Moroccan Association for Journalism Najib Senhadji launched the petition.

Rabat – The youngest boxing heavyweight champion ever, Mike Tyson has made a shocking revelation about the way he used to escape anti-doping checks. In an interview with ESPN on August 8, the American boxer admitted to having used to submit his wife or children’s urine in order to avoid positive results in anti-doping tests. “I used to use my wife’s urine and she would say when the results are known, they’ll tell you you’re pregnant. So I thought it would be better to use my children’s urine,” said Mike Tyson. .@MikeTyson le cuenta a @herculezg como pasaba las pruebas de antidoping pic.twitter.com/m2e17UyfuI — Ahora o Nunca ESPN (@ahoraonuncaespn) August 8, 2019 Tyson revealed the truth when the show presenter recalled the case of DJ Cooper, an American basketballer who was suspended for 2 years after using his girlfriend’s urine sample during a performance-enhancing drugs (PED) test and the result came out positive for Pregnancy.

Rabat – The Minister of Health, Anas Doukkali, issued urgent orders for an investigative committee to be formed after a man falsely posing as a doctor in a psychiatric ward in M’hamid in Marrakech was uncovered, according to a statement on Wednesday, August 7. The committee, which consists of the regional health inspector, the regional director of health, and representatives of the Regional Council of the Marrakech-Safi Medical Association, will ensure all necessary measures are taken against the suspect, the statement adds. The unnamed suspect allegedly opened the psychiatric ward himself and was practicing medicine without having any kind of medical degrees or licenses required by law. Since the man was impersonating a doctor, which is strictly forbidden by law, and was, therefore, posing a direct danger to the health of citizens, the competent authorities responsible were immediately alerted by the committee, explains the statement. As a result, the man was arrested by the prefectural police department of Marrakech, under the supervision of the relevant prosecutor. The prosecutor will now take all legal measures against the suspect in order to preserve the health of citizens and take a strong stand against this kind of offense, concludes the statement.

Rabat – In its latest reports on overall water stress, the World Resources Institute (WRS) has ranked Morocco among the countries threatened to face high baseline water stress. Morocco appears 22nd in the overall ranking and 12th in Arab countries. The WRS attributed water scarcity to climate-change, socio-economic development, urbanization, and population growth. The report found that 12 out of the 17 most water-stressed countries are in the MENA region – home to one-quarter of the world’s population. “The region is hot and dry, so water supply is low to begin with, but growing demands have pushed countries further into extreme stress,” the report said. The 17 countries use more than 80% of the available supply on average every year. In a report carried by the World Bank, it is found that water-scarcity will inevitably affect economies in the MENA region and is expected to cause a loss in GDP of 6-14% by 2050. The WRS has stated that there are countless solutions to tackle water shortage but only stated the most 3 effective ways.  The solutions include: Investing in grey and green infrastructure by building pipes and treatment plants, as well as wetlands, and healthy watersheds.  Increase agricultural efficiency by improving irrigation techniques (using precision watering rather than flooding fields) and using seeds that require less water, in addition to reducing food loss and waste, which use one-quarter of all agricultural water. The Washington DC-based organization suggested advance treating, reusing, and recycling as a third solution to create a “new” water source. With 100% of its water treated and 78% of it is reused, Oman – ranked 16th in the list – has emerged as a leader in water treatment and reuse.  Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC) treat around 84% of wastewater collected, but only 44% are reused. The world’s largest wastewater treatment plant is found in Washington DC. On a daily average, the Blue Plains plant treats close to 300 million gallons of wastewater and has the ability to treat over 1 billion gallons a day at peak flow, according to the plant’s website. Water shortage is not the only alarming environmental issue to hit headlines. A study carried out by the Global Footprint Network shows that humanity has depleted, in just 7 months, all of its share of natural resources such as water, soil, and clean air for the year. This means that the earth’s population is currently consuming the resources of future generations. The Earth Overshoot Day fell this year on July 29, which is the earliest date ever, according to a report from the Global Footprint Network. The Overshoot Day marks the date when humanity’s level of consumption exceeds the number of natural resources the earth can regenerate.  Below is the national water stress rankings:

Rabat – Bouworde has been working in the Taroudant region of Morocco for more than 15 years, sending groups of young volunteers from Belgium to work on infrastructure projects like water canals, schools, and a women’s center in the area. However, following significant media attention in Morocco this week, the organization has chosen to cancel its upcoming volunteering projects. On Saturday, Moroccan media shared videos and photos of a group of young Belgian volunteers from Bouworde building a road in the remote village of Adar, east of Agadir. The initiative earned praise for the girls from people across Morocco. However, the girls’ attire, short shorts, also attracted strong criticism.  “[…] Their heads should be cut off so that no one else dares to challenge the teachings of our religion,” a 26 year old teacher from northern Morocco wrote about the girls in a Facebook group of more than 500,000 teachers. The National Judicial Police, in coordination with the Directorate General of Territorial Surveillance (DGST), responded to the comment quickly, arresting the teacher on Tuesday, August 6, for inciting terrorism.  Morocco takes terrorist threats seriously, particularly following the murder and beheading of two Scandinavian tourists in the Atlas mountains late last year. A parliamentary member of the Justice and Development Party (PJD) Ali El Asri also criticized the group. “Since when do Europeans do construction work in swimwear?” He also suggested the group’s volunteer initiative had an ulterior motive. “Is it humanitarian or does it have other goals, bearing in mind the region is still well known for its conservatism and intolerance towards westernisation and nudity?” he said. The president of Tiwizi, an association from the Taroudant region that works in partnership with Bouworde, responded to the comments, expressing his support for Bouworde and emphasizing the positive relationship between the volunteers and the people of Adar. In response to the threat of beheading, Hassan Ait Addi, the association’s president said: “That extremist does not know anything about the region, nor about the suffering of the population,” reported Moroccan news channel Goude. Ait Addi also commented on the controversial Facebook post by PJD member El Asri. “I want to tell him that you do not understand anything and you don’t deserve a place in the parliament,” Ait Addi said. Advice from the Belgian Embassy in Rabat Bouworde sought advice from the Belgian Embassy in Rabat. According to the organization’s press release yesterday, the embassy assured the organization that the safety of the volunteers who are currently in Morocco was guaranteed by the government, and by the presence of the Moroccan police. However, according to the press release, the embassy advised the organization not to allow a new group of volunteers to go to Morocco “under the current circumstances and given the large “publicity” of the case through the press and social media.” “We will of course follow that advice. This is why Bouworde decided to cancel all subsequent camps in Morocco,” the organization adds. When contacted by Morocco World News, the Belgian embassy did not provide further comment in relation to whether they had provided advice to the organization, and the nature of any advice, if provided. The embassy directed all queries to the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Brussels. The Ministry’s deputy spokesperson in Brussels, Nadia Benini recognized that the matter had drawn significant controversy, but told Morocco World News that the Ministry “did not have any specific advice on this matter.”  “We do refer back to our online travel warning page, which does say there is a real risk of terrorism against individuals” she told Morocco World News “But it is up to the organization to see how they will address this matter. We imagine they may have chosen to leave following all of the media attention,” she explained. Morocco has not issued any official comment. Bouworde has given the volunteers the opportunity to return to Belgium early. Three out of the 37 volunteers have so far opted to go home.

Rabat – The High Commission of Planning’s report on the job market shows alarming statistics on job creation in Morocco. The report published on Wednesday, August 7, shows that Morocco’s national economy created 7,000 job opportunities in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the much higher 117,000 in the same period in 2018. HCP said that the job market was marked by a “further decline” in employment rates in the second quarter of 2019. The number of people of employable age grew faster than the number of people who are employed, the report found. “The working-age population (15 years and older) increased, compared to the second quarter of 2018 at a greater rate (1.6%) than the labor force (-0.6%),” HCP wrote. The report said that the participation rate in the job market dropped from 47% to 46% between the second quarter of 2019 and that of 2018. HCP said that the employment rate fell at the national level from 42.8% to 42.1%. The employment rate dropped from 55% to 53.5% in rural areas, while it stagnated at 35.9% in urban areas. The HCP said that in the “forest and fisheries agriculture” sector has lost 176,000 jobs, 170,000 in rural areas and 6,000 in urban areas between the second quarter of 2018 and the same period of 2019. This is compared to an average annual creation of 38,000 jobs over the last two years and a loss of 175,000 in 2016. “The construction sector has lost 27,000 jobs at the national level, 15,000 in urban areas and 12,000 in rural areas, compared with an average annual creation of 22,000 jobs in the last three years,” added the report. In July, HCP said that one of the main reasons why Morocco is struggling to curb employment is the gap between employment prospects and the number of graduates from Moroccan universities and vocational schools. Between 2011 and 2017, the number of jobs created fluctuated between over 75,000 and approximately 100,000 (97,000 in most years), HCP said.  Unemployment decrease Despite the lack of job creations, HCP shows positive statistics on the unemployment rate during the second quarter of 2019. HCP finds that the unemployment rate stood at 8.5% in the second quarter of 209, compared with 9.1% a year earlier. “The number of unemployed people has declined from 1,103,000 to 1,026,000, following a drop of 77,000 in unemployed people,” the HCP said.  The unemployment rate in urban areas declined from 13.7% to 12.4%. The rate of unemployment, however, rose in rural areas by 3.3% (+3%). HCP’s report shows that the largest decrease in unemployment was “observed among graduate students, adults aged between 25 and 34, and young people aged between 15 and 24. The government has long promised to lower the unemployment rate through its active sectors, including the industrial sectors. The Ministry of Trade and Industry said in April that  “The strong positioning of the industrial sector as a lever for job creation and the professional integration of young people is now strongly supported by the deployment of vocational training, driven by King Mohammed VI.”

Rabat – A zebra, nine addax, eight Barbary sheep, eight servals, eight Dorcas gazelles, eight Bald ibis, and a Dama gazelle were born, amongst other animals, said the Rabat Zoo in a press release. Some of these animals are critically endangered. The Dama gazelle, the largest of all gazelles, is also one of the rarest. Once common in Chad and the Darfur and Kordofar provinces of Sudan, fewer than 400 of these gazelles remain in the wild. The Bald ibis is a migratory bird found in semi-arid habitats. The bird can be spotted in the Souss-Massa and Tamri regions in southern Morocco. Thanks to record breeding results there, the birds status was downgraded in 2018 from critically endangered status to endangered on the IUCN Red List. Five Scimitar oryx were also born at the Rabat Zoo this year. Also known as the Saharan oryx, the species was once widespread across North Africa but became extinct in the wild in 2000. The births of the animals this year are the result of a strategy by the Rabat Zoo to ensure the reproduction of its species, in accordance with international standards of conservation. The zoo has a conservation program in place, targeting especially the endemic species of Morocco including the saharan antelopes and Bald ibis, in an aim to rebuild population numbers and to reintroduce them into their wild habitats.  The Rabat Zoo has over 150 different breeds of animals.

Rabat – Spanish police arrested a 39-year-old Moroccan woman on August 2 for abandoning her children in Melilla. The woman had entered Melilla a few days earlier accompanied by her two children, a 6-year-old girl and a 10-year-old boy. She then abandoned them near the local police headquarters to be taken under the city’s care. The mother was arrested after visiting her children in the social center where they were kept. The center’s tutors noticed her presence and notified agents of the Group of Minors of the Local Police (GRUMEN). When questioned by the police, she explained that she did not have the financial means to support her family. A police spokesman told El Pais, “they are fathers or mothers of Moroccan children who go to Melilla with their family legally; the parents leave and the city is obliged to welcome these homeless children.” “These are cases in which parents, because they have no financial means or because they are in a precarious situation in Morocco, voluntarily decide to bring their children to Melilla,” he added. According to the Spanish daily, such cases have become commonplace. Since January, at least 108 children have entered Melilla accompanied by their parents or guardians from Morocco, according to local police quoted by El Pais. Of the 108 children, 97 come from neighboring cities such as Beni Ensar or Farhana, in the Moroccan province of Nador, whose neighbors can cross the border without a visa, says El Pais. According to data from the Spanish government, unaccompanied Moroccan minors represent 70% of the more than 7,000 minors in the care of Spain’s regional governments. El Pais reports that Melilla currently hosts 861 unaccompanied foreign minors, ranking third behind Catalonia and Andalusia. In March 2013 Spain and Morocco signed an agreement to address illegal migration between the two countries. The Spanish Deputy Minister of Children and Families, Abderrahim Mohamed Hammu, told El Pais, “Spain should pressure Morocco to enforce the signed  agreement on child repatriation.” El Pais reported that the “Spanish Government tried, unsuccessfully so far, to reimplement the agreement signed with Morocco and ratified in 2014.”  The agreement allows repatriation of Moroccan minors as long as it is possible to locate the family and ensure the good conditions of the environment to which the child is returned.

Rabat – President of Italy’s Research Institute of Economics and International Politics (IREPI) Domenico Letizia has strongly condemned the “crimes against humanity” perpetrated by the Polisario Front leader, Ibrahim Ghali, and other separatists. IREPI has issued a statement to condemn the Polisario“summer camps,” held every year for the children. Letizia warned that Polisario’s summer camps initiative is just “political propaganda,” which contrasts with “moral principle and violates the conventions on the protection of children’s rights.” IREPI added that children in the camps are “often kidnapped from their families to be trained and enrolled in militia ranks.” In the statement, Letizia  asked whether democratic institutions in Italy are “aware of the accusations of crimes against humanity by the secretary-general of the Polisario, Ibrahim Ghali.” Several international news outlets reported in 2016 that Ghali is on the most wanted list in Spain. He is subject to a warrant for accusations including torture, genocide, and kidnap. Letizia also warned that more than 28 members of the Polisario Front are subject to an arrest warrant from Spain for human rights violations and homicide.  The Italian researcher recalled the case of Rossella Urru, who was kidnapped along with two other Spanish aid workers at a refugee camp in Rabouni, Algeria in 2011 by Polisario members. “The situation of degradation in camp has been denounced by many NGOs such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, France Liberté, US committee for refugees and immigrants, and by the European Parliament,” Letizia said. Radicalization and Extremism IREPI also warned that there is a high level of radicalization in the camps, especially among youths. The think tank added that the issue “could represent a serious international security problem.” In February, Italian media outlet Analisi Difesa published a 13-pages analysis by Anna Rita Palamario, claiming that the Tindouf camps serve as the main source of recruitment for several terror organizations. The report added that the Tindouf camps in southwest Algeria suffer “serious social conditions.” In the camps thousands of Sahrawis live in alleged unbearable living conditions, furthering “the spread of terrorism in the Sahel-Saharan region.” Moroccan security services have long warned against the serious situation in Tindouf camps.  Head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) Abdelhak El Khiame, said that the Polisario Front should also be considered a terror group in the Sahel region. The BCIJ managed to identify more than a hundred Polisario Front members who are operating in Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and “they have been involved in attacks in northern Mauritania.” Letizia concludes her statement, saying:  “We are convinced that these initiatives – are an attempt to hide the prevailing suffering in these camps, where we have had the opportunity, even from recent meetings, to learn about the violations of the fundamental rights.”

Rabat – President of the Tiwizi Association Hassan Ait Addi stated that the Belgian volunteers building a road near Taroudant are part of an association named Bouworde. Tiwizi has been collaborating with the NGO since 2004. Ait Addi expressed his surprise that Board’s initiative, which has been operating for 14 years, is receiving so much online attention. “I was amazed by the mass engagement on Facebook, although the work done by Board association has been ongoing for 14 years and included many activities. They were eating with us and attending weddings and traditions,” Ait Addi told Moroccan news outlet Goud, Ait Addi added that the two associations have regularly collaborated on construction work, infrastructure projects, as well as cultural centers and activities. “We first started by building a cultural center. Then we went to the infrastructure and paving. This is where the picture came from,” the 45-year-old man explained. The Tiwizi president explained that two or three groups consisting of 10 to 17 volunteers of different nationalities come each year to the region. He pointed out that volunteers include students, researchers, professors, and babysitters. The philanthropist also explained in detail how the volunteer project works in terms of accommodation and transport. “They paid for their own food and we help them in their activities they want to do in the region. In parallel, whenever there is a wedding, they are invited and wear traditional Amazigh clothes,” said Ait Addi.  “When they celebrate, we celebrate with them in the form of coexistence and tolerance.” Tiwizi president commented on the primary school teacher from Ksar El Kebir who made an extremist comment on a Facebook post related to the Belgian girls’ initiative. “That extremist does not know anything about the region, nor about the suffering of the population,” said the association president.  Ait Addi also commented on the controversial Facebook post by PJD MP Ali El Asri. “I want to tell him that you do not understand anything and you don’t deserve a place in the parliament.” The Tiwizi president argued that El Asri’s thoughts are a blow to the region’s tourism and could destroy the region’s economy. Ait Addi added that the government should investigate the incident.  The group of Belgian tourists left the country yesterday, Tuesday, August 6, having come to the end of their scheduled visit.

Rabat –  The Disciplinary Board of the Confederation of African Football (CAF)  has decided that Wydad of Casablanca (WAC) is “considered to have lost the game” in the second leg of the Champions’ League final. The ruling is therefore in favor of the Tunisian football club, Esperance Tunis. The decision comes months after the May 31 match when the controversy over the video assistant referee (VAR), which was not functioning during the game, ended the match in confusion. In addition to the surprising decision against WAC, the disciplinary board also imposed a fine of $50,000 against the Moroccan football club for “abandoning” the match. The board also imposed a fine of 15,000 for the use of “flares by the supporters.” WAC players refused to finish the game, demanding that VAR be used. To their utter dismay, the referee kept refusing to check the video technology only to be told more than 20 minutes later that the VAR was not functioning. Referee Bakary Gassama disallowed Walid Karti’s header for an alleged infringement. After almost 30 minutes of discussions, the referee declared Esperance the winner of the African Champion League. However,  on June 5, CAF decided that WAC and Esperance Tunis would play a rematch for the title. The complex dossier urged Wydad Casablanca’s President Said Naciri to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sports. The court, however,  rejected Wydad’s request  to be named winner of the tournament, tasking CAF with the decision The court also declared the CAF executive committee as not competent to rule for a rematch.

Rabat – A 5-year-old satirical weather report is going viral on social media for how depressingly accurate it is, and 31 years earlier than expected. The fictitious weather report was created in 2014 by French weather reporter Evelyne Dhéliat in partnership with the World Meteorological Organization. It was intended to give a glimpse into how climate change would affect temperatures in 2050. However, as record-breaking heatwaves sweep Europe, the prophesizing report has come to fruition much sooner than expected. A side by side of the fictitious weather report, supposed to be from August 2050, with a report from June 2019, has people speechless.  The present-day heatwave has smashed temperature records across 5 European countries, with Belgium and the Netherlands hitting temperatures over 40 degrees for the first time on record. The UK also hit a new high at 38.7°C. Both France and Germany also set new records at 42.6 degrees. The effects of the heatwave on the environment can already be seen. As the wave reaches Greenland, the melting of the island’s ice sheet is accelerating and causing massive ice loss in the Arctic. Scientists estimate that 12 billion tons of ice melted in Greenland in just 24 hours alone. The melting is set to become the largest ice melt of its kind, with 248 billion tons of ice already lost. For perspective, 1 billion tons of ice loss is equivalent to about 400,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools, according to the Danish Meteorological Institute.

Rabat – A parliamentary member of the Justice and Development Party (PJD) Ali El Asri has lashed out at a group of Belgian tourists who are spending the summer paving a road in a village in the province of Taroudant, southeastern Morocco. In a post on his Facebook account, El Asri seemed to be worried about the tourists’ health. In his post he criticized their dress code, shorts, and t-shirts, arguing that the Belgian girls were not appropriately attired for building work. The politician argued that sunburn and the cement touching their skin could have negative effects.  “When were Europeans doing building work wearing swimwear?!” said El Asri on Tuesday.  “Everybody knows how Europeans insist on preserving security measures in construction-related work sites, as a tourist is not allowed to access a worksite without wearing a suit, helmet, and gloves,” added El Asri.  He went on to express his doubts about the aim of the initiative, whether it was truly humanitarian or had other purposes. The parliamentarian explained that in the village near Taroudant, the residents would not be used to the choices of summer clothing as it is a conservative area. After sparking controversy and public outrage El Asri deleted his post in less than 24 hours.  He then posted a note addressed to the Minister of Interior Affairs, Abdelouafi Laftit. In his note, Al Asri requested to see the documentation and funding behind the organization of the project. Acknowledging that the construction work is of great benefit to the neediest people who live in isolated areas, El Asri asked the minister to be vigilant as volunteer initiatives can be used for unknown purposes. He then proposed the preparation of an annual report on all workshops to be presented for parliamentary examination. On Tuesday, the National Judicial Police, in coordination with the Directorate General of Territorial Surveillance (DGST) arrested a primary school teacher from Ksar El Kebir for inciting terrorism in a comment on El Asri’s post. The teacher wrote an extremist comment on the post in a group of more than 500,000 teachers. “You are right! Their heads should be cut off so that no one else dares to challenge the teachings of our religion,” said the 26-year-old teacher. DGST said in a statement that the suspect has been taken into custody under the supervision of the prosecutor’s office specializing in terrorism cases. An investigation has been opened to determine the circumstances and motives of the case.

Rabat – Henley &amp; Partners, a global residency and citizenship consultancy firm, has released its quarter 3 update of the Henley passport index. The index ranks passports according to the number of destinations their holders can access without pre-departure government approval.  According to the report released earlier this week, Morocco ranks 83 in the world, on par with Benin. Morocco ranks second in the North Africa region, behind Tunisia. The ranking is based on data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The highest ranked passports on the list are Japan and Singapore, followed by Finland, Germany and South Korea. United States passports rank 6th. The report finds that Moroccan passport holders can travel to 61 countries around the world without a visa, or by obtaining a visa-on-arrival. Moroccans can travel regionally without government pre-approval. According to the report, no prior approval is needed for travel to Mauritania, Algeria, Tunisia, and Senegal. Visas are needed however for travel to Libya and Egypt.  Some of the countries Moroccans can travel to around the world without prior approval include Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Ivory Coast, the Cook Islands, Vanuatu, Brazil, Jordan, and Turkey. Moroccans need prior government approval for travel to any countries within the European Union, China, Australia, and the United States. Visa procedures can be lengthy for Moroccans wishing to travel to these countries. In mid-May of this year, Moroccans applying for a Schengen visa through the Spanish consular services were facing up to six months of wait times for their visa appointments.

Rabat – Construction of a metro line in Malaga that runs through 11th-century Islamic ruins has gone ahead, despite objections from the Andalusian Ministry of Culture. The 11th-century ruins of an Islamic district, known as Al-Tabbanin, were discovered as part of the metro’s construction. The district is thought to have been abandoned in the thirteenth or fourteen century. The ancient ruins, which were found underneath a roundabout next to the chain department store, El Corte Ingles, are incredibly well preserved and intact. Despite this, the metro construction company has begun bulldozing the site. The metro company justifies the action, saying that the site has been fully recorded using 3D technology for the future use of researchers. The company adds that parts of the site that will not be bulldozed have been removed to be put in a museum paid for by the construction company. The portions removed for preservation represent only a small segment, while the rest of the ancient ruins are set to be either razed or buried. “It’s unfortunate what they have done,” said one local resident to Spanish media in front of the construction site. The Andalusian Ministry of Culture declared the actions of the Malaga Metro as ‘unforgivable’ in a recent council statement. The problem of the ancient ruins vs the metro line is one Malaga’s authorities have run into many times before. Construction of the metro began last March and has been frequently held up by the discovery of archaeological remains, each time sparking debate. Last July, a report from the Public Works Agency attempted to justify the destruction of a medieval road in favor of the metro line. “Any solution that would have preserved the Arab district in its entirety would have had obvious consequences on the development of the metro line, requiring us to change the route or the method of construction,” said the report. The decision from the Public Works Agency makes local residents dismayed by the destruction of the ruins, conservationists, and historians virtually powerless to stop the razing by the metro company. Even though the Andalusian Ministry of Culture designated the Moorish district Property of Cultural Interest, meaning certain areas of the historic Muslim quarter are “protected,” the metro company has gone ahead with the development anyway.

Rabat – The Confederation of African Football (CAF) decided to impose fines on RS Berkane (RSB) and Wydad of Casablanca (WAC) for the conduct of their supporters in the stands. The Confederation has also sanctioned RSB player Omar Nemsaoui for 4 matches. The Disciplinary Commission of the CAF has imposed fines of $62,500 and $15,000 respectively on two Moroccan football clubs; RSB and WAC. RS Berkane was fined $22,500 for fans’ use of smoke and lasers, firecrackers, and missiles in the second leg of the CAF Cup final.  CAF imposed another fine of $30,000 on the club for “aggressive gestures towards officials of the 2nd leg of the CAF Cup by some of RS Berkane officials and players and unsporting behavior and violent conduct of its technical team.” CAF also decided to suspend RSB player Omar Nemsaoui for four matches. CAF also fined the player $10,000 for “displaying violent conduct and confronting match officials during the medal ceremony” during the same match. WAC and Esperance Sportive of Tunisia (EST) were both fined $15,000 for “excessive use of smoke and pyrotechnics, flares lit in the stands, and throwing objects such as sound bombs and bottles of water” in the first leg of the Champions League final. In late May, the Ethiopian Football Federation (EFE) released a statement, claiming that Fouzi Lekjaa (president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation) had aggressively assaulted the referee during the CAF Cup final between the Egyptian team Al Zamalek and Moroccan football RS Berkane which took place on May 26.  CAF’s Disciplinary Committee dismissed referee Bamlak Tessema allegations arguing that the referee’s report does not match that of the match commissioner, Equatorial Guinea’s Gustavo Ndong Edu. The board said that “there is insufficient solid and corroborating evidence to prove the culpability of Fouzi Lekjaa.”

Rabat – A Moroccan delegation has flown to Nigeria to attend a meeting to assess the progress of the major Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline project. During the meeting, the Moroccan delegation along with experts from international oil and gas companies reviewed the progress of the gas pipeline project. The assessment is part of the Moroccan-Nigerian determination to deliver the project in “record time.” Members from Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NPPC) and Morocco’s  National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONHYM) discussed the importance of the key project, emphasizing that it is designed to develop the regional integration of West Africa. ONHYM Director-General Amina Benkhadra, who led the Moroccan delegation, also held talks with the President and the new Director-General of the NNPC, Mallam Mele K. Kyari. The delegation along with experts and NPPC members stressed that the pipeline will develop the delivery of gas to the population and industrial units, while also enabling Nigeria to export its abundant gas resources. The meeting also confirmed that the project will serve as a means to accelerate the economic and social development of the population on the African continent, as well as to ensure an alternative source of gas for Europe. During the meeting, Kyari emphasized the strategic importance of the gas pipeline, not only for Nigeria or Morocco but also for all West African countries. The meeting to review the progress of the project comes after Kyari met with Moha Ou Ali Tagma, Morocco’s ambassador to Nigeria on July 23. In July, both the ONHYM and the NNPC vowed to deliver the project on schedule amid concerns over political hurdles that may cause a delay in delivery. During the meeting, Kyari said that discussions with Morocco are underway to find a way to accelerate delivery and cement energy cooperation among the countries. “We are completely aligned with the MoU signed by our two governments. We will take it forward and ensure that those terms that are particularly related to oil and gas industry are delivered in record time,” Kyari said in July. The project is the fruit of several discussions between both Morocco and Nigeria for the project. In June 2018, resident of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari visited Morocco to finalize the signing of the first phase of the project with King Mohammed VI. The project, set to be 5,660 kilometers of pipeline aims to supply  15 countries in West Africa. Challenges In January, Fitch Solutions published a report titled “Planned Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline Faces Fundamental Challenges,” forecasting a delay in the completion of the project due to economic hurdles. The report stressed that political and security concerns in some of the countries affected by the NMGP will cause delays. Fitch’s report said that “considerable commercial, technical, legal and financial challenges” will make the project “unlikely to materialize in the short or medium-term.” Despite the concerns, both Morocco and Nigeria are determined to deliver the project to enhance the region’s industries as it will meet the needs of consumers.

Rabat – Security services at the Mohammed V airport in Casablanca arrested an Italian national subject of an international arrest warrant from Belgian judicial authorities. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that the 19-year-old suspect has been involved in an armed robbery. Checking operations at the airport revealed that the suspect is the subject of a red notice issued on August 5 from Interpol, at the request of the Belgian judicial authorities. Police arrested the suspect upon his arrival onboard a flight from Canada. The red notice was issued with a view to applying a four-year prison sentence for his involvement in a case of the attempted robbery of two houses in March. Police put the suspect in custody as part of the extradition procedure. Moroccan police also informed Belgian authorities of the suspect’s arrest. The operation is part of Morocco’s security cooperation with its partners against transnational organized crime.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries announced that cereal production in the 2018-2019  has reached 52 million quintals, down by 49 % compared to last year. The ministry said in a statement that the total cereal production area reached 3.6 million hectares. “The total production is divided into 26.8 million quintals for soft wheat, 13.4 million quintals for hard wheat and 11.6 million quintals for barley,” said the statement of the ministry. The ministry cites a poor rainfall season as the main reason for the drop in crop production. “Rainfall was 290.5 mm by the end of May 2019, down by 23% compared to the year before,” the ministry said. The agricultural value-added of this crop year is estimated at MAD 120 billion. The ministry’s statement supports a report issued by the Directorate of Studies and Financial Forecasts published in July. The report showed that cereal production for the 2018-2019 season was estimated at 61 million quintals. The report said that the number “represents a decrease of 40.5%” from the previous season. The report added that the production would be divided up into 35 million quintals of common wheat, 13.3 million quintals of durum wheat and 12.5 million quintals of barley. The directorate’s report, however, shows a positive overview of the fruit growing sectors, rearing and rangelands. The report also added that the projected yields of sugar beet was estimated at 70 tonnes per hectare. The document also showed a “good” forecast for olives, citrus fruits, and date palm production.

Rabat – Over the weekend, the US felt the shockwaves from two mass shootings within 24 hours, resulting in 31 deaths. On Saturday, August 3, twenty people were killed in a shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and nine victims were shot dead in Dayton, Ohio, in the early hours of Sunday, August 4. The perpetrator of the El Paso shooting posted a manifesto online entitled “The Inconvenient Truth,” warning against the supposed dangers of mass immigration. The manifesto also warned that Hispanics will eventually take over the economy and government. As for Dayton, the 24-year-old gunman killed his sister and eight others in an attack that lasted only 30 seconds in a popular nightlife district of the city. His motive for the attack remains unclear. The two shootings have rocked the nation and resurged debates over the cause of gun violence in the US and whether gun laws should be tightened or not. The day after the Ohio shooting, on Monday, August 5, US President Donald Trump took to Twitter to both give his condolences to the victims and called for stronger background checks, which he said should be “desperately needed immigration reform.” “We must have something good, if not GREAT, come out of these two tragic events,” he said. In the same series of tweets, he pointed the finger at the media and “fake news” for causing the build-up of “anger and rage” in the country. However, Trump’s statements on the shootings and surrounding issues saw a change in direction when he delivered a national address at the White House just hours after the tweets. During the address, he cited mental illness as one of the primary factors behind mass shootings. “Mental illness and hate pull the trigger, not the gun,” said Trump. “In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy,” he said. “These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America. As well as calling for reforms to mental health laws, he expressed support for the death penalty for those who commit mass murder. He said he had directed the justice department to propose legislation to ensure those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty. The US president also criticized “the perils of the internet and social media” and “gruesome and grisly” video games for promoting violence in society. “It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence,” he said. “We must stop or substantially reduce this and it has to begin immediately.” As well as drawing criticism for incorrectly naming the Ohio city that fell victim to one of the mass shootings as Toledo instead of Dayton, Trump faced criticism, particularly from the Democrats, for failing to mention possible changes to gun legislation. “When he can’t mention guns while talking about gun violence, it shows the President remains prisoner to the gun lobby and the NRA (National Rifle Association),” said the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in a joint statement. Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan, a Democratic candidate for president, agreed with Pelosi and Schumer in an MSNBC interview: “Republicans need to, quite frankly, get their shit together and stop pandering to the NRA [National Rifle Association] because people are getting killed.” Lily Adams, the communications director of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, tweeted: “He got the city wrong. He got the causes wrong. He got the fixes wrong. He’s completely incapable of rising to the moment.” He got the city wrong.He got the causes wrong.He got the fixes wrong. He's completely incapable of rising to the moment. — Lily Adams (@adamslily) August 5, 2019  The president was also criticized for failing to mention the effect his own anti-immigration rhetoric may have on violence in the US, particularly in light of the El Paso shooter’s statements in his manifesto. “This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas,” said the statement, calling the large Hispanic population of the city a “cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by invasion.” Democrats a pointing out the manifesto sounds eerily similar to some of Trump’s own statements, who has also referred to large groups of migrants trying to reach the US an “invasion.” Some Democrats accused Trump of stoking white nationalism and inciting violence by making these comments. “He’s an open avowed racist and is encouraging more racism in this country,” presidential candidate and El Paso native Beto O’Rourke told CNN. Another Democrat presidential candidate, Pete Buttigieg echoed this statement, tweeting:
“Our president isn’t just failing to confront and disarm these domestic terrorists, he is amplifying and condoning their hate.” Our president isn't just failing to confront and disarm these domestic terrorists, he is amplifying and condoning their hate. https://t.co/TNNUXccxkW — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) August 4, 2019  A third Democratic presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, said Trump’s language “creates a climate which emboldens violent extremists.” Mr. President: stop your racist, hateful and anti-immigrant rhetoric. Your language creates a climate which emboldens violent extremists. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 4, 2019  A handful of Republicans chimed in to criticize Trump, with Senator John S. McCollister condemning his own party for “enabling white supremacy.” The Republican Party is enabling white supremacy in our country. As a lifelong Republican, it pains me to say this, but it’s the truth. I of course am not suggesting that all Republicans are white supremacists nor am I saying that the average Republican is even racist. — Senator McCollister (@SenMcCollister) August 5, 2019

Rabat – Alsa-City Bus, a joint venture between Moroccan company City Bus and Spanish company Alsa, won the tender by public transport provider Al Assima in January 2018 to manage the Rabat-Sale public bus system. The contract promises a MAD 10 billion investment into the bus transport system in the region (approximately $1.2 billion) over the next 15 years. The contract includes bringing over 300 new buses to Rabat-Sale. Abdellatif Soudou, the vice-president of the Rabat-Sale city council, announced on his Facebook page on August 6 that the new buses would be operational “before the start of the school term,” in other words, the buses should be up and running by September 5. Soudou added that some buses may even start running “before Aid El Adha, if all goes to plan.” The new Alsa-City Bus buses will replace the current fleet run by Stareo, a company that has been in financial difficulties for a number of years. Many of Stareo’s buses have smashed paneling and windows.

Rabat – According to the figures of the semi-public operator Red Eléctrica de España, the Kingdom has become a net exporter of electricity to Spain. Morocco exported 76% of Morocco-Spain border exchanges of electricity and imported only 24%. Spain’s electricity import from Morocco in 2018 reached almost 20,588 GWh (Gigawatts/hour), while its exports to Morocco were only 10,442 GWh. According to the Foreign Exchange Office 2018 annual report, electricity exports generated MAD 158 million in 2018, compared to nearly zero in 2017. In March 2009, Morocco adopted a 2010-2030 strategy for renewable energies. The strategy aimed to solve the sector’s challenges. According to a publication by the Ministry of Energy, Mines, Water and Environment, Morocco was facing growing demand on energy (doubling at the end of 2020 and quadrupling at the end of 2030) and a high dependency on foreign countries (import of more than 95% of the country’s energy needs). The entry into service of several renewable power generation projects (solar and wind) such as the Safi Thermal Power Plant and solar energy stations like Noor Midelt and Noor Ouarzazate increased Morocco’s capacity to nearly 3,500 MW. Morocco aims to produce 42% (6,000 MW) of the electricity mix from renewable sources by 2020 and to reach at least 52% by 2030. The Safi thermal power plant, functioning since 2018 with a capacity of 1,386 MW, can satisfy up to 25% of the national electricity demand.

Rabat – An Algerian “sovereign” authority is consulting with academics on the reopening of closed land border with Morocco. A source quoted by Independent Arabia is expecting “ progress”  in the discussion under “positive” indications from  Morocco. The Independent Arabia’s sources said that a sovereign authority started its consultations with academics and specialists to discuss the “most effective way to open land border” despite the “outstanding controversial issues” between both countries. Algeria has long supported the claims of the Polisario Front, which opposes Morocco’s territorial integrity and sovereignty over Western Sahara. The suggestions of the academics include the establishment of committees made up of several ministries from the two countries Independent Arabia recalled Morocco’s recent positive rhetoric “free of the language of rivalry between the two neighbors” amid the popular movement in Algeria. Morocco’s government, however,  had expressed its willingness to open a frank and serious dialogue before the popular movement emerged in Algeria. In a speech marking the 43rd anniversary of the Green March, King Mohammed VI called on the Algerian government to join a frank dialogue to break the stalemate between the two neighbors. “I should like to say today, in a very straightforward and responsible way, that Morocco stands ready for a direct and frank dialogue with our sister nation, Algeria, in order to settle the transient and objective differences impeding the development of relations between the two countries,” said King Mohammed VI in his November 6, 2018 speech. The King renewed his call once again on the eve of Throne Day on July 29. The monarch said that Morocco has reiterated its  commitment to the “policy of the outstretched hand towards our Agerian brothers, out of loyalty to the bonds of rooted in brotherhood, religion, language and good-neighborliness that have always existed between the peoples of the two sister nations.” Independent Arabia  also recalled how Moroccans celebrated the victory of Algeria during the 2019 African Cup of Nations in the borders “It was ended with an official letter from King Mohammed VI, who described Algeria’s win as Morocco’s coronation,” Independent Arabia wrote. In addition to the congratulatory letter, the monarch also expressed Morocco’s commitment to friendship, saying that it was shown through the “the sincere and spontaneous manifestations of friendliness and support expressed by Morocco – its King and its people – for the Algerian national football team at the African Cup of Nations held in our sister country, Egypt.” Algeria closed the border with Morocco in 1994 after Rabat imposed visa regulations on Algerian citizens. Rabat’s decision came following a terrorist attack on the Atlas Asni Hotel in Marrakech.

Rabat – “Sometimes I think my entire life was preparation for Morocco. At home we always knew we were Moroccan,” begins a long, homecoming-themed article by Khen Elmaleh, a Moroccan Jew who says she has always wanted to bond with a part of her identity she felt she had lost. Elmaleh recently travelled to Morocco to have a firsthand feeling and experience of the memories and stories she grew up with as the child of Moroccan Jews who migrated to Israel after World War II. As a Jewish Moroccan child in Israel, she recounts, Moroccanness, even as it was part and parcel of how children like her felt, how they wanted to project themselves in the larger Israeli society, the Moroccan, or Arab, part of their identity “gradually faded” as they attempted to fit in, to be part of Israel’s national melting pot. “I’m grossly generalizing the experience of an entire generation, but in practice, Morocco’s presence in our lives gradually faded. Our Moroccan identity was relegated to folklore, the kitchen and amusing viral phrases that boosted the ratings of television comedies,” she writes. Elmaleh presents this gradual weakening of identification with Morocco as a result of the hostility, even if subtle, that being Moroccan or Arab evoked in Israel’s national imaginary. Growing up in Israel, she explained citing a known figure among Jewish, Moroccans was a “dirty word.” As people like her navigated Israel’s political and cultural reality, she writes, there was a pervading feeling that the country wanted them to “kill the Arabness inside us,” to sever ties with their grandparents’ home, to let go of the umbilical cord binding them to the past, their grandparents’ past and memories. This erasure of the past came with the possibility of being part of the Israeli melting pot, Elmaleh argues. “The traditional Israeli narrative holds that these places belong in the past; they’re no longer relevant to us.”
The past-erasing strategy worked for some time, for decades. But in time, and most emphatically in recent years, many have taken upon themselves to challenge the dominant narrative. They want to know “the truth” about who they really are. Elmaleh speaks of her own longing to visit Morocco as a desire to inhabit the home that her grandparents left, to own the stories that they told her growing up. “The more insistent this effort was,” she said of the societal demand that she let go of her Moroccanness, “the greater was my desire to understand just what it was I was supposed to forget.” The trip to Morocco, which she only took this summer, was both a homecoming and a biographical exploration. “I needed a visual perspective to understand what the DNA of my existence is comprised of. I needed to understand where Morocco and I intersect today and to what degree it’s relevant to our lives, we second- and third-generation people. I was going on a first date with the place that has had the most influence on me other than the place where I was born.” Poring over Elmaleh’s colorful and almost cinematic description of her trip to Morocco, there is a sense that Morocco did not disappoint. She said she felt a twinge of powerful emotions and cried as her plane landed in Marrakech, revealing the city “in all its strange rosy beauty – a kind of beauty I had never seen before, a kind it’s possible to imagine only on a movie set for a biblical period piece.” After visiting “beautiful and quirky” Marrakech, Elmaleh—predictably— headed to Essaouira, the repository of Morocco’s Jewish past. A small coastal city two hours drive from Marrakech, Essaouira’s cultural centers and infrastructure still bear markers of a time when Jews were a thriving community in Morocco, when Moroccan Jews and Muslims lived in harmonious, peaceful cohabitation. Essaouira, which Elmaleh said is “as beautiful as a painting,” felt both distant and familiar. “We had arrived in Essaouira – or its former Portuguese name, Mogador – during the 22nd annual Gnaoua World Music Festival. Some 130,000 visitors from Morocco and the rest of the world flood the city every year, which seems like a cross between Acre and Venice Beach in California.” One thing that stroke Elmaleh at the Gnawa festival was that most of the attendees were young, in their early or late twenties. She thought the kind of rhythm and evocation that come with the festival would tune best with an older audience. In Essaouira, however, the festival was not merely a cultural event for fun. Rather, it was taken as serious stuff, integral to Morocco’s history and identity. “Gnawa is our tradition, it is an integral part of our identity,” one young festival-goer from Casablanca told Elmaleh. Such attachment to tradition or anything deemed part of the Moroccan identity, Elmaleh suggested, is only possible in a country striving to keep its memories alive, or invest in its rich and diverse history so that it becomes an anchoring force for its youth, a rallying cry for the next generation, regardless of differences that may exist. Elmaleh speaks of a “manifold Morocco” to drive her point home. “The Moroccans are made up of many different tribes: Amazighs (Berbers), Arabs, Sub-Saharan Africans, immigrants from Europe. They have experienced conquests, colonialism and splits and still there’s some unity of a shared fate, a basic brotherhood among people who have ended up in the same place. It’s impossible not to be aware of the sharp contrast between this and the fissures we grow up on in Israel.” Elmaleh herself was graced with that sense of shared, inclusive Moroccanness. She recounts how insecure and misplaced she felt at first as she spoke Moroccan Arabic with a different accent. She expected to be found out, to receive at some point a slightly contemptible look, or a cold shoulder, or an unwelcoming smile, as her difference or her insufficient Moroccanness showed in the way she articulated her Arabic words. To her surprise, however, that rejection never came. Instead, her Moroccan interlocutors embraced her difference. “I stuttered my way into Morocco insecure and afraid that the next moment I’d be discovered as not really ‘one of theirs.’ But gradually, as the language barrier melted, so did this feeling. I was absolutely ‘one of theirs,’ only a bit different,” she wrote.

Rabat – Lydec issued a press release on August 5, in response to allegations on Facebook by an ex-employee casting doubt on Casablanca’s water quality. Abdelmalik Badaoui, a former employee of Lydec and the secretary general of the Union Bureau of Lydec Retirees, sent an audio recording to Moroccan news source Assabah in which he says Lydec’s water tanks are dirty, and more generally accuses Lydec of breaching health standards. Assabah suggests these allegations come at a time of dispute between Lydec former employees and the company, regarding the eligibility of former employees to access free water services from Lydec. Lydec has issued a press release in response, assuring that the water in Casablanca meets Moroccan health standards. The company adds that the Public Testing and Studies Laboratory (LPEE) has conducted independent testing on the water, confirming the water quality meets norm NM 03.7.001. The norms sets standards for human consumption in relation to mineral and bacterial levels. Lydec controls water quality from 184 testing locations across Casablanca, including tanks, and pipe networks. The company tests for sediment content, chlorine, and temperature amongst other standards. In 2018, the company reports having carried out 96,500 bacterial and chemical analysis, one and a half times more testing than what is required by Moroccan law. According to Lydec, the testing showed compliance in 99.97% of cases. Water contamination can be due to chemical or latrine leakages into the public water systems. It can also be due to bacteria growing inside water installations in homes, including in water-heaters and pipes. In its press release, Lydec warns that clients should also monitor water installations on their own property.

Rabat – The Jordanian Embassy said that it has not received any instructions regarding visas for Moroccan women. On Monday, August 7, several news outlets reported that Moroccan women aged 18 and 35 will no longer need a male guardian to obtain special permission from the Jordanian Ministry of Interior to enter Jordan. The embassy told  Morocco World News that it has received “no official instructions” regarding this new procedure. The embassy added that the news is a “misinformation.” The embassy said that it does not recognize the concept of a male guardian in response to a question from MWN about male guardianship as an entry requirement. The embassy also promised to give further information to MWN once it receives official instructions regarding visas for Moroccan women. HuffPost, however, quoted an “authorized”  source from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who said that Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister of Nasser Bourita had held talks with his Jordanian counterpart Aymen al Safdi on the issues of visas for Moroccan women in July. The source added that Bourita “insisted”  that Jordan remove any visa restrictions for Moroccan women. The Jordanian Tourism Board also published the list of countries where citizens are eligible to obtain a Jordanian visa on arrival. In the Maghreb region, citizens from  Morocco, Algeria, Libya, and Tunisia can obtain visas upon arrival. However, the website shows that only  Tunisian citizens aged 18 to 35 are allowed to obtain a visa upon arrival. The debate on visa restrictions for women comes eight months after a group of Moroccan activists condemned discriminatory visa policies in Jordan and Egypt. On social media, several women voiced their frustration after they were denied visas on arrival to Jordan for work. Mounia Semlali, a female employee at Oxfam,  told Morocco World News that her visa request was rejected. She added that the embassy verbally told her that she could not visit the county without a mahram. “When I argued the fact that I need a mahram, they told me that I need approval from the Ministry of Interior in Jordan.” “Why must Moroccans between 18 and 35 years old be accompanied by a mahram to have the right of entry in Jordan? Why Moroccans in particular?” she asked. The Jordanian ambassador in Morocco, Hazem Al Khateb Attamimi, intervened. He said in January that Moroccan women aged 18 to 35 are subject to stricter rules when applying for visas to visit Jordan. He told MAP that the visa regulations have “been applied for many years and have not been modified.” The ambassador added that the policy “only restricts and limits the entry of certain age groups, and does not prohibit them.” The ambassador explained that the policy “is governed by regulations related to the legalization and protection of the labor market in Jordan.” Attamimi added that Jordan does not “prevent Moroccan citizens from entering its territory, provided they submit to regulatory measures to specify the workplace or to indicate the reason for the visit.”

Rabat –  Members of the royal navy rescued 424 irregular migrants in the Mediterranean on the night of Sunday, August 4,  through to Monday morning. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that, according to military sources, most of the irregular migrants are sub-Saharans. The list of the rescued migrants includes 53 women and 16 minors. The migrants were on board several damaged makeshift inflatable boats. The Coastguard provided the rescued migrants with first aid before they transferred them to various ports across Morocco. The operation comes after royal navy members rescued  63 sub-Saharan migrants from a damaged ship off the north-eastern coastline of Morocco on August 4. Recently, Morocco has been facing more pressure from irregular migration, urging the government to intensify its efforts against irregular migration attempts. Morocco’s help in managing border control and the abortion of irregular migration attempts resulted in a “significant decrease” in the migration pressure on Spanish coasts, reported Spanish news outlet ABC. Morocco has foiled more than 40,300 irregular migration attempts since January 2019. Thousands of migrants leave the African continent via Morocco every year using risky methods to reach Europe. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said that  12,443 migrants arrived illegally in Spain via the sea route between January and July 2019.

Rabat – Spokesperson of the US Embassy in Morocco, Joshua Wagner, has confirmed the second visit of Donald Trump’s adviser, Jared Kushner, to Morocco. Wagner told Moroccan television channel 2M that Kushner, along with US special envoy for international negotiations Jason Greenblatt arrived in Morocco on Thursday, August 1. The spokesperson said that the US officials were “officially received by the Moroccan government.” “Kushner held an official meeting with members of the Moroccan government, before leaving the kingdom on Friday [August 2nd],” added Wagner. On August 2, the Jerusalem Post reported that Kushner’s agenda for his visit to Morocco also included meetings with Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed (MBZ) and Oman’s Minister Responsible for Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin Alazi bin Abdulah in Morocco. Morocco’s official news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) has not published a statement on Kushner’s latest visit to Morocco, nor his meeting with the MBZ and Oman’s foreign minister. Kushner’s visit is part of his second Middle East tour to seek support for the US economic project, a part of the Middle East peace plan, otherwise known as the Deal of the Century. While Kushner is seeking support for the plan, Palestine refuses mediation from the US as Trump’s administration supports Israeli actions. On June 23, thousands of Moroccan citizens also gathered to reject the Deal of the Century in a protest. The protesters marched in Rabat to denounce any maneuvers against the  Palestinian cause and the legitimate rights of Palestinians. The Moroccan government also supports the Palestinian cause, emphasizing that its position on Palestine is constant.

Rabat – The National Judicial Police, in coordination with the Directorate General of Territorial Surveillance (DGST), arrested a primary school teacher on August 5 for his alleged involvement in a case of glorification and incitement to terrorist acts. According to a statement from the Directorate General of National Security (DGSN), the teacher (26 years) was arrested in Ksar El Kebir (99 kilometers south of Tangier). The suspect commented on a post about a Facebook video. In his comment, he encouraged people to “cut the heads off” a group of Belgian female tourists. The post said, “they should have respected the region’s traditions and Morocco’s Islamic identity.” “They should have been covered; this job is for men and what they did was pure provocation,” added the post. The teacher commented saying, “you are right! Their heads should be cut off so that no one else dares to challenge the teachings of our religion.” The post was published on a Facebook group of 500,000 members, most of whom are teachers. The targeted Belgian tourists were in a video going viral on social media. They were part of a group volunteering to fix a road in poor condition in the region of Taroudant. While their initiative attracted the sympathy of the village residents and the majority of Internet users, others were unhappy with the “girls’ outfits.” According to the statement, the investigation resulted in the seizure of a laptop and mobile phone that the suspect allegedly used to post his comment. The suspect was taken into custody under the supervision of the prosecutor’s office specializing in terrorism cases, in order to determine the circumstances and motives of the case, concludes the statement.

Rabat – The Ministry of Interior issued a statement on the death of a young girl, who died in a burning apartment building in Sidi Alal Bahraoui, near Rabat. The statement, quoted by Moroccan television channel 2M, said that the victim was playing next to the window at the time of the explosion of a telephone charger inside the room.  “Once there, the members of the civil protection worked hard to reach the girl, but they did not succeed despite the efforts made.” The statement added that the girl was stuck in a fence placed on the window of her house. Shocking videos and photos, showing the girl trying to escape have gone viral on social media. The posts stirred uproar, with people condemning the alleged delayed intervention from civil protection. Saddened with the death of Hiba, eyewitnesses said that civil protection should shoulder their responsibility for the death of the victim. “People went to their center, and some of the members of civil protection said that they still had to put on their suits in order to rescue the girl,” one citizen said. Another local resident said that people have been calling the firefighters for 23 minutes without receiving a response. The victim’s aunt said that Hiba’s mother was feeding her second youngest  daughter in another room, when the incident happened.  She told Hespress that when the charger exploded in the room, where Hiba was playing, the mother took her second child outside to go back to help the victim. “Women prevented her from entering the house as it caught fire,” the victim’s aunt said. She added that civil protection members told people who called them that they could not help Hiba without wearing their suits. When the incident happened, the victim’s father was on his way to the mosque for al-asr Prayer. The ministry’s statement said that an investigation was opened to determine the circumstances of the incident. Low quality chargers manufactured in China have caused similar incidents across Morocco. In 2017, several incidents occurred, causing the death of several people.

Rabat – A new environmental project is in the works.  The idea was launched by Moroccan Jamal Berraoui. He wants to plant 50 million trees across Morocco on November 18, Morocco’s independence day. A national tree-planting day started off as just an idea, but then a number of stakeholders decided to adopt the project, Berraoui told Maghreb Press Agency (MAP). To spread the concept and to gain more momentum, Berraoui has launched the hashtag #50millions_d_arbres (50 million trees). “A huge number of people, companies and public and private enterprises have shown they are ready to take part in the project,” Berraoui said. He believes the initiative must be backed by councils. The protection of nature is the responsibility of local councils, and is not a political question, he emphasized.  The councils will need to identify areas where tree planting will be possible, and citizens will then participate in the project by helping with the planting on the day. In 2016, Abdeladim Lhafi, the Commissioner General at the time of the COP22 (the United Nations Climate Change Conference) organised an initiative to plant a million trees in a day in the Jbilat area near Marrakech. Close to 37 000 volunteers helped with planting trees over a 3000 hectare area.

Rabat – On a visit to the Ministry of Energy in Rabat, US Congressman Frank Pallone said he is impressed by Morocco’s progress in renewable energies. Pallone, who is also the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, is leading a congressional delegation which arrived in Rabat as part of the US-Morocco determination to strengthen bilateral relations in different areas. Pallone told reporters following a meeting with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita on Monday, August 5,  that he was impressed by Morocco’s progress in renewable energies. He also expressed his country’s wish to develop cooperation in the renewable energy sector. “Yesterday [Sunday, August 4], we went to the Ministry of Energy, and we were very impressed because Morocco produces more than 30 % of its energy from renewable sources such as solar and wind power,” said the Congressman.  The North African country is determined to reinforce the sector with a commitment to position itself as a leader in the renewable energies sector. In February, CNN reported that Morocco is well on track to hit its target to generate  42% of its electricity from renewable energies by 2020. With a solar power plant of magnitude – Noor-Ouarzazate complex-  Morocco produced 35 % of its electricity output from renewable energy sources by the end of 2018, Minister of Energy Aziz Rabbah said in January.  North African country seeks to expand its production rate to 52 % of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. CNN noted that the Noor-Ouarzazate complex, produces enough electricity to power a city the size of Prague, or twice the size of Marrakech The Ministry of Energy believes that the state will invest $40 billion in the energy sector by 2030. During Pallone’smeeting with Bourita, the two officials discussed means to “step up bilateral military and trade cooperation,” according to the Congressman. Morocco and the US already share strong ties, with several military and trade agreements on the table. The US remains Morocco’s largest supplier of arms. Morocco and the US also signed the Free Trade Agreement (FTA)  on June 15, 2004, which came into effect on January 1, 2006. The US congressman recalled that Morocco, a powerful ally of the US  is the only African country to sign the FTA with the US administration.

Following the collapse, the Moroccan Forum for Democracy and Human Rights issued a statement on August 4, calling on all officials to open an investigation into the circumstances of the incident. Among the addressees, the letter was sent to Abdelahad Fassi Fihri, Minister of National Planning, and  Abdelouafi Laftit, Minister of the Interior. The Forum questioned the extent to which the legal and technical conditions stipulated in the Construction Law had been respected, and if the building’s foundations were capable of sustaining as many floors. The Forum requested responsibilities to be clarified. The forum also called for an investigation into the absence of any separation between the building and adjacent shops, as stipulated by construction regulations. The lack of separation caused damage to a nearby shop.

Rabat – The acting American Chargé d’Affaires to Morocco, Jennifer Rasamimanana, has assured Morocco that the delay in the US ambassador taking office is “normal.” The prospective ambassador, David Fischer, has still not taken office over 600 days since his nomination by US President Donald Trump. Rasmimanana was questioned about the issue on the sidelines of a visit from a delegation of US parliamentarians. “It’s normal, things are underway and not only Morocco is affected by this. There are many countries in the same situation,” she said, adding that relations between the two countries are historic, and Morocco and the US are “strategic partners.” Stressing the importance of the relations between the two countries, she recalled that Morocco was the first country in the world to formally acknowledge the United States as an independent nation in 1777. A communiqué in 2017 first announced the nomination of American businessman David T. Fischer as the next US ambassador to Morocco, but nothing stirred in the Senate. In January of this year, federal documents indicated that the Senate failed to confirm Fischer as US ambassador to Rabat and Fischer’s nomination was sent back for presidential consideration. President Trump stood by his decision, nominating the car dealer from Michigan, known for being a major Republican donor, for a second time. However, six months after the second nomination, Fischer has still not taken office Fischer contributed $250,000 to President Trump’s inauguration funds, and his nomination as an ambassador has been largely perceived in US policy circles as an expression of gratitude for Fischer’s contribution to President Trump’s inauguration. Rasamimanana was right in pointing out that Fischer is not the only prospective ambassador experiencing a delay. The nominee to be envoy to the Bahamas has already waited almost 800 days, while a slew of others have already waited between 500-600 days. The delay is most likely due to ongoing clashes between Republicans and Democrats occupying the Senate.

Rabat – The families of the three opposition activists jailed in Edhibia prison have warned that the condition of their relatives is deteriorating. The three activists have been on a hunger strike for two weeks to condemn their arbitrary detention. Members of the Polisario Front arrested the activists in June when they were participating in protests against human rights violations in the Tindouf camps. Pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara reported that Moulay Aba Bouzid and Mahmoud Zidan’s health is deteriorating due to their continuous hunger strike for “the arbitrary detention and the delays in bringing them to trial.” Moulay Aba, according to the source, is suffering from pain in his left side. The prison doctor warned  Mahmoud Zidan that the hunger strike may result in kidney failure.  The families of the detainees said that the Polisario Front should bear all the responsibility for the detainee’s health conditions. In July, the activists condemned the serious violations committed by members of the Polisario Front. One of the activists told his family that he spent 36 hours in a secret prison before he was transferred to a prison in Rabouni. Polisario also used a blindfold while they were interrogating the three activists. “We were then transferred to the Edhabia prison,” he said. The activist described the conditions of detention in the Edhabia prison as “miserable.” On July 16, Human Rights Watch (HRW) condemned  Polisario’s use of arbitrary arrests and torture. HRW also called for the immediate release of the three activists.

Rabat – Osian Roberts, the Welshman whom Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) has just appointed as the new technical director of the Atlas Lions, Morocco’s national football team, is set to be a big part of the North African country’s grand plan to emerge from the fiasco it suffered in the recently concluded Africa Cup of Nations. From the Welshman’s first interview since his appointment, he appears ready for the challenge, the monumental task of devising the plan that may deliver Morocco its first major trophy after over three decades of trophy drought, a mix of mediocre performance and half-hearted brilliance. Speaking to Wales Online on August 3, Roberts spoke about legacy, the excitement of a new challenge, and the drive to make his mark—which he hopes will be positive and lasting—on Moroccan football. The Welshman’s decision to take Morocco’s offer surprised many in his entourage, as he was in good terms with the Welsh federation, the employer he left for Morocco. But Roberts is adamant that he left his post with Wales because Morocco’s offer came with a challenge that spoke to his heart. “They told me ‘Come in and build something special for us, leave a legacy’,” Osian said of Morocco’s call. “That appeals to me because it is what I have done here.” Roberts’s legacy-inspired plea is warranted. As the assistant coach of the Welsh national team, Roberts has been widely described as the mind behind the country’s recent runs of impressive forms, including a formidable outing at the latest European Championships and a qualification for the World Cup in Russia. Roberts was particularly instrumental for Wales’ spectacular display at the 2016 European Championships in France, where the Welsh team, an underdog at the tournament, shocked European footballing behemoths by securing a spot in the semi-finals. Goal, a football-focused outlet, explained, speaking of Robert’s role in the positive transformation Wales has witnessed of late in terms of football: “The popular coach, who has been involved with the Welsh coaching setup since 2010, was credited with the Dragons’ semi-final run at Euro 2016.” Roberts said Morocco’s offer came “quickly,” unexpected. But so appealing—and grand—was the project design that he felt he could not turn it down. He said that nothing “negative” precipitated his unexpected move to leave his post with the Welsh team. Rather, he explained, Morocco’s offer, and the responsibility that came with it, was a “challenge that really excites me.” Roberts recounted the circumstances of his appointment by FRMF to make his point—about the grandeur of the challenge and the excitement of being the one to make it come true—clearer. “It’s kind of just happened very quickly. I was in Armenia doing technical analysis of UEFA’s under-19s tournament when the Moroccan FA President made contact, invited me over for a chat. We had great discussions, I got to see the country and he invited me back on Tuesday to put something definitive together. “I was still a little open-minded, but as things were put into place it became clearer and clearer this was a great opportunity I simply couldn’t turn down.” But for all the enthusiasm, and despite his impressive record with Wales, Roberts appeared to show hints of awareness as to the different mindset and technical toolkit needed to deliver what Morocco is asking for—a recipe to do well in major continental and worldwide tournaments. Roberts said FRMF gave him “the autonomy” he needs in his job to devise plans as it sees fit, plans that work—at least supposed to—for the kind of resources FRMF promised to put at his disposal. But, he acknowledged, that autonomy will not be used to uncritically replicate the philosophy that made him successful during his tenure with Wales. The challenge is the same but the tactical environment and the philosophy should be different, he argued. “I can’t just cut, copy and paste the Wales model I’ve helped build up and transport it over to Africa. It’s a completely different culture, a very different challenge. But building a national team’s department appeals for sure, although it will require lots of details to make it work.” Again and again, Roberts’s language throughout the interview evinced optimism, readiness, and a sneaking sentiment that while Morocco’s team has not done particularly well in its recent outings, it has what it takes to do well. The challenge, though, as far as Roberts sees it, will be to channel the resources available towards realizing the aspired results, the dream that has frustratingly—and sometimes, like this year, incomprehensibly—eluded the Moroccan Lions in decades. He said he is “intrigued” and excited to try with Morocco “something similar” to his Welsh success story. With a technical director and a head coach— also newly appointed —with impressive resumes, Morocco appears to show no willingness of relinquishing on harboring grand designs and entertaining great expectations for its football team. Having disappointed at the recent CAN and World Cup, Morocco sees in Vahid Halilhodzic (the newly appointed coach) and Roberts the unique combination it needs to deliver the kind of success after which the North African country has been desperately, relentlessly, chasing.
Halilhodzic’s task seems less daunting compared to Roberts, however. The Franco-Bosnian coach’s successful experience with Algeria at the 2014 World Cup and Morocco’s Wydad in the late 1990s means he is familiar enough with the challenge Morocco—and African teams, in general—represents. But whether Roberts can replicate the inspiring moments he has had with Wales remains a big question mark.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Education and Vocational Training issued a statement, announcing that medical, dentistry, and pharmaceutical retake exams will take place from September 4-30. The ministry said that the retake exams will take place according to the schedule established and posted in medical universities. The ministry also called on all students to take the retake exams. The statement comes six days after the National Commission of Medical Students in Morocco said that a march will take place on September 1 as part of the continuous  “struggle” to urge the government to meet their demands. Since March, medical students have been carrying out protests and strikes against poor medical training conditions, as well as the government’s decision to privatize medical education services. Hundreds of students boycotted final exams after four months of continuous protests. Throughout the year, the Education and Health Ministries have convened the students for meetings, urging them to suspend their strikes to take the final exams.  Supported by their parents, students announced in several statements their determination to continue their protests and sit-ins to denounce the ministries’ “persistence” in not meeting demands. In June,  medical student Oumaima Outani told  Morocco World News that the students are striking against the “inhumane circumstances in which final year medical students take their internships.” She said that all students are “forced” to strike by the poor conditions in which students are forced to work. We are forced to protest. We are forced to save our public schools and to save our future, so we are ready to do whatever it takes and to go as long as we can,” she said In a statement, the commission of medical students said that all strike and boycott of finale exams were 10% successful. The statement came after  Minister of Education Said Amzazi warned the students that they should shoulder their responsibility for missing exams. The students, however, believe that the government and the ministries of health and education, bear the responsibility of the lost year.” The commission also questions the concerned parties’ willingness to resolve the case. in a statement on July 30, the commission said that “the huge delay in responding the demands of students and their concerns, which exceeded four months, question the officials’ will to resolve this file.”

Rabat – The recent heatwave that hit Europe has caused Greenland’s ice sheet to begin melting more quickly, losing 12.5 billion tons of Ice in one single day. On Wednesday, July 31, the melting of Greenland’s ice reached its peak with a record of 56.5% Greenland, which is the world’s largest island, is a semi-autonomous country under Danish authority. Located between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, ice covers 82% of its surface. The increased temperatures causing the ice to melt is the same weather front from North Africa and Spain that led to record-breaking temperatures in Europe. Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Britain all saw unprecedented heat waves at the end of July. According to a study by scientists in the United States and Denmark in June, increased melting of Greenland’s ice sheet would contribute to the rise of the global sea level by 5 to 33 centimeters by the year 2100. The same study found that if all the ice in Greenland island melted, which would take centuries, sea levels would rise by 7.2 meters. For Ruth Mottram, a climate scientist with the Danish Meteorological Institute, the ice-melt will continue as the sunny and warm weather in Greenland persist. She expected that the ice-melt would increase and peak on Thursday, August 1, before cooler temperatures slow the pace of melting. “It looks like the peak will be today. But, the long-term forecast is for continuing warm and sunny weather in Greenland, so that means the amount of the ice loss will continue,” said Mottram, as quoted by the Associated Press. Mottram added that since June 1 the Greenland ice sheet has lost 240 gigatons (240 billion metric tons) this year compared to 290 gigatons lost overall in 2012. The melt season roughly starts on June 1 and continues until the end of August.

The rescue operation took place on August 4, approximately 20 km off the coast of Al Hoceima, reports Spanish news channel COPE. The boat’s engine had broken down and the hull had filled up with water when the navy arrived. The migrants were taken back to the Al Hoceima port. On August 1, the Moroccan police also arrested 95 other sub-Saharan migrants when they were preparing to leave for Europe from a beach in Tazaghine, west of Al Hoceima. Every year, thousands of migrants leave Morocco illegally by boat in an attempt to reach Europe. According to figures from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), between January and July 2019, 12,443 migrants arrived illegally in Spain by sea.  While monthly arrivals to Spain are lower this year (down from 20,992 over the same period last year), the number of fatalities on the Mediterranean remains high, notes the IOM. At least 206 people have died trying to cross to Spain between January and July.    Spain and Morocco have been working together closely to prevent illegal migration. On July 19, the Spanish government approved a €30 million grant to reinforce Morocco’s border capabilities. Earlier in July, Spain also approved a grant of €26 million to buy and deliver to Morocco 750 vehicles, drones, scanners, radars and other technical equipment for strengthening the control of its borders, reported Spanish newspaper El Pais. According to a statement in January by the Moroccan Ministry for the Interior, Morocco stopped 89,000 people from illegally migrating to Europe by land and sea in 2018. 29,715 of these migrants were intercepted at sea.

Rabat – The Moroccan Ministry of the Interior has launched a call for bids for the renovation of the historic Meknes Medina. The restoration project, part of the wider initiative to renovate ancient medinas in many Moroccan cities, aims to rehabilitate over 17 historical sites in Meknes over five years.  The works are due to be completed by 2023 and have a forecast budget of over MAD 73 Million.  The initiative, signed by King Mohammed VI on October 2018, also includes plans for renovating the ancient medinas of Sale, a city near Rabat, Tetouan, and Essaouira. The nationwide initiative has a total budget of MAD 2.35 Billion.  These funds will go towards renovating historical monuments, improving accessibility by paving and improving road surfaces, as well as building above and below-ground parking spaces. The construction of schools, cultural centers, and other amenities will also be covered by the budget.  By implementing these changes, the program seeks to attract more tourists and boost revenues for local artisans. It aims to improve the lives of Medina residents through job creation and better access to social services.  The program targets many of the city’s historic Babs (Gates) Foundouks (Historic Inns) and Borjs (Towers). Among the monuments targeted are Bab Lekhmis, Bab Tizimi Sghira, Bab el Kazdir, Bab Berrima, Bab Beni M’hammad, Bab Bradiine, Bab Jdid, Borj bibi Aicha, Borj Chrichira, Borj Beni M’hammed, Fondouk el Moulouiine, Fondouk Zbadi, Fondouk Soltane, Foudouk Nejjarine, Foundouk Talaba, in addition to the Medrasa Filalia and the Lalla Aouda Mosque.  The project is a collaboration between the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry for Habitat, and the Agency for the Development and Rehabilitation of the Fez Medina, ADER FEZ.

Rabat – The Prosecutor’s Office of Ain Sebaâ’s Court of the First Instance in Casablanca ordered the arrest of a Moroccan National for fraud and impersonation. The man pretended to be a senior Moroccan intelligence agent, promising to help send dozens of his victims to the Netherlands.  Pretending to hold close relations with diplomatic officials, he scammed more than a hundred people by extorting sums of money ranging between MAD 50,000 and 60,000 since 2013.  Assabah newspaper reported, in its August 5 issue, that the scammer targeted elderly men in mosques. He approached them after prayer and asked them about the situation of their children after first gaining their trust. When the victims’ children appeared to be unemployed, he persuaded the victims that he could help them emigrate to Europe. According to the daily, the fake agent offered to help them to emigrate to the Netherlands on the pretext that Dutch authorities pay immigrants based on their level of education. He also promised them that he would intervene with officials at the Dutch Embassy and with Moroccan diplomats to facilitate their departure. The police arrested the man in a cafe in Casablanca after two victims had filed complaints. The victims had given him MAD 30,000 in advance but were suspicious when he asked for more.  During the investigation, the man continued to claim to be an intelligence services agent and then to be a  police commissioner. Eventually, the man confessed to having been a scammer for several years.

Rabat – There is always an untold story hidden behind closed doors. In 1971, Morocco witnessed a turning point when rebel military leaders attempted to assassinate late King Hassan II on July 10, 1971, during his forty-second birthday celebrations. The coup d’etat attempt made it into Morocco’s history, but some details of the heroism and sacrifice remain an untold story. On August 4, Spanish news outlet El Espanol published a report on two Spanish women, who “saved King Mohammed VI from death.” The report comes as Morocco celebrates the 20th anniversary of King Mohammed VI in power. The report tells the story of Juanita and Ascension, two Spanish nannies who allegedly saved the monarch, when he was a prince during the coup d’etat attempt in 1971 in Skhirat, on the outskirts of Rabat. The report takes us back 48 years to a Saturday when King Mohammed VI’s father was celebrating his 42nd birthday with a  large party. The entire royal family were in attendance along with high-level diplomats. The evening of the birthday party, “hid a surprising gift for the Alawite monarchy,” said El Esmanoyk. A group of soldiers, generals, and colonels “very close to Hassan II, organized a coup d’etat that aimed to overthrow the monarchy.” At the time of the attempted coup d’etat, King Mohammed VI was then 7 years old. “A real butcher’s shop:” is how the Spanish news outlet described the scene after military rebels opened fire, killing 100 people and injuring 200 more. El Espanol said that the life of King Mohammed VI was the “target” of the military rebels, “but his baraka [blessing] had two female names: Ascension and Juanita.” The Rescue As guests made their entrance to the celebration, they were required to sign their attendance in a guest book. Suddenly, a group of soldiers bursts into the palace. The entrance of the soldiers, shouting and shooting into the air, attracted the attention of the Royal Governess, Juanita Labajos. She asked them what they were doing, saying that the King was not yet ready. “The party has not begun yet!” Shouted the nanny.  The military rebels pointed their machine gun, saying that the “party starts now!” and started shooting people. Chaos reigned. While some of the dignitaries and politicians attending the party attempted to escape, many simply threw themselves to the floor, trying to avoid the gunshots.  During the massacre, 100 people lost their lives and 200 were injured. Among the dead was Belgian Ambassador, Marcel Dupret. However, Juana Labajos had one goal in mind: saving King Mohammed VI and his siblings.  “Juana Labajos moved in the palace like a fish in the water. She knew everyone and everyone knew her,” El Espanol wrote. Meanwhile, King Hassan, apprehended by a soldier, persuaded him to remain loyal to their king.  “Are you going to kill your own king?” The soldier then stood firm and greeted the King and let him go, but warned him that others were still trying to kill him and his family.  At the same time, soldiers came upon King Hassan II’s five children: Princess Lalla Asmae,  Prince Moulay Rachid, Princess Lalla Hasna, Princess Lalla Meriem, and King Mohammed VI with a Spanish nanny. The nanny refused to give in to the soldiers and stood in front of the children and the other nannies, protecting them.  Military sources from the Spanish embassy claim that this was Labajos, and that she spoke firmly to the soldiers in Arabic, taking the children and their other caretakers to hide in the women’s bathroom, where they remained locked in until rescuers came.   The Spanish embassy sources confirmed that this woman was none other than Juana Labajos, however, her younger sisters told the press that the rescuer was in fact Ascension Diaz. Biographer of King Mohammed VI, Ferran Sales, wrote that, “No one is able to confirm if it was [Juana Labajos] who in July 1971, amid the Skhirat coup d’etat,  [threw herself] into a pool to save the little Sidi Mohamed who had fallen into the water and threatened to drown. ” While there are several versions of the story, and no one but King Mohammed himself will ever truly knew what took place that day, El Espanol reports that the evidence confirms Juana Labajos as the heroine.   Two years after the coup d’etat, late King Hassan II gave the two highest decorations to the Spanish Governess. King Hassan named the nanny a Dame of the Alawite Throne.  In 1977, Labajos also had to go back to Spain after suffering a serious illness, allegedly cancer. During her stay at the Nuestra Senora de Loreto clinic. According to El Espanol, King Mohammed VI, and his siblings flew to Madrid to “say goodbye to their beloved ‘Aunt Juanita’ as they called her in private.”

Rabat – Shocking footage of a girl unsuccessfully trying to escape a burning apartment building in Sidi Alal Bahraoui, a town 40 kilometers from Rabat, has been circulating on the internet since Sunday, August 5. The disturbing video shows the young girl, named Hiba, trying desperately to escape the building by the window, but being blocked by grills. Neighbors who had gathered down below, waiting for firefighters to arrive, could only look on helplessly. One of the local residents in the district condemned the delay in intervention, saying that people had been calling the firefighters for 23 minutes. “They hang up the phone. There is proof, go check the call center there. We did our best,” he told the press. “Nobody killed her, the civil protection killed her,” he added with tears in his eyes. He said that local residents even drove to the civil protection center. “They found the [firefighters] playing cards.”  Another local resident said that several people tried to break down the door of the apartment, but were sadly unable to open it. By the time the civil protection services finally arrived, the girl had caught fire. The eyewitnesses said that civil protection bears all responsibility for the death of Hiba. “People went to their center, and some of the members of civil protection said that they still had to put on their suits in order to rescue the girl,” one citizen said. Firefighters did eventually arrived to rescue Hiba, but she died from the serious injuries she sustained in the fire shortly after arriving at Tifelt Hospital, according to Al Yaoum 24. Internet users who saw the video are condemning the firefighting services for not arriving at the scene quickly enough. Local authorities have not yet indicated what caused the apartment building in the Al-Nasr neighborhood to catch fire.

Rabat – Kenyan authorities have asked for Morocco’s support as the East African country vies to secure a non-permanent seat at the UN Security Council for the 2019-2020 tenure, a local outlet has reported. At an event organized at the Moroccan embassy in Kenya in commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of King Mohammed VI’s ascension to the throne, Kenyan and Moroccan officials shared enthusiastic messages of pan-Africanism, of heightened inter and intra-African dialogue on the diplomatic front. Speaking at the event, Arthur Adumbi, Kenya’s foreign affairs ministry’s Representative for African Opinion, recalled Morocco’s role in the rising pan-Africanist mood among African policymakers. He praised Morocco’s investments across the continent and pointed out that, since it rejoined the African Union two years ago, the North African country has positioned itself as one of the most vocal promoters of African issues at the global level. “As you are aware, Kenya is vying for a non-permanent seat of the UN Security Council for the period 2019-2020 and therefore requests Morocco’s support for this candidature,” Adumbi said. The Kenyan official also pointed to Morocco’s pioneering role in post-colonial Africa. Dwelling on the role of the Casablanca Group, one of the forerunners of pan-Africanism in the aftermath of independence for most African countries in the 1960s, Adumbi said that Morocco was instrumental in decolonization struggles and in paving “the way for the unification of African states through pan-Africanism… and the launch of the then Organization of African Unity.” Mokhtar Ghambou, the Moroccan ambassador to Nairobi, spoke, for his part, of Morocco’s African ambitions, its South-South agenda, as well as the country’s willingness to step up through scholarships and inter-university exchanges to curb extremism and provide academic training for future African elites. For Ghambou, Morocco’s significance for the continent has not only been in the conventional economic sectors such as banking, trade, or agriculture. In addition to those sectors, Rabat has been a reliable African partner in the field of higher education and vocational training, the ambassador explained. He also drew attention to what he suggested is Morocco’s pan-African policy on migration. “Thanks to the Royal Initiative, 50 000 illegal migrants and refugees have become legal residents so far, with access to education, healthcare, and affordable housing, just like the citizens of Morocco,” he said. Inevitably, the Moroccan ambassador put forward the perceptible progress Morocco has made in recent years. He said, “We have no oil or gas, as you know, but that didn’t prevent us from building the largest solar energy plant in the world, from having the fastest train in Africa and the Arab world, and from having the largest port in Africa and the Mediterranean.” These achievements, Ambassador Ghambou argued, have made Morocco a sought-after and reliable partner at both the continental and global levels. Other speakers at the event echoed the same sentiments as Adumbi and Ghambou. From the necessity of a collaborative African platform to curb extremism to the urge of furthering intra-African exchanges, all the speakers agreed that the “African family” at the UN and other international organizations should show more unity and cohesion when discussing on issues of vital interest for the African continent.

Rabat – The Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco, the Arab World Institute (IMA), the Ministry of Culture, and the National Museums Foundation will jointly organize an art exhibition titled “Treasures of Islam in Africa, from Timbuktu to Zanzibar.” This exhibition will showcase 13 centuries of history through nearly 250 pieces of heritage and contemporary art, from public and private collections from Morocco, Africa, and Europe. The exhibition will display art, archeology, architecture, and works of ethnography.  The event is due to take place in the Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Bab El Kebir Gallery, and Bab Rouah Gallery. The exhibition aims first to explore the different methods with which African countries were first introduced to Islam. Islam reached Southern Saharan countries in the 8th century, first through trade networks in the east and west, then through the major pilgrimage routes. Second, it intends to highlight the wealth of religious practices across the African continent. Sufi brotherhoods were prevalent in the 18th-19th centuries, influencing African Islam today. Finally, the exhibition invites visitors to a sensory experience highlighting the spread of know-how across the continent. It will unveil the stylistic and technical peculiarities that contributed to the influence of Southern Saharan populations. A previous version of the exhibition was held in May 2017 in Paris. King Mohammed VI and François Hollande, the then French President, visited the exhibition held at the Institute of the Arab World (IMA) in Paris.

Rabat – Abdelfettah Karmane, a Moroccan artist born in Sidi Slimane, has won the French “Mondial Art Academy” prize for the third time, having also won the prize in 2016 and 2018. His winning piece this year is a watercolor entitled “Nature morte aux citrons” (Dead nature with lemons). The painting is in the hyper-realistic surrealism style that Karmane has become synonymous with. Karmane, who exhibited his work for the first time at just 14 in his hometown, has since become a prominent figure in Moroccan art. The artist is a graduate of the School of Plastic Arts in Rabat. Combining his modern education from the Rabat school and the Moroccan touch and inspiration he started with back in his hometown, Karmane’s work has received international acclaim, with his work being exhibited in France, Portugal, Italy, and Russia. Even as his paintings gain international attention, they still maintain their distinctive Moroccan flair. “While these paintings have a very distinct voice, the trace of Karmane’s origins remain obvious,” said Mondial Art Academy on its website. “Architectural and decorative motifs are drawn from the Moroccan tradition and ensure the compositions a frank local tone.”

Rabat – Police in Bilbao, Spain, arrested on Friday, August 2, six men of Maghrebi origin involved in the alleged rape of an 18-year-old girl. Spanish news outlet El Pais reported that the six suspects, aged between 18 and 36, are all of Maghrebi descent. The victim told a hospital staff member that she was raped by a group of  men at the Etxebarria park. A close source to the investigation later told El Pais that the suspects are from the Maghreb region. The suspects are now being detained at the Ertzaintza offices in Bilbao, which takes the proceedings before they go to court. Detainees remain in custody, as authorities wait for the conclusions of the ongoing investigations to determine the circumstances of the incident and take corresponding measures regarding the suspects. In a tweet on August 2, mayor of Bilbao,  Juan Mari Aburto, expressed his anger over the rape incident. He asked the court to not ease on violent crimes. Meanwhile, El Pais did not specify which Maghreb countries the suspects are from. Spanish news outlet El Espanol reported, for its part, that the suspects are from Morocco and Algeria.  “The girl managed to get to Basurto Hospital, where she introduced herself with wounds. The police did not find the alleged rapists until 5 in the morning,” El Espanol noted. The incident is not the first of its kind in Bilbao. In June, El Espanol reported the arrest of three suspects, including two Moroccans, involved in the rape of a 17-year old girl.

Rabat – Morocco’s Human Rights Council (CNDH) has issued new decisions in favor of hundreds of victims of serious human rights violations between 1956 and 1999.  In a statement on Sunday, August 4, CNDH said the decision is consistent with King Mohammed VI’ instructions  that reports and accusations of severe human rights abuses be adequately addressed.  While the time frame of the decision explicit mentioned 1956 and 1999, which was before King Mohammed VI’s ascension to the throne, CNDH promised it would continue the work for the following years to give Morocco a clean record on human rights. . Also concerned with the measures, according to the statement, are victims of Polisario’s kidnappings.  CNDH said in its statement that 624  people will benefit of the compensation operation among whom 80 people who were the subject of serious crimes and human rights abuses  by the Polisario Front. The statement added the CNDH has allocated mobilized nearly  MAD 87 million to compensate victims of human rights abuses.  CNDH said that the new procedure is in accordance with the standards and criteria of the Final Report of the Equity and Reconciliation Commission (IER). “On January 6, 2006 his majesty King Mohammed VI tasked the Consultative Council, the now-National Council for Human Rights, to follow up the implementation of the recommendations of the Equity and Reconciliation commission, including those relating to reparation, financial compensation, social inclusion, administrative and financial adjustment, and health coverage,” the statement recalled. The Polisario Front has long been linked to kidnapping accusations. On August 4, 2003, NGO  France Libèrtés issued a report on  conditions of detentions of Moroccan prisoners held in Polisario’s prisons since between 1975 and 2003. The 52-page report documents the serious violations of human rights that the Polisario inflicted on Moroccan war prisoners. “Until the 1980s, the guards would whip the prisoners with electric cables when they were being too slow, or just to terrorize them. They were constantly beaten and humiliated,” reads the report.In November 2003, the Polisario released 300 Moroccan prisoners of war and in August 2005 it released the 404 Moroccan prisoners of war following a UN mediation. Most of Moroccan prisoners had been held in horrendous conditions for over two decades.  A report conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Committee (OLAF) between 2003 and 2005 but released only in 2015 shows that Polisario subjected Moroccan prisoners of war to forced labor. According to the findings of the report, Moroccan prisoners of war participated in building the bulk of infrastructure in the Tindouf camps, which was funded by international donors.  In addition to inflicting unbearable and reprehensible human rights abuses on Moroccan prisoners of war, the Polisario used them as free labor in their large-scale embezzlement of humanitarian assistance destined for the Tindouf camps.

Rabat – Millennium Challenge Account-Morocco Agency (MCA Morocco) and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) have announced the launching of a joint $73 million initiative to increase youth employability. Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and the Vice President of MCC, Anthony Welcher, signed a memorandum of understanding on Friday, August 2, in Rabat for 15 new projects to be put in place to create and renovate vocational training centers. The 15 new projects will be funded by the $73 million “Fonds Charaka” initiative. The initiative consists of two parts. The first one, “Fonzid,” will “support private or public initiatives that create investment opportunities and involve the private sector and civil society in the development and management of industrial zones.” The focus of Fonzid is on “innovative, cost-effective, inclusive and sustainable projects that integrate social and gender aspects and respect MCC’s environmental, social and gender policies.” The second part of the project, “Charaka,” focuses on vocational training. Charaka is “dedicated to financing the creation or expansion of vocational training centers managed under public-private partnerships,” says MCA Morocco. The 15 new projects announced on Friday fall under the Charaka part of the initiative. 9 new vocational training centers will be created and 6 existing centers will be renovated. The vocational centers focus on a wide range of sectors, including agriculture, tourism, industry, crafts, construction, transport, logistics, and health. These centers, which will host and train nearly 8,400 trainees annually, will be located across six regions: 5 of the projects will be in the Casablanca-Settat Region, 4 in the Fes-Meknes Region, 3 in the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima Region, and lastly the Eastern Region, the Beni Mellal-Khénifra Region, and the Draa-Tafilalet Region, will be home to 3 of the projects.

Rabat – An important US congressional delegation is expected to visit Morocco today. The visit is part of the visibly increasing push to cement the old, “strategic” bilateral ties between Washington and Rabat. The delegation, which is headed by Democrat Representative Frank Joseph Pallone, will stay in Morocco for three days during which they are expected to hold meetings with high-ranking Moroccan officials to discuss ways of strengthening the relationship between the two countries, Moroccan outlet Le 360 reported yesterday. While the visit comes as a further illustration of the profound bilateral ties between the two countries, its main motive has to do with “bolstering legislative and economic cooperation,” the Moroccan paper quoted sources who have been briefed on the matter. Even as the Trump administration still does not have an ambassador in Morocco, Rabat and Washington have remained close allies under President Trump. Earlier this week, while congratulating Morocco’s King Mohammed VI on his twentieth year as monarch, President Trump said that Morocco and the US should continue working together to “accomplish a lot” on a wide-range of issues of shared interests. Trump also spoke of the need to boost, and perhaps honor, “the cultural link between our countries as a testimony of our friendship for more than 240 years.” The congressional visit comes days after news emerged of a second visit to Morocco by Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and Senior Advisor. Kushner is also the mastermind of President Trump’s infamous, exceedingly pro-Israel “Deal of the century” for the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Kushner’s second visit, like the first one three months ago, was reportedly an attempt to get Morocco’s support for President Trump’s controversial deal for Palestine. While the congressional delegation’s visit’s talking points are said to be essentially about boosting the Morocco-US commercial and institutional exchanges, the timing, as well as the visible influx of positive comments from Washington may arise suspicions in some quarters about any links with the push to get Morocco on board with the US on the Palestinian question. For now, though, Rabat has been clear about its stance on Palestine. Amid rumors recently that Rabat was considering a change of heart on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Moroccan government rebutted by saying that its close relationship with Washington, as well as its strong desire to remain a reliable US partner, would never get in the way of its “constant support for the Palestinian cause.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Culture has launched the second phase of drilling archeological excavations at “Dar El Baroud,” an ancient pottery district in Sale, not far from the capital Rabat. The excavations have revealed “the major importance of the site in terms of history, archeology, and art,” said the ministry in a statement. The archeological works have uncovered a complete artisanal district dedicated to the pottery dating from the 12th to the 14th century. The site includes 40 pottery ovens, several artisan workshops, and various types of ceramics. The work on the site and artifacts found significantly boost scientific research on Islamic archeology and ceramics both in Morocco and in the wider Islamic West, according to the statement. As a result, the ministry is working on setting up a center dedicated to the site, in order to promote Sale’s history and heritage.

Rabat – In Europe and North America, the long standing culture of animal companionship has produced laws on breeding, buying, selling, and adopting pets. This culture is still new in Morocco, which leaves most of the country’s pet sales unregulated.   Although the kingdom has its fair share of legitimate pet stores, most purchased pets are acquired through informal pathways.  There are souks throughout the country where shoppers can find almost any animal. Fish, turtles, mice, birds, snakes, skunks, squirrels, and ferrets are available in these unofficial pet plazas. And, of course, the quintessential purebred dogs. In a city overflowing with scorned strays, the throngs of people gushing over the pricey purebred puppies in Casablanca’s Souk Laayoune is an interesting sight indeed.    Perhaps even more interesting is the digital side of Morocco’s purebred marketplace–the Facebook marketplace, that is.  It’s technically prohibited to sell animals on Facebook, but the social media platform hosts a great deal of Morocco’s purebred dog sales.  Morocco’s most popular dog breeds are the Siberian Husky and the Alaskan Malamute. There are several Facebook groups created with the specific purpose of buying, selling, and breeding these dogs.  In addition to buying and selling puppies, members of these groups can also find a mate to breed their adult dogs. The two dog owners–some of whom are children–then collaborate to sell the puppies and share the profits. On average, about 20 dogs are listed for sale daily in these types of groups, including at least two new litters of puppies. However, most advertised dogs are between six months and one year old.  Why are people reselling their dogs? The amount of young adult dogs listed for sale may be surprising, but there are a variety of reasons people may look to rehome their Huskies. Allergies, moving, or a lack of financial resources are perfectly sound reasons to rehome a pet. What seems more common, however, is unpreparedness.  For *Ayoub, 30, having a dog is like having a business. He paid MAD 3000 for his adult Husky and later sold him for double the price.  The police officer bought the dog on a whim from a coworker who could no longer afford to keep it. He had no idea what he was getting into, but said he was excited to have a cute dog to show off. He never researched the specific needs of Siberian Huskies.    Ayoub still lives with his parents, who did not like the Husky at all. Because he was unsterilized, the dog frequently marked his territory with urine, and Ayoub’s mother was constantly cleaning up after him.  The dog, named Rocco, was never allowed inside the apartment. Ayoub, who works 14 hours a day, kept Rocco in a small room on the roof of the building, where he constantly howled.  After six months, Ayoub was fed up with him.  Despite only feeding Rocco rice and never taking him to a vet, Ayoub claimed he could no longer afford to keep him. In reality, his neighbors had been complaining about the dog’s nightly howling, and he, too, was getting annoyed with Rocco’s behavior. Ayoub sold the dog on Facebook for MAD 6000. The dangers of unauthorized pet sales Buying a pet off the street or from the souk comes with its fair share of risks. The animal could be sick, carrying diseases, malnourished, anti-social, or aggressive. Buying a pet online also has these risks–in addition to potential danger.   “Beware of those who put animals up for adoption,” one 24-year-old woman warned in a Facebook post.  She had agreed to adopt a German Shepherd from a man in Casablanca and planned to meet him near Acima, a large supermarket. He did not arrive at the scheduled meeting time, but since she had traveled all the way from Sale, she decided to wait. Around 9:30 pm, when the area was nearly empty, he finally messaged her on WhatsApp and told her that he was just across the street.  Before crossing to meet him, she excitedly looked around for her new furry companion. “I noticed two guys on a motorcycle. One of them was texting at the same time I was talking to this person, and he was even looking in the direction of Acima as if to look for someone,” she wrote.  She quickly realized that there was no dog with these men who were waiting for her. She ran and filed a complaint, and the man did not contact her again.  Online pet sales are not inherently dangerous, but without any third-party monitoring and regulation, these endeavors can be risky, especially to vulnerable populations such as women and children. Unverifiable profiles and photos put both buyers and sellers at risk–especially amid an ongoing crisis of purebred theft. Morocco’s rooftop breeders Breeding Business defines backyard breeding as “an unethical and amateur form of dog breeding generally performed at home with limited skill or training. A backyard breeder is a breeder in which profits gained from breeding are the main objective. Often done at the expense of the dog’s health, hygiene, and care.” In Morocco, this practice occurs on rooftops.  *Anas is one of Morocco’s many rooftop breeders. He breeds his female Siberian Husky with his friend’s male Malamute, and advertises the puppies in various Facebook groups. The two friends split the profits. He keeps the puppies in a cage with their mother on the roof of his apartment building. At just five weeks old, he claims they are ready to be weaned and moved to new homes. His prices are MAD 1600 for female puppies and MAD 1800 for male puppies. One prospective buyer expressed his interest in the puppies, but explained that he was inexperienced in handling dogs.  “You should have a balcony where you can keep it,” Anas advised. “If you’re working the whole day, just leave a box where it can poop and pee.” The buyer hesitated. “I’m not sure if I know how to take care of it,” he said. “They’re really cute,” Anas responded, offering no more words of wisdom.  According to the American Kennel Club, responsible breeders sell puppies when they are between seven and twelve weeks old to ensure they are properly weaned, socialized, and healthy.  A responsible breeder “is also likely to ask questions of you and what kind of puppy you are looking for, what environment you live in, and other questions to help decide that you will be a responsible pet owner,” writes one expert on an informational website for Husky owners.  “Beware of any breeder that encourages you to rush your decision without checking you out.” Solutions Introducing laws on dog breeding would significantly increase the living conditions of purebreds in Morocco, if they are adhered to.   Such regulations include requiring breeders to have a government-issued license to breed and outlining satisfactory living conditions for the dogs being born and bred.  Successfully implementing and enforcing these measures, among others, would reduce incentives for backyard breeding and push irresponsible breeders out of the market.  Responsible breeding will also increase the value of puppies. This will limit the pool of buyers to those who are serious about raising and caring for a dog, and have the resources needed to effectively do so.  Contrary to popular opinion, the issue of animal welfare in Morocco not limited to the country’s strays–the unregulated sale of companion animals must also be seriously addressed.  Morocco is struggling to adjust to its emergent culture of dog ownership. Most living spaces are not made to accommodate large dogs, food is expensive, sick and injured pets are routinely abandoned by owners who can’t afford veterinary care, and there is a general ignorance of the time and resources needed to properly care for dogs.  Animal welfare laws are a step in the right direction, but laws don’t always inspire social change—or ameliorate the economic pitfalls that limit the proper care of animals. Education is the key here: until more Moroccans become acquainted with the inherent rights and needs of all animals, many strays and pets will be deprived of the lives they deserve.    *Names have been changed for confidentiality.

Rabat – Gun safety is set to remain one of the major concerns in the US. Early on Sunday morning, an armed man killed nine people and injured at least 16 people in Dayton, Ohio.  The police later said that responding officers shot and killed the armed suspect. According to CNN, the shooting took place around 1 a.m. outside on East 5th Street in the city’s Oregon district. Security services believe that the suspect acted alone. FBI is helping with the investigation. The CNN report said that the motive of the crime was “not immediately clear.” The incident took place hours  after another gunman killed 24 people at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas. El Paso Mayor Dee Margo told CNN that it was a “tragedy that i’m having a hard time getting my arms around.” Images of the suspect have gone viral, showing him wearing glasses and a dark t-shirt. The man was holding a rifle. US President Donald Trump tweeted that the reports of the incident in El Paso were “very bad, many killed.”  “God be with you all!” the president added. Throughout the years, the US has suffered multiple mass shootings. Last weekend, a 19 year old opened fire at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in California, killing four people, while at least 11 were injured. The gunman used a rifle. According to ABC News, there have been at least 16 mass shootings in 2019 in the US, and the first 10 took place through May. The report tellingly noted that there have been more mass shootings in the first five months of 2019 than the same period in 2018. Trump’s gun control policy is sparking controversy across the world. The Washington Post estimated in 2015  that there were 357 million firearms in the US in 2013, meaning the country hosted “40 million more guns than people.”

Rabat – The Moroccan Government rejected a parliamentary proposal calling for the teaching of Moroccan ministers’ children in public schools, according to Hespress. The Confederation of Democratic Labor (CDT) submitted the motion during the voting session on the new education framework law on August 2. The proposal calls on “Moroccan officials, especially members of the government, parliament, and directors of public institutions to register their children for compulsory public education.” According to the CDT, the proposal aimed to restore people’s confidence in public schools.  However, the Minister of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education and Scientific Research, Said Amzazi, rejected this proposal without justification. The Government also rejected all the proposals made by the Confederation. It is expected that the draft law will be issued in the Official Bulletin within the next few days. Amzazi said in a speech that the new education law “constitutes the first framework-law in the history of Moroccan legislation in the field of education and training and scientific research.” “It will enable our country to have a legislative reference which guarantees the sustainability of the education system reform,” added Amzazi. The Minister reaffirmed the state’s guarantee of free public education, adding that the State is committed through this law to create a special fund to finance the education system and improve its quality.

Rabat – The union affiliated with the Moroccan Union of Labor (UMT) announced a two-day strike on August 8 and 9 in protest the dissatisfaction of the workers. The union was calling for a dialogue on increasing salaries and the payment of garbage workers’ salaries and bonuses. The strike decision comes after the signing of new contracts for garbage management with Averda and Derichebourg companies. To make their voices heard, garbage workers in Casablanca have decided to observe a two-day strike and threatened to let the city drown in garbage during Eid Al Adha (August 12). The period of Eid Al Adha requires greater mobilization in waste management operations. Families across Morocco sacrifice cattle in remembrance of Prophet Muhammad’s Sunnah. The resulting waste of entrails, skin, and blood, mean cities are in serious need of fast garbage disposal. In a statement, the union says it refuses to enter into any dialogue until the city council, the mayor of Casablanca, and the Averda and Derichebourg companies meet their demands.

Rabat – The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) has joined the chorus of voices requesting fundamental changes in Morocco’s labor legislation. In an email dated August 1, sent to to the Moroccan employment ministry, AFL-CIO urged the North African country to reconsider its current labor law project as it “constitutes a violation of the most fundamental and constitutional rights.” The emailed letter, which was signed by Cathy Feingold, AFL-CIO’s International Director, and a copy of which Morocco World News received, directly addressed Mohamed Yatim, Morocco’s Minister of Employment and Vocational Training. “I am writing to express our deep concern regarding the propagation of the draft national legislation regarding the right to strike which has been presented to the parliament of Morocco,” starts the letter. The text of the draft on the right to strike was, according to the American trade union, presented to the Moroccan parliament without inclusive dialogue with all major Moroccan stakeholders in the labor sector, especially trade and labor unions. For AFL-CIO, the fact that the draft was introduced to parliament “without prior tripartite negotiations” is “a violation of the most fundamental and constitutional rights.” While Moroccan law recognizes the right to strike, AFL-CIO feels that the country’s legislation on the matter—both existing laws and the draft law being considered at the parliament—falls short on some essential aspects of workers’ rights. “The right to strike is one of the most significant elements of the right of freedom of association and is a means to ensure that the working class can defend their moral and economic rights,” the email pointed out. In Morocco, however, AFL-CIO email went on to suggest, workers and trade or labor organizations are denied basic rights, including the protection of “the right to organize and bargain collectively,” which Morocco ratified as part of the International Labor Organization’s Convention 98. An essential part of AFL-CIO’s frustration with the Moroccan legislation on strike is the criminalization by the Moroccan law of some forms of workers’ strike. “The kingdom of Morocco has not yet abrogated Article 288 of the Criminal Code, which imposes grave penalties, including imprisonment, upon any person who attempts to his/her legal right to organize any form of industrial action.” In light of its complaints, AFL-CIO urged Morocco, among other things, to “withdraw the draft legislation from the parliament,” “amend its national legislation to reflect ILO conventions,” allow for more inclusive social dialogue with trade unions, and “respect trade unions’ rights and freedoms” by upholding international labor standards. The email comes after domestic actors lambasted the legislation project which the government introduced to the parliament in April of this year. Morocco’s Democratic Confederation of Labor (CDT), one of the country’s most prominent trade unions, has been poignantly critical of the government-sponsored draft law on the right to strike. Long before AFL-CIO, CDT has relentlessly been calling on the government to withdraw its project and initiate a more inclusive dialogue with all trade unions to ensure a more comprehensive reflection on amending Morocco’s labor law. “We reject the form and continent of this text, as well as the approach the government used when drafting it,” a CDT spokesperson said recently. That spokesperson, like a number of other critics, argued that the project is a reflection of how the Moroccan government stifles inclusive social dialogue to have its own way around vital issues.

Rabat – I followed with great interest the reactions raised by one of my answers during a press interview on July 22, 2019.  Upon analyzing some of these reactions, I realized that what I said was stripped of its context. The debate was imbued with political tensions and confusion, and the question of “who is a political detainee” in all its complexities was consequently swept under the rug. It is a nearly existential question that every country must answer at least once in its history. So, recalling the National Council for Human Rights’ (CNDH) approach based on interaction, openness, and transparency, and which the council has always used with victims and actors,  and based on the council’s role in contributing to intellectual debate and public awareness of human rights issues, I will try to reorient the debate to focus on its original subject, hoping that we all come to a common understanding of “political detention.” I will try to be precise and concise and make a contribution embedded in the Moroccan context. This contribution is not – in any way – a legal document, but perhaps just a preamble to collective thinking on a subject in which legal, political, and philosophical considerations are intertwined and overlapping. Notes and Definitions: It should be noted, first of all, that very few media outlets have actually noticed that there is no agreed-upon definition of the term “political detainee”. According to Amnesty International, a political detainee is “a person detained for political reasons, i.e. for opposing, with or without violence, their home country’s authority (whether or not the State to which they belong is internationally recognized). This category, according to Amnesty International, includes: We can note that this definition includes both someone who has exercised their right to expression and someone who committed a crime such as assassinations for political purposes. It, therefore, combines two distinctly different categories. It is unacceptable to confuse a peaceful protester with an individual accused of murder even if the motives of the latter are “noble.” This confusion opens the door to manipulation and ambiguity due to the connotation of the term “political detainee”. The term gives the impression that significant arbitrary injustice was committed for the purpose of revenge against an innocent person who merely practiced their basic rights. Therefore, many Amnesty International branches do not refer to this definition when they describe cases of detainees who have committed acts which may be considered crimes.  The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe considers that a “political prisoner” is a person deprived of their individual liberty, provided that they meet at least one of the following criteria:  (A) if the detention breaches one of the fundamental guarantees set forth in the European Convention on Human Rights and its Protocols, in particular, freedom of thought, conscience, religion, expression, press, and freedom of assembly and creation of associations;  (B) If the arrest is for political reasons and has nothing to do with any violation of the law,  (C) If the duration or circumstances of the detention, for political reasons, are clearly disproportionate to the offense for which the person or the accused was convicted; (D) If, for political reasons, the person concerned is detained in circumstances that constitute discrimination against them compared to other persons; or (E) If the detention is the result of a clearly flawed procedure, which appears to be due to the authorities’ political motives. This concise but also practical definition is closely related to several topics in the human rights context, particularly arbitrary detention, fair trial conditions, and guarantees of fundamental rights.  Although it is limited to fundamental rights as provided for in the European Convention on Human Rights, it remains useful nonetheless. It is clear that this definition – if it applied to the Moroccan context in the past – does not currently do so. These definitions, however, refer to the basic concept of “political motive” to define a “political detainee”. The “political motive” concept is much more difficult to define than the concept of “political detainee”. In this contribution, I will use the term “political motive” according to a definition which I consider broad and flexible so as not to limit the debate. The definition is as follows: “an act has political motives if it can be ascertained, without a doubt, that it was done to serve the interests of a “political party “.  I, therefore, consider that the concept of “political motive” is a prerequisite for talking about “political detention.” There is only a fine but crucial line between the two. It is possible that a “political motive” was behind the arrests during the events of Al Hoceima or Jerada. A number of human rights defenders considered the possibility, but it cannot be undeniably proven. It is also unfair to not question the matter given the duration and circumstances of the demonstrations. I will not decide now on this matter, which, in all cases, comes second after the question of violence.  The question of violence and international law The complexities of the events of Al Hoceima and Jerada stem from the fact that the use of violence dominates any other descriptions based on “political motive or motives.” But before diving into the matter, it must be emphasized that there is no room here to talk or debate over legitimacy vs. illegitimacy, or violence vs. peaceful demonstration because CNDH has already issued a memorandum calling for the abolition of any penalty against participants in undeclared peaceful protests. On July 12, 2019, the Council also called for allowing new forms of public expression which has taken social networks as a platform. The Council did not address the issues of violent demonstrations, because in such cases, considerations other than the rights of expression, creation of associations […] and protest raise to the surface. I share the prevailing view which affirms that committing acts of violence prevails over and exceeds the concept of “political motive” for carrying out arrests. Once a demonstration can be described as “violent “, the idea of “political motives” is no longer valid and becomes secondary, except in cases of self-defense or necessity, and the same applies to forms of violence committed in the context of hate crimes or incitement to violence.  Any use of violence strips the person of the title of “political prisoner” and leads to judicial proceedings. This legal requirement is recognized and universal, and constitutes a general element of the sovereignty of the State of law. National Human Rights Council Framework In this context, it is necessary to recall that CNDH is a national constitutional institution with three basic functions: the prevention of violations, and the protection and promotion of human rights. Therefore, the Council must constantly seek precision in assessing cases of human rights violations in our country, be it proven violations or mere allegations, in the light of not only legal, but also humane and moral responsibility. Additionally, the development of an effective and successful advocacy and victim support strategy deserves particular attention in terms of describing any violation. With regard to the events of Al Hoceima and Jerada, the Council has observed and followed, within its mandate, the demonstrations and protests for several weeks. If the youths who were arrested during these events met the above-mentioned criteria for the title of “political detainee”, the determinants of the Council’s work would have been clearer; its work even easier. The Council’s president would have clearly and unhesitatingly called for the immediate release and compensation of the detainees in accordance with Chapter 23 of the Constitution and Article 9 (5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, instead of seeking amnesty for them, (Article 58 of the Constitution). Since these criteria were not met, the use of the term “political detainee” by CNDH would have been, in this case, misplaced, counterproductive, and irresponsible, and would have been a precedent and an exception at the national and international level.  How can these young people be described, if they are not “political detainees”? Personally, I consider them victims of a faltering and flawed measure, which could neither guarantee a decent living and economic and social rights of citizens, nor respond to their legitimate demands. This faltering, which I described on July 12, 2019 as a “performance crisis” caused a real “trust crisis”. Therefore, I called for the establishment of a new sociopolitical charter as the only way out of the crisis facing our institutions. The charter would be based on a participatory approach which can take into account the social and cultural characteristics of each region in its historical dimensions. Its purpose would be to establish a regional structure which meets the national expectations of citizens and which is based on a human rights approach. This human rights approach would take into consideration the national and international human rights obligations of our country. All of my many meetings with the families of the detainees included a basic requirement expressed by every mother, every father, every sister, and every wife: “Release the youths”! The exceptional and tragic circumstances of the events that led to the arrest of these young people and the difficult humanitarian circumstances of the families have mobilized the entire nation behind them. Therefore, CNDH will continue to support them by listening to them, expressing empathy, showing appreciation, consideration, and the commitment and dedication in the Council’s duty. After all the anger, after following emotions, after listening, today, it is time to think. CNDH will, therefore, continue to hold discussions and exchange opinions with different society actors to agree on the concepts that have been raised, but also on the political, economic, social, cultural, and legal consequences of what has happened. In addition, the Rabat – Driss Benzekri – Human Rights Institute will study the issue of “political detention” in cooperation with national and international experts. The report, which will be published by CNDH after being discussed during its General Assembly, which is only a few days after the inauguration of its members, will focus on the conditions of arrests and trials, as well as allegations of torture and ill-treatment. It will also be an opportunity to fully assess these tragic events, which will remain in our country’s memory and which have divided Moroccans and left profound traces in our collective memory.  It is time to address all these effects. CNDH intends to carry out this work by exercising its full powers and defending its independence. What remains certain is that the Council will never betray the trust of the victims, their families, and all Moroccans.

Rabat – The House of Councilors, the 120-member upper house of Morocco’s parliament, has approved the newly adopted Draft Law 51.17, definitely putting to rest nationwide debates about the implications of that law for the future of Moroccan education. The draft law has widely been opposed in Moroccan conservative circles. One MP of the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) resigned after Parliament adopted the bill. To most PDJ supporters, the bill feels like a dangerous deviation from the party’s traditional nationalist and Islamist foundational pillars. Critics of the bill, among them former Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane, feared that the adoption of French as the principal medium of instruction for scientific subjects at high school level, one of the bill’s major points, amounted to a cultural surrender to French culture and identity. Benkirane, a founding and well-respected member of Morocco’s ruling, Islamist PJD, even called on PJD MPs to boycott the law because, he said, it was contradictory to Moroccan culture and identity. According to education minister Said Amzazi, however, those who opposed the draft law have an incomplete, inaccurate understanding of what it really means for Morocco’s education system. Speaking yesterday after the House of Councilors green lighted the parliament’s lower house’s decision to adopt the bill in question, Amzazi said that social inclusiveness and socio-economic equity are some aspects of the law that have not been sufficiently mentioned in debates over its implications for the future of the Moroccan social and educational systems. Channeling King Mohammed VI’s Throne Day Speech, which called for a new impetus to complete the ongoing reforms and bring about “a new generation” of Moroccan public servants, the Moroccan minister said the law is consistent with the “royal vision” to modernize Morocco’s education, maximize pupils’ performance in foreign languages and policy decisions. This in turn, Amzazi stressed, will drive up Morocco’s competitiveness on the world stage. Inclusive education system, compulsory and free-of charge schooling for children aged 1 to 16, equal opportunities for all children, as well as socio-economic equity were some of the points Amzazi repeatedly relied on to show, according to him, how the newly passed law is key to achieving the new development model of which the King enthusiastically spoke in his Throne Day speech. He said the law includes positive discrimination for students from low-income, marginalized backgrounds, a reflection of the King’s insistence on policy reforms aimed at including and lifting Moroccans who still feel left behind or not concerned with the series of reforms that have so far punctuated the country’s political life. If Amzazi’s hearty, celebratory reception of the adoption of the controversial bill sounds like one of the most spirited defenses of a law which some Moroccans do not welcome, it is because the minister has been one of the most outspoken voices of the modernization, pro- Draft Law 51.17 camp. When the bill was being drafted and provoked uproarious opposition among conservative MPs and political pundits, Amzazi hit back in numerous public statements. He consistently said that embracing the fast-moving world of globalization benefits Morocco far more than conservatives’ call for keeping, or returning to, some essence of Moroccan identity. In a March interview with Moroccan outlet Challenge, he said that Morocco had to choose between remaining parochial and at the margins of global dynamics, or catching the train of globalization and scientific progress. The recently approved law, he suggested back then, represented a step in the right direction, one of educating future generations of Moroccans at ease with and equipped to navigate the world of scientific progress and technical inventions. “What exactly are we asking of our education system?” Amzazi asked. “Do we want to train our children in a vacuum in a model predefined for eternity and without regard for the changing world around, or do we rather want them to be equipped to be citizens of the world, capable of integrating themselves in competitive work settings, and having mastery over technological advances impacting all fields?”

Rabat – According to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), the 39-year-old Moroccan prisoner escaped at 1 pm. The German news outlet reports that he took advantage of an exit permit to climb the 5.50-meter high fence reinforced with two rolls of NATO wire at the top. FAZ reported that the police asked motorists to remain vigilant and warned against taking hitchhikers in the region. A helicopter was also mobilized during searches over Preungesheim. Police also gave a description of the fugitive to the public. The Moroccan national is described as a man of stout build wearing a red shirt and gray pants. He sustained an injury to the head while escaping. According to the German Ministry of Justice, quoted by FAZ, the man had been serving a sentence at the prison in Frankfurt-Preungesheim IV. The prison has a security level 2. The institution does not have a high-security wing and hosts prisoners who are due for release. The Ministry’s spokesman clarified that the inmate was not a violent offender.

Rabat – Despite the privileges awarded to me by my youth and middle-class family, traveling has never come easy to me.  While I’ve been fortunate enough to study abroad (and now live) in Morocco and visit various cities throughout the country, I must admit that most of the traveling I’ve done here has not been due to my own initiatives–I always had someone telling me where to go and what to do. To be frank, had I been here alone, I probably would have done next to nothing with my time. I won’t sugarcoat it: I’m very lazy and generally a difficult person to travel with. I hate sweating, crowds, loud noises, carrying heavy things, being looked at, and leaving the comfort of my own home. I know, I know. I’m a real catch.    My sweet fiancé, bless his heart, somehow managed to get me on a three-hour train ride from Rabat to Fes and a 40-minute bus ride from Fes to Sefrou, followed by a fifteen-minute walk from the bus stop to his family’s house.  Based on my pre-departure Google search results, I wasn’t expecting much from Sefrou. At most, I envisioned a small mountain town in the middle of nowhere speckled with dilapidated old buildings. Boy, was I wrong.  Everything I love about Morocco’s cities–the mountains of Chefchaouen, the medina of Fes, the artisans of Marrakech, the cool breezes of Rabat, the colors of Ouazzane, the gorgeous foliage of Ifrane, the warm hospitality of Errachidia–had been packaged up, tied with a bow, and presented to me in the form of Sefrou. “Little Jerusalem of Morocco” Unbeknownst to the average tourist and overshadowed by nearby Fes, Sefrou is actually a bastion of the country’s diverse heritage. Moroccan natives, of course, are generally more familiar with the city’s rich history. At the foot of the Middle Atlas mountains, Sefrou boasts the perfect site for agriculture and trade. Fertile soil nourished by rivers and springs produced an abundance of food, and the city’s strategic location made it a hub for traders traveling from the Mediterranean to the Sahara. Additionally, Sefrou was once home to one of Morocco’s largest Jewish communities.  It is estimated that the first Amazigh Jewish people in the area converted to Judaism 2,000 years ago, making Sefrou an ancient Jewish settlement. Although a portion of Sefrou’s Jewish community converted to Islam in the 8th century during the reign of Idris I, Jewish communities from the Tafilalt area and Southern Algeria migrated to Sefrou. In 1596, Jewish exiles from Spain settled in Sefrou as well.  By 1968, most of the descendants of Sefrou’s Jewish settlers emigrated to Israel and Europe. Once as high as 8,000, the exact number of Jewish people living in Sefrou today is unknown, although estimates are low.   The old Mellah, or Jewish quarter, still stands in Sefrou’s medina. It is distinguished by its low walls and reached by crossing a short bridge over Oued Aggai, which passes through the old medina. Today, this part of the city is mostly inhabited by Muslims.     Things to do in Sefrou  As travel blogger Vago Damitio put it, Sefrou is a city that “functions for its residents, not for tourists.”  In this regard, a day trip in the small city is a breath of fresh air.  Sefrou is best enjoyed through a professionally guided tour, but if you’re lucky enough to know a current or former resident, you hit the jackpot! Your experience in Sefrou will be even more fulfilling when hosted by one of the city’s natives.   If you’re looking for a place to relax off the beaten path, here are some things to do in Sefrou.  At the entrance of the city lies the Cave of the Believer, or Kef al Yahudi in Hebrew. This cave is supposedly the burial site of the Prophet Daniel, according to one Jewish tradition. Nearby is a desecrated cemetery where righteous Jews were once buried. There is not much to see or do here, but if you value Jewish traditions you will surely enjoy experiencing this piece of history. A taxi to the Mausoleum of Sidi Ali Bosrgin is worth your time. At the peak of a formidable hill, the mausoleum offers a beautiful panoramic view of the city. After a brief walk north, you’ll find yourself at an abandoned French military base. If you wander farther west, you may find the ancient fountain of Lalla Rekia. The healing water from this fountain can supposedly cure both psychological and physical ailments–although most people now just use it to hydrate.    The Cascades at the edge of town present a gathering place for Sefrou’s families. There is a shallow pool at the base of the waterfall, which feeds a deeper reservoir just a few meters away. Overlooking the water is a multi-level terrace with tables and umbrellas where you can snack on popcorn and fresh orange juice.          Further downstream, families picnic on the shady riverbank. You may also see groups of women sitting at the edge of the water, laughing, chatting, and making laakad–the silk buttons used for djellabas and kaftans. Nestled in a lush garden near Bab Imkam is Cafe Saqiya. The cafe itself does not offer anything extraordinary on the menu–the appeal is in the ambiance. The calming sounds of the Oued Aggai combined with a soft breeze and lush trees make this cafe the perfect place to unwind. Just across the water from Cafe Saqiya is a children’s park that doubles as a small zoo. Ducks, gray geese, and other waterfowl patrol the grounds while pigeons and doves watch over the playground from the roof of a long shed. In the shed are individual stalls containing various types of birds. As you venture into the medina, you’ll find it just as charming as that of Fes–and much easier to navigate. Relatively absent from the narrow streets of Sefrou’s medina are the working animals, motorcycles, and cars that disrupt foot traffic in places such as Rabat or Marrakech. You may also notice that the Sefrou medina is much cleaner than others, and the few stray cats and dogs wandering about appear happier and healthier than those in larger cities. At the center of the medina lies Huddadine Square. This is where you can find Sefrou’s famed artisans: “weavers, blacksmiths, button makers, plough makers, ironmongers, and tinsmiths” are all stationed here, writes Damitio. In the Mellah, you will note the unique Jewish architecture and cemetery, according to the Fez Guide travel website. The travel agency Morocco Off The Beaten Track will take you to the deserted school, orphanage, and synagogue of Em Habanim.   Last but certainly not least is Sefrou’s annual Cherry Festival. Every summer, foreign and domestic tourists alike flock to the city to witness the blossoming cherry trees and famed beauty pageant at one of Morocco’s oldest cultural festivals. Sefrou is widely known for this yearly event, which is recognized by UNESCO. The jewel of Morocco If you are traveling through Morocco in pursuit of some Orientalist fantasy, Sefrou is not the place for you. You will not find dancing monkeys, snake charmers, or magic carpets here.  Rather, Sefrou is a lovely family-friendly place that demands relaxation–quite the opposite of Morocco’s typical tourist hubs. Some residents claim that the air itself makes the food taste better and induces a calm sleepiness. I don’t know if this is backed by science, but I have personally never felt more at peace than I did in Sefrou. I’m so grateful that my fiancé brought me to his family’s beautiful home, and I can’t wait for my next visit.

Rabat – As the world’s population increases, countries are facing growing environmental challenges. A big issue is “waste,” and what to do with all of the unwanted products that are being generated by human consumption. Plastic, paper, food, metal, everything, where does it all go? The World Bank expects humans to generate a staggering 3.4 billion tons of waste annually by 2050. This would represent an increase of 70% since 2016.  Morocco is one of the lowest producers of solid waste in the Middle East and North Africa regions, at 550 grams of waste per person per day in 2016. However, with a population of over 35 million people, the waste still adds up to millions of tons a day. Once Morocco’s waste is collected, where does it all go? Right now, to open dumps, landfills and most recently, under a new government initiative, to “valorization centers.” These modified landfills capture methane that comes from the fermentation of the waste, and burn it to produce heat. Once this is done, the leftover waste is buried. The concept of a national-scale waste sorting and recycling is still in its infancy. According to a report published by the Moroccan Ministry for Mines and Sustainable Development, in 2015 only 6% of Morocco’s recyclable waste was actually recycled. This means that, by and large, most of Morocco’s waste ends up in landfill. Morocco’s most infamous landfill, the Mediouna landfill, is on the outskirts of Casablanca. Covering an area of over 70 hectares, it receives 1.2 million tons of waste per year. The toxic fumes waft over to neighboring suburbs, poisoning the air and forcing some people to relocate. For Reda Kabbaj, Mediouna landfill raises urgent questions. Born and raised in Agadir in southern Morocco, Kabbaj is currently an associate partner at MINA Connect, a management and consulting firm based in Pennsylvania, USA. The firm provides project management services and operational support for projects in the areas of water, environment and renewable energy, with a particular focus on African initiatives. Kabbaj is interested in waste management solutions. “Casablanca just throws its waste into the Mediouna landfill. And now the landfill is facing big issues. It’s going to arrive at 99% saturation,” he warns. “Casablanca is a fast growing city. Landfill is just not suitable for this city anymore.” Landfills like Mediouna can’t be filled up indefinitely and space around cities for more landfills is limited. So Kabbaj has been thinking about alternatives. He believes the future of Morocco’s waste treatment strategy lies in “waste-to-energy” technology. He wants Morocco’s major cities to stop filling up landfills and to instead build “waste-to-energy” plants.  Waste-to-energy plants use combustion technology to burn waste in order to generate steam, electricity, and hot water. Hundreds of these plants already exist around the world, transforming waste from major cities across Europe, Asia, the US, and most recently Africa, into energy. “Other big cities do their treatment through “waste-to-energy plants” because they have a lot of advantages. For example, the plants save on land. A plant only uses four to eight hectares of land, unlike the 100 hectares required for landfill. Also, it treats the waste using the best technology in the world, reducing its volume by up to 90%,” he explains. What about carbon emissions? Kabbaj says the technology is clean, and plants are subject to strict emission regulations. In August last year, Ethiopia opened Africa’s first waste-to-energy plant on the outskirts of the capital Addis Ababa. The “Reppie waste-to-energy facility” is built on the Koshe landfill site, which was previously a sprawling open air dump, covering an area approximately the size of 36 football pitches. The $118 million plant was built through a public-private partnership between Ethiopian Electric Power and a foreign consortium made up of China National Electric Engineering Company (CNEEC), Cambridge Industries Limited from Singapore, and Ramboll, a Danish engineering firm. The plant ceased operations shortly after its inauguration because of a contractual dispute, but some news sources reported in April that Ethiopia Electric Power “is planning to restart operations.” The plant is designed to incinerate 1400 tons of waste a day, and when it eventually operates, it will do so within the CO2 emission limits of the European Union. “[Ethiopians] show us the way that we Africans need to act,” says Kabbaj. He believes Morocco is a prime-candidate for Africa’s second waste-to-energy plant. He makes it sound like it is only a matter of time before the technology comes to Morocco. A few things do stand in the way though, he adds. The government will need to make some changes to Morocco’s legal framework, Kabbaj explains. The public-private-partnership law does not currently allow Moroccan municipalities to enter into these types of public-private contracts. Given municipalities are in charge of waste management, the law will need to be amended so that they can sign these types of contracts, he says. Then it will be about convincing all the relevant stakeholders about the idea. “I do remember the first day I introduced the technology in 2016 after the COP22 [international climate change conference] to the main stakeholders and municipalities. I was told it could not be done because the calorific value of Moroccan waste is so low due to high content of organics and it would be too expensive,” Kabbaj explains. He then explains that his feasibility studies eventually showed decision-makers that the technology was actually a reliable solution.  “Based on my experience, people working in the ministries realize [waste-to-energy] is the best option, but the challenge is that there are a lot of stakeholders who all need to be convinced,” he says. “It’s going to take time.” Funding is also an issue. One small plant costs on average $120 million. But according to Kabbaj, there are plenty of private companies interested in this type of venture: “the method is to partner with someone who has the expertise to build a waste-management plant.” Kabbaj’s opinion is clear. According to him, Morocco is ready for waste-to-energy technology. But for the moment a waste-to-energy facility is not on the Moroccan government agenda. If Kabbaj keeps advocating for this solution, maybe it will be soon?

Rabat – At 1:41 pm on June 19, a Facebook user shared a desperate plea in an adoption group for cats and dogs in Rabat.  “I need your help to find my three-month-old Husky. Last night my brother got mugged around 11 pm at the corniche of Hay el Fath, Rabat, and they took the dog from him,” he wrote.  Several users commented on the post expressing their sympathy and support for the original poster, but others were critical. One commenter even found the situation amusing.  “I thought if you have a dog with you, you have nothing to fear,” she remarked sarcastically. “You raised it without teaching him how to fight or defend himself? That’s a pity. Stop raising cute and friendly dogs here because they can’t survive in Morocco.”  “She’s three months old and my brother was assaulted with a knife by two people,” the original poster replied. “I don’t see what’s funny in this story?” “This is the problem with Huskies,” another user chimed in. “If she was a German Shepherd, Malinois, or one of the other violent breeds they wouldn’t take her.” “I hope you can find her, and I hope after this experience you’ll be more careful,” he continued. “Always raise and teach your dogs to attack.” This single post offers a glimpse at larger issue within Morocco’s emergent culture of pet ownership: the theft of purebred dogs.  As the demand for purebred dogs skyrockets, opportunistic criminals are taking advantage of the new market.  Some people speculate that a mafia of pet thieves is taking root in Rabat, and that this single network of criminals is responsible for pet heists from Harhoura to Kenitra. Although this theory remains unverified, dogs and cats are strategically stolen from hands and homes every day.  Friendly dogs that are unbothered by strangers may seem the most susceptible to theft, but all dog breeds can be victims of this crime. As long as the dog is purebred, a dedicated thief will try to find a way to steal it.  Small dogs such as Shih Tzus, Yorkshire Terriers, and Bichons are popular pets in Morocco, making them a target for thieves–especially since they are easily picked up and transported. Although small dogs are much easier to steal, Huskies, Malamutes, and German Shepherds earn a higher profit given their unofficial status as Morocco’s most popular breeds.  Rottweilers and Malinois are also targets, despite their reputation as aggressive guard dogs.  Dogs are stolen both violently and covertly. Thieves may stalk and attack lone dog walkers, scan the yards of wealthy neighborhoods for an unaccompanied pet, or entice a friendly dog running loose on the beach or in a community park.  Because men are more likely to be out with their dogs alone, they are more prone to violent assault and theft. Reports of stolen pets often include descriptions of more than one attacker, sometimes armed with knives, and almost always using a motorcycle to make their escape.  One woman reported to a Facebook group that her Labrador Retriever was stolen by three individuals who attacked her male gatekeeper. She firmly believes the thieves intended to resell the dog.  Another man was attacked by four people who stole his German Shepherd puppy. “It’s really disappointing to see people steal dogs to make money,” he wrote on a Facebook thread. The most commonly stolen dog breeds are the Siberian Husky and Alaskan Malamute. Several times a week, Husky and Malamute owners throughout Morocco post pictures of their stolen and lost dogs online, hoping they will be found by a good Samaritan.  The fate of most missing dogs, however, remains a mystery.  Some may be sold to dog-fighting rings to be used as bait. “Aggressive” breeds may be purchased by drug dealers or gangs. Others are picked up by backyard breeders. A few may even end up in loving homes, but most of the dogs will be bought and resold at a higher price in a different city. In Morocco, the sale of dogs tends to be a cyclical business.   You can find almost anything in Morocco’s medinas and souks–including lost or stolen pets.  Hamza, 24, went to the Rabat medina right away when his German Shepherd disappeared from his yard in Hay Riad.  “It’s like when someone steals your phone,” his friend said. “You look for it in Medina.” Despite Hamza’s quick efforts, he never found his dog. It was likely sold before he could get to it, or taken to a different souk and put up for sale.  In December 2018, the Facebook page of an animal rescue organization called Comme Chiens et Chats – CCM shared a few photos of a small, Spaniel-looking dog.  “We received this picture of this little dog put on sale at the souk, he was probably stolen,” the caption read. “If you recognize him or his human is looking for him, today he was at the souk of stolen dogs.” Although the name may invoke some fantasy, the “souk of stolen dogs” is not some seedy, dimly lit, smoke-filled maze brimming with squealing puppies and howling dogs.  Rather, this phrase refers to areas in typical souks and medinas where pet thieves can be found attempting to quickly, but discreetly, sell last night’s catch to the highest bidder. Some thieves put the stolen animals in cages and others keep them on the end of rusty chains. Animals can even be found sitting motionless in cardboard boxes, perhaps sick or sedated.   The “souk of stolen dogs” has many locations throughout Morocco, notably in Casablanca’s Souk Korea and Souk Laayoune, the souk in Sidi Allal El Bahraoui near Rabat, and the large souk in Sale Jadida. Thieves will also pass along their stolen dogs to children, who will try to casually sell them on street corners near beaches, parks, and public transportation hubs.   In these crowded spaces, the dogs go largely unnoticed by the average passerby–that is, unless you’re looking for them.  Similar “souks” exist throughout the Middle East and North Africa, as purebred cats and dogs are now hot commodities for a select demographic in the Muslim world.  Despite some of these places being well-known, stolen dogs are rarely reunited with their rightful owners.  The criminal underbelly of pet ownership raises an important question: is Morocco, or any developing country, a suitable place to have pets? Make no mistake: thousands of pets are abused, neglected, abandoned, and stolen every day in the developed countries of North America and Europe, where dog-fighting rings, violent gangs, puppy mills, and sexual perverts are prevalent. On paper, the abuse of animals in Morocco pales in comparison to that of the U.S.  Yet it appears as though the majority of animals in Morocco, both feral and domestic, are more vulnerable to immense suffering.  Because the culture of pet ownership is so deeply ingrained in Europe and North America, there are legal systems in place to protect domesticated animals and their owners.  Additionally, microchips, GPS devices, police, and animal shelters all serve to reunite lost or stolen pets with their owners. Morocco completely lacks a comparable system.  These formal and informal mechanisms only exist in developed countries, where governments and private organizations can afford to position animal welfare as a priority.  Does this mean that all dog owners in Morocco should train their pets to be aggressive so they won’t be stolen? Perhaps. But this does not address the root of the problem, which is the unregulated pet industry that allows degeneracy to flourish. So long as Morocco lacks proper animal welfare laws, pets will be subjected to widespread abuse, neglect, and theft. And as long as the market for pets remains unregulated, purebred cats and dogs will continue to be easy money makers for opportunistic criminals. *Name has been changed for confidentiality.

Rabat –  Morocco’s help in managing border control and the abortion of irregular migration attempts resulted in a “significant decrease” in the migration pressure on Spanish coasts, reported Spanish news outlet ABC. ABC said that the month of July ended with a significant decrease in irregular migration. Quoting data from the International Organization of Migration, the Spanish news outlet said that security services intercepted 2,362 migrants and at sea compared to 7,885 in the same period in 2018. The number of aborted attempts in July represents a 70% decrease. Data also show a decrease in irregular migration attempts in Ceuta and Melilla. ABC said that 226 people managed to enter Spain through the fences of Ceuta and Melilla, against 1,085 in 2018.  ABC added that as of July 25, operations against irregular migration detected reached 24,117 in 2018 against 15,851. The number represents a 34.2% decrease in irregular migration attempts. In March, Spanish Minister of Interior Fernando Grande-Marlaska  said that Morocco’s security services are “leading to a decline in the arrival of migrants to the Spanish coasts.” He added that “coordination with the countries of origin and transit in the fight against these networks has led, since February, to a decline in migrant arrivals that is being confirmed during this month of March.” Like Spain, the Moroccan government has also expressed satisfaction with the cooperation with Spain against organized crimes. Moroccan director of migration at the Ministry of Interior, Khalid Zerouali, explained in July in an interview with El Pais that border control “has helped to ease the migratory pressure, but we must continue to work to strengthen this.” “It is true that on the Spanish side, we feel that the migratory pressure has decreased, but on our side, it continues to increase,” he said, commenting on Morocco’s successful operations to decrease the flow of migrants entering Spain. Spokesperson of the government Mustapha El Khalfi said in May that the decrease reflects the “great” effort of Morocco’s law enforcement forces against the issue of undocumented migration and the trafficking networks active in this area. He added that the statistics “testify to the considerable efforts” made by Morocco to combat irregular migration networks, especially those active on the Morocco-Spain axis.

Rabat – A photo of an 11-year-old Moroccan boy, surrounded by uniformed police officers with his arms piled with homework and textbooks, has gone viral in Italy. The photo, which Italian media has titled “the boy with books,” is serving as a representation of children everywhere trying to receive an education in unstable and chaotic living conditions. The photo was taken in Primaville, north-west of Rome, as police in riot gear raided an abandoned building where almost 350 people from Morocco, Romania, Ethiopia, Algeria, and Tunisia had been squatting. Thirty minors were among the migrants from the building, who were moved to a migrant center. The boy pictured, named Rayane, was among them. Taken by surprise, the families were forced to leave the building with only what they could grab in the rush, says the Italian newspaper La Repubblica. Rayanne’s first instinct was to grab his school books, clearly yellowed and damaged. Photographers immortalized the moment. The young Moroccan boy told journalists on the scene that books are deeply important to him. Italian media reports that Rayanne comes from a very poor family, with his father running a booth at a local flea market as the family’s only source of income. Rayanne attends a small school in the neighborhood and is reportedly extremely diligent in his studies. Some were so touched by the displaced boy’s dedication to his schooling in the midst of the chaos that a Gofundme page has been created to help Rayanne and other children like him get an education. The photo “is the mirror of today’s Italy, which hates culture, takes it out on the weakest and has destroyed all hope of social improvement,” reads the Gofundme page. “Rayane is Moroccan, and he badly wants to study,” the page continued. “He promised his math teacher to graduate.” “Rayane, like all children, foreign or Roman, has the right to study, a right that Salvini’s Italy wants to cancel. We launched this support campaign to allow him to continue his studies.” Famiglie Accoglienti (Host Family), an Italian NGO that started the crowdfunding campaign, have already raised €9000. They vow to use the funds “exclusively to help all children evicted in Primavalle and dispersed in various makeshift accommodation tens of kilometers from what had been their home for twenty years with their studies.” “We must hurry, we want Rayane and his companions to return to school in September with all their books and a roof over their heads,” Host Family finished their call for donations by saying.

Rabat – It is Groundhog Day in the Wydad vs. Esperance Tunis dossier after the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS), which was expected to deliver a final verdict, ended up issuing a partial, non-binding ruling. When Morocco’s Wydad Casablanca (WAC) and Tunisia’s Esperance Tunis (EST) lodged complaints with CAS after a controversial, for some scandalous, second leg of the final of the African Champions League, the broad expectation was that CAS would be the final arbiter in the matter. Earlier this week, on July 31, however, the Lausanne-based institution ironically overruled the rematch decision previously made by CAF, the body governing African Football, while at the same time pointing out that “competent bodies” from the same institution are in fact the ones responsible for making the final decision. The only decisive clause in CAS’ partial verdict is its outright rejection of Wydad’s side of the controversial story. Both Wydad and EST opposed CAF’s earlier rematch decision and claimed that they should win the continental trophy. CAS declared EST’s conclusions more compelling that WAC’s. But does that translate into victory for EST? The answer is yes, at least as far as EST is concerned. The Tunisian club sees in CAS’ partial ruling a tacit agreement with its claim that it is the legitimate winner. EST suggested rejecting the conclusions arrived at by Wydad’s legal team during the hearing on July 30 was a veiled way of urging CAF to declare them as the legitimate winner. For its part, however, Wydad is just as adamant that “the battle is not yet over.” In a statement the Moroccan club’s president issued to “clarify” CAS’ ruling, the Casablanca-based club noted that, rather than roundly dismissing CAF’s authority, CAS’s ruling simply meant that CAF’s previous decision did not respect due process. CAF’s earlier rematch decision was taken by the body’s executive committee when the Wydad-EST case should have been the responsibility of its interclub and disciplinary committees. The essential takeaway from CAS’ ruling, according to Wydad, is that CAF is now free to decide as it sees fit as long as it follows its own regulations as to which of its sections or subsections have the legitimacy to deliberate on a case like the EST-Wydad controversy. Meanwhile, CAF’s response to CAS’ verdict shied away from fueling speculations as to which decision the body is considering between a rematch and an EST victory. In its response, CAF simply said it had not yet received from CAS a written, comprehensive summary of the hearing that EST and Wydad had at the body’s headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. At this stage, WAC, whose CAS file dismissed CAF’s rematch ruling, will most likely welcome the same decision it contested. In the meantime, EST hopes that CAF will not rob it of a victory that CAS has from all evidence declared in its favor. As the original controversy seems to be returning to its starting point, the air seems to be filling up with a rematch scent, as the most likely, soundest move from CAF would be to confirm its own previous ruling. For CAF’s “competent bodies” to dismiss the executive committee’s ruling would be to grant CAF critics their oft-repeated point. That the body is a mostly dysfunctional unit where decisions are generally ad hoc and contradictory, a reflection of the power struggle or influence peddling which is reportedly the foundation of CAF’s functioning.

Rabat – Facebook removed multiple pages, groups, and accounts this week for their involvement in “coordinated inauthentic behaviour” operations on Facebook and Instagram. The social media giant identified two unconnected operations, the first originating from the UAE and Egypt, and the second originating from Saudi Arabia. Both operations were created to mislead social media users about the state of affairs in a number of middle eastern countries, Facebook stated in a press release on August 1. First operation Facebook found that the UAE and Egypt based operation was linked to two marketing firms: New Waves in Egypt and Newave in the UAE. The identified accounts impersonated public figures, posed as local news organizations in targeted countries and promoted content about the UAE, Facebook found. The account owners also posted about local news, politics, elections, and topics including alleged support of terrorist groups by Qatar and Turkey, Iran’s activity in Yemen, the conflict in Libya, successes of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, and the independence for Somaliland. Second operation According to Facebook, the second operation was linked to “individuals associated with the government of Saudi Arabia.” In this case, the account owners posted promotional information about the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and successes of the Saudi Armed Forces, particularly during the conflict in Yemen. They also criticized neighboring countries including Iran, Qatar, and Turkey, and called into question the credibility of the Qatar-owned Al-Jazeera news network and Amnesty International. The key targets of the operation were Qatar, the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, Palestine, Lebanon, and Jordan, Facebook says. Facebook’s press release did not specify how exactly Morocco was targeted by the operations. Rising diplomatic tension Tensions have been rising this year between Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. In February, Saudi news channel Al Arabiya aired a documentary questioning Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara, after which Rabat recalled Moroccan ambassadors from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. That same month, Morocco also withdrew from the coalition fighting in Yemen. In April this year, UAE’s ambassador to Morocco abruptly left the country, causing speculation of diplomatic tensions arising from Morocco’s position in the Gulf Crisis. Morocco refused to side with the UAE and Saudi Arabia in the Gulf Crisis blockade of Qatar. When Saudi Arabia and the UAE severed ties with Qatar on June 6, 2017, closing borders and restricting airspace, Morocco chose to remain neutral. The “coordinated inauthentic behaviour,” displayed by the UAE and Saudi Arabia may be rooted in political tension.

Rabat — A new report from the ratings agency Fitch Ratings has argued that Morocco’s attempts to establish a sharia-compliant financial infrastructure continue to be impeded by various challenges. The Moroccan government has recently approved a new law concerning sharia-compliant insurance, known as takaful, earlier this month on July 10. The new legislation has been designed to further promote the growth of Islamic financial institutions, commonly referred to as “participation banks.” Under takaful, individuals and companies collectively contribute towards a singular fund to be used for reimbursement in the event of damage or loss. Following the government’s new legislation, companies will be permitted to launch these takaful subsidiaries. However, the report also pointed out a number of challenges that have the potential to disrupt the growth of the industry. Firstly, funding continues to be an obstacle for the growth of local participation banks. A lack of capital and liquidity is expected to hinder the ability for participation banks to grow rapidly. Regardless, Fitch Ratings remained optimistic for the industry’s potential in Morocco. Jamal El Mellali, the Associate Director of Financial Institutions at Fitch Ratings, said, “Recent developments in Morocco are consistent with the country’s efforts to build a cohesive Islamic finance ecosystem.” The report also outlined the concern of public awareness and trust in Islamic financial infrastructure. With the industry still being relatively new and in its emerging stages, it will take time before the public has adequate trust in these institutions. The report also cited similar developments when Islamic finance was introduced to Turkey and Indonesia, where it experienced rapid growth but then stalled at around 5% to 6% of total lending. For the foreseeable future, Islamic finance will continue to face a number of challenges to growth in Morocco; however, the future still holds great potential for the industry.

Rabat – Donald Trump’s adviser Jared Kushner reportedly arrived in Morocco on the evening of Thursday, August 1. During his visit to Morocco, as part of his Middle East tour, the US official also met with Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed (MBZ), the Jerusalem Post reported. A US administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that Kushner met with he MBZ and Oman’s Minister Responsible for Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin Alazi bin Abdulah, according to the Jerusalem Post. The news outlet added that Kushner’s meeting with the MBZ was expected to take place in the UAE, but it “ultimately took place in Morocco.” Morocco’s news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) has not reported on the arrival of Kushner, MBZ, or Oman’s FM. Xinhua news outlet, however, reported on Thursday that Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan arrived in Morocco for a private visit on Wednesday, July 31. The unnamed official said that the meetings were “extremely productive.” The meetings aimed at following up on the US-sponsored economic meeting held in  Manama in June. The meeting discussed the economic aspects of the proposed Israel-Palestine peace plan.  Daniel Estrin, a  correspondent at the  National Public Radio in Washington tweeted that Kushner will be visiting the Mideast with stops to Saudi Arabia, Jora, Israel, Egypt, and Morocco. While the reason behind his second stop in Morocco has not yet been confirmed, international news outlets said that the visit seeks to gain support for the US economic project as part of the Middle East peace plan otherwise known as the Deal of the Century. The deal seeks to boost the economy in Palestine, according to the US narrative. Palestine, however, refuses any mediation from the US as it believes that the US is siding with Israel. The tension between the US and Palestine intensified after US President Donald Trump announced his country’s decision to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. On July 24, Trump’s administration blocked a proposal urging the UN to issue a condemnation after Israeli forces demolished Palestinian homes in Oued al-Homes, south of the occupied Jerusalem.

Rabat – The next coach of the Moroccan national football team will not be a Moroccan national, in spite of popular demands that “a man of the country” take over in the aftermath of the recent debacle at the African Cup of Nations. Almost a fortnight after the dramatic end of its three-year-long romance with Herve Renard, the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF) has appointed Bosnia’s Vahid Halilhodzic as the new head coach of the Atlas Lions, according to Moroccan outlet Al Ahdath Al Maghribia. The appointment, which is yet to be confirmed by FRMF, comes two days after the body presented a three-name shortlist featuring the German Gernot Rohr, the French Laurent Blanc, and the Bosnian Vahid Halilhodzic. Rohr looked like the least probable replacement, however. The German has had a satisfactory stint as the coach of Nigeria’s Super Eagles. His team won third place at the recently played Africa Cup of Nations, and the German manager made an impression for disciplining a not-so-talented Nigerian side, for inspiring ordinary players to perform as well as the great and frighteningly talented Nigerian squads of the good old days of Nigerian football. The possibility for the German to leave Nigeria soon was very scant. Plus, in response to FRMF’s interest in him, Rohr has adamantly dismissed rumors around his future, strongly denying claims of talks with FRMF for a possible coaching contract in Morocco. Blanc, who has not managed a team since he left France’s PSG football club in the summer of 2016, was the second priority. But for a coach who in recent months has rejected a pile of offers from top European clubs, taking on the African plunge that Morocco offered would have been surprising at best. This left FRMF with Halilhodzic as its most viable option, its best shot to replace Renard, its charismatic and continentally revered now-former French coach, with a manager of similar caliber. Halilhodzic was not in good terms with FC Nantes, the French club where he made his name in the 1970s and 1980s as a sterling forward and which he has managed since October of last year. Plus, news that he rescinded his contract with Nantes on Thursday, August 1, has reinforced the credibility of Al Ahdath Al Maghribia’s report that he has already come to an agreement with FRMF. The 67-year-old Bosnian brings tested international experience (his coaching CV is impressive at both club and country levels) and well-trusted local insight (he is familiar with the Moroccan local league). These are perhaps the two qualities which FRMF feels are needed to put together a squad that can put to rest the painful memories of successive might-have-beens in recent years, of last-minute sloppiness in the most crucial moments in major games. Having managed Wydad Casablanca, the top Moroccan club, with which he won the African Champions League in 1997, the Bosnian boasts inside knowledge of the Moroccan League, which most Moroccans now think should be taken into account when considering players for a spot in the national squad. But even as he brings coveted European expertise and additional inside knowledge of the Botola, as the Moroccan football league is called, Halilhodzic is hardly what most Moroccans fans asked or hoped for. After the Egyptian fiasco at this year’s CAN, when a languid but resilient Beninese side got the best of the hyped but uninspired Moroccan Lions, there were resounding echoes, urgency-filled calls for a local coach, “a man of the country” as a possible alternative to replace Renard. That mood was mostly a reaction to the standout story of this year’s CAN: the success of home coaches. 10 out of the 24 coaches at the continental showpiece in Egypt were locals, and most of the best performing teams came from that bundle. From Algeria’ impressive attack-defense balance to Senegal’s free-flowing football, at times offensively intense and at others prodigiously physical, or even Ivory Coast’s promising display or Mali’s series of stellar performance despite an early exit, there was a sense that local coaches came to Egypt to show that they, too, can manage at the same level as the much-coveted foreign coaches. Algeria’s Djamel Belmadi and Senegal’s Aliou Cisse said as much in a joint post-match press conference after the final. CAN 2019 felt, then, like the prelude of an exhilarating epoch for local coaches, so pervasive was the sentiment that it would precipitate the end of the dominance of “white wizards,” those glamorous and expensive foreign coaches seemingly paid to perform miracles with African teams. Across the continent, anything foreign—or European, or Western, to be precise—is always elevated, more revered. “No one is a prophet in their own land,” as the saying goes. Critics have often quipped that African federations’ tendency to call on foreign managers is football’s way of catching up with the “white savior complex,” that laughable feeling among some Africans that expertise from home is never comparable to overseas experience. “Belmadi and Cisse,” the Guardian’s Jonathan Wilson said of the coaches of Algeria and Senegal, respectively, “feel like part of a new generation of coaches, Africans with significant European experience, who represent the future.” This comment came after, early on in the same piece, Wilson had suggested that, seeing the kind of quality and cohesion that Senegal, Algeria, and other local heroes-managed sides put on display at the 2019 CAN, it felt “like a step in the right direction” to ditch foreign saviors in favor of local heroes. As Morocco’s new, purported, Franco-Bosnian manager prepares to take up his new position and put on his first display with the Moroccan Lions against Burkina Faso in September as part of the qualifiers for the next Afcon, Moroccans who have been rooting for “a man of the country” are bound to feel betrayed, not listened to. Like the proponents of the “white savior complex” idea, they may see in Halilhodzic’s appointment FRMF’s fixation on European expertise to help realize a Moroccan aspiration, or fix a national mess. While other great African football sides are taking the dish du jour, considering local catches, critics may point out, Morocco is still obsessed with the idea of a white wizard saviour. In FRMF’s defense, however, the truth is much murkier. It was only after a steady diet of Moroccan coaches—Rachid Taoussi or Badou Zaki are the two names that readily come to mind—failed to fare as expected that FRMF called on Renard. And now that Renard is gone, very few Moroccan coaches presently boast the kind of experience that FRMF is seeking. Jamal Sellami, who won last year’s CHAN with the local Atlas Lions, and Mustapha Hadji, former Moroccan international and Morocco’s second coaching assistant under Renard, have been mentioned as possible alternatives. From FRMF’s perspective, however, in football management as in any other corporation-like operating structure, it is much safer to hire the candidate with a proven record of success than one who promises to deliver when given the chance. Of course, some, more inclined to patience, would have gone for the promising candidate. Their argument would be that, when given enough time and resources, a committed promising candidate can rebuild the squad and bring to the team a whole new esprit de corps. But FRMF doesn’t have time; it can’t wait, so urging is the need for another adventure, another dream, especially after three years of relentless team-building and colossal investments “turned to dust” in a match Morocco was supposed to easily win. But whether the former Wydad coach can be the inspiration for that new dream is another question altogether.

Rabat – Saudi Arabia, notorious for its heavy restriction of women, has announced a series of reforms to increase their freedom. One of the new cabinet decrees published by the official Saudi gazette on Friday, August 2, allows women over the age of 21 to apply for a passport without authorization and travel without the guardianship of a man. The new amendments also allow women to register childbirth, marriage, or divorce, and to be issued official family documents. Women will also now be eligible to guardians to children. Previously, women were required to seek permission from their guardian, usually their father or husband, to marry, apply for a passport or to leave the country. The reforms follow several high-profile cases of Saudi women fleeing Saudi Arabia and seeking asylum in countries such as the UK and Canada, citing gender oppression. Friday’s royal decrees also covered employment regulations, ruling that all citizens in the country have the right to work without facing discrimination based on gender, disability or age. The decree is part of a plan Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced in 2016 to diversify the economy by 2030 and try to increase women’s participation in the workforce to 30% from 22%. Princess Reema bint Bandar, Saudi Arabia’s first-ever female ambassador to the United States, said on Twitter that the amendments “are designed to elevate the status of Saudi women within our society, including granting them the right to apply for passports and travel independently.” “These developments have been a long time coming,” she continued. “From the inclusion of women in the consultative council to issuing driving licenses to women, our leadership has proved its unequivocal commitment to gender equality.” “These new regulations are history in the making. They call for the equal engagement of women and men in our society. It is a holistic approach to gender equality that will unquestionably create real change for Saudi women,” added Princess Reema. “Women have always played an integral role in our country’s development, and they will continue to do so moving forward on equal footing with their male counterparts,” she finished her statement by saying. While the reforms under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s reign mark a positive move in the direction of gender equality, many are pointing out there is still a long way to go and that women are also still facing human rights violations in the country. 10 prominent Saudi women’s rights activists are currently on trial for “cybercrimes,” according to a UK group advocating for Saudi rights, ALQST. 4 of the women allege they have been tortured in prison, have been subjected to electric shocks and whippings, and have been sexually harassed and assaulted. The prosecution charged them with crimes under the country’s cybercrime law, based on a string of alleged confessions that the women had been in contact with human rights organisations. None of the women had access to a lawyer. — القسط ALQST (@ALQST_ORG) March 13, 2019  In March, more than 30 countries at the UN Human Rights Council criticized Saudi Arabia for detaining the women and human rights organizations have decried the arrests as well. So before we all start rejoicing these reforms we need 2 remember that the Saudi government has set the bar so low for human rights that any minor reform will always seem monumental. — MS SΛFFΛΛ (@MsSaffaa) August 2, 2019  Despite Friday’s reforms, many elements of the guardianship system remain in place. Women still need permission from a male relative to marry or live on their own, as well as leave prison if they have been detained. They still cannot pass on citizenship to their children, or provide consent for their children to marry.

Rabat – According to the Moroccan Exchange Office figures for June 2019, during the first half of 2019 Moroccan exports increased by 3.1%, while imports increased by 3.8%. Morocco’s trade deficit has therefore increased compared to the same period last year. Morocco’s trade deficit reached MAD 102.460 million, up from MAD 97.7 million last year.  According to the Exchange Office, the increase in the rate of imports is due to an increase in the imports of capital goods, in particular the acquisition of airplanes (airport import rates increased by 9.9%).  Import rates of finished consumption products (including synthetic fabrics and plastic products) and half finished consumption products (including steel threads and bars, and other metal products) also increased by 3.2% and 5.7% respectively.  The Exchange Office identifies that the slowdown in exports is due to a slowdown in automobile exports, phosphate exports, and textile and leather exports. Export growth rates for finished vehicles dropped by 4.8% in the first half of 2019. According to a statement by the Exchange Office in April, this drop is due to a global slowdown in automobile demand. However, vehicle cabling exports increased by 6.9%, indicating a strong performance in the broader vehicle supply chain ecosystem. A number of international cabling companies are present in Morocco including French group Nexans, German company Kromberg &amp; Schubert and Japanese company Yazaki.  German group Prettl Automotive entered Morocco’s cabling industry market this year. The group opened an 8600 square meter cabling factor in Tangier in April, employing up to 600 people.

Rabat – Eid Al Adha, or the Festival of Sacrifice, is one of the holiest days in the Muslim calendar. The date of Eid Al Adha is announced every year by religious authorities around the world. It changes every year, as the Muslim calendar follows the moon’s cycles. According to the Moroccan Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs, Eid Al Adha will be celebrated this year on August 12. Eid Al Adha, also called Eid Al Kbir or the “Big Eid,” falls on the tenth day of the Islamic month of Dhu Hijja. It marks the end date of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, one of the five pillars of Islam. What is Eid Al Adha? The Eid Al Adha celebration honors the willingness of Ibrahim, recognized as a prophet in Islam, to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to Allah’s command. Muslims believe that Ibrahim was spared from sacrificing his son when Allah instead provided a lamb for sacrifice. Read Also: Moroccan Leather Industry to Use Sacrificed Eid Al Adha Sheep’s Skins Muslim families across the world will sacrifice an animal, usually a sheep, goat, cow, or camel in celebration of the day. The meat is cooked, forming the basis of stews, roasts and barbecues. The symbolic significance of the sacrifice also includes sharing with the poor. A large part of the animal, usually a third, is given away. Food safety during Eid To ensure food safety during the festival, the Moroccan National Office of Food Safety (ONSSA) has carried out a rigorous vaccination and animal tagging campaign, aimed at preventing the spread of foot and mouth disease and other illnesses. The Moroccan Secretary of State for Sustainable Development also launch the “Clean Eid Al Adha” campaign on July 24. The purpose of the campaign is to raise awareness on the importance of keeping slaughter areas clean, and disposing of slaughter residues appropriately. This year’s campaign is also calling on Moroccans to preserve the skins of sacrificed animals, so that they can be collected and treated, then used in Morocco’s leather industry.

Rabat – Banana Republic launched a line of hijabs on Tuesday, August 30. The American retail giant added four styles of plain colored and patterned hijabs, the head coverings some Muslim women choose to wear, to the “accessories” section of its website. Banana Republic’s joins other retail giants who are moving towards more inclusive brand depictions and clothing lines. In 2017, Nike released a sports hijab line, and last year, GAP released a promotional “back to school” ad campaign showing a little girl wearing a hijab. Banana Republic’s new product quickly sparked debate. Two of the high profile Instagram influencers, British-Moroccan model Mariah Idrissi and the founder of the online fashion label Haute Hijab, Melanie Elturk, criticized Banana Republic about two images used in the ad campaign. They pointed out that the brand’s campaign images for the hijabs did not necessarily meet the modest dress code requirements of hijabi women.  The first image shows a woman wearing a hijab and a short sleeve white T-shirt. The second image shows a woman wearing a hijab and a grey dress with a slit up the side of the leg. Elturk shared the first images from Banana Republic’s website on her Instagram, writing: “While I LOVE that hijab is becoming more mainstream and applaud @bananarepublic for their efforts in inclusivity… I have to pause at the way it’s portrayed.” “There are guidelines to hijab outside of just covering hair,” she noted. “All it would have taken was a consultation with a Muslim brand or group to advise in order to do it right and respect our values. So while this excited me as someone who’s life mission is to normalize hijab in the mainstream, I also think it’s important we keep the essence of hijab intact for ourselves and our future generations,” she added.  London-born model Mariah Idrissi, of Moroccan-Pakistani descent, also commented on the images.  “I’m out here on… all these platforms to explain the importance of getting the right people to consult for brands that want to tap into the ‘Muslim dollar’ and then this happens. Why are these errors happening still?” she questioned.  Idrissi made headlines back in 2015 when she became the first model to wear a hijab in a major international fashion campaign for H&amp;M.  Banana Republic has removed the two images in question from its website. The brand has not released a statement on the matter.

Rabat – Police in the city of Fez arrested a 45-year-old Moroccan national after he allegedly made a hoax call to police. During the phone call, the man alerted police to a terror threat at Fez-Sais airport. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that the suspect called the command and coordination room, which is responsible for receiving calls from citizens to manage police intervention on the public road. The suspect hung up without revealing his identity. Investigations, however, led to his swift arrest. Police put the suspect in custody for further investigation into the circumstances of the case, DGSN said.

Rabat – Police in Nador, eastern Morocco arrested, on Thursday, August 1,  a 49-year old Spanish national suspected of organizing an irregular migration operation. The suspect was driving an international transport truck registered in Spain, according to a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). According to the statement, an irregular migrant was found hiding inside the truck. DGSN noted that the would-be migrant was very carefully hidden. The irregular migrant, having difficulty breathing, feared for his life and contacted a family member for help. His family then called the police who managed to identify and stop the truck to rescue the migrant. The investigation into the suspect shows that the Spanish national previously carried out two similar operations, charging MAD 10,000 per person. The truck driver was collaborating with a second suspect who police believe is responsible for mediating irregular migration operations. The second suspect receives sums of MAD 60,000 per person in return for trafficking services. Police put the suspect in custody pending further investigation into the incident and any accomplices involved in the irregular migration network. The operation is part of Morocco’s efforts to combat irregular migration attempts. Morocco’s security services have carried multiple similar operations throughout the year. In June, police arrested n Indian national suspected of mediating irregular migration in Tangier. Police in Asilah, northern Morocco also arrested a Malian national suspected of facilitating irregular migration and human trafficking operations in May. Aware of the danger of irregular migration, Morocco has been intensifying efforts to curb the phenomenon in collaboration with Spanish security services. In July, Moroccan director of migration at the Ministry of Interior Khalid Zerouali said that  irregular migration networks have become “sophisticated.” Now candidates for illegal immigration are trying to leave from south Casablanca. There are also attempts to reach the Canary Islands” from the coast between Agadir and Dakhla, added the minister. Zerouali said that Moroccan police foiled more than 40,300 irregular migration attempts since January 2019. In his interview with El Pais, Zerouali added that border control “has helped to ease the migratory pressure, but we  must continue to work to strengthen this.”

Rabat – The law banning facial coverings in government buildings, schools, and on public transport comes into effect in the Netherlands on August 1. The law does not apply to public streets. The law targets clothing that completely covers the face or “covers it in such a way that only the eyes can be seen.” It therefore applies to the burqa, the niqab, as well as motor helmets and ski masks. Offenders are now subject to a 150 euro ($166) fine. The Netherlands has a population of approximately 17 million, and it is estimated that somewhere between 100 and 400 people wear a niqab or burqa. According to a statement from the Dutch police issued on July 31, public institutions will be responsible for enforcement of the new law.  “Verification of compliance with this prohibition lies with the employees of the institution where the prohibition applies and with the personnel of the transport company,” the police say. “They are expected to address offenders, point out the existence of the prohibition and request them to remove the face covering or otherwise leave the premises,” the statement adds. The ban on facial coverings is controversial, and how it will be applied in practice remains to be seen. For the Dutch Federation of University Medical Centers, hospitals “should not be charged with this task, but it is up to the police and the judiciary,” reports Dutch news source NOS. Amsterdam’s OLVG hospital group has said it will not take action. “Our policy is, if care is need, then that is what we will provide,” hospital spokeswoman Elles in‘t Hout told the Dutch newspaper NRC. Representatives of the transport industry have also said they will not enforce the ban, citing worries over disruption to services if police assistance is required, reports NOS. When the law was voted in mid last year, critics, including Annelies Moors, professor of Anthropology and Sociology at the University of Amsterdam, warned the ban could dissuade some women from entering public spaces. Under the law, people wearing a burqa can for example no longer enter a police station to report a crime.  The Dutch police have reassured that in this situation, “there are several options,” being making a declaration by phone or by the internet. Where phone or internet reporting is not an option however then the police explains that “you must cooperate by taking off the clothing that covers your face.” In public transport and in educational institutes, healthcare and government, “it is important for social safety and services that everyone can recognize and look at each other,” the Dutch police statement adds.

Rabat – According to the poll, 51% of voters think Trump is racist, compared to 45% who do not.   USA Today detailed the results, which are divided according to political affiliation, sex, race, and religion.  CNN compared these findings to a September 1968 poll regarding former Alabama Governor George Wallace, who ran for president that year.  Wallace was a proud segregationist and opposed to the Civil Rights movement, which sought to grant black Americans equal rights. According to a Harris poll, 41% of voters believed he was racist, while 40% did not.   While they may not be representative of the entire population, these results demonstrate that “more voters believe Trump is racist than believed a segregationist running for president in 1968 was,” writes CNN analyst Harry Enten.  Quinnipiac held similar polls in 2018, with 49% of respondents believing Trump is racist.  The new poll comes on the heels of yet another racist scandal involving President Trump. In early July, he tweeted that four Democratic congresswomen of color should “go back” to their countries. The attack was directed at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar. All four are US citizens. Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx, New York to a Puerto Rican family.  Pressley, a black woman, was born in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Tlaib, of Palestinian descent, was born in Detroit, Michigan. Omar was born in Somalia in 1982. After fleeing the ongoing civil war, Omar’s family spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya. The family was granted asylum in the US in 1995, and Omar later became a US citizen at 17 years old.  Amid Trump’s tweeting scandal, the president held a rally in North Carolina during which he doubled down on his comments. While criticizing Omar, his attendees and supporters began chanting “send her back.” Trump has been accused of spewing racist rhetoric since he launched his presidential bid in 2015. He also has a questionable past–records of his racist remarks date back to 1973. In June 2017, he reportedly remarked that once Nigerian immigrants saw America, they would “never go back to their huts.” At the same time, he also allegedly said Haitians “all have AIDS.”  In January 2018, the President referred to El Salvador, Haiti, and various African nations as “s—hole countries,” and demanded to know why the US accepts immigrants from these places.  Most recently, he referred to a majority-black district in Baltimore, Maryland as a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess” in a July 27 Twitter attack on black congressman Elijah Cummings. This attack came in response to Cummings’ criticism of the treatment of migrants at border facilities between the US and Mexico.   USA Today reported that Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld “warned the Republican Party that if it does not denounce Trump in 2020, the GOP will be known as the ‘party of racism in America.’”

Rabat – The Court of Valencia opened an investigation into the alleged suicide of an inmate at the Zapadores Migrant Detention Center in Valencia, a 25 years old Moroccan national. The Moroccan man died on the afternoon of July 15.  According to Levante-EMV, the young man had arrived a few days before at the detention center in Valencia, from Alicante. The Spanish outlet pointed out that there was no imminent expulsion order against the young man. According to Publico, “after lunch and when all the inmates were in their respective rooms, the deceased got out of bed, tied his shirt to the upper bunk and hung himself.”  “When the guards noticed, the young man had already died,” said the Spanish source. Apparently, on July 14, the police officers guarding the detention center had to intervene to stop a fight, involving the victim. The altercation was between a group of Moroccans and a group of South Americans. As reported by Eldiarioes, the Government delegate in the Valencia Region, Juan Carlos Fulgencio, told journalists that “as a result of his injuries (from the fight) and as it seemed that the other group’s attention was focused on him, he was provisionally isolated for his own protection.” “He was under surveillance, and in the few minutes he spent between one control and the next, it seems that he decided to take his own life,” further explained the delegate. Levante-EMV reported that the court investigated how the victim could have committed suicide despite the center being equipped with guards and surveillance cameras in the rooms and in the common areas. The judge requested the recordings be examined for any negligence in the care of the inmates. Publico reported that the removal of the body was carried out by a judicial commission. The commission determined the cause of death as suicide by suffocation, pending confirmation of the autopsy.  Several Spanish NGOs requested that the circumstances of the death be clarified. They asked that it be made clear the center’s management or the guards had been negligent, reports Eldiarieos. The Campaign for the Closure of Detention Centers and the End of Deportations requested that citizens gather in front of the Zapadores center on July 16 to urge the Government to implement the Center’s closure decision. According to 20 Minutos, in 2018, more than 30 organizations called for a demonstration against “institutional racism” and detention centers in Spain.

Rabat – Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Amina J. Mohamed said that Morocco’s progress is “truly exemplary leadership.” Mohamed attended a reception hosted in New York by Morocco’s permanent representative to the UN Omar Hilale on Tuesday, July 30. The event was held to celebrate the 20th anniversary of King Mohammed VI’s coronation.  During the reception, Mohamed said that Morocco’s reforms are “very reactive and in line with the times” to meet the aspirations of young people and the rising generations. She added that the UN presence at the ceremony was an “expression of solidarity for the leadership we see in a prosperous nation that leads the way in Africa and also in the world.” Mohamed told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that she hopes that Morocco’s expertise can be spread to the rest of Africa. UN Assistant Secretary-General for the Department of Peace Operations and the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, Bintou Keita, thanked King Mohammed VI  for all “the contributions that Morocco is making to peacebuilding and peacekeeping efforts” on the African continent. Morocco contributes with more than 2,100 uniformed peacekeeping volunteers. Morocco ranks 13th in the world for peacekeeper contribution. The country has been “an essential partner of United Nations peacekeeping operations for many years,” said UN peacekeeping spokesman Nick Birnback.

Rabat – Kyle “Bugha” Giersdorf, a 16-year-old boy from Pennsylvania, has won $3 million at the first-ever Fortnite World Cup, after he came first place in the solo challenge on July 28. More than 40 million people tried out for a slot in the competition and a whopping 9 million people tuned in on YouTube to watch the tournament. Fortnite is an online video game that has taken the world by storm since it was launched by Epic Games in 2017. The game involves dropping 100 players onto an island where they have to find weapons, build bases, and try to eliminate the competition until only one player is left standing. The game has more than 120 million players, bringing Epic Games a profit of $3 billion last year. Its first-ever World Cup had a total prize pool of $30 million, making it one of the most lucrative competitive tournaments on the planet. To put it into perspective, Bugha’s prize is only $850,000 less than the prize for the winner of the U.S. Open, which will be held in a few weeks at the same stadium in New York City. Another comparison being made by many, illustrating just how much esports has joined the mainstream sports industry, is that Bugha’s prize dwarfs the one Tiger Woods earned from winning the Masters by a million dollars. 16-year-old made a millionaire overnight The win will surely be life-changing for Bugha, who his mother says has been playing video games since he was three. “Emotionally, right now, I don’t feel too much, except I know that this could pretty much change my life forever,” Bugha told ESPN. “It’s just absolutely unreal.” The win seems to be the culmination of a lot of hard work paid off, as his mother Darcy Giersdorf told ESPN that he plays 8-10 hours of Fortnite a day. “I literally feel like I’m in a dream right now,” she said after the tournament. “It’s so surreal. … This is life-changing for him. He’s been playing video games since he was 3, so this is his passion. He told us he could do this, he put his mind to it and he did it.” Monetary gain aside, within an hour of winning the title, Bugha gained more than 100,000 followers on Twitter. The win has also earned him acclaim on mainstream media. On Monday, July 29, the 16-year-old appeared on Jimmy Fallon on NBC’s “The Tonight Show” to give a rundown of his daily routine. 16-yr-old #FortniteWorldCup Solo Champion @bugha walks us through his gaming routine.

Rabat – Moroccan police in Tangier have opened an investigation into the trafficking of 505 kilograms of cannabis resin aboard a commercial vehicle registered in Morocco. Security services at the port of Algeciras, Spain seized the vehicle on July 28. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that the center of joint police cooperation between the Moroccan and Spanish authorities alerted police services that a car loaded with half a ton of cannabis was seized at the port. The statement added that judicial police in Tangier have opened an investigation into the case. The investigation aims to identify the suspects involved in the trafficking operation and how the vehicle had arrived in the port without undergoing the necessary inspection procedures. Police arrested two suspects involved in the trafficking case. DGSN added that three other individuals, including a woman, and a teenage girl are being investigated for their alleged links with a criminal network implicated in the operation. DGSN said that it will continue its investigations under the supervision of the public prosecutor’s office, in order to arrest all those involved as well as possible accomplices. The operation is part of Morocco’s ongoing efforts to combat drug trafficking and international organized crimes in cooperation with Spanish security services. Morocco and Spain regularly collaborate in the fight against drug smuggling, irregular migration networks, and terrorism. Spanish police have arrested several Moroccan suspects allegedly involved in drug trafficking and terror charges in recent months. In April,  Spanish police arrested a Moroccan national in Tarifa, southern Spain. The suspect was the subject of a European arrest warrant. The Moroccan suspect was allegedly involved in crimes of drug trafficking and participation in a criminal network. In March, Moroccan police arrested a Spanish national in Tetouan, northern Morocco. The Spanish suspect was also the subject of an international arrest warrant from the Spanish judicial police and an Interpol red notice.

Rabat – El Othmani arrived at Nouakchott airport last night and was greeted by the Mauritanian ministerial delegation headed by Mauritania’s Prime Minister Mohamed Salem Ould Bechir. The official inauguration ceremony for Mauritania’s new president Mohamed Ould Cheikh El Ghazouani will take place today in Nouakchott. El Ghazouani won the Mauritanian presidential elections on June 22, with 52% of votes. The Moroccan head of Government said he was “very happy to attend the investiture ceremony of the new Mauritanian president.” “We would like to congratulate our brothers in Mauritania for the political phase that they have gone through, and that has allowed the country to obtain stability and security necessary for development,” El Othmani added in a press conference yesterday. El Ghazouani took over from outgoing president Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, who took power in a 2008 coup, then won elections in 2009 and 2014. The 2019 election was largely peaceful, although small demonstrations broke out after results were announced. The losing candidates contested the outcome of the votes. “We reject the results of the election and we consider that they in no way express the will of the Mauritanian people,” third-place candidate Mohamed Ould Boubacar said. The King of Morocco Mohammed VI congratulated the winning candidate when the election results were announced. Morocco and Mauritania are looking to strengthen their relations, a point emphasized by El Othmani last night in Nouakchott. “Morocco is aiming to further reinforce its excellent and historical relation with Mauritania,” he said. Representatives from the US, Algeria, Egypt, Mali, and Angola amongst other states will also attend the ceremony today. While the leader of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic Brahim Ghali also received an invitation to the investiture ceremony, his attendance is not yet confirmed. Ghali did not send a congratulatory message to El Ghazouani after the announcement of his election victory.

Rabat – Pictures and videos of Safi’s local authorities dragging a street vendor by a chain he had fastened around his own neck caused a wave of national anger over social networks. The authorities arrested the vendor on July 27 as part of the regular campaigns against the appropriation of public property. Local authorities prevented a number of vegetable and fruit vendors from using the public street in the Corse district of Safi near the Al Baraka market. The vendors were protesting against the ban imposed by the authorities. The viral pictures show an officer dragging the seller from inside a pharmacy by an iron chain and putting him in an auxiliary forces car. Several Internet users then launched the hashtag “#drag the sheep #drag the dog” to condemn the authorities’ behavior. In a statement, Safi’s Prefecture clarified that “the vendor appearing in these pictures chained himself by the neck and tied the chain to his cart with a lock, in an effort to obstruct the work of local authorities charged with liberating public property.” “In recent weeks, he has been mobilizing and encouraging street vendors to confront the authorities and to display their goods on the public street opposite the market,” added the statement. “He also threatened to commit suicide if he was prevented from selling on the public street,” says the Prefecture. “Being subject to legal proceedings, the vendor fled and entered a pharmacy before being arrested by officers to avoid any suicide attempt,” the statement further clarified. Safi’s Prefecture also mentioned that despite having the right to an allocated space to sell his merchandise in Al Baraka market, the vendor insisted on continuing to use the public street. In a Youtube video, the vendor’s mother explained the vendors’ version of events. “My son just wants a place to sell his goods; he has been asking authorities in vain,” she said. The mother described the arrest scene saying, “they dragged him in a savage manner; I’ve never seen them drag anyone like that, not even terrorists.” “No mother in the world can bear seeing her child dragged in such a violent and degrading way,” she added. In the video, she also mentioned how her “son has a spot in the market, yet he has been continuously expelled from it for the benefit of a retired woman.”  “You’re comfortable having a fixed salary, while you dragged him like a dog for being unemployed,” she angrily addressed officers. She further explained that “they’re doing this because he is asking for his rights. He hasn’t harmed any of them.” Another Facebook video shows the market’s customers and other vendors condemning the act. One customer said that “the market’s selling spaces have been illegally granted to people.” He continued, “we condemn this cruel and degrading behavior, and we request that the authorities give an official apology to the vendor.” A vendor who witnessed the arrest clarified that authorities “told us to wait (for selling spaces) till Monday; we can’t do that, we need money to cover the Eid El-Adha’s expenses.”  “All they’ve given us are false hopes,” he added. The vendor also complained that officers often “come and throw their merchandise.” “We’ve spent all our money on; it’s not fair,” he said. With this incident, the issue of street vendors in Morocco resurfaced. In 2013, a Moroccan street vendor in Marrakech died after setting himself on fire, grieving over his confiscated goods. Similarly,  in April 2016, Moroccans were shocked by the death of “Mi Fatiha” (Mother Fatiha). The street vendor set herself on fire after officers had insulted her and confiscated her merchandise.  The same year, another street vendor stripped down to their underwear as a protest against authorities’ ban.

Rabat – US-managed website Export.gov  reported that Morocco has requested the purchase of 24 new Apache attack helicopters from its main army supplier, the US. Export.gov, a portal managed by the US Department of Commerce, shared an overview of Morocco’s military on July 15, showing Morocco’s latest military purchase activities. The overview shows that Morocco has put in a bid for  24 new Apache attack helicopters at $1.5 Billion. Apache attack helicopters are among the most advanced equipment and are heavily used by the US Army as well as other international militaries. “Over the last decade, Morocco has strengthened its navy and equipped its army with sophisticated vehicles,” said Export.gov. The website also recalled the most significant purchase made by Morocco, which included the 25 new F-16 aircraft in 2019. “The Moroccan defense budget is expected to grow to  $3.9 billion by 2022,” emphasized the website. Morocco’s military budget slightly increased from MAD 29.4 billion ($3.2 billion) in 2012 to MAD 34.7 billion in 2018 ($3.5 billion), according to the 2018 Trends in World Military Expenditure report released in April 2019. Export.gov added that Morocco made other significant purchases, including the  “162 new M1A1 tanks at $.75B, 300 TOW missile launchers with 1800 missiles at $180 Million, and significant interest in purchasing High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), PATRIOT Air Defense systems, and G550 reconnaissance aircraft. Morocco is the largest U.S. weapons buyer in Africa.” The overview said that Morocco signed a contract in 2019 to be provided with “technical support for their Abrams tanks.” “The Royal Moroccan Air Force flies F-16 fighters, C-130 transport aircraft, and CH-47D helicopters, among other U.S.-origin equipment, while the Royal Moroccan Navy operates modern frigates equipped with U.S.-origin digital communications” according to the government website. Morocco received 62% of its arms from the US between 2014-2018. Morocco also received 32% of its major arms from France, a second major supplier for Morocco. Export.gov said that   Spain is also among the list of major military suppliers to Morocco. “Morocco’s military expenditures totaled about $48 billion between 2005 and 2015,” the website added.

Rabat – The Confederation of African Football (CAF) issued a statement on August 1 following the Court of Arbitration for Sports’ (CAS) verdict on the ongoing dispute over the African Champions League final.  CAS officially dismissed CAF’s decision, taken on June 5, to replay the 2nd leg of the final between Wydad Athletic Club (WAC) and Esperance Sportive de Tunis (EST) in a neutral ground. The CAS explained that “the CAF executive committee was not competent to rule for a rematch of the second leg of the final and has therefore decided to annul that decision.” The CAF statement explained that the CAS annulled the decision for procedural reasons and that a summarized decision is yet to be issued. “The CAS Panel annulled the decision of the CAF Executive Committee only for procedural reasons. However, CAF has yet to receive the summarized decision,” said CAF in a statement. In its verdict, the CAS decided to refer the case to the competent CAF bodies to rule on the matter and apply the appropriate disciplinary sanctions.  In the statement, the African football body announced that its competent bodies will meet in the coming days upon the CAS request. “In this regard, CAF announces that the competent bodies will meet shortly to decide on the case and details will be communicated in due course,” said CAF

Rabat – Hamza bin Laden, the son and heir of Al Qaeda‘s founder Osama bin Laden, has been reportedly killed in an airstrike. The news came on Thursday, July 31, from three US officials who agreed to discuss his death with US media on the condition of anonymity. While the details remain scarce the officials did confirm that “the United States government played a role,” and that death occurred “sometime during the first two years of the Trump administration.” The Pentagon, as well US President Donald Trump and security advisor John Bolton, have declined to comment. In February, the US State Department announced it would pay as much as $1 million for information on Hamza bin Laden’s whereabouts, as his death had not yet been confirmed. The department’s Rewards for Justice Program described the Hamza bin Laden as “an emerging al Qaeda leader” who “has threatened attacks against the United States and allies.” In September 2017 article, counterterrorism expert and former FBI agent, Ali Soufan, echoed a similar statement. “Hamza is being prepared for a leadership role in the organization his father founded” and is “likely to be perceived favorably by the jihadi rank-and-file,” he said. “With the Islamic State’s ‘caliphate’ apparently on the verge of collapse, Hamza is now the figure best placed to reunify the global jihadi movement.” Commenting on the announcement of his death, Soufan warned the US government not to confirm anything too soon – as it is unusual for Al Qaeda to not announce the death of a leader and celebrate him as a martyr. However, he added that if the US officials are correct, “it significantly damages Al Qaeda’s plans for moving to the second generation.” The young bin Laden, who is believed to have been born around 1989, was added to the US’ official terrorist two years ago. Many speculated Al Qaeda was priming him to be his father’s successor. In 2011, his father Osama bin Laden was killed by US Navy Seals in a raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Bin Laden was responsible for the four attacks on the US on 11 September 2001, which killed nearly 3,000. The terror attacks are the deadliest ever on US soil. Intelligence reports that after his assassination, two of Al Qaeda’s top lieutenants began grooming Hamza bin Laden for a leadership role. He married the daughter of one of these lieutenants and pledged to avenge his father’s death. In recent years, al-Qaeda released 11 audio messages from Hamza bin Laden in which he threatened the US, called for attacks and encouraged jihadist action in Syria. The high price put on Hamza bin Laden’s head by the US shows the potential threat he could have posed. The CIA has already confirmed the death of two of his brothers, Saad bin Laden, who was killed in a drone strike in 2009 while he was operating in a remote area of Pakistan and Khalid, who was killed in the 2011 Abbottabad raid. However, the US is still hunting for Ayman al-Zawahri, who assumed the Qaeda leadership mantle after Osama bin Laden’s death.

Rabat – In Morocco, a country where seven out of ten women are unemployed, thousands choose to travel annually to Spain for work. In accordance with a bilateral agreement between the two countries, Moroccan workers are able to receive temporary visas for seasonal labor jobs in Spain’s strawberry fields. Women find these jobs through employment centers that promise good wages, comfortable accommodation, and health care.  The centers recruit based on age, sex, and marital status, both to offer opportunities to marginalized women and hire candidates less likely to stay in Spain after the harvesting season ends.  Once in Spain, many find conditions very different from what they were promised. Instead, the women live in overcrowded buildings, often working without pay. Multiple women have reported incidents of sexual harassment and assault at the hands of their employers. “Before I left my home I was like a hero to everyone. Nobody in my village had ever had the chance to go and work in a rich country like Spain,” one woman told the Guardian. “But it has turned out to be the worst decision of my life.” Valued at €580 million, Spain’s strawberry export business is Often referred to as “red gold”. Most strawberries are grown at farms in the Huelva province in southern Spain.  As part of a 2001 bilateral agreement between Morocco and Spain, almost 20 thousand Moroccan workers now travel to Huelva every year for seasonal work picking fruit. Last June ten Moroccan women filed complaints against their former employer, Spanish strawberry grower Doñaña 1998 d’Almonte, citing allegations of labor violations, sexual harassment, and abuse at the hands of their managers. The Moroccan nationals claimed they were forced to work long hours, denied bathroom breaks, and punished for not working fast enough. They said they were housed in dirty shipping containers, not the nice apartments they were shown at the recruitment centers. They often worked without pay, wages were often withheld until the women completed their seasonal contracts.  Unable to speak Spanish, the women struggled to defend themselves. Out in the fields, some said they suffered racial abuse. Some claimed they were sexually assaulted by their managers and others said they were raped. The ten women suing d’Almonte were part of a larger group of about 100 women who came forward last year with complaints of poor conditions on the farm in Huelva. A few days after reporting their plight, the women were forced onto buses and sent back to Morocco. Some had not yet received any payment for their months of work on the farm. Nine women managed to escape from the buses. With the help of local activists and a labor union, they joined another former worker to form the group of women involved in the lawsuit.  “They brought us to exploit us and then to send us back. I wish I drowned in the sea and died before arriving in Spain,” one woman told the New York Times. Unable to work, the ten women are now confined to Spain they await trial.  Spanish courts have been slow following through with the investigation. The Provincial Court of Huelva initially closed the case in December of 2018, but the women’s hopes were renewed in May when their case was reopened. The women’s’ difficulties stretch beyond Spain’s borders. Women who have suffered sexual abuse can be stigmatized in Morocco. After going public with the allegations last year, the women lost the support of their conservative families, and most of their husbands have filed for divorce. The ten women involved in the lawsuit are not the first or the last to come forward with allegations of abuse at the hands of their seasonal employers in Huelva. As early as 2010, El Pais reported on discrimination and assault Moroccan women endured on Spanish strawberry farms.  Despite previous reports of abuse and the ongoing lawsuit, Moroccan employment agencies continued to recruit women, posting new positions in January. Hundreds of women, some desperate for work and others lured by the promise of earning up to 3,500 Euros in one season, applied in person at an Agricultural Training Center in the rural town of Sidi Alal Tazi in January. “Here in Morocco, I work from four in the morning to five in the afternoon in the harvest of peas in exchange for 50 dirhams a day. If I work for three months in Spain (with daily wages ranging between 35 and 40 Euro) I will return with savings that will allow me to dedicate more time to my children,” Fatima Qazab, one of the women applying to work in Spain, told Spanish news agency Efe. The National Employment Promotion Agency (ANAPEC), headquartered in Casablanca, manages to hire and mediating between prospective job candidates and Spanish businessmen. The agency said it privileged women with dependent children, and especially those widowed or divorced, a practice General director Abdelmunim El Madani said helps “break the cycle of exclusion” of many rural women in Morocco. Whereas ANAPEC said this focus is designed to empower these women, others claim it makes the women more vulnerable.  Alicia Navascues, who works with women’s rights group Mujeres 24, told the Guardian “In Morocco, they are deliberately looking for those who are cheap and vulnerable to do this work, namely rural women with young children who only understand Arabic, cannot understand their contracts written in Spanish or claim their rights.” Early in July of this year, fresh allegations of abuse from the latest group of seasonal workers who began working in Huelva in February of 2019. “We were told we’d be treated like professional workers and be treated with dignity,” one of the women told the Guardian. “But when we got to Spain they made us feel like animals.”

Rabat – Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner is expected to make a second stop in Morocco. The visit seeks to gain support for the US economic project as part of the Middle East peace plan known as the “Deal of the Century.” International correspondent at the Washington-based National Public Radio Daniel Estrin quoted an anonymous US official, saying that Kushner is “visiting the Mideast with stops to Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Egypt, and Morocco.” Kushner started his tour on Wednesday, July 31, when he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as part of his tour. Andalou Agency reported that the official is expected to share details of the “Deal of Century” plan, which aims to resolve the Israel Palestinian conflict in favor of Israel. The deal focuses on an economic development approach in Palestine. Kushner told CNN in an interview that the deal’s focus will be the finding of a “realistic and viable” political future for the region. The Palestinian Authority, however, refused US mediation, especially in the wake of the US embassy’s relocation from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Kushner’s expected visit to Morocco will be the second in less than three months. Kushner first visited Morocco in May, when he was received by King Mohammed VI. The US adviser arrived in Morocco as part of his tour in preparation for the US-sponsored economic conference held in Bahrain in June with the participation of Morocco. A US official tells NPR that Jared Kushner is visiting the Mideast with stops to Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Egypt, and Morocco. — Daniel Estrin (@DanielEstrin) July 31, 2019  Kushner’s May visit touched on “bilateral relations and developments in the Middle East,” according to Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. Concerns were raised during Kushner’s visit, especially as Morocco has long shown unwavering support for the Palestinian cause. Rumors also emerged that Kushner disclosed information on his country’s Middle East Peace plan in Morocco. However, Bourita said that  the government does not know yet of “any peace plan for the resolution of the conflict.” “Morocco does not know yet of the content of any peace plan and will express its position when it will be informed about the details of the initiative,” Bourita said in May. In June, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated its unwavering support for the Palestinian cause.   Bourita said that Morocco’s position on the Palestinian cause is “constant.” He emphasized  that the country is steadfast in its stance to support the establishment of an “an independent, sovereign, and viable Palestinian state, with East Jerusalem as its capital.”

 Rabat – A young King with a new vision, a strategy based on action, a critical look, and an unprecedented capacity to mobilize the people and the political class, has been the mastermind behind a courageous leap towards the future.  The result has been a new Morocco, moving at an unprecedented speed, a fast-changing society, a new economic and social landscape, paired with growing expectations, a youth brimming with hope and questions, and a society which has tasted the fruits of development and freedom, and now wants more. To better prepare the country for this deliberate revolution promoted by a reforming King and citizens eager for prosperity and freedom, it was necessary to heal the wounds of the past, overcome the failures, and take care of the woes of recent history. “Reconciliation” became the watchword at the beginning of the King’s reign: to face the misfortunes of the past, to come to terms with them, to establish pardon as a method of governance, and to care for the victims.  Society recognizes its difficult moments and uses its culture to heal the wounds and to deliver justice without drama or witch-hunts. The core meaning of reconciliation allows for neither winners nor losers, but true forgiveness. It is a gift of hope among citizens, to a whole generation.  Unfortunately, no light has been shed on the period between 1956-1959 due to a lack of cooperation on the part of the post-Independence generation of leaders. Those ‘forgotten events’ now haunt the political class, as has been seen during the recent sad events in the Rif region.  The basics of a new model of authority based on an approach that guarantees respect for dignity and freedom within the framework of the rule of law have been put forward since the beginning.  The new model is still “a work in progress” but important milestones have been reached, notably in the 2011 Constitution which enshrines the universality of human rights and speaks of improved governance of the security apparatus (one of the recommendations of the Equity and Reconciliation Entity or IER).  The culture of “rights and duties” has yet to be translated into citizen behavior and acts of citizenship in the public space, but the efforts of schools, families, and the media in this field must be part of a long term vision wherein rights are always coupled with duties and responsibilities.  From a political point of view, the access of opposition parties to government, known as “alternance consensuelle” and the admission of an “Islamist” party into the political arena, both initiated by Hassan II in a concern for reconciliation and normalization, were consolidated in practice by the 2011 Constitution. The famous Article 47, which stipulates that the first party that wins the relative majority in elections will form the government, has been a request made by the USFP (the Socialist Union of Popular Forces) since the end of the Youssoufi Government in 2002 (when the latter came first in elections but a technocrat by the name of Driss Jettou was asked to form the Government). Democracy, a royal project  Elections are becoming more free overtime, paid votes and other practices persist, but government intervention is becoming less and less frequent (except for the 2016 parliamentary elections). Democratization is a long-term “reign project” that is consolidated by a real separation of powers, the establishment of strong institutions, the strengthening of the Parliament and the Head of Government’s powers, embryonic but advanced regionalization, increased participation of citizens in the management of public affairs, the establishment of the principle of accountability, and the recognition of the plurality of cultural and identity origins, especially with the recognition of Tamazight  an official language of the country (along with Arabic). Morocco is more free, more open, more dynamic politically, and more just than it was two decades ago. There are still reforms and adjustments to be made in the areas of human rights, the true sense of independence of the judiciary system, how government is formed, the need for an improved governance system for development management, and the freedom of expression and of the press. Some call for a new “generation” of political and economic reforms, which is normal for a country that is experimenting, innovating and on the move. Adjustments are always necessary to plan better for a more promising future for all Moroccans.  The idea of a polarized society between modernists and conservatives turned out to be cultural, sociological and historical “heresy”. The efforts made by some to administer a re-engineering of the political field in the light of a Manichean dichotomy of modernists versus conservatives that is strange to the culture and history of Moroccan society have only consolidated the unity of Moroccans around their King, their faith, and their territory.  The reforms initiated by King Mohammed VI and supported by Moroccans have made any interventionism (of a political nature) of the government ineffective, even unacceptable. Challenges relating to the protection of freedoms, especially freedom of the press and freedom of expression, and human rights still need to be addressed. However, Morocco is becoming more and more democratic, the field of freedoms is becoming larger, and the political field resonates with dynamism and debate. Moroccans have not yet reached the stage of a real debate of societal ideas and projects, but we must get there if we want to mobilize everyone for and around the same vision.  The socio-economic reforms desired by the King and the Moroccan people have irreversibly transformed the productive and social landscape of the country. The Moroccan economy is among the most diversified in Africa and the MENA region. GDP has almost tripled in the space of 20 years, from almost $ 42 billion in 1999 to $ 110 billion in 2019. Per capita income has doubled: $ 1,400 in 1999 and 3,000 in 2015. Morocco exported $ 10.5 billion in 1999, while in 2017 exports have reached $ 41 billion. The number of tourists reached 11 million in 2016 while they were 4 million in 2000. Before the 2000s, industry accounted for about 15% of GDP and employed only around 10% of the population. In 2017, it accounted for nearly 30% of GDP and 21% of jobs. Macroeconomic equilibrium is maintained despite a high level of public debt (including the debt of public institutions and local governments.) Measurable achievements  The leap forward in infrastructure is breathtaking, with a network of 37 ports, including 13 dedicated to foreign trade, 18 airports, 16 of which international, 1800 km of highways, with 60% of the population directly linked to the highway network, and 85 % less than an hour away from a highway, the first super-high-speed train in Africa, mega solar power stations, tax-free economic zones, logistical stations and industrial zones of international renown, several agropoles, giant seaside resorts for tourism, development projects for valleys and lakes extended in time and space, a financial center of choice in Casablanca and so on. At the social level, primary school enrollment has increased from 87% to 112% in 2017 (gross percentage). Poverty was reduced from 16.3% in 1998 to 4.8% in 2013. Life expectancy has increased from 68 to 76 in 18 years. Morocco has a rate of 20 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2017 compared to 63 deaths in 1990. Maternal mortality decreased from 112 cases per 100,000 live births in 2010 to 72.6 cases in 2018.  These figures speak for themselves, and are undeniable. Morocco today is very different from what it was twenty years ago. Nevertheless, there are still challenges to be met, failures to correct. The development model has reached its limits. The King spoke about it two years ago and reiterated it this week. We need to rethink our approach, our methods, our way of doing things, even our system of governance.  The private sector remains cautious and depends largely on government action. Private internal investment is chronically low. The tax incentives given to the real estate industry have had a negative effect on other sectors, including the industry itself, abandoned in favor of housing windfalls.  GDP growth remains at an annual average of 4%, a rate unable to absorb the thousands of young people on the labor market every year or to create a real added value that can improve the standards of living for Moroccans.  Access to credit, especially for SMEs/SMIs, still hampers the ability of small businesses, the real creators of jobs and value, to finance their projects. Corruption affects almost all sectors, as government action has yet to find the right approach to tackle this devastating scourge. The cost of the environmental degradation bill has been estimated at 3% of GDP by the World Bank.  Despite the significant achievements of the Green Morocco Plan, the ROI of public investment remains below expectations. Indeed, an annual investment of MAD 10 billion produces only MAD 12 billion of exportable value (rate of return of 1.2 to 1, compared with industry and tourism where profitability in exports can reach between 6 and 10 for 1).  Agricultural productivity is still below the level of rival countries, and the small farmer is still awaiting the transition to modern, solidarity-based farming that fully values the local product. The industry is still dependent on FDI and state incentives, and private national investment remains mixed, even timid. Tourism is expected to find new sources of sustainable growth in ecotourism, rural and cultural tourism, national tourism and niche markets such as MICE and luxury travel.    Morocco, a transformed country   The competitiveness of Moroccan companies is seeing slow improvement because of a lack of modern governance, a culture that does not sufficiently value talent and does not prioritize investment in digital industry, AI, high tech and R&amp;D. From a social point of view, the unemployment rate persists at an alarming rate, with 14.7% in urban areas in 2017. Overstressed, overtaxed, and limited in its ability to consume and contribute fully to the national economy, the Moroccan middle class does not receive enough attention from the government. Poverty is still prevalent in rural areas and in large pockets in cities. The lower middle class lives precariously and is vulnerable to social shocks. The education and health reforms have not yet made significant progress in digging the sectors out of the doldrums. Morocco, which, under the leadership of its young King, was able to correct the flaws of the past at the very beginning of the century, is now strong enough and better equipped to face these challenges. Reforms certainly create change, but change comes with its risks, failures and fractures. It is normal that challenges remain, and that is how nations move forward, by working, trying, and learning from their successes and failures. The Morocco of the future, more glorious, more prosperous, more just, will be built by allowing everyone to contribute to its making.  A new impetus is emerging on the horizon. A reorganization of the political and rights field is necessary by introducing new reforms that would clarify the roles of actors, put in place safeguards to further protect rights and freedoms, rethink the separation of powers, and strengthen the powers of the Head of Government and Parliament.  It is essential to complete the work of reconciliation with the past by targeting the Rif region and the setbacks of 1956-1959 and by putting in place real policies for the development of the regions impacted by past human rights abuses.  The prerequisites for the real takeoff of tomorrow’s Morocco are: i. pursuing the fight against poverty and vulnerability through direct cash transfers, designed and managed by women;  ii. strengthening the capabilities of the middle class through the reduction of the income tax to make up for private school expenses, and iii. the establishment of funds to support access to housing, to college, car acquisition, and leisure activities. Government must work more effectively on the employability of young people by acting through a better offer (more life skills, entrepreneurship, communication, etc.), a more fluid and timely access to temporary and alternate employment, flexible bridges between businesses and training centers, and the orientation of public investment towards strong job-creating sectors such as services, tourism, culture, technology, travel, sports, social entrepreneurship, etc. Investing in the future depends on setting up a real knowledge economy and society. Morocco must be able to reach 15,000 to 20,000 invention patents by 2035.  Education and training, priority projects To achieve this, we must invest in the offer of university training and research. Morocco must build 200 to 300 universities and world-class research centers in the next 15 years. It must also be able to invest 3 to 5% of GDP in research and development. A real Science, Technology, and Innovation Strategy over 20 years is paramount. Science and innovation must be the concern of schools, media, universities, civil society, and the private sector. The use of science and research in life and business must become sacrosanct. We need to overcome the gap that separates us from advanced countries by focusing on artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, robotics, 3D printing, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, flying vehicles, blockchain, genetics, space technology, energy storage, materials science, Big Data, etc. It is by entering the world of the Fourth Industrial Revolution through the “big gate” that we can create value, lasting value, which will transform the industrial and economic fabric of Morocco. The genius of a King and a people, who transformed Morocco and its economy in the space of twenty years, is also capable to hoist the country to the level of the best governed countries on the planet and to the level of the countries most capable of producing sustainable wealth from knowledge and science. The successes of the last twenty years must give us all the courage to work harder in the hope of achieving a better Morocco in the very near future. Provided we maintain faith in our collective genius, in our King, and in our culture. The rest will follow. Hope is the beacon that will guide our collective journey to our destiny, the fate of a nation that is searching for itself and that will definitely achieve its dream.

FRMF previously announced that the VAR would go into effect starting from the next football season. The 10-day-training starts Thursday, August 1 and aims to present the VAR basic elements to the Moroccan referees to ensure they are familiar with the technology. The referees will also be updated on FIFA’s new refereeing regulations, reported Assabah newspaper in its August 1 edition. FRMF has invited 110 referees and assistant referees of both genders to attend the training. They will also pass a fitness test. A Spanish company will carry out the project to set up the VAR across Moroccan stadiums. Assabah added that the Spanish company has finished evaluating Moroccan stadiums to ensure that they match VAR’s technical set-up requirements. A report will be prepared and submitted to FRMF’s president Fouzi Lekjaa. The Spanish company requires a minimum of 15-hour-training per referee. A video of the referees will be sent to FIFA to evaluate their readiness and efficiency before they can be officially named VAR Referees.

Rabat – The 2019 Women Danger Index listed Morocco as a place to avoid for female travelers. Morocco ranked eighth in an index of 50 countries prepared by Asher and Lyric Fergusson, two travel bloggers. Published on July 15, the index shows South Africa as the most dangerous country for solo travelers, with Brazil in second place, followed by Russia. Mexico ranks fourth, while Iran and Egypt rank fifth and seventh, respectively. The index takes into account several factors, including the percentage of women who feel safe walking alone at night, the intentional homicide of women index, and sexual violence. Morocco scored low in both legal discrimination and domestic violence. Morocco topped the list of the Top 10 Worst countries in terms of domestic violence. The list shows Morocco as the tenth worst country in terms of legal discrimination. This was defined in the blog post as, “Aggregate score for laws and regulations that limit women’s ability to participate in society and the economy or that differentiate between men and women.” In 2018, Morocco adopted Law 103-13 against gender-based discrimination to criminalize public harassments and all forms of violence, including sexual assault. Moroccan women and activists, however, questioned the efficiency of the law, especially after the publicization of several rape cases and violent incidents. The most recent infamous rape case hit headlines in July when a man violently raped a Moroccan woman in Rabat. The violent rape resulted in the woman’s death. Since then, female activists have been condemning the light sentences given to defendants charged with violence, rape, or sexual harassment. A government-sponsored survey shows that 12.4% of Moroccan women faced sexual assaults in public spaces in the past twelve months.  In addition to violence in public spaces, the index finds that domestic violence is “often underreported to varying degrees in each country.” A survey from the Moroccan government shows that the grim reality of domestic violence is worrying in Morocco and all the more difficult to tackle as the majority of women do not report it. According to the study,  a whopping 93.4% of sexual violence victims have not reported their plight to authorities. Morocco also scores low in “gender inequality.” Morocco ranks second in the top ten countries in terms of gender inequality on the index. While the index does not mention the incident, the brutal murder of two Scandanavian tourists in the Atlas Mountains near Mount Toubkal in December 2018 could be a defining factor in Morocco’s low scores on the index. Following the incident, several embassies upgraded security alert for terror risk. In addition to the US, Canada, and the UK also warned their citizens to exercise caution due to “terrorism” in Morocco. Despite concerns over sexual violence, several other indexes show Morocco to be as safe as most European countries. The 2019 Travel Risk map showed that Morocco the US and have a low-risk level. The map shows Morocco as the only country to have a low-risk level in North Africa, with Algeria and Tunisia classed as medium risk. The map helps organizations and travelers better understand the risks of each destination where they travel and operate.

According to the Irish Mirror, the bus driver had alerted the police “gardai” attached to immigration when he arrived at Dublin Port. In a video seemingly filmed by the bus driver, one of the teenagers emerged blackened by the engine’s dust and apologizing to the officers. The second teenager followed a few minutes later. Addressing the scared teenager, one of the gardai is heard saying, “you’ll be okay, there is no problem.” The Irish Mirror mentioned that “the gardai treat immigrants with compassion; they are used to police forces in their own countries being aggressive.” Answering the officer’s question, the teenager stated that he came from Morocco. He specified that he entered Europe through Spain. He then explained that he boarded the bus in London before traveling by boat to Dublin.
