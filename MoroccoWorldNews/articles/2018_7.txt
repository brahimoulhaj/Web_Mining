Rabat – Will the controversy over video assistant referee (VAR) ever be addressed? FIFA has invited coaches and presidents of its 211 football associations across the globe to attend a conference on the 2018 World Cup, which took place in Russia from June 14 to July 15. The world’s governing football body announced Monday, July 30, that it will host a conference on the recent World Cup on September 23 in London. The head coach of Morocco’s football team, Herve Renard, and the chairman of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) Fouzi Lekjaa will both take part in the event. According to FIFA’s FIFA , the conference aims to analyze “FIFA’s flagship competition from the technical and tactical angles.” FIFA added that the meeting will compare the 2018 World Cup with the previous tournaments, as well as discuss the implementation and impact of VAR. FIFA knows that several football teams and thousands of fans were not satisfied with the use of VAR throughout the Russia tournament. But FIFA may not choose to admit the alleged mistakes committed by referees in several games due to the “unjust” use of VAR. The football organization has denied all accusations against VAR and its referees, arguing that when using VAR, referees’ decisions were 99.3 percent correct. According to FIFA’s figures, VAR analyzed 335 incidents, including all goals, an average of 6.9 incidents analyzed per match. Morocco was one among several football teams to complain that VAR was not used to judge fouls in Morocco’s favor in its Potugal game, but the technology was used to allow an equalizer for Spain in Morocco’s last game. The issue caused Moroccan football fans to launch a petition to denounce the lack of VAR use in the Portugal game. Morocco World News contacted FIFA to ask about its stance on Moroccan fans’ accusations, but FIFA did not respond. In its Monday statement, FIFA said that the unprecedented meeting will be organized, hosting several symposiums for technical experts of confederations and members of football associations. “The World Cup in Russia has been a success both on and off the field, and with this conference we want to discuss the technical and tactical aspects identified in the field by our experts, while listening to feedback from our team,” said Deputy Secretary General of FIFA Zvonimir Boban.

Rabat – The Yves Saint Laurent Museum in Marrakech has announced it will exhibit the works of Moroccan photographer and videographer Leila Alaoui, who died during the 2016 terrorist attacks in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The exposition of Leila’s series “Les Marocains” will be open September 30 to February 5, 2019. The exhibit, organized by the Majorelle Foundation and the Leila Alaoui Foundation, will be free to allow Marrakchis and other Moroccans to share and appreciate Alaoui’s photography. Some exclusive photos taken by the late artist will be shared for the first time.  “Les Marocains” is a series of life-size photographic portraits taken in a mobile studio that Alaoui transported around Morocco. “Drawing on my own heritage, I have lived in various communities and used the filter of my native Moroccan position to reveal, in these portraits, the subjectivity of the people I photographed,” explained the artist in the presentation text of her project, which debuted in 2015. Born in 1982 in Paris, Alaoui studied photography at the University of New York City. Her work explored identity building, cultural diversity, and migration in the Mediterranean. Alaoui used photography and video art to express social realities through a visual language understood by all people. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally since 2009 and her photographs have been published in numerous newspapers and magazines. A victim of the terrorist attacks of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, on January 15, 2016, the young artist died suffering from multiple heart attacks.

Rabat – As street crimes —such as robbery and mugging— are a serious concern for police, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) has required police officers to carry their service weapons while on duty and in uniform. Abdellatif Hammouchi, the chief of Morocco’s DGSN, issued a circulated instruction this week to security prefectures throughout Morocco. The note specifies that all police officers in uniform must carry their personal service weapon. The instruction includes police officers and senior officers serving in cities traffic police, and police mobile brigades in charge of maintaining order. The note provides instructions on when and how to carry service weapons. The weapon should be attached on the right side of the belt. Owing to certain security responsibilities, some officers in uniform may conceal their service weapon. The DGSN emphasized the need for police to carry service weapons in order to ensure the safety of citizens by combatting street crimes and maintaining public order. Many Moroccan police officers have recently been using their service weapons against suspects carrying weapons and refusing to surrender to police. On June 28, a police officer shot 5 bullets, including two warning shots, at a man brandishing a knife in Temara. The suspect smashed the front windshield of two buses. When the suspect attempted to attack the bus passengers, the policeman fired his service weapon to disrupt the act. On June 19, a police officer of Kenitra’s mobile brigade used his weapon to stop and arrest several suspects escaping on a scooter. The police officer shot one suspect who was transported to a hospital and later died. The police officer managed to arrest three suspects among six. The suspects had committed armed robbery with a knife. After the incident, some members of the public and the family of the man killed marched in Kenitra to condemn the killing. Other Moroccans have reacted to uses of police force on social media. Some support the use of service weapons in public, saying that it could reduce street crimes and could have a deterrent effect. Others think police should not shoot to kill, but should only be allowed to shoot to injure suspected criminals if necessary to make an arrest.

Rabat – Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has supported Morocco’s request for resources to tackle undocumented migration and border issues. Sanchez allegedly sent a letter to the European Union Commission, urging it to provide Morocco with emergency assistance to face the challenges of undocumented migration to Europe. A gateway to both Africa and Europe, Morocco has been receiving hundreds of sub-Saharan migrants and refugees in recent years. According to British news outlet Euractiv, the EU has “approved” a €55 million grant to assist Morocco. The fund falls within the EU’s Border Management program and will provide resources for border guards in Morocco. EU officials told the outlet that the letter included other demands from several other governments, adding that the commission is “quickly” responding to the requests. The call for cooperation followed the latest crossing of nearly 700 migrants, who violently stormed the border fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta on the morning of July 26. On July 27, Spanish news outlet La Sexta quoted journalist Ignacio Cembrero as saying that Morocco’s Ministry of Interior has responded to Spain’s request, asking for €60 million in resources. “Morocco has drafted a long list of resources, including vehicles, helicopters, riot gear and radars, worth 60 million euros to fight irregular migration,” reported to La Sexta. Morocco’s stance is clear King Mohammed VI has expressed interest in solving migration issues in Africa, urging leaders to increase efforts to address the issue. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has said that migration requires concrete measures. After a meeting with Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Josep Borrell in June, Bourita said that his country would refuse any action from the European Union to outsource migrant reception centers to Morocco, describing such a solution as “easy.” The minister added that such steps cannot solve the issue of migrants but are “counterproductive” measures. Hundreds of migrants have also chosen the North African country as a destination instead of just a transit country. In May, Morocco’s National Committee in Charge of Monitoring Immigrant Regularization announced that the country is taking measures to regularize over 24,000 undocumented migrants.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has said that corruption wastes approximately 7 percent of Morocco’s GDP every year and claimed that the most effective way to deal with Morocco’s enduring economic and social problems is to fight corruption in public administration. El Othmani, who is also chairperson of the Justice and Development Party (PJD), made his remarks at a meeting of PJD-linked engineers and youth on Sunday, July 30, in Rabat. The country’s incumbent party had summoned the meeting to appraise Morocco’s economy and propose “a new development model” to meet the various challenges of the North African kingdom. In what seemed to be a direct response to King Mohammed VI’s Throne Day speech which called for immediate action to solve Morocco’s social and economic issues, El Othmani said that Morocco’s economy is suffering from dysfunctional public services and an ineffective redistribution of national resources.  Corruption is the biggest obstacle for Moroccan progress, El Othmani said. He added that other corruption-related practices, such as poor coordination between different ministries, also impede Morocco’s path to development. To bolster his claims, El Othmani said that the amount of money and resources that Morocco loses to corruption each year could build 150 schools and 300 hospitals. He concluded that a new development model for Morocco should include a responsible public service built on merit and political accountability. “Morocco is not short of resources, but of effective management,” El Othmani was quoted by Assabah as saying. He explained that implementing effective policies to tackle corruption is the surest way to ensure inclusive and society-oriented growth. Insufficient efforts The King’s Throne Day speech may have spurred El Othmani to make the remarks, but it was not the first time he acknowledged the country’s unsatisfactory record when it comes to fighting corruption and ensuring political accountability. In February, El Othmani said that Morocco’s is still underperforming in the fight against corruption and that the country’s development is held back by ineffective policy implementation.  Curbing financial corruption plays “a great role” in realizing equity and development, the PJD leader said at the time, complaining that Morocco’s corruption and accountability index is “still very low.” In late July 2017, the US State Department released a report identifying corruption and ineffective management as great concerns for Morocco’s economic growth. The report claimed that the kingdom’s development plans and efforts are considerably limited by corruption and inefficient management.  While Morocco has made a number of reforms to boost employment and growth and fight corruption, the government “does not implement the law effectively,” the report noted. It explained for example that the kingdom’s Central Commission for the Prevention of Corruption (ICPC) was “without senior leadership” throughout 2017.

Rabat – In 1958, an accidental fire nearly detonated a hydrogen bomb at the US Sidi Slimane military base between Rabat and Fez. The culprit was one of the rear wheels of a B-47 bomber carrying a nuclear bomb, which caught on fire. Many Moroccans could have lost their lives in a nuclear disaster. However, no one in Morocco knew of the incident at that time except Morocco’s King Mohammed V.  The US Department of Defense preferred to keep it secret, according to an account from the book “Command and Control” by Eric Schlosser. After World War II, the US wanted to install its military bases with nuclear weapons as close as possible to the (now former) Soviet Union, its enemy at that time. In 1951, France granted the US territory in Morocco to build a military airbase capable of deploying the B-36 and B-47 bombers. By 1954, the US had secretly stockpiled nuclear weapons at the base, unbeknownst to France. Two years later, when Morocco gained independence, national pressure mounted within the country to expel the US from their air bases. Under pressure, the US closed its bases in the fall of 1963. But before the US left the North African country, a catastrophic incident that could have killed many in Sidi Slimane was narrowly averted. On January 31, 1958, one of the rear wheels of a B-47 bomber caught on fire on the runway at the US air base at Sidi Slimane during a simulated maneuver.  The plane was carrying a Mark 36 bomb, a second-generation hydrogen bomb. The Mark 36 is an armed 4-ton atomic bomb. It was a transitional weapon, combining the old technologies of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan with new technologies.  The fire spread to the bomber’s fuel tank and destroyed it. Fortunately, the crewmen escaped without injury. But there was still danger that the bomb would detonate. Firefighters sprayed the remaining burning parts of the bomber and then withdrew.  According to Schlosser, “The flames reached the bomb, and the commanding general at Sidi Slimane ordered that the base be evacuated immediately.” Fortunately, the explosives in the bomb burned out but did not detonate. According to an accident report cited by Schlosser, the Mark 36 hydrogen bomb and parts of the B-47 melted into “a slab of slag material weighing approximately 8,000 pounds (about 4 ton), approximately 6 to 8 feet wide and 12 to 15 feet in length with a thickness of 10 to 12 inches.” The State Department preferred not to broadcast the news about the incident since “a public statement might be distorted by Soviet propaganda and create needless anxiety in Europe,” wrote Schlosser. When an American diplomat in Paris questioned what happened at Sidi Slimane base, the State Department responded that “the base commander had decided to stage a ‘practice evacuation.’” American witnesses to Sidi Slimane incident On April 12, 2013, the National Security Archive, a non-governmental research and archival institution in Washington, D.C., published an article on the Sidi Slimane incident. The history article received many comments by people claiming to be present at the time of the incident. They still remember that day. They were still children at the time and said their fathers worked for the US army. “I lived at Sidi Slimane when this happened and remember it well. My Dad was Army Corps of Engineers there to build air strip….” wrote Alexis Namasete. “The day of the evacuation I was in school – 2nd grade. We were let out and told to go straight home. There were vans driving around the base telling everyone we were being evacuated. We were the last to leave as it was Dad’s responsibility to make sure everyone was off before us. Mom kept suitcases packed with clothes and food for these types of situations. We went to Port Lyautey and I don’t think we even spent the night,” he added. Since the bomb could have leaked radiation after the incident, Namasete recalled, “We had to take our pee to school in a jar to be tested. I don’t remember anyone ever telling us what they were testing for.” Adrienne Perry, a 5th grader, was also at Sidi Slimane when the incident happened. “My parents also had positions of responsibility and insisted I evacuate with people that I barely knew because they had to stay behind,” he wrote. Perry described the situation, saying “It was a truly terrifying experience.” “What I remember most is the massive cloud of black smoke that followed us all the way to Port Lyautey,” he added. Port Lyautey, approximately 50 kilometers away from Sidi Slimane air base, is the former name of Kenitra. It was named by France in 1933 after French General Hubert Lyautey. The city was renamed Kenitra in 1956 when Morocco gained independence. The incident in Morocco is said to be one of the most serious near disasters. Since 1950, the US has had 32 accidents involving nuclear weapons across the world known as “Broken Arrows.”

Rabat – Two months after the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, President Donald Trump has said that he is willing to meet his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, without preconditions. The potential meeting was later rejected by both members of Trump’s administration and Rouhani’s advisers. Trump’s assertion came in a joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, in Washington D.C. on Monday. When asked whether he would be willing to meet his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani, Trump said, “I would certainly meet with Iran if they wanted to meet. I don’t know that they’re ready yet. They are having a hard time right now. I ended the Iran deal. It was a ridiculous deal. I do believe that they will probably end up wanting to meet and I’m ready to meet any time that they want to.”    The US withdrew from the Iranian nuclear deal in May, which led to the country reimposing sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. The deal was agreed and signed by the US, the UK, France, Germany, Russia, China, and the European Union. An adviser to the Iranian president said on Tuesday that any talks with the US had to start with reduced hostility and a return to the international Iran nuclear deal.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI, accompanied by his son, Prince Moulay El Hassan, inaugurated a mosque in Tangier and named it “Princess Lalla Abla,” before performing the first prayer in the new mosque on Monday, July 30. The mosque’s name honors the King’s grandmother, Lalla Abla bint Tahar, who was the second wife of King Mohammed V and the mother of King Hassan II. The mosque, built for approximately MAD 26 million, is a part of the integrated redevelopment program of the Tangier-city port area. “Princess Lalla Abla” is located at the end of Avenue Mohammed VI in front of the new fishing port of Tangier that was inaugurated on June 7 by the King.  Tangier’s new mosque was built according to Moroccan architectural standards. It has an indoor reception capacity of more than 1,900 people on a plot of 5,712 square meters. “Princess Lalla Abla” has all the necessary amenities for worshipers including two prayer rooms (men and women), housing for the imam and muezzin, shops and an esplanade of 2,720 square meters.

By Dil Bola  Rabat – Moroccan women once again stole the spotlight with a third-place finish at the World Taekwondo World Cup Team Championships this weekend in Wuxi City, China.   The Moroccan women’s taekwondo team displayed their eloquent yet powerful skills in the Korean martial art by winning their first match against the Ivorian selection by a substantial amount (8-77). The team’s second match against the South Korean team, although difficult, ended in Morocco’s favor (51-50) but the semi-final fight went to the Chinese, who snatched the gold medal win.   In contrast, the Moroccan men’s team was eliminated within the first round. Their brief victory against Côte d’Ivoire (110-78) ultimately led to a frustrating loss against South Korea (48-94).     Taekwondo is a grueling and strenuous Korean martial art characterized by self-defense principles, the art of concentration, and the theory of power. Reaction force, equilibrium, mass, speed, and breath control is all taken into account as head-height kicks, jumping kicks, spinning kicks, and fast kicking techniques are all emphasized in the competitive point-by-point system.   Earlier this year, the African Taekwondo Championships were not only held in Morocco but dominated as well by the host nation. The Moroccan team won four gold medals at the Inbiaat Sports Hall in Agadir—three of the medals were earned by Moroccan women.   Further, the African Championships in March significantly highlighted the influence of the Moroccan women’s team during the under-73-kilogram match. The gold medal win by Chaimae Kriem displayed her resilience in the women’s taekwondo selection as she defeated the Rio 2016 Olympic bronze medallist, Hedaya Malak of Egypt.   Throughout the last few years, the Moroccan women’s selection has taken the Korean martial arts’ world by storm as they repeatedly exhibit their power and influence by frequently placing within the top three positions.   The Moroccan women’s third-place victory at the World Championships, which ended over the weekend, was achieved by the selection composed of Ouiam Dislam, Oumaima Elbouchti, Nada Laaraj, and Ouafaa Elaatri.

Rabat – Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) arrested a Turkish family in possession of six forged passports in the northern coastal city of Nador on Monday. The Turkish family, two parents and four teenaged children, entered the country through Casablanca’s Mohammed V International Airport with their real passports. However, on their way out of the country, airport security forces discovered six false Syrian passports in their possession. The family is currently being held in custody, pending an investigation by DGSN to determine the story behind their forged passports. Earlier this month, police in Morocco arrested an undocumented Algerian resident in Morocco who, along with another Algerian national, was involved in the premeditated burglary of a hotel room occupied by a Saudi Arabian national in Marrakech.

Rabat – Former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has expressed confidence that the new Spanish government led by Pedro Sanchez will preserve the positive diplomatic bonds between Morocco and Spain. Zapatero attended the reception ceremony chaired by King Mohammed VI on Monday in Tangier to celebrate the 19th anniversary of his accession to the throne. “I am convinced that this positive relationship between our two countries will be further consolidated with the new Spanish government,” Zapatero said. Zapatero’s remarks reiterated those made by King Felipe VI of Spain during the 5th World Congress of Middle East Studies (WOCMES) held on July 10 in Seville. In his statement at the event, the Spanish king saluted the bonds uniting the two countries, emphasizing, “The relations between Morocco and Spain are strategic because we are neighbors who have shared concerns and who face common challenges.” King Felipe VI also called for more efforts to reinforce diplomatic ties between the two countries. Zapatero agreed with the Spanish king and underscored the importance of strengthening the links between Spain and Morocco for the benefit of both countries. The former prime minister also commended the contributions of Madrid and Rabat in solving the challenges faced by Africa and Europe. He also expressed gratitude for being invited to attend the reception ceremony, saying he was “very honored.”  Spain’s new government has already expressed determination to work with Morocco on some challenges, including migration issues. Prime Minister Sanchez said he was interested in reinforcing cooperation with migrants’ countries of origin, transit, and destination, “especially Morocco.” In a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Sanchez said that migration is a “global challenge that requires European responses.”  Those responses, they said, should be based on “solidarity and respect for human rights” and aimed at providing “an effective response to the arrival of refugees and migrants.” King Mohammed VI also received former Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Miguel Angel Moratinos, along with other officials and former prime ministers of several countries for the Throne Day celebrations. The ceremony followed King Mohammed VI’s speech delivered from the city of Al Hoceima on Sunday, July 29.

Rabat – Adel Taarabt may return to the French league. According to sports outlet Goal, the Moroccan international midfielder is currently in discussions with French club FC Nantes for the coming season.  The Atlas Lion, accompanied by some family members, met the president of FC Nantes, Waldemar Kita, on Monday, July 30, to negotiate a contract.  Last season Adel Taarabt played 22 Serie A games with Genoa. He made 18 starts and scored two goals and two assists. The Moroccan joined the Italian club in 2017 on loan from Benfica, with whom he has a contract until 2020.  Taarabt, who trained at RC Lens, has already played with some prestigious clubs, including Tottenham, Fulham, AC Milan, and Benfica. However, the 29-year-old football player has developed a bad reputation. In multiple clubs, he has had trouble getting along with his teammates.  As for his career with the national team, Taarabt has not played for Morocco for over 3 years. Last year, he expressed a wish to be part of Hervé Renard’s list for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Unfortunately, given his controversial past, Taarabt did not make the cut.  Taarabt made a number of mistakes while playing for the Moroccan team. On the eve of the national team’s match against Algeria during the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, he decided to leave the training camp and consequently did not play the match. Taarabt immigrated to France with his family when he was only 11 years old. “People, especially Moroccans, do not know that I always felt pressure. People were always expecting me to be the future Zinedine Zidane [former French footballer], a pressure that was always difficult to manage.” While he knows he will not be able to forge a better career, Taarabt does not regret what he has done so far. “I have already played for famous international teams, like Tottenham Hotspur, Queens Park Rangers, Benfica, which itself is an achievement.” Taarabt also played for France’s national under-17 and under-19 teams.

Rabat – FIFA President Gianni Infantino congratulated King Mohammed VI on Throne Day, Monday, at Marchaine Royal Palace in Tangier. The King welcomed several international personalities who greeted and congratulated him on the 19th anniversary of his accession to the throne. FIFA’s 48-year-old Swiss-Italian president, Gianni Infantino, was among the guests. A video broadcast by Moroccan television channels showed Infantino smiling at the King, shaking hands with him, and murmuring a few words to him. Despite the recent turbulence between Infantino and Morocco over the kingdom’s 2026 World Cup bid, Morocco invited the FIFA president to attend the celebrations for Throne Day.  Infantino is expected to stay through the end of the two-day celebrations Tuesday. Many Moroccans accused Infantino of trying to sabotage Morocco’s candidacy to host the 2026 World Cup in order to let the North American United 2026 bid win the hosting rights. Football fans also blamed FIFA for prioritizing “big” teams in Russia and foregoing the use of video assistant referee (VAR) for “small” teams, leading to Morocco’s early elimination from the 2018 World Cup.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI received Monday in Tangier’s royal palace Aicha El Khattabi, daughter of Moroccan iconic activist and politician Abdelkrim El Khattabi. Aicha attended the Throne Day ceremony chaired by King Mohammed VI at the Marchane palace in Tangier. In a statement to the press, Aicha said that the people of Al Hoceima province are aware of the King’s efforts to improve their living conditions. Aicha also expressed her hope that government will “solve the situation” of both the imprisoned Hirak Rif activists. In June, a court in Casablanca gave sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years for 54 Moroccan activists for their involvement in the Al Hoceima protests in 2016 and 2017. She also recalled that after King Mohammed VI ascended to the throne in 1999, he contacted her and her family “by telephone to inform us that he will make his first visit to Al Hoceima and the Rif region.” After the call, El Khattabi and her brother Said came back to Morocco from Egypt to greet the King. Concluding her statement, El Khattabi said that Morocco will always be a united nation. Throne Day came after a week after the celebration of the 97th anniversary of Annual Battle led by Abd El Krim El Khattabi on July 22, 1921. The ceremony started at 2:15 p.m. marking the attendance of many local and international officials, including FIFA chairman Gianni Infantino.  José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, former head of the Spanish Government; Miguel Angel Moratinos, former Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation; Akinwumi Adesina , President of the African Development Bank; Jacques Diouf, Diplomat, Former General Director of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); Adnan Amin, General Director of the Agency International Renewable Energy Association (IRENA) also attended the ceremony. The ceremony followed King Mohammed VI’s speech delivered from the city of Al Hoceima on Tuesday, July 29. To celebrate the Throne Day, the Royal Moroccan Air Force (RMAF) will organize air shows above Martil sea resort northeast of Tetouan and above M’diq, located between Ceuta and Tetouan on July 30 and July 31.

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat- Moroccan karateka Achraf Ouchen, 21, triumphed with a knockout win in a fight against the Spanish karate champion, Franklin Mina, on Saturday at the 2018 Karate Combat Olympus in Athens, Greece. Ouchen was competing in the 93-kilogram category. Olympus was the second event of the Karate Combat fighting league’s inaugural season. It aired at 9:30 p.m. local time (7:30 p.m. Moroccan time). Fans can watch the highlights or see the entire fight for free at karate.com. Ouchen first made a name for himself as a finalist in the Senior World Championships when he was just 18 years old. In an interview with Morocco World News, Ouchen cited this as the accomplishment that really boosted his career. “My first time participating in a world championship, I received a medal for the juniors’ category and in the next one I obtained gold—making me world champion in the under 21 year-olds’ category.”  Speaking about his 2017 win at the Senior World Championships in Linz, Austria, Ouchen said, “During my 3rd consecutive world championship, I made history; this was the first and only silver medal a Moroccan ever received in a Senior World Championship.” Ouchen was born in Nador, Morocco, but is currently residing in the capital Rabat where he is in the third year of his university degree in sport sciences. He commutes between the cities and trains in both.  Ouchen is truly passionate about karate—a sport in which he feels he can fully showcase his skills. Engaging in other sports, the young sensation never felt he could display his full potential or strength. “With the opportunities that the Karate Combat style offers, you can enjoy knocking-out people to the floor and not worrying that you’ll get a penalty or lose the fight for having too much power in your strike. In Karate Combat, you can enjoy your knockout and be the champ of the fight!” Ouchen explained. The athlete continued, saying that his previous fight in Budapest “was really an emotional moment for me because I was fighting in the kind of style that I feel most free and comfortable with… winning that fight against a strong opponent gave me a huge boost and the confidence to work harder and shine even more in my next fights.”  Ouchen is very confident regarding the future of his career. The athlete sees Karate Combat as a great way to introduce future generations to the sport.  “I have all the possibilities in front of me. I can fight Pro and also compete to qualify for the Summer Olympics of 2020,” he anticipated.  Ouchen explained he first developed an interest in karate at the age of 6. He elaborated: “My parents chose this martial art to fill my free time—and to keep me away from violence and troubles in the streets.” “My first coach in the dojo noticed that I had skills and I had potential in karate. He made me train extra sessions and made karate a lifestyle for me. School, karate, eating, sleeping—that is what made me admire this sport and make it part of my life.” Concluding his interview, the champion emphasized that he really believes that Karate Combat is a cornerstone in founding a new era of professional combat sports.

Rabat – Moroccans living overseas have received special thanks from Minister Delegate in Charge of Moroccans Residing Abroad and Migration Affairs Abdelkrim Benatiq, who emphasized their important role in defending Morocco’s national cause across the globe. In a meeting held on Sunday in Skhirat, a coastal city 45 kilometers south of Rabat, Benatiq underscored the contribution of Moroccan expats to consolidate their ties with their homeland. The official then said that the number of Moroccans living abroad is estimated at 5 million. He added that wherever Moroccans are living, they always show concern for issues related to their country. The meeting was dedicated to evaluate several issues of concern to MREs, including investment. According to the minister, Moroccan expats “represent a model of coexistence and respect for each other’s beliefs.” To express gratitude for the expats, Benatiq said that his ministry is working to implement programs to further consolidate the ties between Moroccans and their country of origin. These programs, according to the official, are part of the national strategy aimed at preserving the identity of the members of the Moroccan community overseas. It is also designed to protect their rights, interests, and to promote their adhesion to the development of Morocco. The meeting also marked Morocco’s ongoing celebration of Throne Day, which started on July 29 and will continue until Tuesday, July 31. Head of the Moroccan Center for Strategic Studies Mohammed Benhammou emphasized in a statement to Maghreb Arab Press that unity and territorial integrity are a priority for Moroccan foreign policy. He added that the country is in a strong position on all diplomatic levels. Khalid Chagraoui of the Institute of African Studies said that Moroccan investments in Africa are of strategic importance. He noted that Africa is full of natural resources, including 260 million hectares of undeveloped agricultural land that could improve food security on the continent. He added that Morocco has considerable experience in agriculture and food industries. Earlier this month, Benatiq said that the number of Moroccans returning may peak in the last two weeks of July before Eid Al Adha, the “Festival of Sacrifice,” the second of two Islamic holidays celebrated worldwide annually. Morocco is expected to celebrate Eid Al Adha on August 22. The official claimed that 961,000 Moroccan expats returned to Morocco on July 17 alone.

Rabat – Ahed Tamimi was finally freed from Israel’s HaSharon prison Sunday morning and held a press conference at the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar, in the occupied West Bank. The 17-year-old broke down in tears when she received a tremendous and emotional welcome from her family and supporters in front of her house in the village of Nabi Saleh. A vast crowd assembled at a press conference devoted to Tamimi upon her release from prison. Tamimi held the conference along with her father Bassem and mother Nariman. Tamimi was sentenced to 8 months in prison after she and her cousin appeared in a video yelling at and pushing two armed soldiers from her family’s front yard. The Palestinian girl was convicted of assaulting an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier. Her mother, Nariman, also sentenced to 8 months, was released the same day. Speaking at the press conference, Tamimi first thanked everyone who supported her during her incarceration. She said she was extremely happy to be back “in the arms” of her family. However, Tamimi could not fully rejoice since other Palestinian women and girls are still in prison. “My happiness is not complete without my sisters, who are not with me. I hope that they will also be free.”  Tamimi said she is planning to pursue her studies in law in order to “hold the occupation accountable.” The brave Palestinian teenager spoke out about Palestinian women’s continuous role in the struggle against the Israeli occupation of their land. “In the end I want to say that the power is with the people, and the people will and can decide their destiny and decide the future. Women are a key part of the Palestinian struggle for freedom, and the women’s role will continue to expand, not only in the struggle but by producing new generations that can continue the struggle. We say: ‘Leave, leave occupation.'” Both of Tamimi’s parents also expressed their feelings at the conference. Tamimi’s father Bassem described his daughter’s and wife’s release as “a very happy moment.” Her mother Nariman said, “As a parent, I want to say that we shouldn’t be afraid of our children and we should support them in whatever they choose to do. They are being killed whether in our homes or resisting in the streets, so support them in resistance.”  Tamimi’s aunt, Manal, hoped that Tamimi’s release would shift international attention from Nabi Saleh to Israeli prisons, where many Palestinians are detained. “Now the whole world knows about what’s happening here [in Nabi Saleh]. But what’s important now is for Ahed to inform the whole world about the experiences and treatment of [Palestinian] women and minors in Israeli prison,” she told Al Jazeera. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas received Tamimi in Ramallah and praised the model she presented to the Palestinian cause. “The popular resistance model is the best weapon to confront the [Israeli] occupation and to show its savagery to the world,” he said.

Rabat – On Throne Day, Morocco’s Bank Al Maghrib announced it will issue a new commemorative coin with a value of MAD 250. The announcement came on the 19th anniversary of King Mohammed VI’s ascension to the throne. The bank will begin selling its new coin on August 1 in its locations across Morocco and the Currency Museum in Rabat. The bank is setting the price of the coin at MAD 550. The face of the coin features the figure of King Mohammed VI and the inscriptions “Mohammed VI” and “Kingdom of Morocco” in Arabic. The reverse of the coin has the inscription “19th anniversary of the ascension of the King to the throne” in Arabic and French. The coin is composed of silver (92.5 percent) and copper (7.5 percent). The coin weighs 28.28 grams, with a diameter of 38.61 millimeters. The governor of Morocco’s central bank, Abdellatif Jouahri, met with King Mohammed VI in Al Hoceima Sunday evening, and presented the monarch with statistics on the performance of the bank in 2017. Jouahri emphasized that the domestic economy grew at a rapid rate last year. The local economy expanded by 4.1 percent, owing to good climatic conditions for agriculture and overall economic recovery. Today in Tangier, the King was to chair a reception ceremony at Tangier’s Marchaine Palace at 2:15 p.m. to celebrate his ascension to the throne in 1999, according to a statement from the Ministry of the Royal House, Protocol, and Chancery on Sunday.

Rabat- In a large meeting with government ministers on Monday, July 30, to discuss measures needed to accelerate projects mentioned in his Throne Day speech, the King pledged to personally supervise development projects.  For the 19th anniversary of King Mohammed VI’s accession to the throne, the monarch gave his customary ceremonial speech addressed to the Moroccan nation from the capital city of the Rif region, Al Hoceima. Following the speech, the sovereign attended a meeting with Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, Minister of State in charge of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid, Interior Minister Abdelouafi Laftit, Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Boussaid, and Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch, among other ministers.  At the closing of the meeting, the sovereign pledged to personally supervise the relevant projects and remove all that might hinder their progress. The King stressed that special attention should be paid to achieving trust and social justice in the Moroccan society between economic and political  trade unions and by using the country’s resources fairly. The King reiterated the need to improve social supports and create more job opportunities and business facilities. The King also gave high priority to the development of education and the health system and the 2025 water plan to solve shortage problems in many regions of Morocco during the discussion. As per the speech, the King urged ministers to focus on the ‘RAMED’ health coverage program, suggesting that they should collectively work to correct the country’s health system “characterized by blatant disparities and poor management” and bring positive change for citizens.

Rabat – Abdellatif Jouahri, the governor of Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM), Morocco’s central bank, has called for radical reforms and a new developmental model adapted to the country’s current problems, saying that the North African kingdom “needs an economic leap forward” to address its numerous economic and social issues. Speaking at the behest of King Mohammed VI on Sunday, Jouahri noted Morocco’s improving banking sector. The King had called for a meeting of ministers and high-ranking officials hours prior to his traditional Throne Day speech on Sunday, July 29. According to BAM’s governor, the flow of investments and a strong global economy allowed Morocco’s economy to grow at an impressive pace of 4.1 percent in 2017. “This improvement led to the creation of an important number of jobs,” Jouahri explained. He noted that despite the surge in job creation between 2017 and 2018, the volume of Morocco’s needs made the country’s positive economic outlook “insufficient.” He said Morocco failed to satisfy the growing demands of an increasing number of job seekers.   While the country’s current inflation rate and investors’ confidence point to a positive economic atmosphere, Jouahri said Moroccan authorities should adapt the economic development model to present challenges. According to BAM’s governor, formulating such an up-to-date economic model should involve a revision of the Morocco 2030 plan to refocus on promoting education, specialized training, and social inclusion in all crucial sectors. Jouahri advocated for revised retirement regulations and more assistance to low-income families, saying that wages and retirement pensions should be adjusted to the inflation level to have “wages that reflect prices” and ensure “social cohesion, effectiveness, and productivity.” “Morocco needs to leap forward by mobilizing all its driving forces to provide an economic climate conducive to investments, economic growth, and job creation.” Jouahri’s plea was hours later followed by King Mohamed VI’s Throne Day speech in commemoration of 19 years of leadership since he ascended to the throne in 1999. The King urged immediate action to tackle the country’s social and economic problems.  The King called on government officials, political institutions, and all “important national stakeholders” to help bridge the widening inequality gap and mitigate social exclusion by implementing effective policies and promoting a sincere and inclusive social dialogue.

From humorist to politician? Rabat – Moroccan-French comedian Jamel Debbouze again told his fans in an interview with French outlet “Le Journal Du Dimanche” that he refused a position in the French government as a secretary of state.  However, Debbouze did not specify which government had offered him the position. “If I tell you more, we will only remember that!” he said.  The 43-year-old actor joked that he is doing “the job of the Ministries of Culture, Youth and Labor” through his Jamel Comedy Club and its associative commitments. The actor of “Les indigènes” also recalled his friendship with King Mohammed VI, who helped Debbouze build his career. “I’m very proud of our friendship, hope it will last forever.”  Last year, the comedian had also mentioned the political proposition on French radio RMC. “I was asked to be secretary of state, secretary of state for… What is it called?” He explained that he refused the offer “because it is obviously not my job, because I will be bored to death, because that is where I would be the least effective and the most criticized.” Debbouze is currently busy touring for his new show “Maintenant ou Jamel” (Now or Jamel) and running his comedy club. After six years of absence from the comedy scene, Debbouze made a successful comeback on his favorite playground: the stage. Very close to his audience, the comedian talked about his fears, his role as a father, and his career. The committed artist often mocks political figures, such as Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump, while also discussing subjects like racism and terrorism. The Paris native has starred in many movies, including the historical movie, “Days of Glory,” which he also co-produced in 2006. Debbouze also inaugurated his own comedy club in 2008, opening opportunities for amateur stand-up comedians. Every year, the comedian organizes “Marrakech du Rire,” which serves as a “link between cultures,” uniting hundreds of comedy fans for the world’s premier Francophone stand-up comedy festival.

Rabat – A World Bank-sponsored report on global trade connectivity and logistics performance has revealed Morocco’s poor performance in terms of logistics and international shipments quality, casting a grim light on the North African kingdom’s recent reforms to improve its “doing business” indicators.  A connected world “Connecting to compete,” as the 82-page document is called, is a biennial report that gathers data from surveys with logistics workers worldwide—both workers on the ground and company leaders—to assess how well-integrated countries are in the global economy, especially in terms of service delivery quality and supply chain management.  This year’s edition was published on July 24 and covered nearly 6,000 country assessments made by logistics professionals across 160 countries. The report shines a light on how countries are keeping pace with an increasingly globalized world with “shifting priorities” in the highly mobile global market. While the document presents Morocco as one of the few developing countries that have integrated logistics performance as an essential part of their reforms and policies and “have set up national strategies” and organizations dedicated to the advancement of logistics, numbers this year indicate a poor overall performance for the kingdom. Morocco performed better in 2016 Morocco, which occupied the 96th position in the 2016 Logistics Performance Index, is now 109th, putting it far behind many MENA countries: Egypt and Tunisia both outperformed their North African neighbor in the index.  In the broader MENA region, Morocco’s current position is near the bottom, among the region’s worst performers.  United Arab Emirates (11th), Qatar (30th), Oman (43rd), Saudi Arabia (55th), Bahrain (59th), and Kuwait (63rd) are the region’s top performers, whereas Egypt (67th), Iran (67th), Lebanon (76th), and Jordan (84th) fared relatively well at the global level.  Morocco’s regression in this year’s index is partly due to the decreasing quality of delivery speed and tracking. Although Moroccan shipments are reported to meet quality criteria by 82 percent, the report notes that airport and port supply chains take more time than is usually necessary when exporting or importing goods.  The kingdom ranks 115th in terms of customs, 103rd in international shipments, 101st in logistics quality and competitiveness, 112th in tracing and tracking, and 114th in timeliness—suggesting sluggish delivery systems despite efforts to boost connectivity both domestically and internationally.  Algeria also backsliding But for all its inability to meet its own and global logistics standards, Morocco largely outperformed neighbor Algeria and Libya, which tied for 117th.  Libya’s poor performance can be blamed on its “fragile economy, armed conflicts, and political unrests.” But the report found that Algeria’s poor performance is the result of insufficient governmental actions to promote quality B2B (business to business) activities and a dwindling private sector. Algeria has been consistently underperforming in recent years, the report indicated. The North African country used to be among Africa’s and the MENA region’s top performers, with ranks of 76th and 96th in 2016 and 2014, respectively. Uneven ground According to the report, however, developing countries’ worsening rankings are perhaps more an indicator of a structural problem in the highly unequal global market than of failures in domestic policies. “The toll can be particularly heavy for developing countries trying to compete in the global marketplace,” the report said, underlining that the top 10 performers are all developed countries whereas the bottom 10 are all developing or low-income countries, “most in Africa.” Not surprisingly then, Germany tops the rankings while Europe (with 8 representatives in the top 10) is leading the dance for quality delivery and logistics performance. Japan and Singapore are the only-non-European countries in the global top 10.

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat- Tangier, nestled in the Strait of Gibraltar, is nicknamed the “Gateway to Africa” for its proximity to Europe. The city is a popular destination for cruise ships and is foremost a port city. It is connected to 174 ports from 74 countries on 5 different continents. One of Tangier’s appeals is that there are ferry rides from Morocco to Spain. In fact, you can see the edge of Spain from Tangier’s Cape Spartel, a promontory (and popular viewing point) located 300 meters above sea level.  Tangier experienced a period of relative touristic obscurity after World War II compared to other areas of Morocco, but has been drawing more and more tourism. The increase is partly due to the appeal of its primary attraction—the Caves of Hercules, situated just 14 kilometers west of the city. King Mohammed VI has also been personally promoting the region as a tourist destination. Tangier has undergone increasing modernization, including the construction of the business district “Tangier City Center” and a new football stadium. In August, it will also host Brave 14, the first global mixed martial arts (MMA) event ever to take place in Africa and the final Spanish Super Cup football match. A new luxury port has been built adjoining the ancient medina (old city), which has also recently been restored. The port is an area more wealthy visitors can dock their boats at while touring the Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, palm trees have been planted in many of Tangier’s main streets in an attempt to decorate the city. Over the years, the city has been a link between various cultures. In the past, Tangier was both an Amazigh (Berber) town and a Phoenician trading center. It also passed through the hands of the Romans, Vandals, Visigoths, and the Umayyad Empire. A Carthaginian Empire settlement dating back to the 5th century B.C. called “Tingis” by the Greeks inspired Tangier’s current name. As of 1923, colonial powers considered Tangier a city of “international status” and it became a landing for diplomats, businessmen, and spies. It was also a mecca for gamblers and an “El Dorado” for the upper class.  Essentially, Tangier was not under the jurisdiction of Morocco for a long period of time. From 1923-1928 it was deemed a “neutral demilitarized zone” under the joint administration of Spain, France, and the United Kingdom. Beginning in 1928, it also was administered by Portugal, Italy, and Belgium, and in 1929, the Netherlands joined on. The United States followed during World War II, using Tangier as its operation base for its Office of Strategic Services. As of 1956, Tangier was reintegrated into Morocco. Due to its complex administrative history, it became well-known for being a hub of cultural and religious diversity.  According to popular legend, the demigod Hercules founded Tangier. Amazigh mythology suggests it was founded by Surfax, a different hero from Amazigh and Greek mythology. Caves of Hercules. This is Tangier’s main attraction. Legend has it that Hercules spent the night in a grotto in Tangier before embarking on his 11th out of 12 labors. He was charged to steal the golden apples of the Hesperides sisters, said to grant immortal life.  The main cave has two entrances: one that faces the sea and one that opens toward land and is accessible to visitors. The cave gets its fame from its seaward-facing entrance, which is shaped like the continent of Africa and known as “The Map of Africa.” The site holds both mythological and archaeological importance. It is part natural formation and part man-made. The cave was originally much smaller, but the Amazigh people carved stone wheels out of the walls for millstone construction, considerably expanding the site, and the Phoenicians carved eye-shaped patterns into the walls. Before the site became a popular tourist attraction, it was used as a brothel in the 1900s. Admission to the cave is free and there is a snack shop as well as a cafe which overlook the sea. Visitors can also follow a set of stairs that lead down to a quaint beach. There is also a second, smaller cavern before the main entrance where visitors can pay a small MAD 5 fee to enter and take photos of the Greek-style decorations. A photo op with a parrot is available for an additional price, and guides charge MAD 5. Cape Spartel. This is a vantage point with a lighthouse located 300 meters above sea level. It is a great spot to take scenic photos and admire the Strait of Gibraltar. On clearer days, the edge of Spain, only 14.5 kilometers away, can be seen across the water.  The “Battle of Cape Spartel” between the British and joint French and Spanish fleets took place in 1782, 29 kilometers off the coast of Cape Spartel. The battle was part of the American Revolutionary War, and the results were inconclusive. Church of Saint Andrew. Some tourists may appreciate a visit to the modest but historic Saint Andrew Anglican church. The church still holds services and is known for its architectural blend of both Gothic and Islamic styles. The church overlooks a cemetery, which guests can also visit. Take note of the Lord’s Prayer written in elegant Arabic calligraphy inside the church.  Emily Kenne, Sherifa of Wazaan (1849-1944), who introduced the cholera vaccine to Morocco, is commemorated at the church. Kasbah Museum of Mediterranean Cultures. Ranking in at the top museum to visit in Tangier, the Kasbah Museum of Mediterranean Cultures helps tourists grasp the complexity of the city’s history. The museum was once the former sultan’s palace (Dar el-Makhzen) but has since been refurbished, featuring beautifully restored architecture that is an exhibit in and of itself.  The museum also features a very charming Andalusian-style garden. Information and artifacts begin with prehistoric times and continue through the 21st century. Included are special exhibits, for example a display of Amazigh jewelry. Some other notable highlights are the mosaic of Venus from Volubilis and giant map replicas—one map shows ancient Phoenician metal trade routes as well as electronic goods exchanges from the 21st century. A second map, created in Tangier in 1154, displays the known world of the time period. Visitors should be aware there is an MAD 20 entry fee and displays are in French and Arabic only. Begin your visit in the first courtyard and work your way around the exhibits counterclockwise. The museum is located outside of the medina—to get there, enter the “Porte de la Kasbah” (the entrance to the city’s fortress) and follow the signs. Try tajine de pescado. During its occupation, Tangier’s cuisine was greatly influenced by Spanish culture. Named after the earthenware pot in which it is served, tajine is a specialty Moroccan dish that usually contains spiced, slow-cooked savory stews made with meats and vegetables or fruits.  However Tangier’s “tajine de pescado” (tajine of fish) is its own version, containing fish instead of beef or chicken along with roasted tomatoes. Given Tangier’s proximity to the sea, it is no surprise that the city’’s specialty dish would contain seafood.  Catch the sunset at Cafe Hafa. This scenic cafe is located outside of the Kasbah, overlooking the sea. William Burroughs, Paul Bowles, Tennessee Williams, The Rolling Stones, and many other celebrities have frequented Cafe Hafa to enjoy mint tea and kif (cannabis), and to look out over the Mediterranean toward Spain. Sunset and nighttime are the best times to go as there is often music, but show up early because the cafe is quite popular and gets very crowded.  The cafe is located in Marshan and is open from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m. (2 a.m. on weekends). Hit the beach. Tangier’s beaches have wonderful and clean water. The summer weather is hot but has a pleasant breeze. The Bakassem beach is especially recommended for tourists and is kept very clean.  Stop by Asilah. Asilah is situated about 31 kilometers south of Tangier. Like Tangier, Asilah was formerly occupied by the Phoenicians, and it was part of “Spanish Morocco” from 1912 to 1956. Asilah is lesser known and smaller than Tangier, but it is worth taking a stop there to appreciate some of its beautiful architecture.  Asilah hosts a weekly Thursday market and annual music and art festivals, including a mural-painting festival. There is also a yearly International Festival held in August which features jazz and Moroccan music.

Rabat – After successful cooperation on tourism, China and Morocco are studying ways to reinforce cooperation on fisheries and aquaculture sectors. Secretary of State for Sea Fisheries Mbarka Bouaida and Deputy Mayor Wang Luming, of Qingdao in Shandong province, eastern China, held talks in Rabat on Thursday, July 26, about fisheries and aquaculture sectors. Wang led a large delegation of representatives from government sectors and private companies, who showed interest in Morocco’s potential. Bouaida presented the delegation with an overview on Morocco’s fisheries and the aquaculture sector. Bouaida expressed satisfaction with Morocco’s assets, emphasizing that the meeting “was very interesting” as China is a leading country in aquaculture at the international level. Both Morocco’s and China’s fisheries sectors are very important to their economies. According to the recent report from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, Morocco’s fish production ranked 13th globally, with 1.3 million ton of fish, while China topped the list with 1.2 million tons of fish. Bouaida also compared Morocco’s assets with those of Shandong province, emphasizing that the Chinese region “represents a certain similarity with Morocco in terms of coastline length.”  “We are very interested in this important partner, because China has very important know-how in aquaculture that the country has developed on several levels.” The secretary of state also recalled the axes of Morocco’s Halieutis strategy and the potential of Moroccan coasts in the field of marine aquaculture. Launched in 2009, the Halieutis strategy was designed to overcome challenges in the fisheries sector, according to Morocco’s Ministry of Economy and Finance. The strategy seeks to ensure protection and sustainably of species exposed to overfishing. Bouaida also expressed Morocco’s interest in reinforcing its partnership with China in other areas, including solar energy, science, and technology. “We need to develop a real partnership in terms of scientific research, particularly between the Moroccan National Institute for Fisheries Research and other fisheries research institutes in China, in order to train the maximum number of experts in marine sciences,” the official said. Wang agreed with the Moroccan official, telling the press that their discussions were also an opportunity to “discuss various areas of scientific collaboration with the oceanographic institutions of the city, as well as Chinese investment opportunities in Morocco’s aquaculture and seafood processing industry.”  China has become one Morocco’s most significant economic partners as the two countries have reinforced their ties in several sectors, including media and tourism.

Rabat – Blockchain firm Soluna, backed by New York private equity firm Brookstone Partners, has announced plans to develop a 900-megawatt wind farm power plant in Dakhla, in Morocco’s southern provinces. Brookstone will finance the flagship project, investing $100 million initially to construct the first 36 MW turbines. The entire project will cost the company an estimated $3 billion. The managing director of Brookstone, Michael Toporek, said that the company has “exclusive rights to the area for a wind farm but the issue was there’s no real place to put the electricity.” He added, “These days, what you can do with stranded power is set up a computing center, develop this as an off-grid project.” According to Business Wire, the project will cover an area of 37,000-acres with the potential to generate 900 megawatts of wind power. Brookstone founded Soluna in 2018 to power the blockchain-economy with clean, low-cost renewable energy. Soluna aims to power “the coming wave of blockchain technologies, networks, and distributed applications.” Soluna will provide “green, renewable, low-cost computing power for the evolving demands of the blockchain ecosystem and compliant with the local regulations,” according to Business Wire. Business Wire also recalled King Mohammed VI’s vision to reinforce the country’s renewable energy. In April, King Mohammed VI chaired a working session at the Royal Palace in Rabat to review the progress of the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN). During the session, Moroccan officials presented the monarch with forecasts for when the Noor solar power plants would enter into service in 2018. The solar power plant called Noor-Ouarzazate is one of the largest solar energy complexes in the world.  Throughout recent years, Morocco has focused on the significance of renewable energy. Morocco has also established itself as one of the most active African countries in the sector. In April’s working session, the King expressed satisfaction with Morocco’s progress in renewable energies, urging operators to maintain and strengthen mobilization in the sector, to make it an economic engine of the country.

Rabat – Brazil’s PSG star has admitted to World Cup theatrics, apologizing to millions of critical Brazilian fans. Neymar used a sponsor’s ad video on Sunday, July 29, to directly express a heartfelt apology to fans he “may have disappointed” in recent months.  Squarely addressing fans’ criticism of his dramatic exaggerations of opponents fouling him during the World Cup in Russia, Neymar said: “You may think I exaggerate. And sometimes I do exaggerate. But the truth is I suffer on the pitch.” The tournament’s traditional favorites spectacularly underperformed at this year’s World Cup in Russia, with heavyweights Spain and Germany leaving the tournament much earlier than expected.  Brazil, however, were present for much of the Russian adventure, leading the polls as the favorites to win the trophy for the sixth time. That was until Belgium and forward Eden Hazard met Brazil in the quarterfinals, surprising Brazil with a solid 2-1 win. Brazil fans, however, were far from dissatisfied with the squad’s overall performance—Brazil created clear chances and did dominate Belgium in many regards. Many blamed the loss on God, misfortune, and, overwhelmingly, Neymar’s negative influence on his teammates. Some football enthusiasts even called the team’s star player a “clown” and an actor more deserving of an Oscar than a Ballon d’Or. In his defense, the forward cited his playing style as that of a boy who both “charms and irritates the world” as well as his inner drive to win and make fans happy. “I still haven’t learned to disappoint you,” he said, suggesting that the rationale behind his attitude is not that he is “spoiled” or “impolite”; instead, it is because he has not yet made peace with frustration. “You may think that I fall too much, but the truth is I did not fall; I fell apart. That hurts more than any step on an operated ankle. I took long to accept your criticism. I took long to look at myself in the mirror and become a new man,” he said. “I fell, but only he who falls can pick himself up. You can keep casting stones, or throw away these stones and help me stand.”

Rabat- After the “Be a free woman” hashtag (#Soisunefemmelibre) lit up Twitter in Morocco, Moroccan activists have launched a petition to oppose the “Be a man Be a man” (#KounRajl) campaign, which encouraged men in Morocco to tell their female relatives to cover up at the beach. The petition, launched on Thursday, called on the head of government and Morocco’s political parties to intervene and abolish the hashtag perceived to be against the freedoms of women. According to the signatories of the petition, the hashtag “has stirred emotion and indignation.” According to the petition, the “misogynistic” campaign is not the first of its kind. “Last year,  a ‘militia’ raid on a beach in Agadir forced women in swimwear to cover themselves, including foreign tourists,” reads the petition. Backing the argument, the author of the petition, President and founder of the Women’s Tribune Association Fathia Bennis wrote: “The body of women in the public space seems to be disturbing more and more Moroccan men, some of whom allow themselves, with impunity, to ‘overplay’ an unacceptable police role in our country.” The petition, according to signatories, was launched not only to defend the freedom and equality of citizens but also to raise awareness and concern about the “future of our society hitherto based on tolerance and openness in the world.” The petition also discussed the alleged increase of violence against women. Despite multiple anti-harassment campaigns, gender-based violence remains an issue in Morocco. A 2016 report from the National Observatory said that harassment in public spaces affects 73 percent of  women. The High Commissioner for Planning HCP conducted an investigation in 2017 after a shocking assault on a public bus in Casablanca. The study revealed that physical violence affects 808,000 victims, representing 14.2 percent of women. Morocco has adopted a new law on violence against women, providing protections for women and punishments for perpetrators. Law 103-13 also recognizes forms of abuse that many face from their partners and families. The petition claims that various forms of violence against women are increasing. The petition also recalled King Mohammed VI’s calls to reduce inequalities between genders. Article 19 of Morocco’s constitution says that men and women “shall enjoy, equally, civil, political, economic, social, cultural and environmental rights and freedoms set forth in this title and in the other provisions of the Constitution.” The same petition says that Morocco works to achieve parity between men and women. The call also condemned the rise of “an exacerbated retrograde mentality, creating a climate of psychological and physical violence which undermine the safety of the citizens.” The petition attracted more than 1,500 signatures, and aimed for 5,000. Several Moroccan activists slammed “Be a man” hashtag against swimwear, describing it as a violation of the rights to freedom of Moroccan women. Bouchra Abdou, an activist, feminist, and president of Tahadi Center, told Morocco World News that the campaign “misleads the meaning of manness as it is based on power, absolute jurisdiction and control over the fate of others.” Several activists also contacted attempted to correct the misconception about the role of men, emphasizing that men should be brave and respect the freedom of others rather than imposing their opinions on others.

Rabat – In a politically and emotionally charged context following protests in Northern Morocco and a months-long boycott of some of the country’s leading companies, Morocco’s King Mohammed VI has called for citizens to safeguard Morocco’s unity and stability in these times of “chaos” and uncertainty stemming from “schemes of enemies and various threats.” King Mohamed VI, who made his Sunday speech on the eve of the 19th anniversary of his ascension to the throne, underlined his vision for Morocco: functional public services, responsive and accountable political elites, and responsible and participatory citizenship. But as important as political accountability and a modernized public administration may be, the country cannot rise to its numerous challenges without a genuine commitment to unity, peace, and stability, the King said. Patriotism and a strong commitment to the destiny of the motherland—through bad and good times—have been a defining element of Morocco’s national heritage. This emotional attachment to the country and the ensuing sense of sacrifice is now more than ever needed in uncertain times of security challenges. “The commemoration of Throne Day, which today marks the nineteenth anniversary of my accession to the throne, is testament to the allegiance binding me to you, and to the mutual covenant between us to remain forever faithful to Morocco’s sacred, immutable values and to make whatever sacrifices are needed for its unity and stability.” Mohammed VI also called on the government, political parties, and other elites to be mindful of their special duties as keepers and guarantors of the peace and stability needed to propel Morocco towards the kind of future that many Moroccans want for their country. Constructive criticism The King, who came to power in 1999, has implemented a number of bold social and economic reforms, regaining the trust of partners and collaborators in Africa and beyond.  There is, however, still more to do to attend to the needs of many Moroccans, the King noted. “We can be satisfied with and take pride in what Morocco has achieved and what Moroccans have accomplished over the last two decades. Yet, I cannot but feel that something has been missing in the social domain…we shall continue to work actively and resolutely in this field, and seek to identify and address weaknesses together.” Mohammed VI made it emphatically clear in his speech that fulfilling Moroccans’ dreams and aspirations requires unity and a binding belief in a common future. Fulfilling these demands “a collective action, planning and coordination between different institutions and actors.” The King welcomed criticism, but said that while it is good and legitimate to criticize, it is more important to do so with the intention of advancing the country or the political debate, rather than promoting division and discourses that feed a political atmosphere of self-deprecation to downplay and undermine “achievements made in the last two decades.” “I am confident that Moroccans will not allow the advocates of chaos and nihilism or the peddlers of misconceptions to exploit certain deficiencies in order to encroach upon Morocco’s security and stability and belittle its gains and achievements.” Calling for a “general overhaul” of the country’s development model, the King promised a “social registry” that will spur social equality by promoting a genuine “social dialogue.” According to the King, social dialogue is a necessary condition for development as it ensures that “social stakeholders concerned keep in mind the nation’s best interests show a keen sense of responsibility and seek consensus in order to develop a balanced, long-lasting social charter.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI addressed his fellow citizens on Sunday evening in a formal speech delivered from Al Hoceima, in northern Morocco.  The King expressed his concern over persisting socio-economic disparities that are hampering Morocco’s development and urged citizens to work together to improve social issues. With Al Hoceima, in the heart of the Rif, having been the site of massive protests decrying social disparities in 2016 and 2017, the King’s choice of venue for this speech was significant. On the eve of his 19th Throne Day, King Mohammed VI said that he is giving special attention to social issues—echoing previous statements that he has made about disparities between the socio-economic classes. Despite the progress that has been made in Morocco, the King said that he “cannot but feel that something has been missing in the social domain.” The monarch sought to reassure Moroccan citizens that their complaints have been heard. The King urged citizens to work together with the government to improve society and social well-being. “We shall continue to work actively and resolutely in this field and seek to identify and to address weaknesses together,” he stated. Evoking his speech at the state opening of Parliament, the King criticized Morocco’s development strategy. The current strategy, he said, has failed to meet the needs of citizens and needs urgent reform. Morocco’s development strategy has long been among the most important issues critiqued by King Mohammed VI in his speeches. King Mohammed said, “It does not make much sense for more than a hundred social welfare programs of varying sizes to be spread out among several ministries and public agencies, with billions of dirhams earmarked for them.” The King blamed a lack of “proper coordination” between operators for creating the situation. He added that citizens cannot benefit from these programs if they do not efficiently meet their needs. “I am not criticizing just for the sake of it. In fact, I consider self-criticism to be a virtue and a healthy phenomenon, so long as words are coupled with deeds and with reform,” he said. The King called upon government officials to step up and take concrete measures by “restructuring national social welfare programs and policies and submitting proposals for evaluation.” He also urged the government to reinforce social dialogue, stating that it is “necessary and it should be an ongoing process.” Furthermore, he said, the cabinet should meet more frequently with trade unions, “regardless of the potential outcome of that dialogue.” Unemployment is a major concern that the government should address, according to the sovereign. The King stated that citizens can be provided with a more dignified lifestyle and social protection if more jobs and opportunities are offered to them. However, this cannot happen without investment and support for the nation’s producing sector. The King recommended that the government adopt measures to implement an administrative decentralization plan no later than the end of October. The plan, according to the King, “should” enable the officials to make more effective decisions and implement development programs to help combat social issues. He also recommended that the government adopt a new investment plan and reform regional investment centers. Monday is expected to be a significant day for Morocco as the country celebrates the King’s 19th Throne Day.  The King himself will chair a reception ceremony at Tangier’s Marchaine Palace to celebrate his accession to the throne in 1999, according to a statement from the Ministry of the Royal House, Protocol, and Chancery. The ceremony will begin at 2:15 p.m. Several princesses from the royal family will host a formal dinner in the evening at Marchaine Palace.

Rabat – On the eve of Throne Day, King Mohammed VI received on Sunday Governor of Bank Al Maghrib Abdellatif Jouahri and Head of Auditors’ Court Driss Jettou, and both presented the monarch with their annual reports. During his meeting with the King, Jouahri discussed Morocco’s financial situation in 2017, emphasizing that the domestic economy grew at a rapid rate last year. The local economy expanded by 4.1 percent, owing to good climatic conditions for agriculture and overall economic recovery. According to the head of Bank Al Maghrib, the improving economy helped establish job opportunities in the North African country. However, job growth was not enough to curb unemployment, thereby increasing the unemployment rate. Jouahri added that the fiscal deficit narrowed to 3.6 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the current account deficit eased to 3.4 percent of GDP. The balance helped the country maintain international reserves at a level providing coverage for approximately six months of imports. The inflation rate slowed to 0.7 percent in 2017. Despite economic growth throughout 2017, Jouahri said that the progress made by the country did not meet expectations. Non-agricultural activity remains behind. Jouahri also said that private investment is still limited despite the incentives Morocco grants and its public spending. “Our country needs not only to pursue and enlarge the scope of reforms, but also and more particularly to see to their successful implementation within the set deadlines,” he added. Jouahri then gave an example of the education system, emphasizing that its goals have not been achieved yet. Jouahri believes that Morocco’s reform of the subsidy system should be finalized and generalized as part of a comprehensive policy to establish price reality and provide support for the poorest households. The official did not deny that the country has achieved progress in terms of stability, regional positioning, and investment attractiveness, but he called for a real economic takeoff and a massive mobilization of its dynamic forces to enable stronger growth and job creation.   Driss Jettou, whose revealing 2017 report brought down several officials involved in development projects in Al Hoceima, presented the monarch with the Court of Auditors’ report for the years 2016-2017, in accordance with Article 148 of the Constitution and Article 100 of Law 62.99 forming the financial court’s code. Jettou said that his department conducted 160 audit missions and made 2,668 decisions regarding the accounts, as well as 215 decisions on budgetary and financial discipline. He recommended that support programs ensure sustainable development and balanced growth across various sectors.

Rabat –  King Mohammed VI delivered, on Sunday, a speech to the Nation on the nineteenth anniversary of the Sovereign’s accession to the throne. “Praise be to God, May peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, His Kith and Kin Dear Citizens, At all times and in all circumstances, Almighty God has blessed Morocco with unity and cohesion throughout its long history. The commemoration of Throne Day, which today marks the nineteenth anniversary of my accession to the throne, is testament to the allegiance binding me to you, and to the mutual covenant between us to remain forever faithful to Morocco’s sacred, immutable values and to make whatever sacrifices are needed for its unity and stability. This covenant between the kings and the citizens of this nation was, and still is, similar to an impregnable fortress protecting Morocco against the schemes of enemies and against various threats. It has also enabled us to overcome difficulties and to make a great many achievements in a climate of unity, security and stability – achievements we are proud of. Morocco is our motherland; it is our common home. We must all safeguard it, protect it and contribute to its development and progress. True patriotism enhances unity and solidarity, especially in testing circumstances. Moroccan patriots are not affected by the vicissitudes of life, however harsh they may sometimes be. These hardships enhance their faith and increase their resolve to tackle difficulties and rise to challenges. I am confident that Moroccans will not allow the advocates of chaos and nihilism or the peddlers of misconceptions to exploit certain deficiencies in order to encroach upon Morocco’s security and stability and belittle its gains and achievements. They realize that when chaos and subversion spread in the land, the biggest losers are the homeland and the citizens. We shall continue to move forward together and work hand in hand to overcome transient as well as objective hurdles and bring about conditions that allow us to continue implementing development programs and projects, create jobs and provide for a dignified life. Dear Citizens, Achieving goals, redressing imbalances and tackling economic and social problems require collective action, planning and coordination between different institutions and actors, especially between the members of the government and between the political parties forming the government. It is also necessary to rise above temporary differences, seek to improve the performance of public administration and ensure the proper management of institutions in order to enhance trust and promote serenity within the community and among all its components. Citizens’ affairs cannot be put on hold for they do not relate to a specific period of time. Responsible political bodies are those that stand by the citizen, in good times and bad. Political parties do, in fact, make efforts to carry out their mission. However, they should attract new elites and mobilize young people to engage in political life, for today’s youths are the ones who know what the current problems and requirements are. Political parties should also find the ways and means to revitalize their work methods. Political parties and institutions are expected to respond on a permanent basis to the citizens’ demands and to react immediately to events and developments occurring in society, even anticipate them, instead of letting situations deteriorate, as if they are not concerned by what is happening. Dear Citizens, I attach special importance to and take a keen interest in social affairs – both as a King and as a person. Ever since I ascended the throne, I have kept my finger on the nation’s pulse and paid heed to the citizens’ legitimate wishes. I have always worked to improve their living conditions and constantly nurtured the hope of achieving that goal. We can be satisfied with and take pride in what Morocco has achieved and what Moroccans have accomplished over the last two decades. Yet, I cannot but feel that something has been missing in the social domain. God willing, we shall continue to work actively and resolutely in this field, and seek to identify and address weaknesses together. The scope of the social deficit and the means for achieving social and inter-regional justice are among the main reasons which led me, in my address at the State Opening of Parliament, to call for an overhaul of the national development model. Indeed, it does not make much sense to have more than a hundred social welfare programs of varying sizes spread out between several ministries and public agencies, with billions of dirhams earmarked for them. Moreover, these programs overlap, lack proper coordination and do not target the populations that actually deserve help. Given the current situation, how can these programs respond effectively to citizens’ needs? How can the people concerned feel their impact? Needless to say, I am not criticizing just for the sake of it. In fact, I consider self-criticism to be a virtue and a healthy phenomenon, so long as words are coupled with deeds and with reform. In this regard, I view the new initiative to set up a “consolidated social register” as a promising start for the gradual improvement of social welfare programs over the short and medium terms. This is a national registration system to identify families that truly deserve to benefit from social assistance programs. To this end, precise and objective standards will be set and modern technology will be used. It is a strategic and ambitious social project which concerns large segments of the Moroccan population. It is much too important to be perceived as a mere one-term government program, or as a reflection of the vision of a given ministry, party or political actor. Dear Citizens, My ambition to improve social conditions in the country is much greater than simply establishing a mechanism or setting out a program, however important that may be. For this reason, I call on the Government and all the stakeholders concerned to undertake an in-depth, thorough restructuring of national social welfare programs and policies and to submit proposals for their evaluation. This task requires a participatory approach, far-sightedness, perseverance as well as diligent implementation.  We need to build on achievements and put successful experiences to good use. Until this reform effectively bears fruit, I recommend the adoption of a set of provisional social measures which are in tune with the above-mentioned restructuring effort. I call upon the government to do this as soon as possible and to inform me regularly on the progress made. To make sure impacts are tangible and felt directly, I strongly recommend laying emphasis on urgent initiatives in the following areas: • Firstly, we need to give strong impetus to school enrolment programs and combat school drop-out as of the next school year. These include the Tayssir program on school enrolment support, early childhood education, school transportation, school canteens and boarding schools. The above measures are designed to ease the burden on families and to provide them with support to make sure their children continue to attend school and training programs. • Secondly, we need to launch the third phase of the National Initiative for Human Development by building on achievements, refocusing programs to promote human resource development and serve the coming generations, supporting groups in difficult situations and starting a new generation of income-generating activities that create jobs. • Thirdly, we need to tackle the inconsistencies affecting the implementation of the ‘RAMED’ health coverage program and undertake, concurrently, a thorough review of the national health system, which is characterized by blatant disparities and poor management. • Fourthly, we need to speed up a successful outcome of the social dialogue. In this regard, I call upon the social stakeholders concerned to keep in mind the nation’s best interests, show a keen sense of responsibility and seek consensus in order to develop a balanced, long-lasting social charter that guarantees the competitiveness of businesses while increasing the purchasing power of the working class in both the public and the private sectors. Let me remind the government, here, that social dialogue is necessary and that it should be an ongoing process.  The government should meet with trade unions and talk regularly with them, regardless of the potential outcome of that dialogue. In this regard, I have always believed that the best social protection comes from the creation of productive jobs that guarantee a dignified life. In truth, jobs cannot be created, nor can a proper, modern social system be set up without a qualitative leap in investment, and without support for the nation’s productive sector. With that in mind, it is necessary to ensure the successful implementation of three basic projects in particular: • Firstly, we need to adopt the administrative devolution charter by the end of October at the latest. This should enable local officials to make decisions and implement economic and social development programs in a manner that is fully consistent with the advanced regionalization agenda; • Secondly, we need to speed up the adoption of the new investment charter; implement the reform of regional investment centers; give the latter the powers they need to carry out their mission, including the possibility for the majority of attending members to make decisions, instead of applying the current rule of unanimous decision-making; group all investment commissions into a single regional investment commission in order to put an end to obstacles and to the excuses made by certain ministries. • Thirdly, we need to adopt legislation stipulating: – on the one hand, a maximum one-month period within which a number of government agencies would have to respond to investment-related requests, stressing that if no answer is given within the time prescribed, it will be taken to mean that the government agency concerned has given its approval; – And, on the other hand, that no government agency shall require documents or information available at another government institution. Government agencies will coordinate and exchange information, using modern computer-based technology to this end. I hope these crucial measures will provide a strong, unprecedented incentive to boost investment, create job opportunities, improve the quality of services offered to citizens and reduce foot-dragging which, as all Moroccans know, leads to corruption. These measures will also serve as a catalyst for the reform of the civil service, making it possible to hold officials to account and to identify the hurdles impeding the reform. These measures should be given concrete substance in investment-related fields, as a prelude to applying them to all sectors in which the citizen interacts with public service authorities. Whatever the quality of legislation, however, efficiency will hinge on the commitment and integrity of each civil servant and on the proper implementation of texts. I also wish to emphasize the need to update support programs for businesses, including ones to facilitate access to finance, increase productivity and ensure human resource training. Our goal is to make sure Moroccan businesses – particularly small and medium-sized enterprises – are competitive and capable of exporting goods and services as well as creating jobs. Indeed, SMEs require special attention since they constitute 95 per cent of our economic fabric. Today, the State and society need to place more trust in productive businesses so that we may once again reach the desired investment levels and move from a negative wait-and-see attitude to an innovative, entrepreneurial frame of mind. Economic revitalization continues to depend on the extent of businesses’ involvement in development, on the revamping of the corporate culture and on the proper use of Morocco’s numerous assets, keeping in mind the international competitive landscape, even the occasional trade war. Dear Citizens, My keenness to improve social conditions and tackle economic challenges is second only to my determination to preserve and develop our country’s strategic resources, particularly water. Indeed, the latter plays a fundamental role in development and stability. Almighty God says: “We made from water every living thing.” The national water plan should address the various issues relating to water resources for the next 30 years. Moreover, the government, along with the institutions concerned, are called upon to take urgent measures and muster all the means required to deal with emergencies that arise from a lack of access to drinking water and to water for irrigation and livestock, especially during the summer. To this end, I have always stressed the need to maintain the policy of building dams – a sector in which Morocco is a pioneer. Because I have keenly sought to continue with that policy, we have managed to build thirty dams of various sizes in the country during the last 18 years. Dear Citizens, Morocco –  its past, present and future – is a sacred trust which we must all seek to preserve. We have accomplished so much together, in various fields. In fact, we cannot rise to challenges and fulfil our aspirations unless we are united and committed to solidarity and stability, have faith in our common destiny – in good times and bad – and embrace the spirit of genuine patriotism and responsible citizenship. Given the developments currently taking place in our country, we do need to remain committed to our longstanding religious and national values. We should remember the sacrifices made by our forefathers so that Morocco could remain a united, sovereign and dignified nation. I cannot, in this regard, but honor, with deep reverence, the memory of Morocco’s valiant martyrs, particularly my venerable grandfather, His Majesty King Mohammed V, and my revered father, His Majesty King Hassan II. May they rest in peace. I also wish to commend the Royal Armed Forces, the Royal Gendarmerie, the Auxiliary Forces, the National Security Forces and the Emergency Services on being constantly mobilized, under my leadership, to defend the nation’s unity and safeguard its security and stability. I also want to praise the humanitarian and social work carried out by the Royal Armed Forces, at home and abroad, especially at the field hospital in Gaza to alleviate the suffering of our Palestinian brothers and support their steadfastness, and at the al-Za’tari camp as well. This is on top of humanitarian and medical assignments carried out by our Royal Armed Forces in many African sister nations. I shall continue, as always, to be the nation’s first servant, who is keen to listen to your concerns and respond to your requests – one who is entrusted with upholding your rights and preserving your sacred values. Almighty God says: “And for those who fear Allah, He (ever) prepares a way out, and He provides for them from (sources) they never could imagine”. True is the Word of God. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.”

Rabat – Lebanese singer Ramy Ayach has dedicated a song to King Mohammed VI to congratulate him on his 19th Throne Day anniversary. Morocco will celebrate the anniversary on Monday, July 30. The singer has already released his tribute, “Allah, Al Watan, Al Malik” (“Allah, Homeland, and the King”), expressing both his respect for the monarch and for the Moroccan people. The artist borrowed the title of his song from the last verse of the Moroccan national anthem. Throughout July 30 and 31, airplanes will perform aerial acrobatics in Northern Morocco, including two of Tetouan’s neighboring cities, Martil and M’diq. The airshows will be performed by the prestigious “Marche Verte” aerobatics team of the Royal Air Force (FAR). King Mohammed VI will deliver a speech on the eve of his Throne Day celebration. He is expected to make his speech from Al Hoceima, home of the 2016 and 2017 social protests, which began with the death of a local fishmonger. Speculations are rife that the King will address some of the recent challenges Morocco has been facing, including social inequalities, the development model, and the high-price commodities’ boycott. The King’s speech will air at 9:30 p.m. on national radio and TV, the Ministry of Royal Household, Protocol, and Chancellery said on Saturday. The statement did not specify the King’s current whereabouts, opening the door for more speculation about whether or not the speech will be delivered from the city of Al Hoceima.  The King will chair a reception ceremony on Monday at Tangier’s Marchaine Palace to celebrate his accession to the throne, according to a statement from the Ministry of the Royal House, protocol, and Chancery. The ceremony will begin at 2:15 p.m. Princesses will host a dinner provided by the King at Marchaine Palace.

Rabat – Prior to his Throne Day speech, King Mohammed VI is expected to chair an emergency meeting in the Al Hoceima, convening Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and other officials. Several  Moroccan news outlets including Le360 and Al Youm 24 quoted anonymous sources confirming the news. Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit, Minister of Finance and Economy Mohamed Boussaid, and Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch were summoned to attend the meeting. In order to attend the King’s urgent meeting, El Othmani, Head of the Justice and Development Party (PJD), cancelled attending PJD’s regional council at the Tangier-Tetouan Al Hoceima, scheduled to take place on Sunday in Tangier. As quoted by Al Youm 24, the meeting is expected to be of the utmost importance. The King may tackle many pressing topics, including both social and economic issues and the Manarat Al Mutawassit project in Al Hoceima. After the death of local fishmonger Mouhcine Fikri in October 2016, dysfunctions in the Manarat Al Moutawassit project led to protests in Al Hoceima during 2016 and 2017. The problems led the King to dismiss a number of ministers and senior officials and created the opportunity for a government reshuffle. Firing officials was the King’s response to the Court of Auditors’ findings. The Court, chaired by the former prime minister Driss Jettou, uncovered evidence suggestion officials were to blame for the project delays in Al Hoceima.  The King is also expected to deliver his speech from Al Hoceima. His speech will air on national radio and TV at 9:30 p.m. Morocco will celebrate the 19th anniversary of the King’s Throne Day tomorrow.  The King will chair a reception ceremony on Monday at Tangier’s Marchaine Palace to celebrate his accession to the throne, according to a statement from the Ministry of the Royal House, protocol, and Chancery. The ceremony will begin at 2:15 p.m. Princesses will host a dinner provided by the King at Marchaine Palace. On Tuesday, the King will also oversee the ceremony of oath of new laureates of different military ranks, schools, and institutes.

Rabat – Despite the major consequences of the ongoing boycott, Centrale Danone was able to achieve its annual financial goals, owing to baby food sales in China. Chief financial officer Cecile Cabanis announced the company’s achievements, saying that the company is “entering the second half with an operating model capable of offsetting these headwinds,” referring to Morocco’s boycott against high prices. The company has also shared its future vision aiming for more progress to reinforce its sales growth and improve its recurring operating margin by 2020. Chinese demand for baby food gave the company confidence. However, Morocco’s boycott costs the company an arm and a leg as it announced net loss of MAD 150 million in the first half of 2018. The company might have suffered more loss as the campaign is still ongoing. The company has estimated that its sales in Morocco have declined by at least 40 percent in the second quarter of 2018.  In a press conference on July 27, Cabanis admitted that the “impact has been significant so far,” adding that the “unprecedented boycott” will have effects on Danone’s performance in the second half of 2018. She added that the company has “adopted a cautious outlook for the remainder of the year” to mitigate the impacts of the boycott. Cabanis also recalled the visit of the CEO of the company Emmanuel Faber to Morocco to personally address the major consequences of the boycott. She added that the company is currently studying how to make relevant changes “in response to an environment where purchasing power is under pressure.” “We are ready to provide greater transparency and engage in a client dialogue that we believe will be an important step towards restoring a normal situation,” she added. The company said that its sales growth has increased by 24 percent (€ 1.2 billion) in the first half of 2018 internationally Speaking about the company’s achievements, Faber said in a statement published on Friday  that “this strong performance, achieved despite a volatile environment and unexpected adverse events in certain markets, reflects the strong fundamentals of our business and the maintenance of our financial discipline.” He added that the performance “reflects a more balanced portfolio, based on more growth drivers.” Since April, Centrale Danone released statements in an attempt to reconcile its consumers in Morocco. The boycott has also urged officials from the government to defend the company and called on Moroccan citizens to suspend the boycott. CEO of Danone, however, reassured the government that the company will not leave Morocco as the country represents a very important market for the company.

Bourita made his remarks at the Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom in Washington, a major event hosted by the US State Department on July 24-26. “Faithful to the legacy of His glorious ancestors, HM the King, in his capacity as Commander of the Faithful, has successfully managed to make the Moroccan religious model a real lever and a force of persuasion,” he added. According to the minister, King Mohammed VI is “the guarantor of the freedom of worship in the Kingdom.” Bourita underscored that “the particularity of the Moroccan model is also the result of an exemplary social cohesion”. Morocco’s constitution establishes the country’s Hebrew heritage “as one of the components of Morocco’s national identity,” Bourita said, recalling that late  King Mohammed V rejected the racist laws of the Vichy government, loudly proclaiming the duty to protect Moroccan citizens of Jewish faith. Late King Hassan II has also played an overwhelming role in promoting peace and interreligious dialogue, particularly in the Middle East region, the minister added. The Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom in Washington focused on concrete outcomes that reaffirm international commitments to promote religious freedom and produce real, positive change. The Ministerial convened a broad range of stakeholders, including foreign ministers, international organization representatives, religious leaders, and civil society representatives, to discuss challenges, identify concrete ways to combat religious persecution and discrimination, and ensure greater respect for religious freedom for all.

Rabat- As Morocco’s Throne Day approaches on July 30, Moroccan media have reported that King Mohammed VI has been in the troubled northern city of Al Hoceima since Monday, July 23. Security services have moved into cities in the north, especially to Al Hoceima, where King Mohammed VI has arrived with senior officials, Al Massae newspaper reported Friday. The King was seen in his car on an Al Hoceima street with his advisor, Fouad Ali El Himma. Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita also arrived in the northern city along with the minister of the interior, who oversees the security arrangements in the city. For the 19th anniversary of Throne Day, the King will give a speech addressed to the Moroccan nation, expected to be broadcast from a northern city.  The Ministry of the Royal Household, Protocol, and Chancellory announced that the King’s speech will be broadcast on radio and television Sunday, July 29, at 9:30 p.m. According to public expectations, the King will most likely speak from Al Hoceima or Tetouan. In the last two years, the King has given Throne Day speeches from Tetouan. According to Al Massae, Morocco’s King is staying near the Bouskour beach, located in Imzouren, near Al Hoceima. Al Hoceima province Governor Farid Chourak is responsible for maintaining security in the many neighborhoods and streets in Al Hoceima, according to the same outlet. Al Hoceima has been on full alert on all main streets, neighborhoods, and squares in order to secure the royal visit, especially since the King is used to roaming streets without official protocols, Al Massae noted.  According to the newspaper, Mohammed VI will stay for more than two weeks in the north. Ministers and officials will reportedly travel to the region over the weekend to prepare for the Throne Day celebrations. Sunday’s speech is expected to be one of the King’s most important since 2018 has witnessed many significant events in Morocco. The most striking occurrence has been the boycott of three prominent companies in Morocco since April 20 and controversially “harsh” sentences given to Hirak Rif activists on June 26 for their participation in 2016-2017 Al Hoceima protests.  Many Moroccans are waiting for the King to announce important policy changes on Throne Day. Others are expecting that King Mohammed VI will probably grant amnesty to the 54 convicted Hirak Rif activists, who were sentenced to 1 to 20 years in prison. Up to now, the monarch has not spoken directly on the Hirak movement, except when he decided to sack many ministers and senior officials in October 2017, after they mishandled the Al Hoceima development projects “Manarat Al-Mutawassit.”  The King said he was “disappointed in their performance at their respective ministries and he would never again entrust them with any public missions.” A video has been recently circulating social media, claiming to show King Mohammed VI sailing the coast of Al Hoceima on what was identified as a yacht belonging to the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. The Qatari yacht, known as “Lusail,” was carrying many people and surrounded by security boats that prevented the public from approaching it. According to the poster of the 35-second video, King Mohammed VI was seen aboard Lusail yacht while Moroccan citizens chanted “Long live the king” on the other side. The security boats prevented the public from taking photos. Social media pages also featured pictures believed to be of the King in his car accompanied by his adviser Fouad Ali El Himma.

Rabat – Desiree Bonis, the Netherlands’ ambassador to Rabat, has praised Morocco’s role on migration and the fight against domestic and transnational terrorism. Bonis made her remarks Wednesday, July 25, during a meeting with the Moroccan speaker of the House of Representatives, Habib El Malki. The Dutch official hailed Morocco’s role on various multinational cooperation missions. She pointed out that Rabat plays a crucial role in maintaining peace and stability in the Mediterranean. She also praised Moroccan-Dutch nationals’ social integration and adaptability skills. The ambassador said that Moroccans’ reputation for easily integrating within Dutch society reflects Morocco’s unique position as a bridge between Europe and Africa and a historical meeting point of cultures and civilizations, according to a press release by the House of Representatives.  Calling Rabat-Amsterdam diplomatic ties “historical,” the Dutch ambassador noted that the two countries are currently collaborating on a wide range of strategic issues, including education, health, agriculture, and fishing.  In return, Habib El Malki praised the relationship, saying that Rabat and Amsterdam share “very good relations.” According to Malki, despite their noticeable differences, the two countries face similar security and social challenges, especially with regards to terrorism and the surge of extremism.  El Malki said that Morocco and the Netherlands should further their cooperation to guarantee transnational security and stability. He called for social and political dialogue between the two countries as a way of bridging their social and cultural differences. More importantly, though, Malki extended an invitation to the speaker of the Dutch House of Representatives to visit Morocco, saying that maintaining bilateral ties requires closer institutional cooperation. Morocco has a well established reputation as a champion of transnational security and stability. In addition to its globally praised anti-terrorism model, Rabat has been lauded for its recent reforms to integrate thousands of irregular migrants.  Morocco was also one of the pioneers of the recent UN-sponsored Global Compact for Migration. The document, which calls for a “comprehensive multilateral vision” to tackle migration and related issues, will be finalized in December at a summit in Marrakech.

Rabat- Ahed Tamimi, the 17-year-old teenager who became an icon of Palestinian resistance in the occupied West Bank, will be released from prison Sunday. Tamimi was sentenced to 8 months in prison after a video emerged showing her shoving two Israeli soldiers and slapping one of them in the West Bank village of Nabi Saleh. She and her cousin appeared yelling at and pushing two armed soldiers from her family’s front yard.
 She was convicted of assaulting an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier. In addition to the 8 month prison sentence, Tamimi had to pay a fine of $1,437. The Palestinian teenager was arrested on December 19, 2017. Her mother, Nariman, and cousin were also arrested for the same incident. According to the Times of Israel, Tamimi said the soldiers shown in the video had shot her 15-year old cousin, Mohammed Tamimi, in the head with a rubber bullet an hour before. “Then I saw the same soldiers who hit my cousin, this time in front of my house. I could not keep quiet and I responded as I did,” Tamimi added. Her father, Bassem Tamimi, wrote a post on his Facebook page on the day of her arrest. “The IOF [Israeli occupying forces] raid my home and arrested my daughter Ahed Tamimi after the Israeli media attaks (sic) here after she stop the solder (sic) in front of our house when he shot child on his head.” A spokesman for the Israel Prisons Service told the Times of Israel Wednesday that Ahed Tamimi and her mother Nariman will be released on Sunday. “They are then planning to hold a press conference at the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar, which is slated for demolition by Israeli forces,” the same source added. Ahed’s father told Haaretz that he has been notified that his daughter will be released this Sunday, and family members will wait for her at the Jabbara checkpoint south of Tulkarm Sunday morning. Tamimi’s lawyer Gaby Lasky said on Thursday, “Tamimi’s long detention stemmed from political motives than from legal reasons.” “Legal proceedings are not intended to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and instead of sending minors to prison for resisting the occupation, the time has come for a courageous leadership to free us all from the chains of the occupation.” The 17-year old Palestinian’s case has drawn the attention of many people around the world.  Tamimi has had great support and sympathy from Palestinians, Arabs, and the international arena. They considered her a symbol of bravery standing up against Israeli aggression and occupation.

Rabat- Morocco’s speaker of the House of Representatives, Habib El Malki, has said that the reason the government has been slow to implement the Tamazight (Berber) language law is that the government is worried over “complications” it may pose in the future. In a press conference on Thursday, El Malki asserted that the government does not want to rush the launching of the Tamazight law, which calls for the language to be integrated into public administrations and services.  The government representatives’ cautious approach to the Tamazight draft law is connected to its aspiration to produce a successful and fair law that would not cause division or conflict in the Moroccan identity. To El Malki, the law is a very delicate subject and rushing implementation would only result in “serious complications” in society. “If the law fails, it’s not only the Parliament that will lose, Morocco and us together will too.” El Malki informed Moroccan journalists that the parliament committee concerned with the Tamazight law is working soberly to ensure the success of the draft law, which was presented in 2016. He stressed that Morocco is a leader in the Maghreb region when it comes to engaging Tamazight in all spheres, next to Arabic. Morocco presented draft laws 26.16 and 04.16 related to the integration of Tamazight into national education and administrative institutions as well as the protection and development of both Arabic and Tamazight. The draft laws strive to boost the status and usage of Tamazight in public administrations and services and in all “priority areas of public life,” including documents such as ID cards, passports, drivers’ licenses, and banknotes. The government also recently announced its goal to integrate Tamazight in cultural and artistic expression, such as literature and cinema. In 2001, one year from descending to the Moroccan throne, King Mohammed VI drew the attention to the Amazigh language and stressed the need to celebrate it as part of the Moroccan culture and identity.

Rabat – Following their last visit to the Ibn Batouta stadium where the Spanish Super Cup will take place, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has approved of the venue’s optimal facilities.  According to the Spanish technical delegation, Tangier’s Ibn Batouta stadium offers “excellent conditions” to host the game between FC Barcelona and Sevilla on Sunday, August 12. The match will be played at 9 p.m. Moroccan time. Representatives of both clubs accompanied the delegation. The stadium has “very recent facilities, dating back only seven years, and perfectly arranged for the organization—a competition—at the height of the Spanish Super Cup,” added the RFEF in a statement. The stadium can “comfortably” accommodate up to 45,000 spectators, notes the statement. The Spanish federation had proposed, at a meeting of its steering committee on July 9, that Tangier host the 23rd Spanish Super Cup. The city was chosen especially because of its “optimal weather conditions” and because it is easy to buy tickets on the internet. “The RFEF thanks the Royal Moroccan Football Federation for its interest and collaboration in providing the Tangier stadium” the Spanish federation said in a statement.  This will not be Tangier’s first experience as a “neutral site” for foreign leagues, as the city’s stadium hosted the French Super Cup on two occasions: the 2011 Super Cup between Lille and Marseille (4-5) and the 2017 Super Cup game between Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco (2-1). As for FC Barcelona, the Spanish giant will be playing its second match in Morocco, after taking on Raja Club Athletic on July 29, 2012, at the Mohammed V Stadium in Casablanca. FC Barcelona crushed Raja de Casablanca 8-0.

Rabat – As Spain pledges to reinforce cooperation with Morocco on migration challenges, Morocco has requested €60 million in resources. Quoted by Spanish news outlet La Sexta on July 27, journalist Ignacio Cembrero said that Morocco’s Ministry of Interior  has responded to Spain’s request for cooperation, asking for resources such as helicopters. “Morocco has drafted a long list of resources, including vehicles, helicopters, riot gear and radars, worth 60 million euros to fight irregular migration,” according to La Sexta. The Spanish cabinet has already approved Morocco’s request and forwarded it to the European Union “hoping that the EU will take care of the expenses,” said Cembrero. The source added that Pedro Sanchez’s government has contacted Morocco to discuss solutions to migration issues, because Morocco serves as  a country of origin and transit. However, Morocco argued that authorities are already doing their best to handle undocumented migration. Morocco’s response came after the meeting between France’s Emmanuel Macron and Spain’s Prime Minister Sanchez in Madrid on Thursday, July 26. The two leaders addressed a message to Morocco and countries involved in migration, calling for further cooperation to curb migration. Macron and Sanchez  agreed that migration is “a global challenge that requires European responses.”  The meeting took place after hundreds of sub-Saharan migrants stormed the border fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta on Thursday morning. On Friday, the Spanish government adopted a law restoring the free “universal health system” that allows undocumented migrants to have access to health services. The Spanish minister of health, consumption and social welfare, Carmen Montón, said after a weekly meeting of the government that “Spain enjoys a public health of high quality that we are very proud of. Today it is strengthened by recovering the character of universality,” reported Agencia Informativa Latinoamericana.

Rabat – Algeria’s sporting authorities have reiterated a desire to jointly bid with neighbors Tunisia and Morocco for the hosting rights of the 2030 FIFA World Cup. While Algerian Minister of Sports Mohamed Hattab spoke more cautiously in June when Morocco first spoke of the possibility of a joint bid, the Algerian official is currently more welcoming of the proposal, as he “confirmed” his country would support a united Maghreb bid.  Speaking on Thursday, July 26, Hattab suggested the countries sideline political differences for the benefit of the region’s many football fans who dream of a World Cup hosted in their countries. A united Maghreb bid would increase the region’s chance of earning the trust of the footballing world.  “I confirm Algeria’s readiness to evaluate a prospective joint bid with Morocco and Tunisia for the 2030 World Cup. This will yield enormous benefits.”  According to Hattab, if the three Maghreb countries stood together for the hosting rights, the bid would be “more solid” and competitive given the sporting and cultural infrastructure that each country will bring to the table. Algerian Football Federation President Kheireddine Zetchi is also supportive of the united Maghreb idea. Following Morocco’s 2026 bid’s defeat on June 13, he “frankly endorsed the idea,” saying that joint bids are more likely to succeed in the future, considering that the number of teams participating in the World Cup will go up to 48 in coming tournaments, from 32.  To convince national federations of their technical and logistical abilities to organize the tournament and bear the extra costs that come with hosting all 48 competing teams, “bidders will henceforth have to join forces” and disregard political divergences, Zetchi explained. Meanwhile, Morocco, which made the proposal in the first place, seems to be having mixed feelings over a united bid with fellow Maghreb countries.  Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, July 24, Fouzi Lekjaa, the president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), suggested that Morocco is currently considering whether it would prefer a joint bid with Tunisia and Algeria or with its Iberian neighbors, Spain and Portugal. “Morocco will bid to host the 2030 World Cup. But we don’t yet know whether it will be a joint bid with countries in the Maghreb or elsewhere,” he said.

Rabat- The Moroccan Association for the Fight against AIDS (ALCS) has called for the government to accelerate its efforts to eradicate the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) by providing the latest treatment drugs in public hospitals. In Morocco, 400,000 people, representing 1.2 percent of the population, suffer from HCV which causes inflammation and damage of the liver. Not all patients can afford the expensive treatment. For this reason, ALCS insists the government implements low-cost treatment and believes that providing early diagnosis for HCV in public hospitals should be a top priority for the government. In line with World Hepatitis Day today, July 28, ALCS pointed out the importance of raising awareness of the disease and called on citizens to watch out for symptoms, such as fatigue, fever, vomiting, decreased appetite, dark urine, and jaundice. In 2017, Morocco announced a plan to wipe out the virus from the country by 2030. The director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Administration, Abderrahman Maâroufi, explained that the plan seeks to provide low-cost treatment for HCV patients. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 71 million people have chronic Hepatitis C infection, making the disease a major public health concern worldwide. The infectious liver disease is caused by the Hepatitis C virus. The virus can cause either acute or chronic hepatitis, ranging in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Chronic hepatitis can bring on cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer after many years.  Despite challenges in Morocco’s health system, the chance of recovery from HCV has doubled since 2015, when Sofosbuvir medicines began to be sold in the kingdom. The medication helps 95 percent of patients in Morocco regardless of the severity of the disease.

Rabat- Amid a major boycott protesting high commodity prices, Spanish transport firm ALSA announced an increase in its ticket prices from MAD 4 to 5, a decision that will not go unnoticed. The consequences of the boycott has not prevented the company from making what some might see as a risky decision that could anger people who use public transport. On Wednesday, July 25, the company announced it signed a new 15-year contract with Morocco’s Al Assima group, which manages the kingdom’s urban transport. ALSA City bus will increase its operational buses, which will service Rabat, Sale, and Temara, a coastal city 11 kilometers south of Rabat. While the agreement aims to alleviate traffic congestion in the Rabat-Sale metropolitan area, the increase in ticket prices by MAD 1 comes at an awkard time. Passengers should expect more increases as the MAD 5 price is stipulated for only  four years of the contract. The contract states that the ticket price will be raised to MAD 5.5 from the fifth year until the eighth year and will reach MAD 6 in the ninth year. Public transport complaints remain a concern in Morocco, as those who lack the means have been urging the government to improve connectivity and mobility of transport options. Over the last ten years, urban transport in the neighboring cities of Rabat, Sale, Skhirat, and Temara experienced a decreased quality of service at the hands of the French Veolia company, which broke its contract in 2009. Al Assima pledged to invest MAD 150 million for ALSA City to add 430 buses by the seventh year. The agreement also promises to create job opportunities for local drivers as ALSA wants to train and recruit 1,607 employees working with the current bus company in the region, Stareo, to improve the quality of human resources. After Veolia withdrew from its operations by breaking its contract, Stareo took over the management of the city buses in 2009. However, Stareo could not meet the demands of citizens, a situation that led Al Assima to launch a call for tender to attract a new transport company in January 2018. ALSA, which operates in four large cities in Morocco, won the offer after several months of negotiations. The company has a total of 653 buses in Morocco; 206 in Agadir, 257 in Marrakech, 150 in Tangier, and 40 in Khouribga, a city 130 kilometers southeast of Casablanca. Moroccan citizens have battled with price increases on fuel, mineral water, and dairy products, which lead to the ongoing boycott targeting three leading companies, namely Sidi Ali (mineral water), Centrale Danone (dairy), and Afriquia gasoline. The boycott began April 20. Moroccan consumers have pulled together against these companies that they consider have set high prices without considering consumers’ purchasing power. The rise in bus prices could prove an issue for regular passengers from modest backgrounds who usually take buses, instead of taxis or tramways, given that they are the cheapest transportation in Moroccan cities.

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat- Former American diplomat and founder of the renowned Rick’s Cafe Casablanca passed away Thursday, July 16th, according to the US Embassy’s Twitter account. US-Moroccan relations have lost a champion. Kathy Kriger first came to Casablanca as a diplomat, but soon fell in love with Morocco. She made Rick’s Café in the classic film Casablanca into reality, and was a larger-than-life figure in the community. We will miss her dearly. — U.S. Embassy Morocco (@USEmbMorocco) July 26, 2018  ???? ???????? ????????? ???????? ??????? ??????? ???? ????? ???? ???? ????? ?????? ??????? ????? ?????????? ? ??? ?? ???? ?????? ????? ?????? ??. ???? ???? ???? ???? ??? ?? ????? ??????? ???????? ??????? ????????? ????????. ???? ?? ???????? ?????? ????? ?? ??????? ???????? ????. pic.twitter.com/ZotJw8gxph — U.S. Embassy Morocco (@USEmbMorocco) July 26, 2018  Details on Kriger’s death have not been made public at this time.  Kriger was born and raised near Portland, Oregon, in the United States. She founded her own travel agency and then traveled the world. Kriger settled in Morocco in 1998. She worked for US and Foreign Commercial Service with the US Embassy in Rabat as a commercial counselor, but retired from the job a few years later to establish Rick’s Cafe Casablanca, a combination restaurant, bar, and cafe inspired by the nightclub featured in the 1942 classic film, “Casablanca.” Like many foreigners before her, Kriger was disappointed to learn that “Rick’s Cafe Americain,” the periphery for the setting of “Casablanca,” was in fact purely fictional. Kriger saw the potential for a financial enterprise that had somehow been overlooked. Kriger was a longtime fan of “Casablanca” from the moment she first saw it in 1974 in her hometown. After opening Rick’s Cafe Casablanca, it was said that most nights, Kriger could be found standing at the corner of the bar, earning her the nickname “Madame Rick.” She used to instruct waiters to refill her wine glass only with water until 11 p.m., at which time she allowed herself a glass of Moroccan Val D’Argan Blanc.  When Kriger decided to turn her dream to recreate Rick’s Cafe into a reality, the road was not an easy one. In fact, Kriger later wrote and published a book, “Rick’s Cafe: Bringing the Film Legend to Life in Casablanca,” explaining her motivations and some of the complications with founding the cafe. First, Kriger took out a loan to purchase an old courtyard-style mansion built in 1930 and located in the ancient medina (the old city) of Casablanca, Morocco. The house was in very poor condition when work began, but its location held a lot of appeal. Furthermore, the mansion faced the port and had two palm trees positioned on either side of the main door. Kriger set about renovating the mansion, enlisting the help of renowned interior designer Bill Willis. The loan that Kriger took out ran out before she started the cafe, so she turned to fundraising to help finance the enterprise. Kriger founded the company known as “The Usual Suspects,” and then set about finishing “Rick’s Cafe Casablanca” under its auspices.  Rick’s Cafe Casablanca opened its doors on March 1, 2004. Features like balconies, brass lighting, a sculpted bar, curved arches, and a 1930’s Pleyel piano pay tribute to the original “feel” of the cinematic cafe that inspired it. Enhancements such as traditional tiles and woodwork from Morocco’s craft industries have also been incorporated into the cafe.  Kriger’s goal was to make Rick’s Cafe Casablanca “everything it was in the movie, and then some.” Although the movie was released under the name “Casablanca,” the name of the original script, “Everyone Comes to Rick’s,” showcases just how much the film centers on the activities of the cafe and not just romantic love. On the surface, “Casablanca” is an exotic and dramatic love story, but at its heart, it is actually a commentary on cultural tolerance and diversity. The main character in “Casablanca” is a cynical, rich American named Rick who runs a nightclub known as “Rick’s Cafe Americain” in Casablanca during World War II. He pretends not to care about the ongoing war crippling Europe until his former lover shows up at his bar with a different man and disrupts his new life. In the movie, Jewish refugees are seen passing through Rick’s bar, trading jewelry, money, and even sexual favors in exchange for exit visas. At one point, Rick has a change of heart and deliberately riggs a roulette wheel so that a Bulgarian woman does not have to sleep with the chief of police in exchange for a visa. In another scene, Rick’s head waiter is shown sharing a brandy with two Austrians about to migrate to the US. He also takes a moment to compliment them on their broken English. Similarly, in creating Rick’s Cafe Casablanca, Kriger sought to convey a powerful message. After the considerable backlash against Muslims in America following the 9/11 attacks, Kriger wanted to create a place of tolerance and unity. This effort is apparent in some of the small details of the cafe, for example, the fact that the menu incorporates both American and traditional Moroccan dishes.  Kriger also sought to prove that an American woman operating alone in a Muslim society can run a successful business. “Casablanca” is considered a classic tale and is often found on critic’s lists for the 10 greatest movies of all time. The film’s origin story began when a Warner Bros. story analyst encouraged producer Hal B. Wallis to purchase filmmaking rights to an unproduced stage play entitled, “Everyone Comes to Rick’s.” The rights cost $20,000 and at the time, it was the most anyone had ever paid for an unproduced play. Ironically, most of the film (with the exception of one sequence) was shot in Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. None of it was ever filmed in Casablanca or in any other part of Morocco. “Casablanca” was an A-list film that utilized established actors and exceptional scriptwriters; nevertheless, expectations of its success were relatively low. The movie production costs totaled $1,039,000 ($75,000 over budget), and the film grossed $3,398,000 domestically and $3,461,000 abroad. The film was not so much an immediate hit as one that met solid success which grew into a large fanbase over time. Acknowledgment for “Casablanca” began to skyrocket when it won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Additionally, Michael Curtiz was selected as Best Director, and Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein, and Howard Koch were all honored for writing the Best Adapted Screenplay. One of the reasons the film was not expected to be a huge success was that it was rushed into and through production. When filming began, the script itself was only half-completed. In the final days of shooting the movie, script was being written the very night before; sometimes dialogue for certain scenes was even written during filming and rushed onto the set.  Production was hurried along to take advantage of the publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa and the capture of Casablanca from the Nazis during World War II. The movie was intended to boost morale and inspire hope in the thrall of worldwide conflict.  “Casablanca” was originally anticipated to release in early 1943, but due to production pressure it premiered at New York City’s Hollywood Theater on November 26, 1942. The United States Office of War Information prevented the screening of the film to troops in North Africa, however, fearing controversy and resentment over its romanticized plot.

By Dil Bola Rabat – It is not uncommon for educated professionals to pursue careers out of state as low salaries, poor work conditions, a lack of funding, and an absence of opportunities motivates the exodus of skilled workers in the Global South.  The brain drain of senior executives and engineers has caused recent concern in studies of migration, remittances, and the economic survival of the Moroccan state.  Said Amzazi, the Moroccan minister of education, spoke of the painful brain drain, noting that each year, over 600 engineers leave Morocco in search of better conditions and, ultimately, job satisfaction and better pay in a more academically-progressive environment.  The phenomenon is not exclusive to engineers. The president of the Moroccan Federation of Information Technologies, Salwa Belkeziz-Karkari, asserted that around 8,000 senior Moroccan cadres leave each year as well. Whether they were trained in the public or private sector, these individuals resign from their position in office to go elsewhere.  Further, Belkeziz-Karkari noted that French multinationals make weekly visits with Moroccan executives to persuade them to immigrate and resettle in France. In exchange, they are offered consistent wages, health benefits, and encouraging working environments.  Despite migration opportunities, 74 percent of Moroccan professionals living abroad are inclined to return to their country in hopes to put improve and develop working conditions in the state. However, some are still reluctant because Morocco’s atmosphere lacks appeal and thus, many fail to return in the end. Emigration of professionals and academics in Morocco dates back to the 1950s. The ‘flight of human capital’ as it was called, referred to the movement of highly educated individuals to industrialized states. However, there was a  dramatic increase in numbers since the 1970s when other states’ selective immigration policies began to favor skilled workers.  Initially, Morocco gained remittances that aided economic survival. But over time, the lack of positive results through these investments aimed at development has caused a decline in remittances. The lack of results prompts emigrants to remain in states offering optimal opportunities. Consequently, the Moroccan economy has slowed down and the jobless are apprehensive of the government failing to facilitate employment.   The solution to this detrimental economic drawback may be simple. In order to accelerate and develop the financial system, halting the brain drain is essential. In order to retain educated individuals, the government could make a good start by improving working conditions, raising salaries, and providing research facilities. If the government monitors emigrants with academic or professional capabilities and implements recruiting programs to facilitate not only their return, but the expertise they have amassed, the Moroccan economy has the potential to improve drastically if not develop to reach new heights of industrial capacity.

Rabat – Royal Air Maroc (RAM) pilots’ protests have caused massive losses to the company’s finances of an estimated MAD 20 million each day, according to L’Economiste. The trouble began on July 18 when the national union of pilots called for a general strike, demanding better working conditions, improved salaries, and more decent treatment, especially regarding retirement terms and health coverage.  While RAM’s management was confident that it would find an accommodation with its pilots early on, and things would return to normal in less than a week, the strike has caused unprecedented financial losses, almost paralyzing RAM’s activities. “Since July 18, everything at the company is now upside down,” one worker was quoted as saying. According to L’Economiste, the protests have become unbearable for RAM management, with some executive officers complaining that the company feels increasingly “compelled to cancel the vast majority of its flights.” Since July 18, approximately 80 flights have been called off, forcing the company to compensate more than 12,000 passengers. But financial compensations is not the only burden on RAM’s already-suffering budget. Extra burdens for the company include hotel and restaurant costs for cancelled night flights, negotiations with other airlines to make up for RAM flights’ unavailability, and maintenance costs for otherwise inoperative carriers. As projections of future losses are far more significant than the current level, RAM has expressed a willingness to negotiate. On Wednesday, July 25, the company’s CEO Abdelhamid Abdou met members of the company’s executive board and pilots’ representatives to find an agreement and salvage the company’s assets and reputation for the remaining month of the summer period. But while there is hope that an agreement will be reached in coming days, there is apprehension as to whether it will be a temporary or final resolution. According to L’Economiste, RAM’s dream of enlarging its fleet would be greatly jeopardized should the company’s management comply with pilots’ current salary demands. Meanwhile, with August (the most profitable month in the summer period) around the corner and an estimated 32,000 Moroccans preparing for pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the company is under intense pressure to find a crisis recovery plan.

By Dil Bola  Rabat- US President Donald Trump tweeted threats to Iranian Prime Minister Hassan Rouhani on Sunday; the latest development in worsening US-Iran relations. US-Iranian relations over the course of the last century have continuously shifted, but American interference remains prominent within the predominantly Shiite Islam state. Contemporary issues stem from the recent decision enforced by the Trump administration’s withdrawing the US from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), otherwise known as the Iran Nuclear Deal coupled with the reinstatement of economic sanctions. The leaders of each state have taken to social media in an attempt to tackle the issue as disagreements, threats, and challenges from each side take the internet by storm.  Rouhani initiated the most recent heated debate during his address to diplomats on July 22nd in Tehran. He warned the US that a war with Iran would be “the mother of all wars” while attempts to maintain “peace with Iran is the mother of all peace,” thus implying a peace agreement was not out of the question.  However, the US would have to comply with a potential agreement. His next message to President Trump: “do not play with the lion’s tail, because you will regret it eternally,” clearly exhibits Iran’s position. Iran has decided to put an end to the diplomatic coercion of US leaders, who many have labelled as a bully in the global arena.  Trump quickly took to Twitter to respond, threaten, and, ultimately, challenge the Iranian regime the next night.    To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE &amp; DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2018  Trump’s ferocity, encapsulated in his all-caps tirade, took Twitter and the international community by storm. Rouhani dismissed the outburst as “baseless comments and empty threats.” He added: “We should respond to them with action” rather than responding “to any nonsensical comment.” Rouhani’s statements prompted a response from Iran’s dominant military figure, the general of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Sardar Qasem Soleimani of the IRGC was quoted Thursday, July 26, saying: “The Red Sea which was secure is no longer secure with the American presence.” Additionally, he stated the president “should know that [Iran is] a nation of martyrdom and that [they] await him,” implying Iran is prepared for a war that would “destroy all that [the US] possesses.”  To understand this week’s Twitter battle, it’s necessary to understand the history of US-Iran relations. With US external interference reaching new heights during the Cold War era, the 1950s saw heavy US involvement within the Iranian government, with assistance from the UK. To assure Soviet-Iranian relations would not further, the US orchestrated a coup removing democratically-elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of Shah Reza Pahlavi. The shah subsequently became the reigning authoritarian monarch and a lackey of the US.  Following the coup, Shah Pahlavi eagerly signed the Iran-United States Agreement for Cooperation Concerning Civil Uses of Atomic Energy in 1957 and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968, thus relinquishing Iran’s ability to develop nuclear-powered weaponry. In return, the US granted mass amounts of foreign aid to Iran, consolidating the alliance.  Rising tensions and conflicting ideals within government and amongst civilians resulted in the Iranian Revolution of 1979. Civilian insurrections ousted the shah and soon after prompted the return of the previously exiled Ruhollah Khomeini. The affair highlights the swift change in Iranian governance as the secular, Westernized state quickly became the first official Shiite state ruled by Sharia law.  The newly-revolutionized Iranian government under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini primarily aimed to reject Western civilization, especially from the US. Diplomatic relations rapidly deteriorated as the Cold War continued and fear of nuclear warfare in the Middle East once again became the US main security concern.  US retaliation came in the form of heavy economic sanctions destroying Iran’s trade ability. Not only did the US impose sanctions, it encouraged others to do the same. By stunting their economic growth, the US crippled Iran’s economy, leaving the country with no choice but to renegotiate terms.  The JCPOA, under Barack Obama’s administration, was the conclusion of formal negotiations between Iran and six major powers—the US, the UK, Russia, France, China, and Germany—in 2015. The agreement aimed to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation by eliminating certain Iranian facilities and scientific practices that could result in Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons. As part of the terms of the agreement, Iran granted the International Atomic Energy Commission (IAEA) the ability to periodically inspect the state, ensuring Iranian compliance.  In May of 2018, the US officially withdrew from the agreement. Other parties to the deal reassured Iran that they would attempt to preserve the deal.  President Donald Trump justified his withdrawal and reinstatement of sanctions by claiming the deal was “defective at its core” and further, insinuating the IAEA inspections failed to notice Iranian nuclear weapons development activity that was still taking place.  Additionally, President Trump claims that if Iran considered relinquishing development of ballistic missile programs, he would be open to re-negotiating terms of the deal. Trump also said that Iranian support for the Assad government in Syria, its intervention in the Yemeni civil war, and the role of Iranian military forces in regional disputes, all informed his decision to exit the agreement.  When the US exited the deal, the Iranian currency instantly took a dive. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded directly to the US president, stating Trump had “made a mistake.” Further, after President Hassan Rouhani verified Iranian attempts to salvage the deal through guarantees with remaining European powers rather than re-negotiating with the US, Khamenei stated: “I said from the first day: don’t trust America.”  As Iranians set American flags on fire in front of Tehran’s parliament building, Iranian rockets based in Syria fired off at Israeli military targets.  The US congressional response remains divided as ever. Indeed, most issues reaching the House provoke divisive reactions.  The general Republican opposition to the Iran deal stems from “genuine distaste for the deal’s details, inherent distrust of President Obama, intense loyalty to Israel and an expansive view of the role that sanctions have played beyond preventing Iran’s nuclear activities,” according to a New York Times analysis of the affair.  Democratic opinions, on the other hand, primarily argue the path of diplomacy is the only option with Iran as renegotiation is unrealistic—in the face of false accusations, Iran will reject US attempts to discuss a settlement.   In rescinding its commitments on a significant foreign policy agreement, the US has proved to be unreliable. With no foundation of possible replacements for the agreement, President Trump’s juvenile diplomatic behaviour once again comes to the forefront as he repeatedly takes to Twitter to openly threaten leaders of states.  In saying that, rhetoric used within his statements mirrors prior inflammatory exchanges with North Korea, prompting the question: Are these empty threats simply a new form of US strategy in the age of social media? Or is a US-Iranian war the only way the standoff can end after the US renounced the agreement?  In either case, US foreign policy has lost credibility, and Iran has even less incentive to comply with or submit to US demands, which no longer seems to be on the table. Both leaders should tread carefully over the political minefield they have created in order to avoid a worst-case scenario of a full-scale US-Iranian war which would only further destabilize the Middle Eastern region and polarize the global arena.

Rabat – Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and French President Emmanuel Macron have pledged more support and cooperation with migrants’ countries of origin, transit, and destination, “especially Morocco,” to tackle migration issues. Sanchez received Macron yesterday at his residence in Madrid, where they discussed several issues including European Union reform, trade, and migration. The European leaders also co-chaired a press conference where they agreed to cooperate with countries involved in migration. The countries will provide support through agencies such as the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, the European Neighborhood Instrument, the European Development Fund, and the Alliance for Sahel. Spain and France also issued a joint statement, explaining the dimensions and challenges countries face due to migration. According to the European countries, migration is “a global challenge that requires European responses.” Those responses, they said, should be based on “solidarity and respect for human rights” and aimed at providing “an effective response to the arrival of refugees and migrants.” The decision of both European countries came after more than 700 sub-Saharan migrants stormed the border fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta on Thursday morning, July 26.  Dozens of the migrants were injured during the incursion. The migration challenge, according to the two cabinets, must be approached from a humanitarian dimension and not only following a security and border control approach. In the joint statement, Spain and France also expressed their determination to organize a regional meeting of European and African ministers concerned with migration affairs, with the aim of looking into migration flows from African countries and exploring joint initiatives. Face it According to Infomigrants, the number of migrants arriving in the Spanish enclave of Ceuta by sea had quadrupled in the first four months of 2018. Five boats, carrying 233 migrants arrived in the first months of 2018, compared to only 51 migrant arrivals by sea in the same period of 2017. Thousands of migrants take the risky sea route to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. The attempt claims the lives of thousands of migrants every year. Throughout the years, Morocco has long promised to tackle the issue of migration; King Mohammed VI has invited African leaders many times to increase their efforts to manage the issue. According to Morocco’s Permanent Ambassador to the  United Nations Omar Hilale,  the North African country has called world leaders to a “realism and global vision” to face the issue.
Morocco will also host an international conference to sign the Global Pact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) on December 10-11 in Marrakech.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Health has given its version of the story after a pediatric surgeon accused a hospital of corruption and made a public and controversial resignation on Monday, July 23.  The surgeon, Dr. Mehdi Echafai, is better known as the “poor people’s doctor” for helping hundreds of families treat their children. Before resigning, he worked in the Tiznit Provincial Hospital, in an area 97 kilometers south of Agadir. Echafai accused the hospital of “abuses” and “corruption,” denouncing “administrative problems” that negatively impacted his family and his own health.  Following Echafai’s accusations Monday, the ministry issued a statement on Thursday, July 26. The department explained that the 34-year-old surgeon “made administrative errors” that led to him being sent to a disciplinary council. The ministry noted the doctor’s right to defense by lawyers had been respected.   Back in February, the hospital’s chief medical officer accused the surgeon, Mehdi Echafai, of insulting him and sued the surgeon for libel and defamation. Echafai had posted a video online in February in which he denounced his superiors’ moral harassment, the failing health system, and corruption within the hospital. The ministry assured that the conflict between the surgeon and the chief medical officer was a personal matter that had nothing to do with the doctor’s professional activity.  Furthermore, the statement claimed that Dr. Echafai “has been the subject of a complaint filed by the father of a patient who accuses him of refusing to take charge of his child without valid reason and to have published his medical file on his Facebook page.”  The Ministry of Health explained that the doctor was under a disciplinary measure depriving him of his salary for 4 months. The regional health department assured that it does not wish to “interfere in a case in progress,” but that it is determined “to take the necessary measures in light of what will decide the justice.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Industry and Trade has announced that China’s Citic Dicastal will build two factories to produce aluminum car wheels, in Tangier and Kenitra, 45 kilometers north of Rabat. The Chinese giant will invest €350 million to build the plants. The company will build the first factory in Kenitra’s Atlantic Free zone.  The second factory will be built in Tangier’s tech city. The Chinese firm aims to produce six million units every year for export. The project also seeks to create 1,200 job opportunities. Minister of Trade Moulay Hafid Elalamy said the “implementation of this strategic project reflects the strong will of Morocco and China to reinforce their bilateral relations.” He added that the construction of the first factory “should take less than 10 months.” Elalamy claimed that Morocco’s automotive industry has established itself as a leading export sector and a driving force for the domestic industry. He added that more efforts will be made to further support the sector. Elalamy and Morocco’s Minister of Finance and Economy Mohamed Boussaid signed the agreement with Vice President of Citic Group Corporation and Chairman of Citic Dicastal Xu Zuo. Xu said that through this project, “Dicastal will expand its global coverage and contribute to the industrial development of Morocco.” The Citic Dicastal Group has 30 production hubs in Europe, North America, and China dedicated to the production of light automotive components and aluminum rims.  The company supplies major automakers, including Renault-Nissan, PSA, GM, Ford, FCA, Toyota, Volkswagen, BMW, and  Audi. The agreement followed an announcement in June of the launch of construction on Magneti Marelli’s production plant in Tangier. The project will cost MAD 405 million and create 500 job opportunities. The plant will also be operational by 2019. The automotive industry led the list of growing sectors in Morocco’s exports, with an increased production of 19.1 percent, in the first six months of 2018. This sector remains a top priority for Morocco. Morocco manufactured 341,802 passenger vehicles in 2017, for the first time surpassing South Africa which produced 331,311 units, according to a 2017 report conducted by IOL. The report stated that South Africa, traditionally the continent’s leading car-producing country, is intimidated by Morocco’s growing production capacity in the automotive sector.  In 2017, Elalamy announced Morocco’s intention to exceed MAD 100 billion in export sales by 2020 and further make MAD 200 billion in exports with a production capacity of 1 million vehicles by 2025.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has denied the existence of an economic crisis in Morocco while highlighting the government’s achievements in promoting the automobile industry and attracting foreign investment. El Othmani answered questions during a House of Representatives session on Monday, July 23. The second session (April session) of the legislative year in Parliament closed its work on Tuesday, July 24, with disappointing results in terms of the government’s response to questions. In the last four months, deputies asked 972 oral questions. The government answered only 385 questions. Ministers answered only 4,631(53 percent) of 8,669 written questions.  No economic crisis in Morocco El Othmani denied the existence of an economic crisis in Morocco, stating that no reports have mentioned the issue. “Claiming there is a suffocating economic crisis in Morocco is false and out of logic. No report whether national or international has been made about this. The word ‘suffocating’ is overstating. If it was suffocating, no money would be left in the state and no parliamentarian would be paid.”  El Othmani also asserted that international reports praised national economy, and, “The Moroccan reports did not say there is an economic crisis in the country.” According to El Othmani, national reports stated that Morocco’s economy should be developed on three levels: convergence of public policies, competitiveness of the national economy, and human capital. Otherwise, national experts affirmed that the Moroccan economic outlook is positive on the whole.  BMI Research automobile industry a 3.5 percent rate of GDP growth in Morocco in 2018. Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Boussaid was ever so slightly more optimistic, saying on July 19 that Morocco’s economy output growth forecasted an increase of 3.6 percent for 2018. According to Boussaid, the fisheries and phosphates sectors increased production by 5.7 percent and 6.4 percent in the first half of 2018, respectively. He also noted that Morocco’s tourism increased by 11.8 percent, and overnight stays recorded an increase of 10.7 percent at the end of April 2018. New foreign investment agreements El Othmani also said the government has signed agreements with foreign investors. “There are signed agreements, and they will be implemented before the end of year.” “It is not easy to get this kind of investment; there are many measures to be taken and long stages to go through in order to gain foreign investments,” he added.  According to automobile industry, foreign direct investments (FDI) declined by 33.1 percent in the first half of 2018, after rising 24 percent in 2017. The foreign exchange regulator reported that Morocco attracted nearly $2.57 billion of direct investment in 2017. The US Department of State affirmed what El Othmani said about foreign investment via its investment climate statements for 2018. The report stated that Morocco has approved “68 bilateral investment treaties for the promotion and protection of investments and 60 economic agreements that aim to eliminate the double taxation of income or gains, including with the United States and most EU nations.” In the past six years, Morocco implemented many reforms facilitating business registration, such as “reducing company registration fees, and eliminating minimum capital requirements for limited liability companies,” according to the same report. The head of government further said that Morocco’s unemployment rate remains better than that of neighbor countries. “If we compare Morocco’s to its surrounding countries, Spain has 15.5 percent of unemployment while Morocco has only 10.5 percent. The same goes for France, Italy, Tunisia and Algeria….However, I agree that further efforts should be made to meet citizens’ expectations.” Indeed, according to the research group automobile industry, Morocco’s actual unemployment rate is 10.5 percent. Nevertheless, Morocco still has to create an extra 115,000 jobs per year to maintain its current labor participation rate, which is 47 percent. Morocco vs Spain According to the CIA’s World Factbook statistics, unemployment in Morocco slightly decreased from 9.4 percent in 2016 to 9.3 percent in 2017. Spain’s unemployment rate went down from 19.6 percent in 2016 to 17.1 percent in 2017. The latest automobile industry studies estimated a 15.8 percent of unemployment rate in Spain. Spain has therefore decreased unemployment at a rate of 3.5 percent from 2016 until 2018. Morocco recorded an average increase in unemployment of 1.2 percent since 2016. However, according to automobile industry from Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP), Morocco’s unemployment rate increased from 9.9 percent to 10.2 percent between 2016 and 2017, a 4.2 percent increase year-on-year. With a population of 34 million, Morocco had 12 million in the labor force in 2017. In the same year, 22.75 million of Spain’s 49 million were employed, according to the CIA World Factbook. Alternatives to agricultural dependence on rainfall El Othmani said that the government has brought new alternatives to the table to move away from agricultural dependence on rainfall. “We are reducing this dependence through increasing the industry rate in the national economy,” he said. But he also acknowledged that “this is something that cannot be done overnight. It is done by serious building.” El Othmani also stated that aircraft industry exports are increasing annually as well as technology exports. “The industrial production rate is 18 percent now in raw domestic production. We are working to reach 23 percent in 2021. Therefore, the upcoming government will find a national economy that is less dependent on rainfall.” According to the BMI research group, automobile production in Morocco is expected to grow by an annual average of 17.4 percent over the quarters of 2018 and 2019. “These investment flows are underpinned by the government’s extensive support and incentive programmes, and an increasingly favourable investment climate.” According to North Africa Post, vehicles led Morocco’s exports in the first six months of 2018 at MAD 35.973 billion, as “the country continues to attract automotive investments.” El Othmani praised the efforts that have been made by previous governments, but said, “However, there are still problems and imbalances that should be dealt with.” El Othmani also saluted all Moroccan competent people who are working hard to develop the industrial sector.

Rabat – Melilla has appealed to Moroccan authorities for repatriation assistance following an alarming increase in Moroccan youth illegally entering the Spanish enclave. The autonomous Spanish city on Africa’s north coast requested a service matching the current situation in Paris: a group of Moroccan police will operate from the French capital to identify and assist in repatriation of minors from the kingdom. Daniel Ventura, anadviser for Melilla’s Department of Social Welfare, stressed in a statement to the press that the city cannot handle minors numbering in the hundreds with facilities designed for far fewer.  “It would be interesting for the six Moroccan agents who came to Paris to identify and repatriate the 400 minors holding a Moroccan document that we welcome in the centers as well as all those living in the street,” he said. Of the approximately 400 young people in question, Ventura estimates facilities can barely house 180. The remaining hundreds, he said, “must be repatriated to Morocco or to other Spanish regions.” He threatened to house the excess minors in tents outside the center, which is already past maximum capacity.  In July alone, almost 100 new young migrants entered Melilla. Most access the territory either with the assistance of a bribed smuggler on the Moroccan side or as stowaways underneath vehicles crossing the border. Local human rights organization Harraga denounced the lack of legal assistance available to the minors, who essentially function in limbo waiting for their 18th birthdays. Another NGO, Save the Children, criticized authorities in Melilla for their “deplorable” handling of the issue even with the considerable funds available for such a purpose. By Anna Schaeffer

Returnees typically receive sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years in prison. According to El Khiame and official estimates, the number of Moroccan fighters affiliated with ISIS and other transnational terrorist networks is approximately 1,660 fighters.  They are spread throughout the MENA region, but are mainly in Iraq, Syria, and Libya. That figure also includes the 200 or so who have already returned to Morocco.

Rabat – Debate over racism claims made by German midfielder Mesut Ozil continue to spark controversy. The chairman of Germany’s football association (DFB) Reinhard Grindel has refuted the former midfielder’s claims of racist statements made against him. Sunday, Ozil resigned from international football after slamming DFB for criticizing his meeting with Turkish President Recap Tayyip Erdogan before the World Cup. Ozil, who has Turkish roots, criticized the racism he felt was present on his football team, saying: “I’m a German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose.”  Grindel admitted Ozil’s departure from the team erupted a debate about racism. As quoted by BBC, the DFB president stated: “Mesut Ozil’s decision to step down from the Germany national team has triggered a debate about racism in general and about football’s capabilities for integration in particular. As DFB president, I do not wish to shy away from this debate.” Defending both his federation and himself, Grindel continued, “any form of racial hostility will not be accepted or tolerated under any circumstances,” adding that he is proud of the efforts made by DFB to integrate footballers. DFB then issued a statement on Monday, also expressing regret over Ozil’s decision to quit the team. However, like Grindel, the federation negated Ozil’s claims. “We emphatically reject the DFB being linked to racism. The DFB has been very involved in integration work in Germany for many years.” Ozil’s exit sparked international debate and was also met with some support. Erdogan voiced support of Ozil’s decision and described “racist attitude” against the player as “unacceptable.” The Turkish Football Federation (TFF) also expressed their support for Ozil.

Rabat- Royal Air Maroc’s losses due to striking pilots could reach a record high since the European Court of Justice ruled May 31 that transit destinations must be included in delay-related indemnity that airlines are required to pay passengers. Royal Air Maroc has cancelled more than 20 flights so far this week and delayed many more due to the firm’s pilots’ ongoing protests.  According to European transports law, when flights are delayed hours beyond the initial schedule, the responsible airline is obligated to pay financial compensation to wronged passengers. The rule, according to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) applies to any airline—European or non-European—whose itinerary includes a European airport. The financial compensations per passenger are set at: €250 for short flights (1,500 kilometers or less), €400 for mid-distance flights (1,500-3,500 kilometers), and €600 for long flights (more than 3,500 kilometers). Royal Air Maroc pilots called for a general strike earlier this month, protesting for improved working conditions, including higher wages, more holidays, and full health insurance coverage.  The costs of the pilots’ protests have already been significant for Morocco’s national carrier, with increasing delays and cancelled flights since the start of the strike on July 18. But as the majority of this week’s cancelled flights featured a European destination—either as departure, destination, or transit—the company’s troubles are likely to increase if it does not find an agreement with its pilots.  Royal Air Maroc all too well knows the implications of the European law on flights. The firm lost out in a revealing dispute with Claudia Wegener, a German passenger, who had booked an RAM flight from Berlin to Agadir with a layover in Casablanca.  In Casablanca, however, the flight to Agadir was delayed more than three hours. When Wegener took issue with RAM management and asked for financial compensation based on the European transports law, she was told that the EU’s transports law did not apply in her case because Casablanca-Agadir is territorially outside of Europe. On May 31, however, the ECJ ruled in favor of Wegener, arguing that the German passenger booked one single ticket that read “Berlin/Casablanca/Agadir,” as opposed to two separate ones. According to the ECJ’s ruling, as long as the ticket’s itinerary includes a European airport, the European law applies.

Rabat – After three months of negotiations, Morocco and the EU signed their long-anticipated fisheries deal July 24 in Rabat. Criticism of the agreement, however, indicates a brewing legal battle: the Polisario Front has said it will fight the fisheries deal. EU-Morocco fishery ties date back to 1995. Strong pushback against this particular deal—from the Polisario Front, the European Court of Justice—failed to block the EU and Morocco from moving forward in negotiations. The Polisario Front stated its intentions to pursue legal action against the EU and the fishery deal in April. On Sunday, Polisario Front Envoy to the European Commission Mohamed Sidati said, “[The deal] only encourages the Moroccan occupation… Morocco steals the resources of Western Sahara people, who largely live in exile and in poverty, deprived of their land and sea. And the European Commission is accomplice to this robbery.” Western Sahara Resource Watch Coordinator Sara Eyckmans asserted the imminent failure of the deal. “As no effort has been made to seek the consent of the people of Western Sahara, a new deal with Morocco for these waters will be illegal.” In February the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled against the inclusion of Western Saharan coastal waters in the fisheries deal. ECJ Advocate General Melchior Wathelet asserted that the deal’s inclusion of the Western Sahara undermines its legitimacy and warrants the agreement should be declared null and void. Former Policy Advisor at the European Parliament Jeanne Laperrouza explained, however, that this ruling is significant but does not hold jurisdiction over the legal outcome.  “The ECJ court does not have the authority to conclude that Sahara waters do not fall within the sovereignty or jurisdiction of Morocco,” she said. In July, the EU rejected a proposal by European Parliament members to block the deal. Concerns include the notion that involving territory not globally recognized as part of Morocco in this arrangement contradicts international law. Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita emphasized the geographic provisions of the law, including waters off the coast of Western Sahara, during a statement to the press. “The answer is clear, since Article 1 of this agreement stipulates that the fishing area extends from parallel 35 to parallel 22, meaning from Cape Spartel in northern Morocco to Cap Blanc in the south.” Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita and Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Aziz Akhannouch praised the agreement’s inclusion of Sahrawi waters. Morocco, expressing satisfaction with the deal, issued a statement applauding the EU’s compromise to include the Western Sahara despite “maneuvers by our enemies to question the unity of Morocco as a nation.” “Attempts by the opponents of Morocco to question this exclusive jurisdiction have been foiled and rejected,” the statement declared. Before entering into effect, the deal must pass through the European Parliament and receive ratification by all 28 EU member states.

Rabat – New Directions Publishing has released English editions of two works by the celebrated late Moroccan author Ahmed Bouanani. Thanks to the prestigious publishing house, the pieces—a novel and poetry collection—by the Casablanca filmmaker, author, and poet are available in the third most-spoken language worldwide for the first time.  The New York-based publisher released in June their first copies of Bouanani’s work: his 1989 novel The Hospital along with two collections of poetry, Les Persiennes and Photogrammes, combined under the name The Shutters.  The Hospital weaves together fiction and autobiography in an eerie narrative based on the author’s own tuberculosis ordeal. New Directions Publishing defines it as “a tour de force: an utterly singular modern Moroccan classic.” Bouanani’s poetry collection looks boldly at national memory. Pulling from World War II, the repressive Years of Lead, the Rif War, and French and Spanish colonization, The Shutters vividly fuses imagery to emotion to history.  “These memories retrace the seasons of a country that was quickly forgetful of its past, indifferent to its present, constantly turning its back on the future,” he writes. The publishing house praised the collection as “surreal poetry [that] maps Morocco’s cultural history, as Bouanani hauntingly evokes all of the violence inflicted on his country.” At age sixteen, Bouanani lost his father to assassination during the end of the colonial era. His life’s work focused on Morocco; most notably, his 1979 film The Mirage continues to receive widespread praise as one of the best and most important Arabic films of all time. “Personally, a film that isn’t necessary, a film that isn’t deeply rooted in our realities, is a film that doesn’t interest me,” he once said about his work on the time of Sidi Ahmed ou Moussa, a leader in the peasant resistance against the Portuguese in the 1500s.  Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art described Bouanani, who died in 2011, as a champion for artistic expression in the “collective trauma of the colonial occupation of Morocco,” trailblazing “cultural practices that sought to establish a new vision of the country.” “Filmmaker, poet, and writer Ahmed Bouanani was a towering presence in this landscape, pioneering a cinematic and poetic language that influenced a generation to come.” Le Monde describes his legacy well: “An atmosphere of mystery surrounds his work: Bouanani offers a precious contribution to Morocco’s collective memory.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has urged Moroccan citizens set to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage in 2018 to represent their country properly and to “avoid all forms of selfishness and provocation.” The King’s message was read by Minister of Islamic Affairs Ahmed Taoufik in conjunction with the departure of the first group of Moroccan pilgrims at the Rabat-Salé airport on Thursday. “As you, the first group of pilgrims, are about to leave for the Holy Land, it gives me great pleasure, in my capacity as Commander of the Faithful and protector of the faith, who is entrusted with guaranteeing the performance of the rites of Islam in this country safely, to send this message to you and all those will be performing the Hajj rituals this year,” said the King. The King also expressed how the preservation of religious tenets is important to him and called on his citizens to represent their country well. “I urge you to avoid all forms of selfishness and provocation, and to embody the ideals of tolerance, solidarity, and cooperation through your endeavours to uphold righteousness and piety.” As the King congratulated Moroccans performing Hajj, he also called on them to comply with the instructions introduced by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs. According to the King, the instruction were provided to make citizens comfortable throughout their stay “and to enable you to perform Hajj in the best conditions possible.” The King added that the ministry has mobilized staff to accompany citizens on the entire pilgrimage. “They include male and female experts in Islamic affairs, doctors, nurses, healthcare providers, and administrators working around the clock to offer  whatever services our pilgrims may need.” The monarch then urged pilgrims to comply with the ministry’s arrangements “in an orderly fashion.” He also called on citizens to comply with orders issued by Saudi Arabia’s authorities. “I therefore want you to serve as ambassadors for your country, conveying a fine image of its cultural heritage,” added the King. Thousands of Moroccan pilgrims perform Hajj, an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, every year. In 2017, more than 2 million Muslims landed in Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj rituals.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) has reportedly tried to convince French-Moroccan Matteo Guendouzi to join the national team. According to Al Akhbar, FRMF is very interested in the French-Moroccan football player and wants to make him an Atlas Lion.  Back in 2017, Arsenal’s new recruit—who had already expressed his wish to wear France’s jersey—was called by the FRMF and its French coach Herve Renard to join the national team. Guendouzi’s father actually stood up the coach, who was supposed to meet him during his stay in Paris. Annoyed by this behavior, Herve Renard decided to move on.  However, it seems that Guendouzi’s new contract with the big English club has awoken FRMF President Fouzi Lekjaa’s interest in recruiting the former player of FC Lorient.  Born in Poissy, France, to a Moroccan father and a French mother, the defensive midfielder with impressive skills was trained at PSG between 2005 and 2014 before continuing his training and becoming a professional. The French-Moroccan evolved with Ligue 2’s French club since 2014. He played 26 games with the professionals: 8 in Ligue 1, 18 in Ligue 2. FRMF’s president is keen to attract the young and promising bi-national football player, who hasn’t made a choice yet. Lekjaa is looking to strengthen the national team as many Atlas Lions will retire soon because of their ages.

By Chase Lacy Rabat- Saudi Arabia announced a temporary suspension of oil shipments Thursday after two oil tankers were attacked by Houthis in the Red Sea’s Bab al-Mandeb strait on Wednesday.  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the suspension will continue “until the situation becomes clearer and maritime transit through Bab al-Mandeb is safe.” State-owned oil company Aramco released a statement confirming that two Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) with holding capacities of up to two million barrels, operated by the Bahri shipping company, were attacked by Yemen’s Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. He claimed that one of the ships had sustained minor damage, but no damage or oils spills had been reported.  On Wednesday, the Houthi-run network Almasirah reported that Houthi forces had launched a missile attack on a warship named the Dammam along Yemen’s western coast.  Bob Cavnar, an oil expert, told Al Jazeera that any delay of shipments leading to even small shortages would have repercussions globally.  Late on Wednesday, Brent Crude had risen 1.57 percent since the attack to $74.59 a barrel.  Saudi Arabia’s response yesterday stand in contrast to its response to a similar event in April when a tanker dubbed the Abaqiq was attacked. At that time, al-Falih calmed fears saying that shipments would continue as normal. The 20-kilometer-wide strait is a major transit point of world oil supplies. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that approximately 4.8 million barrels pass through the Bab al-Mandeb to global markets every day. Much of Europe’s refined oil products pass through the strait to international markets as well.  Saudi Arabia has other options to transport its oil, such as its massive pipeline connecting the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea, bypassing the strait. However, according to the EIA, Saudi, Emirati, Iraqi, and Kuwaiti ships would still be forced to navigate around Africa.  Yemen has been embroiled in conflict since the 2014 Houthi take-over of major population centers, including the capital Sana’a. In 2015 a Saudi-led coalition, including the UAE, began an offensive that has been highly criticised.  Thousands have been killed in the conflict from fighting, starvation, and diseases such as cholera. On the brink of famine, 22.2 million Yemenis, a vast majority of the population, are in need of humanitarian assistance.

Rabat – A pediatric surgeon, known as the “poor people’s doctor” for helping hundreds of families treat their children, resigned Monday, July 23, from his position in the Tiznit Provincial Hospital, in a region 97 kilometers south of Agadir. The hospital’s chief medical officer accused the surgeon, Mehdi Echafai, of insults and sued him for libel and defamation. Echafai had posted a video online in February in which he denounced his superiors’ moral harassment, the failing health system, and corruption within the hospital. The lawsuit’s third hearing ended Monday, after which Echafai announced his resignation. The pediatric surgeon explained his decision to quit because of “administrative problems” including corruption, “which scares the health system.”  In his resignation letter, he denounced the fact he was asked to give “illegal treatment” in his surgical duties, which negatively affected his family and health. A video posted on Monday and widely circulating on social media featured the doctor announcing his departure while citizens begged him to stay. The 34-year-old practitioner said he no longer wants to be part of the public health sector in Morocco, which suffers from serious anomalies and multiple deficiencies. Echafai elaborated on his resignation decision for families hoping he would stay. “I’m tired, I can’t do anything anymore! The leaders have to shoulder their responsibilities, instead of threatening me with prison after all I’ve done. I operated more than 17 children a day, if Morocco does not want me, I will work abroad,” said Echafai. Before resigning, the surgeon regularly took to his Facebook page to denounce “the dismal working conditions,” and “the glaring lack of surgical material,”and “the laxity of the staff,” and “the corruption” within the Tiznit hospital. The 34-year-old doctor discovered the dire situation of healthcare in Morocco while working in the Guelmim region south of Agadir. “I said to the Minister of Health that we, as young doctors seek to improve the situation because there are problems in the health sector and we want the Ministry to be able to make it better,” he said back in February. The doctor submitted a complaint to the health minister to protest “corruption” on Wednesday, July 25. Echafai deplored the “many dysfunctions of the health sector in general,” and the “corruption that is commonplace within the hospital center” where he worked. The young doctor’s multiple statements to the media and on social networks earned him a review with the hospital’s disciplinary council of the hospital in March. At Tiznit Provincial Hospital, where he has been working since 2017, Echafai carried out more than 560 free operations for the poorest patients in 8 months. Following his resignation, a campaign called “I’m Doctor Mehdi Echafî” was launched on social media to support the pediatric surgeon.  Many social media users have stood by the surgeon calling him a “hero” while expressing their disappointment to see him leave. The doctor’s supporters have shared stories tracing the “exemplary” path of the practitioner and deploring his resignation that “deprived the people of Tiznit of a serious doctor, dedicated and honest.”  Moreover, to show their gratitude, hundreds of residents of Tiznit marched in solidarity with the doctor. The protest, which was called by human rights and civil associations, coincided with Echafai’s trial hearing Monday at the Tiznit Elementary School. Echafai said that since the beginning of his work, on June 20, 2017, he has observed the suffering of patients and felt unable to do anything but lose hope in the profession.

Rabat – Heavy rain in Morocco has produced an “exceptional” harvest this agricultural season, according to the Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture. The Ministry of Agriculture published a statement on Tuesday to announce harvest statistics for the 2017-2018 season. According to the statement, Morocco harvested 10.3 billion kilograms of cereals this year, exceeding the harvest of the previous season by 7.3 percent. The ministry credited “good rainfalls and the performance of technical tracks promoted by the Green Morocco strategy” for the successful season. Of cereals, Morocco harvested: 4.91 billion kilograms of common wheat, 2.42 billion kilograms of durum wheat, and 2.92 billion kilograms of barley. The ministry explained that “this production has been achieved in a 4.5 million-hectare area planted with grain, compared to the 5.4 million hectares in the 2016-2017 season.” The decrease in planted areas “was due to the delay of rainfall in the fall season,” added the statement. The ministry noted that despite the delay, the Green Morocco strategy and new technologies improved Morocco’s agricultural yield. “The exceptional harvest is also due to the evolution of the season in excellent climatic conditions characterized by abundance, regularity and good distribution of space and time for precipitation and moderate temperatures throughout the planting season.” The 2017-2018 season recorded a cumulative rainfall of 402.3 mm, compared to 362.6 mm during an average season. The harvest averaged 2,290 kilograms per hectare, representing an increase of 27 percent compared to the previous season and 7 percent compared to the 2014-2015 season, when a record production of 115 million tons was recorded. According to Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch, this season is marked by “generalized growth.”  In a statement to Le360, Akhannouch described the 2018 harvest as a “historic record.”

Rabat- Google has changed the look of Morocco map on its web mapping service, Google Maps, removing the dotted line separating the country from the region of Western Sahara. While some are pleased to see that the separating line has vanished, some Google users still see it.   Google’s decision to update the map for Moroccan users comes 3 years after a campaign by thousands of Moroccan youth asked Google to remove the dotted line as it “insulted” Morocco’s territorial integrity. The separating line was a form of recognition of the Polisario Front separatist group claims to Western Sahara, a recognition that caused Moroccans to launch the petition. The campaign activists previously expressed: “We—all Moroccans—believe that Morocco is one, from Tangier to Elguira. We have grown up with this reality, and history confirms this…However, unfortunately, not everybody knows and admits this truth.” According to Article 38 of Morocco’s 2011 constitution: “All the citizens contribute to the defense of the country and of its territorial integrity against any aggression or threat.” The issue of Western Sahara is a delicate subject for Moroccans who fiercely defend their country’s territorial integrity and its autonomy plan as a viable solution to end the decades-long conflict with Polisario.

Rabat – Moroccan officials have visited Luanda this week to discuss bilateral agreements, raising hopes for a diplomatic rapprochement between the two countries.  The Moroccan delegation’s working visit, which began July 23, aims to prepare the third session of the joint Morocco-Angola commission. Officials discussed their bilateral ties and “future trade and cooperation agreements” that a rapprochement would entail.  In addition to high-ranking Moroccan officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Moroccan delegation consisted of officials from the departments of education, transport, industry, and agriculture, considered strategic for bilateral cooperation between the two states. This week’s visit comes two weeks after an Angolan delegation led by Foreign Affairs Minister Manuel Domingos Augusto paid a similar visit to Morocco. During the Angolan delegation’s stay in Morocco, Domingos Augusto visited the Tangier-Med harbor and expressed his country’s desire to actively collaborate with Morocco on expertise sharing. Angola is both a leading African economy and a traditionally pro-Polisario country, making the rapprochement between Rabat and Luanda significant. Morocco seeks to go out of its African diplomacy comfort zone by furthering its recently-gained continental diplomatic assertiveness, even in traditionally “hostile territories,” according to a Moroccan diplomatic source.  According to the same source, this week’s visit is the culmination of a year-long active but unofficial rapprochement. Although formal discussions to tighten diplomatic ties only started in mid-July this year, King Mohammed VI and President Joao Lourenco gave the green light long ago when they met on the sidelines of the last two AU heads of state summits.  The two leaders also met more recently at the Blue Funds summit in Congo, where President Lourenco is believed to have told Mohammed VI that he has “a keen interest in the Moroccan development model.”

Rabat – Hundreds of migrants have illegally crossed the border from Morocco to Spain’s North African enclave, Ceuta, this morning. With numbers estimated between 400 and 600, the migrants arrived with “unprecedented violence,” according to the police. So far, 11 migrants and 4 civil guards have been transferred to the University Hospital of Ceuta. The migrants used quicklime, feces, and flamethrowers against the security forces to cause respiratory disorders, conjunctivitis, blows, wounds, and burns.  In order to jump the fence, migrants picked the weakest point of the border, a section with blind spots. The border is double-fenced with a length of 8.4 kilometers and a height of six meters. To break the fence, migrants used shears and threw quicklime at security agents.  According to El Pueblo de Ceuta, this jump could be the biggest in the history of the city.  The Red Cross is working with the migrants, now at the Temporary Immigrant Stay Center (CETI). The Red Cross Immigration Emergency Response Team (ERIE) has so far treated 390 foreigners. The maximum capacity for CETI is 520 people, but it currently holds 600. The International Organization for Migration stated that as of June 27, almost 22,000 migrants have come to Spain.  Last September, former Minister of the Interior of Spain Juan Ignacio Zoido stated there had been nine successful mass jumps in 2017 with a total of almost 9,000 immigrants entering the territory, compared to 613 in 2016.  Moroccan Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch stated that the agreement between Morocco and the European Union regarding agriculture and fisheries will continue the influx of migrants.  “How do [Europeans] want us to do the job of blocking African and Moroccan emigration if Europe does not want to work with us? The problem of emigration is very expensive for Morocco and Europe must appreciate it at its rightful value,” Akhannouch said.  By Maria Kuiper

Rabat – The European Union’s Court of Justice (CJEU) has shut down an appeal request from the Polisario Front contesting trade agreements between Morocco and EU, including the fisheries deal. The court has decided that the separatist group is “not indirectly or individually concerned” by the fisheries deal, adding that it “cannot, in any, case, be regarded, on the basis of the arguments put forward, as a locus standi.” Polisario had requested a review of the fisheries agreement between Morocco and the EU in order to prohibit fishing in waters adjacent to Western Sahara. The EU court, however, decided that Polisario’s request was “inacceptable.” The court’s decision added that Morocco’s authorities will allow European vessels to fish in Morocco’s waters, as set forth in the agreement signed on Tuesday, July 24, between the two parties. All the vessels affected by the deal carried fishing licenses issued by European authorities. The EU has promised to take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that the vessels comply with the convention and international legislation in the law of the sea. The number of Moroccan sailors aboard European fishing vessels will also increase. The EU has also agreed to pay €52 million. The amount is higher than the €42 million in the initial 2014 deal, which expired July 14, 2018. The new agreement was amended to include new technical requirements in order to preserve the sustainability of fishings and protect the marine environment, such as a review of catches of small pelagic fish in the south. Significance of the agreement to Morocco’s position on Western Sahara conflict Abdelfattah Elfatihi, an expert on Western Sahara and Sahel conflicts told Morocco World News today that “the agreement will further strengthen the position of the Kingdom” in the Western Sahara conflict. Elfatihi also recalled Resolution 2414 adopted on April 28 by the UN Security Council. “The agreement was in line with the spirit of the UN Security Council’s last resolution on Sahara No. 2414, which called for an objective and realistic comparison to facilitate a political approach to the Sahara issue,” he said. According to Elfatihi, Polisario has lost one of its arguments that have long been used as a “maneuver” to undermine the partnership between the EU and Morocco internationally. “The renewal of the fisheries agreement and the firmness shown by the Moroccan officials following the decision of the European Court of Justice shows that Polisario and Algeria failed to exploit the natural resources of the Sahara,” he added. Towards further cooperation Moroccan officials expressed their satisfaction with the renewal of the fisheries deal, which was concluded through seven rounds of negotiations spanning three months. Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita told the press after the signing of the new agreement that the deal between the EU and Morocco has several dimensions: reinforcing the partnership between Morocco and the EU in the fisheries field, responding to maneuvers and attempts to disrupt that partnership, and to strengthen the fisheries sector.  According to the Bourita, the agreement also aims to ensure the sustainability of sea products in the region, through a number of mechanisms to fight the over-exploitation of fish in the area.

Rabat – Morocco’s banking sector is experiencing a positive moment and has been doing so for the past months, according to a recent BMI Research economic analysis. As monetary policy stabilizes in Morocco, interest rates will remain “firm” and “dovish” until 2019. BMI analysts also predicted a “dovish” financial and monetary climate for the North African country, with Bank Al Maghreb (BAM), the country’s central bank, expected to maintain interest rates at 2.25 percent and 2.50 percent between late 2018 and 2019. Rates in previous years were higher, between 2.50 percent and 2.75 percent. Domestic and external pressures Despite BAM’s “hawkish” efforts to “keep interest rates firm” at a slightly lower level than previous years, recent hikes in commodity prices, including fuel and agriculture products, are likely to limit BAM’s leeway in formulating a monetary policy free of external pressure. The policy is especially impacted by rate policy in both the EU and the US.  “The BAM has limited scope to affect these price pressures by interest rate adjustments and is not typically hawkish in the face of higher in?ation, informing our expectation that it will hold the policy rate at 2.25 percent until end-2018,” the research group said in its forecast for Morocco’s monetary performance in 2019. And while BAM’s policy has in great part been unaffected by the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve’s rates policy in 2018, economic analysts are apprehensive that prices and rates in external markets will have a more noticeable impact on BAM’s policy towards the end of next year.  Dirham devaluation good for exports An expected devaluation of the dirham against the euro, for example, will profit Morocco by making its exports more competitive. At the same time, it will increase inflation as a result of higher costs on imports. “As such, we expect the BAM to move in line with ECB policy in 2019, also raising its key policy rate,” the report explained. For Moroccan consumers, however, there is some good news: should prices and rate adjustments unexpectedly skyrocket, the government is set to step in to alleviate the burden, “ease popular discontent,” and “support private consumption.” The analyses and expert predictions come at a time that BAM deemed propitious for financial and banking business in Morocco. In terms of risk management, Morocco’s banking sector’s performance has been positive in recent months.  According to BAM’s 2017 annual report published Monday, July 23, Moroccan banks’ profits have unprecedentedly surged, with a notable decrease of 28.7 percent in risk-related costs and an average improvement of 17.6 percent in banks’ performances. According to Hiba Zahou, BAM’s director of banking supervision, the country’s banking system has not witnessed such a positive outlook since 2008.

Rabat- Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has asked Moroccans to “stop being gloomy and unrealistic” about the economy despite problems such as poverty, unemployment, and high fuel prices. During a parliament session at Morocco’s House of Representatives on Monday, July 23, El Othmani said that while there is poverty, it is decreasing, according to Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) in charge of economic, demographic, and social statistics. El Othmani affirmed that Morocco’s economic growth reached 4.1 percent in 2017, a notable improvement from the 1.1 percent growth rate in 2016, thanks to better performance in tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing sectors. “Yes, there are problems, but there is no crisis, and the Moroccan economy is in good condition,” El Othmani insisted. El Othmani affirmed that the government’s utmost priority is to overcome the challenges facing the country’s economy, such as the high fuel prices and protecting consumers’ purchasing power. Since fuel deregulation in 2015, during Abdelilah Benkirane’s government, some fuel companies doubled their profits as fuel prices were allowed to vary with market trends. According to the chairman of the House of Representatives’ Finance Committee, Abdellah Bouanou, the difference between the government’s regulated fuel prices and the unregulated prices is nearly MAD 1 per liter. With the ongoing boycott, consumers are enraged by the rise in fuel prices, especially those of Afriquia, which owns more gas stations in the country than any other oil company.  Crude oil prices across the world have also been rising. In early July, they were at their highest since late 2014.  The government has taken measures to find a solution to the high fuel prices by requesting companies to narrow their profit margins. In addition to that, the government is making efforts to end high prices and market monopolization in general. El Othmani said that every country’s economy has its problems, nevertheless they should not be “exaggerated.” Despite the increase in the unemployment rate in the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the employment rate has improved in recent months. El Othmani pointed out that the country created only 86 job positions in 2017. According to research group BMI’s recent report, Morocco would need to create 115,000 additional jobs each year and maintain all current employment opportunities to maintain the current workforce participation rate of 47 percent. El Othmani also firmly defended Morocco’s education system described as lacking by social critics who have called on the Moroccan cabinet to improve it.  If there is an issue in the system, it should not “lead us to dismiss the role of Moroccan schools. It is our speech that harms schools,” El Othmani said. He called on parliamentarians to contribute to the reform of education in Morocco.

Rabat – Moroccan authorities have denied that a man raped an American tourist in Merzouga – a city located 561.6 kilometers outside of Marrakech. The Ministry of Interior issued a statement denying allegations published by local news outlets regarding the alleged rape of a US citizen in a hostel restroom in Merzouga. After some investigation, national police discovered that the American, a national by the name of M.Z.F., “had a consensual sexual relationship with Mbarek Ait El Caid, an employee at a bivouac of the Salama Hostel in Merzouga.” The statement added that the US national was worried about contracting sexually transmitted diseases and underwent medical examination at the Hassan II hospital. Tests revealed that the US citizen had no bodily “trace of violent or sexual abuse.” The girl has refused to be questioned by Fez judicial police and has opted not to pursue justice against her alleged rapist. Mbarek reiterated that Makoul’s sexual relations with him were consensual. The police have now closed the case.

Rabat – Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has spoken out about Mesut Ozil’s decision to leave the German national football team over “racism and disrespect.” In the Turkish press on Tuesday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan revealed that he called Mesut Ozil to greet him after his choice to leave the German team.  “I spoke with him yesterday [Monday]. They can’t digest the fact that he posed for a picture with me. I support the statements of Mesut Özil,” said the Turkish president.  “Such a racist treatment towards a young man who has given his all to the German national team for his religious beliefs is unacceptable.” On Sunday, the 29-year-old midfielder for Arsenal announced that he is leaving the Mannschaft, the German team, after he was harshly insulted with racist words over his picture with Erdogan and Germany’s shocking loss to South Korea which resulted in an early exit from the 2018 World Cup. After the decision of the German-Turkish football player, the Turkish government expressed support for the native of Gelsenkirchen, north-west Germany. The Turkish Minister of Justice, Abdulhamit Gul, praised on Twitter the “goal” of the playmaker “against the virus of fascism.” Germany’s Social Democrat Minister of Justice Katarina Barley reacted sympathetically, saying, “It’s alarming if a great German football player like Mesut Ozil no longer feels wanted in his country.” For the past two years, Turkey and Germany have had particularly strained relations. Ankara has denounced Berlin’s accusations of Turkey’s repressive drift after the 2016 attempted coup against Erdogan. The two countries have, however, been trying to ease tensions for several months now. Speaking about Ozil’s shocking departure, his coach Joachim Low said through his agent that he had no clue that his player was leaving. Low was on holiday in Sardinia when he learned on the internet the statements of the 2014 World Cup champion.

Rabat – Morocco has entered into negotiations with the US to purchase the main attack aircraft of the US army, the “AH-64 Apache.” The negotiations took place when the inspector general of Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces (FAR), Abdelfattah Louarak, visited ??Washington, D.C., to meet US Department of Defense officials, Al Massae reported.  Earlier this month, Morocco received military equipment, including armored tanks, from the US at its FAR base in Nouaceur, Casablanca. If Morocco gets the AH-64 Apache, it would become the second African country to have the successful attack helicopter. Egypt was the first African country to buy AH-64 Apache. The AH-64 Apache is one of the world’s most advanced multi-role combat helicopters, used by the US army and many international defense forces.  The Apache remains the best performing attack helicopter. The Turkish T-129 ATAK helicopter Morocco also wants to acquire the Turkish T-129 ATAK helicopter.  According to the North Africa Post, a FAR delegation visited the Ankara-based Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) headquarters in June to discuss the possibility of purchasing T-129 Atak helicopters. FAR said the decision came as a result of the T-129’s performance in the Afrin battle in Syria, codenamed “Olive Branch.” The Turkish-made T-129 would boost Morocco’s deterrence capacity. It is a smaller and lighter attack helicopter than Apache. It is also highly appreciated by international air forces. The Moroccan army received 6 US anti-ship missiles including AGM RGM UGM-84 Harpoon in 2017, according to the UN Register of Conventional Weapons UNROCA. Morocco may purchase an F16 since it is the only vector that can carry this type of missile. “The Royal Moroccan Navy does not have launching platforms for this kind of missiles on its ships and has no land to sea vectors at all,” the Defense Industry Daily outlet reported.

Rabat – The president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), Fouzi Lekjaa, has opened up about the future of football in Morocco and Africa in light of the 2018 World Cup, Morocco 2026, and CAN 2019. A guest of the MAP forum on Tuesday, Lekjaa gave a presentation on all the football news that has made headlines recently, including Morocco’s participation in the FIFA 2018 World Cup and Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. The forum was held under the theme “The outcomes of FRMF and evaluation of Morocco’s participation in the 2018 World Cup.” Morocco’s defeat against United 2026 did not prevent the FRMF chief from describing his pride in the efficiency of Morocco’s bid to host the international competition. “The Morocco 2026 dossier has made historic achievements such as FIFA’s recognition of the Kingdom’s assets to host a World Cup,” said Lekjaa. Lekjaa also said that FRMF works to ensure that sports companies promote national football. Promising generation of players Speaking about the Alas Lions, Lekjaa said that Morocco has a “promising generation of players embodying the future of national football, who are working tirelessly to meet the challenge of upcoming continental and international sporting events.” Lekjaa believes that Morocco’s Atlas Lions could have achieved better results in the 2018 World Cup, “which was not the case because of Morocco’s long absence from the World Cup and because of the referee, as well as our choices in the first game that have negatively affected the morale of the players.” He added that video assistant referee (VAR) is certainly an added value for football. “However, this technique should not have been tried out in a World Cup.” Thank you fans Lekjaa did not forget the support of Moroccan football fans in Russia and worldwide for the Atlas Lions at the World Cup. “These exceptional fans have shown that they have a rich football tradition,” he said. He added that the fans aspire to see a strong national team and that their needs must be taken into consideration by all stakeholders on the football field. He also called on the national football team to give their audience what they deserve: balanced progress. Moroccan fans “call for more efforts on our part to meet their expectations at future meetings.” CAN 2019 Lekjaa could not discuss Morocco’s participation in the African Cup of Nations (CAN) in 2019 without shutting down the rumors about the departure of Morocco’s head coach, Herve Renard. The FRMF boss reassured Moroccans that Renard will lead the Atlas Lions during the African competition. Lekjaa said that Morocco’s participation in the World Cup should give them a boost to do better in upcoming competitions, including the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN 2019). “We want a competitive national team and Hervé Renard will continue his mission,” he said. Another bid to host World Cup Lekjaa also talked about Morocco’s possibility of bidding jointly to host the 2030 World Cup with neighboring countries.  He said Morocco has not yet studied the possibility. Both Tunisia and Algeria have said they would consider a joint Maghreb bid. “It is an issue that will be decide at the political level,” he said. Recently, several news outlets, analysts, and even the Secretary-General Taieb Baccouche of the Maghreb Arab Union encouraged Maghreb countries to bid jointly to win the rights to host the World Cup as FIFA prefers joint bids.

Rabat – It appears that pilots of Morocco’s largest airline Royal Air Maroc (RAM) are determined to achieve their demands. Hundreds of pilots are continuing their strike, begun eight days ago, to demand a salary raise. Ten international flights have been canceled today, Wednesday, and a further nine flights may be delayed. The pilots are asking for a salary raise of MAD 15,000 per month in order to suspend their protest. RAM, however, has not found a solution to save the company from further crisis. The crisis led to a new round of dialogue held Monday at the request of Morocco’s Minister of Tourism Mohamed Sajid. The meeting convened representatives of the Moroccan Association of Airline Pilots (AMPL). However, negotiations have not solved the crisis. The airline has canceled approximately 50 flights affecting nearly 10,000 passengers, in addition to the 10 flights canceled today. Closure of RAM training center to blame? AMPL President Amine Mkinsi linked the crisis to the closure of RAM’s training center for pilots in 2014. After closing the center, RAM had to send piloting students to ENAC in Toulouse, France, for training. RAM also received backlash from AMPL after hiring foreign pilots instead of Moroccans. According to Mkinsi, who was quoted by Media24, RAM could save time and avoid the crisis if it reopened the training school to overcome the understaffing crisis. “Its reopening is a necessity because even on the international market, pilots have become a rare commodity and therefore expensive. The proof is that in 2017, the RAM wanted to hire 86 foreigners and only 26 of them accepted the offer,” he said. He added that some of those pilots favored offers from Turkish Airlines, Etihad Airways, and others that offered them “better working conditions.” However, a former official of the Moroccan government told Media24 that the proposal “has no chance to be realized knowing that a 1st class of drivers will cost at least MAD 300 million or MAD 3 million per student.” To combat understaffing, RAM hired 540 pilots and co-pilots in 2018. However, the number of pilots was not enough to face the shortage of its staff to cover domestic and international flights. Mkinsi underscored that there should also be a reform in the training structure. He added that RAM needs to hire at least 100 pilots to avoid further cancellations and delays. Royal Air Maroc signed a program contract with the government in 2014. The deal had encouraged the company to shut down its training centers deemed too expensive to maintain. An expensive proposal The opposing official, who shunned AMPL’s hopes aiming at the reopening of the centers, said that Morocco’s economy cannot afford a “flying school as it is overpriced for the public sector.” The official noted that very few carriers have aviation schools, as it is so expensive. 
The former official said that despite the shortage of pilots, Morocco would have to wait three more years to get a first contingent of pilot students if it reopened the training school. He told Media24, “That means that counting (at least) MAD 75 million annual operating budget, to which we must add MAD 75 million investment (training aircraft, simulators …), we get an invoice total of MAD 300 million to train the first 100 pilots of this school.”. In contrast, he said, “the budget of a public engineering school costs a maximum of 30 million DH to graduate 200 students and not 100 laureates as for piloting.”

Rabat – Israeli and Palestinian news outlets have alleged that two Palestinians killed Sunday in Algeria’s capital were assassinated by Israel’s intelligence agency, known as Mossad.  The two men were from Khan Yunis, a city in the southern Gaza Strip. Suliman al-Farra, aged 34, and Mohammed Albana, aged 35, were both scientists studying in Algiers. The original death report states they died of gas inhalation or by a short circuit. The allegation that Mossad organized the killings comes after another Palestinian scientist, Fadi al-Batsh, was killed in Malaysia earlier this year by Mossad in front of a mosque.  In 2016, Mossad allegedly killed a Hamas engineer, Mohammed Zawari, in the capital of Tunisia. Zawari was known for innovations in drone technology. History of Mossad’s assassinations Mossad was formed in 1949, a year after the State of Israel was created. In 1951, Mossad signed a secret agreement with the United States intelligence body, the CIA.  Mossad’s first operation captured Adolf Eichmann in 1960 for killing Jews in Europe as a Nazi war criminal.  After the Munich Massacre in 1972, when a Palestinian terrorist group called “Black September” held 11 Israeli Olympians hostage and killed them, Mossad retaliated and came after people suspected of being involved with the Munich Massacre. However, in a case of mistaken identity, Mossad killed an innocent Moroccan man named Ahmed Bouchiki in Norway in 1973.  In 1980, Yahya al-Mashad, an Egyptian nuclear scientist and the head of the Iraqi nuclear program, was killed in his Paris hotel room by Mossad.  Mossad’s main targets continue to be Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, Lebanon’s Hezbollah, Syrian officials, and Iranian nuclear scientists. Since 2005, Israel has carried out at least 800 organized killings of Hamas civilians and military leaders. In 2010, 27 Mossad operatives with stolen passports and identities participated in the assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, the co-founder of the military wing for Hamas and supplier of arms. Al-Mabhouh was wanted by the Israeli government for the kidnapping and murder of two Israeli soldiers and for purchasing arms from Iran to use in the Gaza Strip. By Maria Kuiper

Rabat – Interpol officials have supervised special trainings to help Moroccan officers secure Moroccan seaports against foreign terrorists. The training focused on countering foreign terrorists using Mediterranean sea routes between North Africa and southern Europe, Al Massae newspaper reported. The counter-terrorism operation, codenamed “Neptune,” also addressed threats from firearms, drugs, and human traffickers, according to Interpol. Interpol announced on July 13 that it had deployed agents in Mediterranean seaports in eight countries, including Morocco, to identify suspected terrorists during the summer tourist season. The Moroccan ports concerned with the joint operation are Tangier Med, Tangier City, and Nador port, according to an official at the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). According to Al Massae, the training offered methods on how to inspect passengers and identify potential terrorists. It also presented control techniques for passengers’ identity and passport information, and how to use them in Interpol’s databases. Interpol’s databases enable authorities to track down jihadists returning from conflict zones, especially Iraq and Syria. On July 17, a source at the DGSN told news outlet Telquel that the Neptune operation would actually be “a technical assistance on sea border crossings.” “Interpol staffing acts as observers and the work is done by the national border police,” he said. Morocco is strongly involved in the operation since it hosted much of the preparations, including training sessions and coordination meetings. The most recent training session hosted by Morocco was held in February in Casablanca, the official said.

Rabat – Moroccan athlete Mohamed Rabii may be in serious trouble with authorities. The boxer, who filed for divorce last year, has been accused by his ex-wife of lying about his salary.  Facing a judge, Rabii said he earned only MAD 5,000 per month with the Royal Moroccan Boxing Federation (FRMB), according to Al Massae. He said 75 percent of match income goes to the FRMB, the technical staff, and the coach, in addition to accommodation and transportation expenses. However, the outlet reported that Rabii’s former wife’s lawyer is denying Rabii’s “false declarations” with documents. The lawyer states the Olympic medalist lives off various financial sources, including a contract that binds him with the Office Chérifien des Phosphates (OCP), which pays him MAD 25,300 monthly. In addition, Rabii also receives bonuses after the end of each match he wins. The boxer would receive rewards ranging from MAD 3,000 to 300,000 after each coronation at the Olympics.  If he wins World Champion, Rabii could also receive MAD 200,000, or MAD 150,000 for a silver medal and MAD 50,000 100,000 for bronze. Moreover, the 24-year-old athlete could also earn MAD 100,000 if he manages to win the title of champion of Africa. In March, the Moroccan boxer secured an impressive victory, claiming his fifth victory in five professional boxing matches and maintaining his momentum among the invincible breed of the “noble sport.”  Once again, the KO man—a moniker he deserves for winning three of his previous four matches by KO—knocked out the Italian veteran Giuseppe Lauri in a third round hugely dominated by the Moroccan’s formidable punches.

Rabat – Geologists published findings on Tuesday of a new tectonic fault stretching from the Iberian Peninsula to Morocco. Researchers believe the fault is the reason for several earthquakes that have occurred in Morocco and Spain.  Two earthquakes occurred in the northern town of Al Hoceima in 1994 and 2004. The latter earthquake had a recorded 6.5 magnitude on the Richter scale with over 600 dead, 900 injured, and thousands displaced.  Spain’s African enclave, Melilla, also felt the effects of the  2004 earthquake, and soon enough, Melilla had an earthquake of their own in 2016. Melilla’s earthquake had a recorded 6.3 magnitude as well as 46 aftershocks in the span of 40 minutes. The earthquakes did not cause as much damage in the bigger cities because buildings were designed to withstand earthquakes, but rural areas and villages, especially in the Rif mountains, hold higher risk. The study states that the fault could produce high magnitude earthquakes and alerts that the growth of recent faults could produce earthquakes of higher magnitude than previous disasters.  In the past 10 years, the region of northern Morocco and southern Spain has experienced 75 earthquakes.  The Geological and Mining Institute of Spain stated the center of the 2016 earthquake as part of the Alboran sea in the western section of the Mediterranean.  The research behind Tuesday’s report was completed by scientists from the University of Jaen in Spain, Spain’s Royal Institute and the Observatory of the Navy San Fernando, the Geological Mining Institute of Spain, the Spanish Institute of Oceanography, and the US Hydrographic Institute of the Navy.

By Maria Kuiper Rabat – US Assistant Secretary of Defense Robert Karem met Abdeltif Loudyi, Morocco’s minister in charge of national defense, on Tuesday to reinforce the relationship of the two countries and vitalize security cooperation.  Loudyi and Karem duly recognized their desire to continue developing a long relationship in modern defense systems, capacity building, and ability to cooperate with each other.  Loudyi emphasized Morocco’s commitment to the fight against terrorism as well as deal with migration in the Mediterranean and the Sahel-Saharan strip.  As a part of Karem’s two-day visit to Morocco, the two nations reviewed their similar cooperation in training personnel, as well as interchanging expertise and joint exercises.  The US and Morocco hold annual joint exercises in Morocco, called African Lion, together with partners from 13 other countries, designed to improve the understanding of each nation. In April this year, the exercises involved techniques and procedures to counter violent extremist organizations.  The Moroccan minister drew attention to Morocco’s responsibility in preserving regional stability as well as helping other African countries’ economic development and armies through training and relaying knowledge.  The two countries exhibited their contentment with the sustainable partnership they have upheld and wish to further this friendship, understanding, and trust.  Moroccan and US relations date back to the United States’ founding, which makes Morocco one of the US’ oldest and closest allies. The security meeting lays a foundation for the years to come in the two countries’ companionship.

Batma had released the track “Bcharat Khir” (Bringer of Prosperity) in April to celebrate the King’s return to Morocco after his heart operation in Paris. The song went viral on social media, generating a lot of positive feedback.

By Anna Schaeffer Rabat – The Red Cross saved two young Moroccans, physically exhausted after attempting to swim from Tangier to Cadiz, Spain, on July 19. Clad in wetsuits, the pair departed from Tangier with the goal of swimming across the Strait of Gibraltar to Spain. However, ocean currents disrupted their path and swept them eastward to Ceuta—the autonomous Spanish territory on Morocco’s northern coast. A local resident spotted the fatigued swimmers and alerted the Spanish Civil Guard. The Red Cross rescued the struggling young men from powerful ocean currents and delivered them to dry land, where one of the swimmers momentarily fainted.  Agents from the Spanish Civil Guard apprehended the men, who reportedly threw stones and reacted violently before the Civil Guard placed them under custody and conducted medical examinations on each. Afterwards, the two Moroccans awaited repatriation in a Ceuta police station. A pattern of attempts The same day, Spanish Maritime Rescue ships rescued a boat, attempting a similar migration path, a mile from the coast of Ceuta. Ten people aboard the vessel disembarked at the Cañonero Dato jetty in the Spanish territory. Endeavours to cross the Strait of Gibraltar are not uncommon. On January 3, 2018, the Spanish coast guard rescued six Moroccans ten miles off the coast of Ceuta. In 2017 alone approximately 600 people—including sub-Saharan migrants and Middle Eastern refugees—sought to make the difficult journey from Morocco to Spain. One such young man named Nabil, originally from Rabat, entered Ceuta illegally with hopes of reaching Spain. He aims to eventually settle in Germany, he says, “To make a life for myself and see what Morocco looks like from the outside.”

By Maria Kuiper Rabat – A ship carrying 40 African migrants 12 miles off the coast of Tunisia has been stranded out at sea for 12 days now.  The non-profit Tunisia Red Crescent, a subsect of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which aims to increase border support for refugees, is ignoring the migrant boat, arguing that Malta or Italy should accept the migrants instead.  The new Italian government, the result of a hung parliament after no major party or political group won elections, closed ports to charity ships from the Mediterranean, saying the European Union should share the burden of accepting migrants.  The interior minister of Italy, Matteo Salvini, refused to accept a rescue boat in June carrying 630 people after Malta had declined its disembarkment. While Malta, Italy, and Greece have requested that other countries help carry the load of receiving refugees, countries such as Poland and Hungary have refused to take migrants arriving in Mediterranean countries. They say they should not be forced to take in asylum seekers or refugees.  Rome suggested migrant centers be set up in Africa. Tunisia rejected this proposal. The European Council agreed to set up asylum processing centers in North Africa, but Libya, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia refused to host the European Union’s proposed migrant arrival platforms.  Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj spoke out against the European Union. “We are strictly against Europe officially placing illegal migrants who are no longer wanted in the EU in our country,” al-Sarraj said. Last month, 80 migrants died when a boat sank off the coast of Tunisia.

Rabat – The Boeing 787 Dreamliner, with advanced technology, is coming to the Moroccan capital.  This three-class version engine, replacing the Airbus A330-300 currently serving the Abu Dhabi-Rabat route, will begin serving the route October 3.  On May 1 this year, the airline placed the 787 Dreamliner on its daily flights to the kingdom’s commercial hub, Casablanca. The move to place the aircraft on Rabat flights will provide customers travelling on Etihad Airways’ Moroccan routes with full product consistency, the latest inflight technology, and increased cargo capacity to further boost trade. The Boeing 787, which features 8 private first-class suites, 28 business studios, and 199 economy smart seats, will reinforce Etihad Airway’s commitment to the Moroccan market.  “Morocco is a very important destination on the Etihad network, underscoring the close cultural and commercial ties between the kingdom and the UAE,” said Robin Kamark, chief commercial officer of the Etihad Aviation Group. “Our flights to Rabat and Casablanca have proved tremendously popular with UAE and Moroccan nationals, and residents. Adding the 787 Dreamliner on all our Moroccan services will now provide our customers flying to both capitals with the same award-winning cabins, innovative seating and products.”  Etihad Airways has been serving Rabat since January 2016, providing the only long-haul link from the city. It will be the only service operated by the 787 Dreamliner from Rabat. The airline launched its first Abu Dhabi-Casablanca flight on June 2, 2006. In March 2013, Etihad Airways increased its flights to Casablanca, launching a new daily round-trip flight between Abu Dhabi and Casablanca. In 2016, the airline announced that it would expand its presence in Morocco by launching two new weekly flights between Abu Dhabi and Rabat to provide a direct link between the two capitals.

Rabat – Bank Al-Maghrib presented its annual report on banking supervision on Monday, July 23, in Casablanca. The central bank listed 24 banking institutions in Morocco at the end of 2017, up from 19 the previous year, after operating licenses were granted to 5 Islamic bank.  In total, Morocco has 86 loan institutions, and Moroccan banks have 7 branches in foreign countries. Shareholding in the banking sector has remained stable. Moroccan privately-owned banks account for nearly two-thirds of assets. Public banks hold 18 percent of the market share. Foreign-owned banks have 16 percent of market share. Three banks—Attijariwafa, BMCE, and Banque Populaire—hold 65 percent of the market. At the end of 2017, the banking sector had 6,388 branches and 7,025 ATMs. Moroccan banks are established in 33 countries, 26 of which are African countries and 7 European. Loans recorded a slight increase of 3.2 percent, reaching MAD 837 billion, due to the increase in households loans by 4 percent and corporates loans by 2.6 percent. Equipment loans jumped 23 percent, exceeding for the first time the treasury loan, which is following a downward trend.  Housing and consumer loans are growing at around 4-5 percent. Deposits increased notably by  5.5 percent to MAD 901 billion, mainly driven by household deposits of both Moroccans residing in Morocco and those residing abroad. Banks netted MAD 10.8 billion last year, up by 17.6 percent, due to a lower cost of risk, the bank’s insurance against defaulting loans, for the first time since 2008. Banks’ cost of risk was MAD 6.4 billion in 2018 reducing from MAD 8 billion during the last two years. Outstanding debts in 2017 experienced a slowdown of 2.3 percent, totaling MAD 363 billion, representing a default rate of 7.5 percent. Banks allocated MAD 45 billion for bad debts provision, and achieved a coverage ratio of 71 percent.  Banks have also held MAD 8.4 billion in reserves, covering risky loans and economic fluctuations.

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat- Located at the foot of the Atlas Mountains, Marrakech has a very open and welcoming vibe toward foreigners. The city is a wonderful melange of both new and old, and of traditional and progressive components.  On travel lists, Marrakech ranks as the top destination to visit in Morocco. In 2017 alone, Marrakech received eight million tourists. Not a surprise! The city maintains a vibrant nightlife. In the modernized areas, clubs and casinos are open late, while the historic Jemaa el-Fna (one of the largest open-air markets in the world) reaches the peak of its wonder at night.  Many of the world’s most popular cities for tourism—Paris, Hong Kong, and New York, to name a few—have a distinct and disappointing feeling of sameness to them. Cultural differences that should distinguish them are lost among the tall, modern buildings, and traditional culture is replaced with technology. While many touristic cities have lost their exotic flavor in an effort to modernize and accommodate the masses, Marrakech manages to present its traditions while also drawing on more modern aspects.  Marrakech is a very active city with many well-known sites. The following list is a mixture of some of the most common tourist attractions as well as some lesser known. Palais Bahia. The palace was built in the late 19th century and was intended to be a hallmark of its time period, showcasing the epitome of Islamic and Moroccan architecture. The palace is eight hectares and contains 150 rooms, including various gardens and courtyards. One of the most popular sites is the harem, where Abu Ahmed, a former black slave who rose to power, housed his four wives and 24 concubines.  Allegedly, the palace was named after Ahmed’s favorite wife, “Bahia,” meaning “beautiful.” The entrance fees is MAD 10. Guides are available at the palace for an extra cost, and can conduct tours in English. As there is little information available on the palace in English inside the palace, hiring a guide is highly recommended. Jardin Majorelle. The gardens surround a villa in which the French painter Jacques Majorelle lived. It took 40 years for the painter to create the gardens. Complete with exotic plants from five continents and various water features, the garden is a relaxing break from the mayhem of the city. There is also a museum featuring Amazigh culture. Entrance to the gardens costs MAD 70, while the museum costs an additional MAD 30. Jemaa el-Fna. This market is one of the largest open-air markets in the world and one of Marrakech’s prime features. It’s also one of the most crowded and active places in Morocco. Jemaa el-Fna is located in the old medina (“city”) and is full of snake charmers, storytellers, animals, and more. It is also a great place for food (both small vendors and restaurants) and bargaining. Make sure to visit both during the night and the day….it’s a completely different experience after the sun goes down and the performers come out. Palooza Park. If you are traveling with children or need a break from Marrakech’s heat, Palooza Park is a wonderful theme park destination which also includes a water park. Costs range from MAD 50 for the children’s water park to MAD 120 for the adult water park.      Grand Casino La Mamounia. Take a break from sightseeing for a relaxing night of gambling at Le Grand Casino La Mamounia. The venue features table games, slot machines, bars, and a classy restaurant. It is one of the most highly rated casinos in Marrakech. Drinks are free if you play at the tables, and there are some events such as buffets and performances.  Terres d’Amanar. Located in an Amazigh region, this hotel and park combination is sometimes overlooked by tourists, but it is a stop not to be missed. It is situated just 30 minutes outside of Marrakech at the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. The park offers a wide variety of activities including horseback riding, archery, Amazigh arts and crafts, a zipline, swimming, and all-terrain mountain biking.  You do not have to be a resident of the hotel to visit the park, and activities are paid individually, usually ranging from MAD 100 to 200 per 30 minutes to 1 hour of an activity. Market bargaining is cultural. If you are a foreigner, you are already a target for raised prices and seller harassment. Items in Morocco may seem relatively cheap to begin with, but it is common for sellers to double prices if they know they are dealing with tourists who are unaware of “normal” pricing. Sellers tend to pursue tourists actively. When bargaining, offer one third to half of the price given and go from there.  Be careful with henna. Henna is a plant paste used to create artful patterns on the skin and is offered in Jemaa el-Fna. It’s a tradition in Morocco and dyes the skin for up to two weeks. However, black henna and even some forms of “regular” brown henna contain chemicals that can burn skin and cause scarring. Women may approach and pushily offer henna, even taking your hand and beginning designs without permission. Steer clear of henna until you know exactly what the paste contains and be firm with the designers if you do not want any. Ask taxi drivers to turn on their meters. Marrakchi taxi drivers are notorious for trying to overcharge tourists. This problem is easily solved by asking the driver to turn on their meter for an exact and fair price to your destination. If they refuse, wait for a different taxi. Summer is hot. Marrakech temperatures can reach over 37 degrees Celsius so being outside can be hard on some foreigners not used to elevated temperatures. Spring and fall are more optimal times to visit for those with low heat tolerance (temperatures range from 19 to 28 degrees Celsius). Stay hydrated, apply sunscreen frequently, and consider wearing a hat to cover your head.

By Dil Bola Rabat – The Moroccan state has continued to garner attention from Turkish investors as its stability, skilled workforce, and strategic positioning on the African continent has reinforced prior positive sentiments.  A variety of sources, such as the 2013 Global Peace Index, designate Morocco as the most stable, pacifistic, and democratic country within the North African and Middle Eastern region.  As one of the primary low-risk countries worldwide, Morocco draws non-residents with ease of legality within business and the geographic positioning that puts the state at the crossroads of all continents, thus rapidly facilitating trade.  Morocco’s export industry is dominated by phosphate and textile sectors with Spain, France, and Italy as essential partners within industrial agreements. Since 1998, Moroccan exports have averaged MAD 11.65 billion, reaching an all-time high of MAD 24.31 billion in March of 2018.  Historically, Moroccan-Turkish economic relations have been primarily amicable, especially after the 2004 Free-Trade agreement that became effective in January of 2006.  The agreement granted industrial exports from Morocco immediate access to the Turkish market, whereas imports from Turkey remained under custom duties to be gradually dismantled over a ten-year period.  The primary goal—an upswing in the Moroccan economy—led to a deal designed to open European Union markets to Moroccan products while simultaneously providing protection to industries with rising Asian competitors.  Similar trade policies and commitments to the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as shared views on security issues, immigration issues, and the situation in the Middle East region, continue to foster cooperation since the initial 1982 Trade Agreement signed by the two states.  Surprisingly, in January of 2017 Moroccan exports to Turkey decreased slightly but significantly by 18 percent following a peak in 2016. Turkish exports to Morocco, on the other hand, continued to steadily increase that same month.  Thus, during his recent visit to Rabat in July of 2018, Turkish Ambassador to Morocco Ethem Barkan Oz corroborated the favourable relations as he met with House of Representatives Speaker Habib El Malki. During the talks, the ambassador discussed promising opportunities so long as both sides maintain cooperation. Further, in an official statement released by the House of Representatives, Oz deemed the exploration of said relations as imperative to the interests of both states—economic and otherwise.  The Turkish ambassador continued speaking of exceptional interstate relations as he noted the “historical and civilizational importance,” linking the two states. He further recalled, “The two countries have always been allies that support each other.” Moreover, Oz emphasized the importance of common history to note the significance behind promoting scientific research, organizations, or events that elucidate this shared history bound by an Islamic heritage as well as the upheaval of the Arab heartlands.  El Malki, the speaker of the house, agreed with the ambassador as he brought attention to the historic and solid relations between the states. He noted the gravity behind unifying the two and, additionally consolidating a Moroccan-Turkish alliance to increase investment opportunities on each side. Turkey ranked 11th as a customer and 9th as a supplier during the year of 2017. Morocco, on the other hand, came in 53rd as a supplier and 28th as a customer to Turkey. Turkish exports into Morocco doubled from 2012 to 2017, reaching MAD 9.8 billion, whereas exports from Morocco to Turkey have predominantly remained stagnant at only MAD 2.8 billion. The resulting Moroccan trade deficit with Ankara stands at approximately MAD 8 billion.  Whether these meetings will genuinely end in a positive investment opportunity for the Moroccan economy remains questionable, but what is evident is the presence of reasonable interest behind Turkish-Moroccan economic relations which will ultimately be pursued in order to continue Turkey’s upwards climb in trade deals, exports, imports, and investments.

Rabat – Kaoutar Fal, who was arrested in Brussels on suspicion of spying for Moroccan intelligence services and later released, has returned home to Morocco. Fal’s lawyer Julien Hardy told Belgian television channel RTBF that Fal went back to Morocco Monday, July 23. “Mrs. Fal decided to leave Belgium and booked a flight to Morocco that she has already taken. She left on a voluntary basis.” She was not expelled from Belgium, he asserted. The Indictments Division and the Aliens Litigation Council (CEC) spokesman said earlier that she was detained “on the basis of another article according to which she is illegally in the territory, and because she represents a threat to national security.” Fal, of Moroccan nationality, was released by the Indictments Division and the CEC because her detention in a closed center was found to be illegal, Hardy told Belgian news agency Belga last week. Fal was arrested on July 11 and detained in the 127 bis closed center in Steenokkerzeel, Belgium, when she went to Charleroi Airport to pick up her passport. Her passport had been seized during a previous detention. Fal was arrested for the first time on May 29, when she had just landed at Belgium’s Charleroi Airport, she said in a letter. According to the Aliens Office, Belgian State Security had asked that Fal be arrested because she represented a risk to national security. “It is important for us to send her back to Morocco as soon as possible,” said the CEC spokesman. “My client was released by the council chamber which judged her detention in a closed center as illegal. The decision was then confirmed by the CEC on July 9,” Hardy told Belga.  “She was released on July 10. But she did not get her passport back which would have allowed her to leave the Belgian territory. On July 11, she was again held in detention.”  Kaoutar Fal’s lawyer lodged a new appeal with the CEC because his client suffered “illegal deprivation of liberty,” he told Belgium channel VRT on July 12. “The Aliens Office has taken more than a dozen decisions in total, including two on prohibitions of entry. We contest the legality of this,” said Hardy Monday to RTBF.  “Several legal proceedings are underway to this effect and others will be introduced.”

Rabat- Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi have presided over the launching ceremony of e.participation.ma, an electronic platform for citizens to speak on public policies. E.participation.ma, launched Monday, July 23, seeks to promote democracy through allowing citizens and civil society to participate in the preparation, assessment, and execution of public policies. Individuals can sign up on the platform and write their suggestions, demands, and opinions on draft laws. The platform also gives citizens the opportunity to sign and submit petitions and organize projects of interest to the general public.

During the ceremony, El Othmani stressed the importance of civil society’s role in making a difference and positively influencing public policies with petitions. El Othmani and El Khalfi both emphasized the significance of the initiative, which has been one of the government’s priorities and the fruit of Morocco’s 2011 constitution calling for participatory democracy. Among other recent government initiatives to develop Moroccan society are the 5757 consumer complaint hotline and the anti-corruption hotline, part of the government’s national plan to end all forms of corruption by 2050. The hotline receives complaints concerning market monopolization, corrupt business practices, food safety, storage, quality, and official statistics, such as price margins.

Rabat – The president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), Fouzi Lekjaa, has announced that Morocco’s head football coach Herve Renard will stay with the Atlas Lions. Lekjaa confirmed the news Tuesday, July 24, at a Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) forum held in Rabat. Renard had tried to shut down the rumors about his possible exit from the Moroccan team earlier this month through an Instagram post. “Some people talk about my future in the media to sow trouble in the Moroccan spirit and if it’s still a little too early to know what will be done, one thing is certain: Out of respect for Morocco and all Moroccans I will not leave in any way for another African nation regardless of it. Those who claim so are wrong,” wrote Renard. However, Renard had kept a door open for speculation that he would leave for a non-African team this time.  Renard, a French national, has been coach of the Moroccan team since 2016. Previously, he coached Côte d’Ivoire (2014-2015) and Zambia (2011-2013), with whom he won the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. At the forum, Lekjaa also discussed the possibility of bidding jointly to host the 2030 World Cup with neighboring countries. He said Morocco has not yet studied this possibility. Both Tunisia and Algeria have said they would consider a joint Maghreb bid. Lekjaa also announced that FIFA President Gianni Infantino has been invited to take part in Morocco’s Throne Day celebrations, on July 30. The outcome of Morocco’s participation in the Russia 2018 World Cup was also a topic in the forum. Most prominent in the discussion was the “unjust” refereeing in the competition. Lekjaa heavily criticized video assistant referee (VAR) and the fact it was not used during Morocco’s World Cup games. However, Lekjaa thought Morocco’s participation in the World Cup should give them a push to do better in upcoming competitions, including the African Cup of Nations (CAN 2019). “We want a competitive national team and Hervé Renard will continue his mission,” he said.

Rabat – Two former prisoners of Hirak Rif have spoken about their experience in an interview with French channel TV5 Monde. Nourdine El Kebdani and Khalid Cheikh, arrested for involvement in the Al Hoceima protests, were recently released. Both ex-prisoners stated the duration of time they spent in prison. Cheikh was sentenced to 8 months in prison and El Kebdani to 7 months. Neither thought they would risk prison just for calling for the rule of law, they told TV5 Monde. However, Cheikh and El Kebdani were also reported among the list of Hirak Rif detainees sentenced to 18 months in prison, published in the media in June 2017. An unofficial list of detained Hirak Rif activists, which included both Cheikh and El Kebdani, was published on June 2017. The two released Hirak activists denounced the intimidation they have been subject to since their arrest. “Our demands are only social and economic. They are all legitimate. We ask nothing; we asked for a hospital and a school, which are simple projects. The state can do that very easily,” Cheikh told TV5 Monde. El Kebdani was arrested in May 2017 in the main public square of Al Hoceima, near demonstrations. He said he was waiting for a friend when the police ordered him to leave. He answered that he had the right to be there. ‘When I walk in the street, I feel afraid’ El Kebdani spoke about his arrest and the constant pressure he has felt even after his release.  In the beginning, El Kebdani thought that he would spend only three days in custody. Then he realized that the arrest did not concern only him, but was linked to Hirak Rif. The police report was made in the middle of the night, he told the French channel. “At 3 a.m., while I was asleep, they told me ‘Get up! Stand up!’ They were dressed like ninjas: scientific police, anti-terrorism police, armed, as if we were criminals,” he said. “It’s psychological pressure. Even today, I’m sick of it. When I came out of prison, I saw a psychologist. He gave me medicine. But until now when I walk in the street, I feel afraid. I tell myself they would arrest me.” The two are among the first detained Hirak activists to be released from prison. Cheikh claimed to be close to Nasser Zefzafi, the leader of the protest movement. Many activists were arrested in May and June 2017 for their involvement in protests that rocked Al Hoceima in 2016 and 2017. On June 26, 2018, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals sentenced 54 Hirak Rif activists to 1 to 20 years in prison. Two figureheads of the protest, Nasser Zefzafi and Nabil Ahemjik, in addition to Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid, received 20 years in prison. None of the former prisoners were considered by the public as martyrs, according to the French channel. A legal battle for the other convicted activists continues, as their sentences are on appeal. “The defense wants to prove that the law was flouted even before the trials,” the same source added. “Today, as Morocco changes and progresses, a citizen still cannot prove the opposite of what was written in the police reports,” Abdelmajid Azaryah, a lawyer for Hirak Al Hoceima activists, told TV5 Monde. While on spot, TV5 Monde described the scene in Al Hoceima as calm and under maximum security.

Rabat – The Marrakech Court of First Instance gave  a French national on Monday a suspended sentence of three months in prison and a fine of MAD 500 for committing adultery with a married man in Marrakech, according to local news Kech 24. The woman’s lover whose wife had filed a complaint against him will also spend three months in prison and pay a MAD 500 fine.  The pair were arrested on July 14 when police entered their apartment in the red city. They were then placed in custody at the disposal of the prosecutor’s investigation. The French resident was released Sunday and returned to France after paying a deposit of  MAD 5,000. The adultery case made headlines after the 41-year-old French woman spoke to French newspaper Le Parisien and accused the Moroccan police of keeping her in custody for 30 hours, deploring the poor treatment and awful conditions. “It’s out of the question for me to go back,” explained the woman. My rights were violated; I was abandoned for two days in deplorable conditions, in a narrow corridor among cockroaches, battered pregnant women … with a heinous prosecutor who yelled at me.” Following her accusations, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) issued a statement denying the allegations. “The arrest of the couple took place after a complaint of adultery filed by a woman against her husband and his companion who were apprehended and placed in custody at the disposal of the investigation conducted under the supervision of the competent prosecutor.”  The statement added that the individuals were held for no longer than 24 hours, the legal limit, after they were arrested in the place where the criminal acts were committed. “The two defendants spent 24 hours together in police custody.” According to the police, the two accused were informed of their rights, including the use of an French interpreter.

The public prosecutor then called for an investigation The incident shocked the inhabitants of the region as he started shooting at people deliberately. One victim, who lost her brother to the suspect’s rampage, told Moroccan news outlet Hespress that the suspect was “following her with his bullets as he was hunting pigs.” “I was running throughout the neighborhood and knocking on houses. No one could open a door for me because everyone was hiding; everyone was scared,” she said. According to Khaled Hasi, a brother of one of the victims, the crime resulted from a conflict between the teacher and three members of his wife’s family. The defendant is also suspected of suffering mental disorders.

Rabat – Borussia Dortmund may enroll another Moroccan football player very soon.  After signing Morocco’s Achraf Hakimi on loan from Real Madrid, the German club is seriously considering recruiting Galatasaray’s midfielder Younès Belhanda, according to Yahoo journalist Manu Lonjon. Lucien Favre ( Dortmund ) penserait à Younes Belhanda ( Galatasaray). Les 2 hommes se sont croisés et appréciés à Nice. Contacts non rompus depuis. pic.twitter.com/xfHWmMd7Wr — ???? Manu ?? (@ManuLonjon) July 23, 2018  The journalist explained that it was Dortmund coach Lucian Favre’s idea to sign Younes Belhanda before the end of the summer transfer window, as the duo had already worked together at the OGC Nice.  “Lucien Favre (Dortmund) would think of Younes Belhanda (Galatasaray). The two men met and appreciated each other in Nice, and have remained in contact since,” wrote Lonjon on Twitter. If the transfer happens, Belhanda will play alongside his national team compatriot Hakimi, who signed a two-season loan on July 11. Throughout his career, the 27-year old footballer has played for Schalke 04, OGC Nice, Dynamo Kyiv, and Montpellier’s football team. He also played for France’s national under-20 football team in 2010.  The Moroccan-French football player joined the Moroccan team in 2011. He has since proven to be one of the greatest elements of the team and became a regular after coach Hervé Renard’s arrival in 2016.  Belhanda, who played in the Russian 2018 World Cup, was one of the Atlas Lions to strongly criticize the video assistant referee (VAR) that led to Morocco’s loss in a game against Portugal and a draw with Spain, claiming that it is only used for the big nations. “Everybody knows it, everybody saw it. When it was about making a decision for Portugal or Spain to reject a goal, we did go back to the video. While when we [Moroccan team] asked to watch the action, the referee told us that he was in communication. But actually, he wasn’t communicating with anyone. Nobody told him [the referee] to check,” stated Belhanda. Belhanda disapproved of using VAR at all: “I am against the video since the beginning, because it takes out football charm. It only serves the big teams.”

Rabat – Spanish farmers in Huelva, Spain have heavily criticized Morocco’s National Agency for Employment and Skills (ANAPEC), claiming some female Moroccan agricultural workers contracted through the agency left the job prematurely.  Spanish news outlet La Mar de Onuba reported that 25 percent of the 1,375 Moroccan workers who came to Spain for the agricultural season have abandoned their job and have not returned to Morocco after leaving their duties in Huelva farms. According to the outlet, the numbers were introduced by Spanish professional agricultural organizations in a July 18 meeting with Jose Alarcon, the head of Spain’s migration agency and minister in charge of migration.  Alarcon went to the Huelva farms to monitor the situation and to verify the reported statistics.  According to the news outlet, Spanish farmers have also criticized ANAPEC for an unfruitful season this year, complaining about  issues this season, including multiple allegations of sexual harassment, assault, and abuses. Spanish agriculture organizations also criticized ANAPEC’s selection of workers, calling on the Spanish government to control future selections. German investigative NGO Correctiv published a story on May 2 in collaboration with RTL Nachtjournal and Buzzfeed News  on Moroccan female agricultural workers in Spain and in Morocco’s Souss Massa region in the south. In the report, women claimed that they were harassed, insulted, and raped in the field. Morocco’s Minister of Employment Mohamed Yatim said that there were no official reports of “sexual harassment” against women in Huelva. He admitted, however, that a suspect had been detained for questioning in Spain for alleged sexual assault. Spain had also announced the arrest of the Spanish suspect, who manages a farm in Huelva. The suspect was later released, pending further investigation.

Rabat – Morocco and EU negotiators finally signed the much-awaited EU-Morocco fisheries deal Tuesday afternoon in Rabat, following months-long rounds of negotiations. On Friday last week, Moroccan and EU officials reached total agreement on the basic aspects of the deal, agreeing to include the waters off Western Sahara (which a February European Court of Justice ruling had deemed invalid) and to set financial compensation at €52 million. The deal allows European fishing ships to fish in Moroccan waters for financial compensation. The new deal was finalized this afternoon, July 24, in Rabat, with Moroccan officials saying that the agreement constitutes a brand new step and new spirit in strategic Morocco-EU relations. The EU made an important compromise by reconsidering the ECJ’s February ruling on the inclusion of Western Sahara, and Morocco compromised on its financial demands. Instead of the €80 million that Rabat requested, the EU has agreed to pay €52 million. The amount is higher than the €42 million in the initial deal. The deal, which was initially signed in 2014, expired earlier this month, July 14, when Rabat and Brussels failed to reach an agreement on the deal’s financial implications for both parties in time.  Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita and Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Aziz Akhannouch represented Morocco at the signing ceremony, while Claudia Wiedey, Brussels’ delegation chief in Morocco, signed the new deal on behalf of the EU. In an interview following the signing, Aziz Akhannouch expressed his satisfaction, saying that the deal marks a new page in EU-Morocco diplomatic ties. “This [the deal] represents shared interests, as it was important for both parties to reconsider and renew their positions.” Akhannouch said the new deal is founded “on new bases that propel us towards the future.” He added: “For us, the most important aspect [of the deal] is to guarantee fishing sustainability and protect Moroccan resources.” He also praised the EU’s compromise regarding the inclusion of Western Sahara’s territorial waters, saying that Morocco will play its part by ensuring that the large part of the deal’s benefits go to local populations.

Rabat – Egyptian Minister of Agriculture Ezz Eddin Abostain announced Monday that Egypt will begin exporting grape seedlings to Morocco for the first time.  According to Egypt Independent, the decision was made after a series of extensive negotiations between Moroccan and Egyptian quarantine authorities. The negotiations discussed the quality of Egyptian agricultural exports and examined whether the imports would meet Morocco’s safety requirements.   “Demand for Egyptian agricultural exports increased following the implementation of strict quarantine procedures, which contributed to meeting the safety requirements from more countries,” explained Ahmed al-Attar, the head of the Central Department of Agricultural Quarantine. The project, which will conclude this month, also included that Egypt will begin exporting tomatoes to Canada.  The exporting procedures for the grape seedlings are already underway.

By Anna Schaeffer Rabat – At a July 20 McKinsey &amp; Company conference in Morocco, a presentation on artificial intelligence algorithms highlighted the powerful potential of digitizing sectors of Morocco’s economy. The global management consulting firm, which specializes in digital transformation, hosted the conference “Potential of Digital and Artificial Intelligence (AI)” this past Friday. Casablanca Sector General Manager Jalil Bensouda and his associate Yassine Sekkat emphasized in their presentation the possibilities of dynamic digital incorporation in Morocco. “The 20th century Grail was oil. The 21st is the data,” Bensouda declared. Evolution of agriculture, accounting, automotive  Bensouda and Sekkat highlighted sectors in which artificial intelligence offers promising potential. Perhaps unexpectedly, the first category deals more with organic matter than technology: agriculture. But the effects of optimization algorithms in farming—especially in light of climate change—are powerful. Irrigation optimization systems considerably improve efficiency, producing greater yields even with less water input. “Given the phenomenon of water stress that has affected Morocco for several years,” Bensouda explained, cost-effective and responsible water usage remains crucial. Algorithms also present a more systematic process for fertilizer and pesticide use. Predictive analysis, a concept championed by scholars researching the intersection of artificial intelligence and agriculture, develops recommendations for crop inputs based on data.  Overall, algorithms and agriculture represent a surprising combination with hundreds of possibilities for growth. Bensouda and Sekkat also discussed the usage of artificial intelligence in banking and tax. Cross-checking and data collection, operated primarily by algorithms, help prevent financial fraud. The automotive sector, too, benefits from optimized logistics circuits and “predictive” maintenance services. By streamlining the manufacturing process, output increases along with profit. Telecommunications, insurance, and energy sectors each present possibilities for improvement with the implementation of artificial intelligence, according to the presenters. “Reducing interactions between citizens and administrators” and creating “smoother communication” in bureaucratic processes goes a long way. What about jobs? Will artificial intelligence replace human capital and disrupt the job market? Bensouda dismissed this concern with confidence.  “On the contrary,” he said. “This is an incredible opportunity that can generate many jobs. For a job destroyed, more than 100 will be created in return.” He continued to explain that the shift away from bureaucracy will engender a simplified entrepreneurial process and, consequently, “an increase in attractiveness and investments.”  Sekkat praised artificial intelligence as “the replication of man’s cognitive abilities by the machine.” It holds the power to improve human ability for analysis, innovation, creation, and prediction with virtually infinite possibility. Morocco: a nation of potential As technology prices decrease, accessibility moves in the opposite direction; “ready-to-use” algorithms increasingly available to the general public make the use of artificial intelligence a real possibility for many Moroccans. “There is a real global shortage for specialized profiles in AI,” Bensouda said. “Data scientists, data engineers and data architects are in great demand. Given the employment situation in Morocco, this sector can be an important source of work.” “It’s not just for Silicon Valley. Above all, it is a real opportunity for Africa and Morocco to catch up.”

Rabat – A recent study has found that Morocco’s health and education sector’s poor and unsatisfying performance levels are primarily due to insufficient investment and inadequate training. The research was conducted by the Groupe de Travail Thématique (Committee for Thematic Appraisal), a governmental body. While the study said public services are generally “dysfunctional and badly-monitored” in Morocco, it showed Moroccan schools have the lowest performance of public services.  Assabah, which reported the study’s findings, said the report “painted a very grim picture” of Moroccan schools and hospitals. The report noted, for example, that the annual average of medical consultations in Morocco is 0.6 percent per inhabitant, with the national average for healthcare availability at an extremely underperforming level of 3 physicians for every 2,000 Moroccans.  According to the research group, such low performance levels hint at a notable lack of medical personnel for a population with many health concerns.  Worse still, the group maintained that the already alarming figures are expected to worsen in coming years, thanks to a lack of funds and government allocations to improve performance. For some illnesses such as diabetes, cancer, and kidney failure, there are not enough fully-equipped facilities and specialized physicians. The situation is no less concerning for Morocco’s educational sector, with “dying facilities” in many remote areas, old and under-equipped public schools, a worryingly low education level in primary school (for both teachers and pupils), and a widening income gap leading many students from low-income families to drop out of school. According to Assabah, Tissir, the royal program to help low-income families cover their children’s school expenses, has not been well monitored. And due to the lack of financial means to continue school, nearly 220,000 pupils dropped out of school in the last grade of primary school. As a result, only 28 percent generally make it to secondary school.

Rabat – While social critics have called on the Moroccan cabinet to improve the education system, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has said, “We should stop underestimating the role of Moroccan public schools.” El Othmani made his remarks during a parliament session at Morocco’s House of Representatives on Monday, July 23. “Education is our special concern, we are proud of it,” said El Othmani. The head of government also said that Moroccan public schools have come out with “frameworks and competencies that the Moroccans are proud of and that the students who studied there are superior.” Is there a problem in Morocco’s education? According to El Othmani, yes: there is an issue in the system, but that should not “lead us to dismiss the role of Moroccan schools. It is our speech that harms schools,” he said, calling on parliamentarians to contribute to the reform of education in Morocco. El Othamni also saluted the efforts made by teachers, men and women “who are struggling for the homeland and are making great efforts that we must recognize.” He added that his cabinet has focused on minimizing the shortage of schools, especially in rural areas, through rehabilitation and completion of school infrastructure. To reinforce his statement, the prime minister gave statistics, saying that “the total number of schools reached 10,905 by the end of the previous academic year.” According to El Othmani there are 889 boarding schools, 545 of which are located in rural areas. The minister also added that 9,511 schools have benefited from rehabilitation. Overcrowded schools? Overcrowded classrooms are nightmares for both students and parents. Thousands of Moroccan students have criticized the large number of students learning in one classroom throughout the academic year. According to El Othmani, the cabinet has stressed that the number of students per classroom should not exceed  30 in the first and second year of primary school. Up to 34 students can be in a classroom for the other grades in primary school, added the head of government. According to El Othmani, Morocco has more than 240,000 teachers, of whom 47 percent are employed in rural areas. He added that regional academies have hired more than 20,000 teachers, who currently are undergoing training to be ready by the beginning of the 2018-2019 academic year. New reform Education has always been a concern for both the cabinet and Moroccans. The issue also attracted King Mohammed VI, who has called on his cabinet to set measures to improve education. In a statement read by Minister of Education and Vocational Training Said Amzazi to the participants of “the National Day on Early Childhood Education” last week, King Mohammed VI called on the government to promote pre-school education as part of the new reform of education. “As regards this crucial reform project, I believe a bold, ambitious approach should be adopted, putting public interest above all other considerations,” said the monarch. Amzazi announced earlier this month Morocco’s strategy to improve pre-primary schools as an important phase for students. A 2017 report from The World Bank said that only 43 percent of Moroccan children aged four to five were enrolled in preschool and only 27.9 percent in rural areas between 2015-2016. Amzazi has put a major focus on pre-schools, aiming for 67 percent school enrollment by the 2021-2021 school year and 100 percent by 2027-2028.  Morocco’s Ministry of Education also pledged to reduce dropout rates and to improve the education system.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Sports and Youth has announced that Morocco will host the African Games in October 2019. After hosting the African Nations Championship (CHAN), Morocco will celebrate the 12th Annual African Games, following the withdrawal of Equatorial Guinea. The decision came at the request of the African Union (AU) and the National Olympic Committees as they consider Morocco as a country that meets all the conditions and has the expertise to host a major international sports event, according to the Ministry of Youth and Sports. More than 5,000 professional and amateur athletes will compete in the sports event. Prior to the official announcement, the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA) had said that it would discuss Morocco’s chances to host the competition. Morocco has not participated in the AAG for almost 30 years due to the African Union’s position on Western Sahara. Morocco’s last African Games were in  1978 in Algiers. However, Morocco’s return to the AU in 2017 made Morocco an eminent part of the pan-African organization as it took seats in several important bodies of the AU, including the security council. The AAG is a multi-sport event held every four years.  The competing nations come from the African continent and must be affiliated with the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa (SCSA). The 2015 games were held in Brazzaville, Congo. Besides Olympic Games, Morocco also dreams to host international football competitions, including the FIFA World Cup. The North African country has said it will submit its bid officially to host the World Cup 2030 when FIFA announces the start of the bidding process. There is also a possibility that Morocco will bid jointly with two other Maghreb countries, Algeria and Tunisia, as FIFA favors joint bids. Morocco’s Tangier will also host the Spanish Super Cup, where football giant FC Barcelona and Sevilla will play their final game.

By Dil Bola Rabat – Confusion has arisen over tax agencies responsible for “notice to third holder” (ATD) after a man attempted suicide Sunday at the Regional Directorate of Taxes of Marrakech.  The individual had received an ATD. The ATD is a method used by the public collector in which banks block the accounts of an individual who owes back taxes. The public collector then seizes the balance, along with future deposits, in order to recover public debts.  Following the attempted suicide, many blamed the General Management of Taxes (DGI)—one of many agencies within the sphere of public debt collection—for seizing funds. The DGI, however, rejected the accusations made as the notice received is not a result of their services.   The DGI is primarily responsible for corporate tax (IS), income tax (IR), and domestic value-added tax (VAT), along with registration, stamping and special annual taxes on motor vehicles.  In contrast, the General Treasury of the Kingdom (TGR) is concerned with collecting the business tax, the municipal services tax, and the housing tax. Additionally, they collect transactional or lump sum fines along with monetary penalties. Following a wave of recent ATDs sent just after deadlines to pay several taxes, it has become clear the TGR is chiefly concerned with enforcement procedures. The means of enforced recovery differ, ranging from the seizure and sale of goods, the notice to third holder, and a ban on the sale of vehicles and goods.  Prior to taking such enforcement actions, the administration must notify the taxpayer of the exacted claims amicably. Taxpayers may appeal to local or national tax commissions, or to the courts in event of administrative abuse.  Public authorities have become more relentless as public finances continue to deteriorate. Due to a fall in tax revenues and increase in expenses, Morocco’s budget deficit has widened by 66 percent or an expected MAD 20 billion. Further, the TGR stated at the end of 2016, unrecovered taxes surpassed MAD 40 billion.  Many maintain that despite the legality of these practices, they are too harsh and inflexible. In the face of mass amounts of public debt, citizens must ask if the state is within its rights to seize what is owed in order to continue running the state?

Rabat – FIFA President Gianni Infantino will spend two days in Morocco for Throne Day.  The 48-year-old Swiss-Italian was invited to attend Throne Day celebrations on Monday, July 30, announced the Chairman of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), Faouzi Lekjaa, on Tuesday, July 24, during the MAP forum. The event, held today in Rabat under the theme “FRMF action report and evaluation of the Moroccan participation in the World Cup 2018,” discussed current issues in various fields—political, economic and social. It was attended by representatives of government bodies and the media as well as other personalities. In his presentation, Lekjaa said, “The results achieved in terms of training in the field of football do not reflect the ambitions or expectations, since the project is at its beginning.” Infantino’s relationship with Morocco has known some ups and down in the past year, especially during Morocco’s 2026 World Cup campaign; the FIFA president was accused of trying to sabotage Morocco’s candidacy to let United 2026 win the bid.  Tensions continued to simmer after the national team’s unfair treatment during the 2018 World Cup in Russia where refereeing mistakes committed against Moroccan players cost the national team its qualification into the Round of 16.  Morocco blamed FIFA for prioritizing big teams and foregoing the use of video assistant referee (VAR) for the games with African teams. Despite these conflicts, Morocco and Infantino seem to have buried the hatchet. In his invitation of FIFA’s president to Throne Day, Lekjaa may see an opportunity to talk about the idea of a joint bid with Tunisia and Algeria for the 2030 World Cup.

Rabat – Moroccan negotiators have expressed their satisfaction with the terms of a new EU-Morocco fisheries deal, underlining the fact that the deal “underpins Morocco’s integrity over its southern provinces.” The deal, which will be finalized in the coming days, allows European fishing ships to fish in Moroccan waters for financial compensation and replaces a 2014 deal that expired on July 14, 2018. The joint EU-Morocco parliamentary group approved the terms of the deal and issued a joint statement Friday that marked overwhelming agreement on the “basic aspects of the deal.” Morocco’s representatives issued a parallel statement to show the North African country’s appreciation of its “European partners’ commitment to strengthening strategic relationships” with a valuable ally.  Praising the new fisheries deal as the culmination of the two parties’ devotion to constructive diplomatic relations, the statement said that the new agreement “perfectly embodies” the crucial importance that both Rabat and Brussels have always accorded to the “diplomatic and historical ties” binding the two parties. A sticking point of negotiations was as to whether the waters off Western Sahara should be included. The statement declared that the inclusion of Western Sahara’s territorial waters in the deal is the result of Moroccan diplomacy’s tireless efforts to convince all its partners, including the EU, that the UN should remain the only legitimate third party to intervene in the Western Sahara question.  By agreeing on the basic aspects of the deal, the statement suggested, the EU has upheld the sacredness of the kingdom’s territorial integrity, despite “maneuvers by our enemies to question the unity of Morocco as a nation.”  The deal illustrates “an even more ambitious aspect in EU-Morocco relations” as well as the two parties’ desire to maintain and further their relations in terms of agriculture and fisheries products. The new deal will grant the lion’s share of the financial compensation to the benefit of local populations.  And according to Moroccan and EU officials, the new deal’s terms and spirit show Rabat and Brussels’ desire to champion development projects in Moroccan regions that have historically lagged behind in terms of social infrastructure and other opportunities.

Rabat – Morocco has granted Australian mining company Clancy Exploration a new cobalt license to explore near the Bou Azzer mine, in an area 120 kilometers south of Ouarzazate. A statement from the mining firm said on July 23 that the area is famous for being “a primary cobalt producer and high-quality cobalt cathode and has been in operation since the 1930’s.” The statement also confirmed the signing of an agreement to “acquire the newly approved exploration licence (EL 3842226) in Morocco from local Moroccan company Chater SARL.” Clancy paid Chater $50,000 for the license to explore in the “Bou Amzil extension,” according to the statement. The statement explained that Morocco granted a 3-year license for the “Bou Amzil extension,” from July 12, 2018 to July 12, 2021. Commenting on the deal, chairman of the company David Iengias said that “this is a jewel of a new licence in Morocco’s major cobalt producing region and gives Clancy immediate exposure to ground very close indeed to the western most shaft of the Bou Azzer Cobalt mine complex.” Wishing for more work and extensions in Morocco, the chairman of the giant corporation expressed his hope that shareholders “will approve the acquisition of the three other licenses in Morocco at the upcoming shareholders’ meeting, allowing Clancy to acquire a significant exploration play in one of the most prospective cobalt areas in Morocco.” The press release further explained the assets of the Moroccan cobalt source, emphasizing that it is one of the world’s only operating primary cobalt mines with “more than 50 deposits in the district, mined over 75 years with production of over 100kt of cobalt, 1,000’s of tonnes of silver and tens of tonnes of gold.”

Rabat – French Montana made it to the top spot while Douzi has been ranked fourth. The prestigious American magazine Forbes has published a new annual ranking of the top Arab Stars who succeeded in making a name on the international stage, including directors, fashion designers, actors, and footballers, highlighting “the influence that these Arab stars wield globally” and “their popularity among masses.” In the category of Arab singers who are killing it internationally, two Moroccans have made the list.  Moroccan-American rap superstar Karim Kharbouch, better known as French Montana, was named the top Arab Star on the global stage.  The singer of “Unforgettable” and Grammy nominee has undeniably proven to be one of the best rappers of his generation. The native of Casablanca has collaborated with big hip-hop names such as Drake, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, and Ne-Yo.  Released in 2012, his first single, “Pop That,” was certified platinum within weeks. His album “Excuse My French,” distributed the following year, propelled French Montana to the forefront of the scene across the Atlantic.  For his part, Moroccan singer Abdelhafid Douzi is considered by Forbes as the 4th most successful Arab artist on the global stage. The 33-year Moroccan sensation made his international break-out thanks to his hit single for the 2018 World Cup, “Colors,” featuring international superstar Jason Derulo. His last single, Amar, was quickly successful. Released just last week, his video clip has been viewed more than 10 million times.

Rabat – Three Moroccans gathered in Johannesburg last week to begin the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI), a one-year leadership training program sponsored by the Obama Foundation to “inspire Africa’s future leaders.” This year, three Moroccans were part of the carefully selected group of 200 young leaders from 44 African nations: 27-year-old Zineb Lahbabi, 31-year-old Hayat Essakati, and 34-year-old Ayman Cherkaoui are all young entrepreneurs or activists fighting for “a better Morocco.” “My goal is to raise civic awareness. I am convinced that social justice and economic development have a lot to do with how our civic behaviors,” said Lahbabi. On July 13, President Obama took to his Facebook account, writing: “This week, I’m traveling to Africa for the first time since I left office…. In South Africa, the Obama Foundation will convene 200 extraordinary young leaders from across the continent and I’ll deliver a speech to mark the 100th anniversary of Nelson Mandela’s birth.” ‘A Master’s degree in just five days’ “The program’s diversity is its primary richness,” Lahbabi, an activist and young leader, told Francophone outlet Telquel. Lahbabi extolled the program’s spirit, describing it as a platform that brings together bright youths who, despite their multiple backgrounds, are like-minded in their ambition to be drivers of change in their countries and communities. “The program focused on soft skills like leadership and storytelling, but it also entailed some more technical aspects like lobbying and public policies. I feel like I’ve just completed a Master’s degree in just five days.” Ayman Cherkaoui compared the program to spending a nice time in a “fabulous” holiday reserve in Greece. “I feel rejuvenated,” the 34-year-old said, speaking of the program’s training sessions as an energizing trip to re-engage with what inspired him in the first place. Inspiring line-up and speeches Cherkaoui was especially grateful for the unique opportunity to meet some of the most recognizable names in African politics, including Sudanese- British businessman Mo Ibrahim, Ghanaian diplomat Kofi Annan, Nigeria’s Aliko Dangote (Africa’s richest man), and former president of Liberia Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. In his Mandela lecture in Johannesburg on July 18, President Obama spoke about the inescapable necessity to commit to democracy, putting a special highlight on the rise of “strong men politics”—politicians who brazenly lie and undermine democratic institutions, he said.  Later speaking to the Obama Leaders, as the YALI participants are called, President Obama urged them to be strategic in their thirst for change and to never give up on their aspiration to make an impact in their countries and in Africa as a whole. “Be bold, but be realistic,” he said. “It was a very powerful moment. He [Obama] gave us practical pieces of advice on the challenges that we will encounter. He gave us examples from his own political career and encouraged us to persevere in the pursuit of our missions,” said Lahbabi.

Rabat – A predicted response has emerged to the controversial Arabic hashtag translate ‘Be_a_man,’ which encouraged men in Morocco to tell their female relatives to cover up at the beach. The new hashtag condemns “sexist” propaganda against Moroccan women. Moroccan women have adorned hundreds of posts with the “Be_a_free_woman” hashtag in Arabic or #SoisUneFemme in French to denounce the original campaign, launched on July 9, against revealing clothing and makeup. The “Be_a_man” hashtag angered thousands of women who called on Moroccan women to stop feeling victimized and act like a free woman. Morocco’s Alternative Movement for Individual Freedoms launched #SoisUneFemme on July 20 in support of women’s freedom. The campaign calls on women to be strong and to fight discrimination based on gender. The hashtag has been widely shared and retweeted. Some Moroccan women, at home and abroad, chose to share photos of themselves in bikinis to condemn the hashtag against beach clothing. #summertime #lesoleilsurmapeau #libre #monchoixmavie #soisunefemme #goodvibes #singerlifestyle #moroccanandproud A post shared by  Naciri Maria (@marianacirijazzandsoul) on Jul 21, 2018 at 2:59am PDT  #Soisunefemme A post shared by  Majdouline TAZI LAGHRARI (@mijoutl) on Jul 21, 2018 at 7:34am PDT  Bouchra Abdou, an activist, feminist, and president of Tahadi Center, told Morocco World News today that the “Be_a_man” hashtag is a violation to women, their freedom, and their choice of dress.  The hashtag, according to Abdou, “misleads the meaning of manness as it is based on power, absolute jurisdiction and control over the fate of others at a time when we are in the greatest need to reevaluate the true meaning of masculinity.” For Abdou, masculinity is to be “brave, classy, and respectful to others.” “Anyone who wants to be a real man should not harass young girls, who are at the age of his daughters. Anyone who wants to be a real man should spend on his wife and children. Anyone who wants to be a real man should not rape infants and children, male or female.” For years, Abdou has criticized the lack of security for dealing with assaults in public spaces. In an interview with MWN earlier this year, Abdou said that “authorities need to push up their sleeves and do something concrete about assault incidents and their perpetrators.” Abdou also urged the Ministry of Education to offer students an opportunity to learn about the dangers of assault and harassment. Visage du Maroc, a platform dedicated to inspiring women, also condemned the “Be_a_man” hashtag, posting a photo of Miss Morocco 1968 wearing a bikini. Notre réponse à la campagne #Kounrajel Ne laissons pas l’obscurantisme gagner du terrain! #SoisUneFemme
(Photo Miss Maroc 1968) pic.twitter.com/e1HxtNTZ7u — Visage Du Maroc (@visagedumaroc) July 20, 2018  “Our response to the #Kounrajel [Be a man] campaign Do not let obscurantism gain ground! #SoisUneFemme,” wrote Visage du Maroc on Twitter. For the supporters of the earlier hashtag, every man in a Moroccan family is responsible for what his sister, daughter, or wife wears. “You are responsible for what your daughter and wife wear… so don’t be a dayooth,” wrote some Moroccans on Facebook. The Arabic word dayooth refers to a man who permits his female relatives to engage in illicit relations.

Rabat – An armed teacher has killed three people near Azrou, a town 89 kilometers south of Fez in the Ifrane Province of the Fez-Meknes region, Morocco. The inhabitants of Douar Ait Ouali, in the region of Azrou, were shocked when a retired teacher killed three members of his wife’s family and injured four others, including a gendarme, with a hunting rifle Sunday night. Moroccan news outlet Al Yaoum 24 said that the crime resulted from a conflict between the teacher and three members of his wife’s family. Before gendarmes arrived, the man shot his three relatives. The suspect then injured four other people, including a gendarme. The injured victims were transferred to the Azrou Regional Hospital to receive care. Some witnesses told Al Yaoum 24 that the suspect suffers mental disorders.  Khaled Hasi, a brother of one of the victims, told Al Yaoum 24 that the suspect had frequently visited the family, as the suspect’s wife left him after he retired. The victim’s brother added that the suspect has been suffering mental disorders since his retirement. One of the victims who survived the shooting and a sister of Badr, one of the murdered victims, told Moroccan news outlet Hespress that the suspect was “following her with his bullets as he was hunting pigs.” “I was running throughout the neighborhood and knocking on houses. No one could open a door for me because everyone was hiding; everyone was scared,” she said. The victim said she finally found a place to hide while the suspect was smoking and waiting for her to appear. A man from the same douar took her in his motorcycle and ran away while he was following them with his hunting rifle. The victim said that, in addition to her sister, she lost her husband during the incident, and called on King Mohammed VI to intervene and call for authorities to give the suspect the maximum penalty. The prepatator, according to Khaled Hasi, had started a fight with a group of young people near his in-laws’ house. The fight became a heated debate, which resulted in the intervention of the Royal Gendarmerie. The suspect then started shooting deliberately, taking the lives of three people while four others were wounded. Several Moroccan news outlets reported on the crime, including Moroccan TV channel 2M. 2M, however, reported that only two people were injured.

By Renee Sang Rabat- It is not unusual for visitors to lose count of how many cats they see while traversing the streets of Morocco. Any person could reasonably infer that the Moroccan person to cat ratio is pretty close to 1:1.  These felines have become as common as the men who frequent cafés and can be found anywhere from lounging in baskets of grain in the medina to hiding in storefronts or simply napping on a car hood (as the above photo indicates). Moreover, the cats have become an inherent part of Moroccan culture and everyday life. Although there are varying takes on the prevalence of these animals, the general consensus among Moroccans is that they are not a bother. The small trays of water and piles of cat food that can be found around the city would at least indicate some fondness and care for the creatures among the people. According to Rabat resident Samira Baazzaoui, cats are a very normal and accepted part of the culture. It is an everyday occurrence to see the cats while walking around the city and the medina. No one is ever intentionally cruel or unkind to them, and some people will even buy cheese to feed to them. It is said that the tie to these animals is embodied in the Islamic faith which influences the attitude towards the cat population. The Prophet Muhammad is believed  to have been personally affectionate towards cats and to have said in a hadith: “Affection for cats is part of faith” (Maqasid al-Hasanah, al-Sakhawi). In accordance with the faith, cats are considered cleaner than most creatures, so much so that if a person were to touch a cat before prayer, they would not need to wash their hands. However, a person who touched a dog would be considered unclean and need to change into a new outfit.  Maryem Karouach, a resident of Casablanca and owner of three cats, noted that “there is even a hadith where the Prophet Muhammad tells about a women who goes to hell for capturing a cat and not feeding it.” In one story, the Prophet Muhammad is said to have gone to put on his robes at the time of prayer, but found his cat, Muezza, sleeping on one of the sleeves. Rather than disturb him, he cut off part of the sleeve to allow the cat to continue sleeping. Aside from their religious significance, cats have become largely ingrained into the everyday Moroccan experience. Boulaouan Mohammed owns a store in the medina of Rabat that sells pet care supplies.   “There are people who live with the cats at home, and there are people who feed them outside even if they don’t live with them…I live with six cats and they sleep with my wife on the same bed—six cats, six babies” he said, laughing. Mohammed says that unfortunately, it can be costly to take care of cats and keep them as pets. “All of the vets who have clinics are private, but there are no public vets with free services for the cats.” In addition, he said that medicine and treatment for animals is often more expensive than it is for people. Because neutering is expensive, reproduction rates among cats is high, so the cat population continues to increase. Despite this, Mohammed insisted that Moroccans love cats and can often be seen sharing their lunch with the cats. “Even though [people in the medina] don’t earn that much [money], they still give the cats water and take them to their homes…. People share their salary with the cats.”  (above: picture of the many cats that Boulaouan Mohammed and his wife have fed) Although there is a  diversity of opinions on the presence of cats in the country, there is an agreed acceptance and perhaps even affection for them that the Prophet Muhammad himself shared. There is also an undeniable beauty at the humanity and everyday kindness that the cats have elicited from the Moroccans they live amongst.

Rabat – The criminal chamber in charge of terrorism affairs at the annex of Sale’s Court of Appeals has handed down sentences from 1 to 20 years in prison for 18 defendants for their involvement in terrorism-related crimes. On Thursday, the court sentenced two main defendants to 20 years in prison, one to 18 years, and three to 16 years, five to 15 years, five to 10 years, one to 8 years, and one to 1 year and an MAD 5,000 fine, the state-owned news agency MAP reported. According to MAP, the defendants were convicted of terrorism-related charges, including “forming a gang to prepare and commit terrorist acts as part of a collective plan aimed at undermining public order.” They were also accused of “advocating a terrorist organization, inciting others to commit terror crimes, and failure to report a terrorist crime.” The defendants were arrested in October 2017 when the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) dismantled a terrorist cell operating in Fez, Casablanca, Khouribga, Meknes, and other cities. According to the Ministry of the Interior, the cell members had suspected connections to ISIS and were involved in “acquiring expertise in explosives manufacturing.” Earlier this year, three women received sentences ranging from to 4 to 5 years in prison for the same terrorism-related crimes. In October 2016, a French former soldier was given 4 years in prison for his involvement in terrorism-related crimes. The French national was arrested in Fez-Saiss Airport in March 2016.

Rabat – Moroccan culture was showcased in all its richness and diversity, Sunday, June 22, at the National Museum of Australia in Canberra, as part of the cultural event “The Souq – a festival of culture.” Morocco’s embassy in Australia had dedicated, at the entrance of the museum, a Moroccan stand where visitors discovered the different facets of the Kingdom’s culture, especially crafts, music, and gastronomy. Visitors could enjoy various traditional dishes and appreciated the rich gastronomy of the kingdom with its ingredients, such as saffron, olives, candied lemons, olive oil, and aromatic herbs. Moroccan craftsmanship also had an important place in the Moroccan stand with different items that reflected the expertise of Moroccan artisans, bringing to the Australian capital the atmosphere and smell of a real Moroccan souk. “This event is part of efforts to promote the rich and diverse Moroccan culture in Australia, a country known for its cultural mixing,” said Morocco’s ambassador to Canberra, Karim Medrek, in a statement to the MAP. This year, the embassy of the Kingdom has opted for a diversified cultural program to make the Kingdom and the pluralism of the Moroccan culture known to Australians. According to Medrek, Morocco has a good reputation among Australians, many of whom visit the North African country.  The arts and culture event was organized by the National Museum of Australia and was enhanced with exhibitions, folk art shows, and craft workshops. Several folklore troupes highlighting the heritage of Islamic countries also participated in the event.

Rabat – The German football player Mesut Ozil has left the national team of Germany.  The 29-year-old midfielder for Arsenal announced the news on his Twitter account. He wrote, “It is with a heavy heart and after much consideration that because of recent events, I will no longer be playing for Germany at international level whilst I have this feeling of racism and disrespect.” The past couple of weeks have given me time to reflect, and time to think over the events of the last few months. Consequently, I want to share my thoughts and feelings about what has happened. pic.twitter.com/WpWrlHxx74 — Mesut Özil (@MesutOzil1088) July 22, 2018  The decision came after he was harshly criticized for appearing in a picture with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at an event in May, during Turkish presidential campaign.  The Turkish-German football player was also targeted by angry fans who lashed out at him after Germany’s shocking loss to South Korea which resulted in an early exit from the 2018 World Cup.  II / III pic.twitter.com/Jwqv76jkmd — Mesut Özil (@MesutOzil1088) July 22, 2018  Ozil received hate mail and threats blaming him for the loss. In the emails he said people called him a “Turkish pig,” among other insulting names. “I am German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose,” Ozil said, adding that the reactions represent a Germany of which he is no longer proud.  “Is it because it is Turkey? Is it because I’m a Muslim? I think here lies an important issue,” said Ozil, questioning why his other dual-heritage teammates have not experienced the same treatment. III / III pic.twitter.com/c8aTzYOhWU — Mesut Özil (@MesutOzil1088) July 22, 2018  Talking about his meeting with the Turkish president before the 2018 World Cup in Russia, he assured fans that his gesture had “no political intention.”  “Like many people, my ancestral roots span more than one country. I certainly grew up in Germany, but my family history has its roots firmly in Turkey. I have two hearts, a German and a Turkish.”  Following his statement, many Turkish ministers applauded Ozil’s decision to leave the Mannschaft.  “I congratulate Mesut Ozil who, on leaving the German national team, scored the best goal against fascism,” tweeted Abdulhamit Gul, the minister of justice.  Germany’s Social Democrat Minister of Justice Katarina Barley reacted sympathetically, saying, “It’s alarming if a great German football player like Mesut Ozil no longer feels wanted in his country.” “If I score I’m French but if I don’t I’m Arab,” said France’s Karim Benzema in an interview with French outlet So Foot in 2011. Bi-national football players have struggled for decades over racism, being targeted by fans, coaches, and teammates.  Recently, France players Paul Pogba, Ousmane Dembele, and n’Golo Kante were subjected to racist abuse by Russians during the World Cup competition in their side’s 3-1 win over the competition’s host.  Last year, the captain of the national team, Mehdi Benatia, was the subject of an offensive insult when called “Moroccan sh*t” on live television in Italy.  Morocco’s Atlas Lion Abdeslam Ouaddou experienced it in 2010. During a game with Valencienne against FC Metz, Ouaddou was the victim of racist verbal attacks by a fan who insulted him for 45 minutes at the Stade Saint-Symphorien.  In April 2009, Nigerian-Belgian Oguchi Onyewu accused his Anderlecht teammate Jelle Van Damme of having treated him three times as a “dirty monkey.” Subsequently, he lodged a complaint against Van Damme to put an end to the racism.  In November 2007, Congolese-Belgian Zola Matumona left FC Brussels following racist remarks by club president Johan Vermeersch. According to the player’s lawyer, Vermeersch had said to Matumona he “was no longer in his country and had to forget about trees and bananas” in the presence of the staff and other players.  In 2006, Cameroonian Samuel Eto’o, then at FC Barcelona, where he was one of the most prolific attackers on the planet, was the victim of monkey cries from an audience member who had already taken a hit at him the previous season. He decided to leave the field, but was dissuaded by his coach Frank Rijkaard.

Rabat – Twenty-five children have been urgently hospitalized due to food poisoning at a summer camp in El Jadida in Al Haouzia province. The joy of 25 children taking part in a summer camp in El Jadida turned into a nightmare. They started vomiting, one after the other, after they had eaten spaghetti with meatballs for dinner on Saturday evening, the outlet Kifache reported. Immediately after dinner, the children began showing symptoms of food poisoning, including severe stomach aches and frequent vomiting. According to the outlet, the 25 children were taken immediately to the regional hospital of El Jadida, where they were rushed to a private room for medical examination. A source from the regional hospital told Kifache that the children’s condition was stable and that it was not cause for concern. Khalid Amal, the regional Ministry of Health’s delegate in El Jadida and a doctor of the epidemiology department, went to the spot shortly after learning of the incident. An investigation was opened and samples of the food were taken for laboratory analysis. Amal asserted that only three cases had been transferred to another pediatric hospital. The medical official said no complications occurred among the children infected with food poisoning as of Sunday, July 22. Some children are gradually gaining strength and do not show any more worrying signs. “In parallel with medical examination and poisoning diagnosis, such as frequent vomiting and acute stomach pain, the medical staff continued to check, administer medication, keep the children under medical surveillance,” he added.

Rabat – The Atlas Lions will be back soon. The Moroccan national football team is set to face Tunisia for a friendly game on November 20 in Tunis. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) confirmed the news on Sunday. “This meeting will serve as preparation for the men of Hervé Renard.” The match will be the first friendly game for Morocco’s Atlas Lions after their praised participation in the 2018 World Cup. The last few months of 2018 will be eventful as Morocco will play several qualification games for the Africa Cup of Nations. The first game will be against Malawi on September 7. Morocco will play against Comoros on October 10 and 13. Morocco will then play against Cameroon on November 16 and a second game against Malawi on March 22, 2019. Morocco’s participation in the 2018 World Cup received international applause despite their loss in two games against Iran and Portugal.  Morocco made a draw in its last World Cup game against Spain. The Atlas Lions and their coach, Herve Renard, criticized FIFA and its referees, blaming them for their elimination as the video assistant referee (VAR) was not used during Morocco’s game to review Portuguese mistakes, but it was used to grant Spain an equalizer. Still blaming VAR FRMF President Fouzi Lekjaa is still angry at FIFA and the absence of VAR in Morocco’s games throughout the first phase of the World Cup. Lekjaa made his remarks on VAR during a conference to evaluate the African participation in the World Cup held on Saturday in Rabat. In the opening ceremony, Lekjaa said that “the issue of referees should not be viewed from the perspective of victims. We must be able today to make deep analyses, to have the capacity to make concrete proposals for the good of football and its future.” Lekjaa also recalled that FRMF sent a letter to FIFA to condemn referees not using VAR in Morocco’s games. On outside influences interfering in football, he said, “If the business does become dominant [in football], the fear is that talent and art will be sacrificed. It is in this logic that the introduction of new technologies at the level of referee in this case, the VAR must ensure impartiality on fields and football justice.”

Rabat– Moroccans turned to social media last week to decry the PJD’s decision to keep the “excessive” lifelong pensions and compensation given to MPs and government ministers after their terms in accordance with the Royal Decree (Daheer) of 1975 during King Hassan II’s rule. PJD announced last Tuesday that the majority of MPs voted in favor of maintaining their lifelong pensions and the compensation given to them and Moroccan government ministers. The former minister of the budget and head of the parliamentary section of the Justice and Development Party (PJD), Idris El Azami Idrissi, explained why PJD reconsidered its proposal to end the pensions. El Azami: “We have received the names of former MPs who will become in a difficult [financial] situation if the pensions were to stop.” El Azami added that the PJD members and those of the House of Representatives, with the exception of the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM), agreed on an alternative solution to reduce the monthly pensions to MAD 3,500. The new proposal suggests that MPs and ministers will begin receiving the pensions at the age of 65 instead of immediately after completing their term of service. For its part, PAM called for the government to establish a fundraising box for MPs, yet another controversial proposal that inspired the mockery of Moroccans on social media. Several Moroccan social media users launched a  satirical campaign with hashtags reading “Campaign_aid_MPs” (in Arabic) in reaction to their call for a fundraising campaign and El Azami’s decision. One Facebook user posted a photo of him holding money and smiling in pure sarcasm, saying: “Since the MPs are perishing in poverty (as El Azami said) here’s a 25 Tunisian Dinar as a donation from me to them so our MPs brother can enroll their children in a private school and spend their vacation abroad!”

Another posted, “I, Mohamed Zekri contribute with one symbolic Dirham to support MPs in a ‘difficult situation.’”

Some even made a box on which they wrote: “Fundraising box for the poor MPs…Help the nation’s sleepers,” referring to pictures that went viral of MPs asleep in the middle of a parliament session.  The government ministers and MP’s monthly retirement income amounts to MAD 20,000 and MAD 35,000, respectively. The ministers were entitled to it even if they had only served for one or two years, whereas civil servants in different government sectors receive wages as low as MAD 2,000 or MAD 3,000. The issue has caused debate among Moroccans for years, as many argued that the MPs do not deserve to benefit from a retirement pension for the rest of their lives, calling for them to relinquish their pensions. In favor of the pensions, the secretary of state in charge of water, Charafat Afilal, said in 2015 that some MPs relinquished their pensions responding to the people’s request. Afilal’s claims did not bear evidence, and her description of the debate on the pensions as a “populist” one enraged many Moroccans who criticized her for belittling the issue. A professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Boston, Mohamed Brahimi, previously expressed to Morocco World News that the debate is worth more than being deemed “a populist debate in a country where public service is more of a solid financial investment.” To make matters worse, the conflict between opinions and the ministers’ inability to reach a final and fair decision has added to the anger of Moroccans amid the ongoing boycott crisis. If the specter of the pensions has not yet disappeared, the boycott campaign might follow in its steps. Moroccan citizens have boycotted for four months three leading companies due to their high prices: Sidi Ali (mineral water), Centrale Danone (dairy products), and Afriquia gasoline, owned by Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch. Just as some ministers defended the pension against the popular demand to reform the law, several ministers and government officials denounced the boycott campaign and called for citizens to suspend it, for fear of dairy farmers’ job loss. Minister Delegate to the Head of Government for General Affairs and Governance Lahcen Daoudi, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi, Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid, and Minister of Employment Mohamed Yatim asserted different views.  What they all had in common is a negative view toward the campaign. The boycott is a delicate issue for Moroccans as it is not only a protest against market monopolies, but the burdening of the regular consumers’ purchasing power through unjustified high prices. In fact, both protests signify a rise against social disparities to many Moroccans. The Moroccan pension system is composed of three principal categories: pensions for civil servants, pensions for employees of state-owned companies, and pensions for private sector employees.  The percentage of civil servants and employees who benefit from retirement is higher than the percentage of Moroccans who contribute to the pension fund. According to Morocco’s High Commission for Planning, the contributions paid from employee salaries is likely to result in a deficit of 7.4 percent of GDP by 2050.

Rabat – FC Barcelona is not ready to let go of its striker yet. Despite sitting on the bench for two seasons, Morocco’s Munir El Haddadi may stay with the Spanish club for a while.  According to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo, Barça hopes to extend the contract of the Spanish-Moroccan football player for 5 more years. The “Blaugranas” has announced that it will not give up on the young footballer for less than €14 million, as he is under contract until 2019. El Haddadi, who played under the colors of Alavés where he was loaned last season and scored 10 goals, has also raised the interest of French clubs, such as Lille and Olympique Marseille.  During his youth, the 21-year-old footballer also played for several Spanish clubs, including Atletico Madrid, FC Valencia, and Rayo Majadahonda.  As for his national career, El Haddadi, born to Moroccan parents in Spain, represented the Spanish national under-19 team and under-20 and made a brief appearance as a substitute at an international game against Macedonia in 2014. His appearance then ruined his chances to represent the Moroccan national football team, according to FIFA eligibility rules. In 2017, El Haddadi urged Morocco to help him convince FIFA to let him represent Morocco. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) asked FIFA to let him play for Morocco in the 2018 World Cup. The FIFA Players’ Status Committee ruled that El Haddadi’s sporting nationality could not be changed from Spain to Morocco March 13. When the decision was appealed, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) confirmed the FIFA ruling with a verdict in May.

Rabat – Can a joint Maghreb bid win the rights to host the 2030 World Cup? According to AMU Secretary-General Taieb Baccouche, the “Maghreb has a real card to play this time.” In an interview with pan-African magazine Jeune Afrique, the secretary-general of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) expressed his confidence that a Maghreb bid could give Africa a chance to host the World Cup for the second time. When asked about his support for a joint Maghreb bid, Baccouche said, “The idea was born after two observations: the official support of all the Maghreb for the Moroccan bid and the choice of a World Cup held by three countries in 2026.” “All this convinced us, at the general secretariat of the UMA, to coordinate a Maghreb bid for 2030 and to start the process,” he added. The Tunisian politician said that he discussed the joint Maghreb bid idea in the recent African Union summit in Nouakchott. “By 2030, there will be an Asian bid from China and probably one from three South American countries. The competition is serious, but Africa has not often had a chance.” Appealing to the 5 heads of state On Saturday, the AMU wrote on its official Facebook page that Baccouche wrote to the five leaders of AMU countries, urging them to submit a joint bid.  In his letters to the heads of state, the secretary-general emphasized that the Maghreb countries could “learn from the Moroccan experience” and “the great enthusiasm expressed by the people of the Maghreb for the initiative taken by Morocco to submit another Maghreb bid in 2030,” wrote the AMU. According to Baccouche, a Maghreb bid would be more favorable to FIFA as it “prefers joint bids over single bids.” FIFA President Infantino announced earlier this month his support for joint bids. “I believe in joint bids because the World Cup is an enormous event.” Political tension could undermine a joint bid A joint bid between the Maghreb would require the countries to tackle tense political issues. Algerian Minister of Youth and Sports Mohamed Hattab said that his country was “ready to study a possible joint bid” with Morocco and Tunisia. However, a joint bid might be an “impossible mission” as the border between Morocco and Algeria is closed. Tunisia has also expressed its interest in bidding jointly with Morocco and Algeria. Morocco has shown great interest in hosting the World Cup, especially in its 2026 World Cup bid. Despite its defeat to United 2026, the North African country announced it would bid for the 2030 World Cup. But expressing interest will not be enough  to fulfill the dream of hosting a World Cup.

By Maria Kuiper Rabat – Lebanon’s suffering economy and an abundance of illegal cannabis farmers has led the Lebanese government to look into its legalization.  McKinsey &amp; Company, an international consultant firm, has proposed the plan for Lebanon to legalize cannabis to save their weak economy. Since the start of the Syrian war, the UN Refugee Agency has estimated around 1 million documented Syrian refugees living in Lebanon. Riad Salameh, the governor of the Central Bank of Lebanon, said in 2015 that Syrian refugees directly cost $1 billion a year and indirectly cost $3.5 billion a year. The Guardian reported that economic growth in Lebanon dropped from 9 percent to 2 percent since the Syrian war began.  One of the reasons people in Lebanon are so poor is because of arrest warrants relating to the drug trade. According to the Guardian, about 42,000 arrest warrants for marijuana offences are outstanding in the Baalbek-Hermel district. People with arrest warrants cannot find a job. Cannabis production in Lebanon is ruled by clans in the country’s eastern Bekaa valley. They have established wealth and power due to years of the drug trade. They are heavily armed and will question authorities.  Lebanon’s cannabis industry peaked during the Lebanese civil war from 1975 to 1990, when approximately 2,000 tonnes of cannabis were illegally transported per year. Now, cannabis brings in an estimated $175 million to $200 million to the country by exporting to the Gulf, Europe, Africa, and North America. Lebanon is the third largest exporter of cannabis in the world, according to the UN Office for Drugs and Crime. Morocco remains the main source for cannabis resin in the world. Moroccan law bans the sale and consumption of cannabis, but farmers continue to grow the plant, and tourists continue to visit Morocco in hopes of trying hashish. According to the South China Morning Post, cannabis provided a living for around 90,000 households in Morocco in 2013.  Moroccan tourism and hashish have gone hand-in-hand since the 1960s during the hippie movement. Chefchaouen, the famous “Blue Pearl” city, has been popularized as Morocco’s main center of cannabis production. The World Drug Report reports that cannabis is the “most widely cultivated, produced, trafficked, and consumed drug worldwide,” although it is still illegal in most countries. If Lebanon legalizes cannabis for medical purposes, there would be more access and treatments for people who experience chronic pain, muscle spasms, seizures, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, and even multiple sclerosis and cancer.

Rabat – Italy has announced the arrest of a Belgian citizen of Moroccan descent for terrorism-related crimes. Italian state-owned agency ANSA reported on July 20 that the 41-year old suspect was arrested in Sarnico, a commune in the province of Bergamo. The suspect was on vacation with his wife. The suspect, according to ANSA, was the subject of an international arrest warrant issued in Morocco in March. He will be investigated for terrorism crimes, participation in a terrorist organization, homicide, and violation of the Arms Act. The news outlet said that the suspect was taken to the Bergamo prison for further investigation. Morocco’s state news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) has not reported on the arrest as of yet. In March, Italian news outlets reported the arrest of a 23-year old Moroccan-Italian for terrorist propaganda on behalf of ISIS. The suspect was arrested in Turin after a two-year investigation by police. In the same month, Italy expelled a 35-year old Moroccan for allegedly praising the 2016 truck attack in Nice, France. Eighty-six people were killed in the Nice attack.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Equipment, Transport, and Logistics has announced that ticket prices for the ferry between Morocco and Spain have been reduced. The announcement followed several demonstrations by Moroccans living overseas (MREs) at departure points against ticket prices. Prices for the ferry between Tangier and Tarifa and between Tanger-Med and Algeciras will be reduced, following negotiations between the concerned parties. The ministry said in a July 18 statement that the decision was taken following a meeting between the merchant navy and shipowners who operate the lines, as well as representatives of the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity. With the onset of the summer season, Moroccans residing abroad had urged authorities to take action on the cost of ferry tickets, which had increased by 30 percent compared to 2017. The ministry said that now a one-way trip for a vehicle and four passengers is set at MAD 1,720, while a round trip is MAD 2,820. Two weeks ago, Secretary of State for Transport Mohamed Najib Boulif shared a statement from the ministry showing ticket prices for each crossing point on Facebook. The official also said that the ministry was closely monitoring the situation and communicating with the ferry companies. The ministry’s decision falls within the framework of the “Marhaba 2018” operation launched every year in Morocco to welcome home returning Moroccan expats for the summer. The operation started this year on June 5 and will continue until September 15.

Rabat – As Morocco has become one of the most popular destinations for Moroccans living overseas and international tourists, the North African country has fascinated another Hollywood magazine with its tangible and intangible assets. For the Los Angeles-based magazine, the Hollywood Reporter, Morocco is “the Most Lovely Spot in the Whole World.” The author of the “Hollywood Insider’s Guide to Morocco,” Kathryn Romeyn takes her readers on a journey to the most-visited destinations in Morocco: Essaouira, Marrakech, and the Atlas Mountains. The publication borrows a few quotes from Walton Goggins, whose visit to Morocco gave him inspiration and unforgettable memories in Marrakech, the High Atlas Mountains, and the Sahara desert. Goggins had “one goal in mind: to wake up deep in the Sahara, to feel connected without words.” “That’s what Morocco gave me, the sense of place I was looking for, and it’s stayed with me ever since,” she said. Romeyn then gave a list of destinations where several Hollywood stars spent magical moments in the four-season land. Starting with the High Atlas Mountains, the author recalled the magnificent Kasbah Tamadot resort owned by British self-made billionaire Richard Branson. The Hollywood Reporter’s next stop was the city of winds: Essaouira. The author then named Morocco’s shooting destinations, including Ouarzazate, Tangier, Essaouira, and the dunes of Merzouga. Quoting producer Khadija Alami, the Hollywood Reporter described the coastal city of Essaouira, saying that it is the destination “where a rough Atlantic Ocean meets the chill and laid-back atmosphere of the hippie era; Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones were once there.”  Marrakech is one of the lovely spots for Hollywood stars.  Romeyn said that several stars, including  John Legend and Chrissy Teigen visited the red city recently, “while Katy Perry (with Ellie Goulding and Diplo) and David Beckham (with Eva Longoria, Tom Cruise and his wife, Victoria in tow) looked to Marrakech’s Amanjena — the secluded, ultra-private property 15 minutes from the bustling medina — to celebrate milestone birthdays.” The author then recalled hotels where some movies scenes were filmed, including The Selman, Royal Mansour, and Mamounia. Morocco’s Hollywood, or “Ouallywood” as described by the Hollywood Reporter, is also among the list of the best destinations to visit in Morocco. Morocco-based producer James H E Cutting was quoted as saying the “only luxury hotel is le Berbere Palace.” “When we were filming Babel, Brad Pitt stayed in one of the private villas normally used for dignitaries and royalty, and used the rear service entrance so as not to be seen by paparazzi,” said the producer. Ouarzazate has been the home for several movies and series, including The Mummy, Gladiator, and Lawrence of Arabia. The award-winning hit series Game of Thrones also includes scenes shot on the sprawling grounds.

Rabat- Morocco is proud of a medical student, Fatima Abderrazak, who helped a Moroccan-Canadian woman successfully deliver her baby during a Casablanca-Montreal Royal Air Maroc (RAM) flight. When the young mother felt the first labor contractions, Abderrazak volunteered to help in response to flight attendants’ emergency announcement in search of a doctor. The woman was only seven months pregnant. The cabin crew members provided Abderrazak with clean towels and oxygen equipment to carry out the premature labor.  As the plane landed safely, the woman and her child were immediately transported to Sainte-Justine Hospital in Montreal.  The baby became the second to be born on an RAM flight.  in 2014, a 33-year-old Moroccan woman gave birth to a baby girl named Ghalia, also on a RAM flight between Casablanca and Montreal. Abderrazak earned the respect of Moroccans and Canadians alike for her courageous initiative, even though she has not yet finished her medical studies. Moroccans on social media praised her efforts and described her as an exemplary doctor who is always ready to do her duty no matter the circumstances. One commenter wrote: “It’s People like her who bring happiness to our hearts, thank you!” “She is our pride, I wish her great success,” another commented. Another wrote: “Kudos to this medical student… although I heard that flight attendants are trained to carry out similar emergency situations.”

Rabat – A total of 299 Moroccan women have passed the admission test to become public notaries (adoul), accounting for 38.37 percent of the passing candidates. A statement from the Ministry of Justice announced on Saturday that 501 men passed the admission test, representing 62.62 percent. King Mohammed VI announced in January an unprecedented decision to open the position of adoul to women candidates. Of the 18,948 who took the test on May 6, 7,632 were women. Public notaries in Morocco, similar to lawyers, typically handle the paperwork for a multitude of transactions, including the sale of property, marriage contracts, and commercial contracts.  Traditionally, the notary position was held by a religious man certified by Morocco’s government to document marriage papers and manage inheritance issues. The tests were given in several regions across Morocco, including Rabat, Oujda, Marrakech, Agadir, Casablanca, Tangier, and Fez. Following the decision of the King, the ministry announced that it would create up to 800 jobs for Moroccan men and women wishing to become public notary officials. The ministry described the event as “historic,” adding that it is a new phase that “embodies the modernist democratic choice of the Kingdom, particularly in the promotion of women’s rights, the fight against all forms of discrimination and the strengthening of their position alongside men.”  The royal decree allows Moroccan women across the country to carry out several duties in accordance with the Islamic law (sharia), such as documenting witness testimony in courts and handling inheritance cases and real estate transactions. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said during the Government Council that equality between men and women on economic, social, and political levels has become a national cause. El Othmani also said that he wants to see women as decision-makers, abiding by the constitutional reforms of 2011 which emphasize equality between genders and the integration of women in different fields. El Othmani invited everyone to be vigilant towards “caring for women in all parts of their lives, especially for [their] education, health, and social integration.”

Rabat –   France and Morocco have agreed for four Moroccan police officers to be sent to help France deal with young Moroccan delinquent migrants in the Goutte d’Or neighborhood in Paris’s 18th district. The agreement was signed in June between the French and Moroccan Ministries of the Interior. The four Moroccan police officers will be charged to identify Moroccan minors for possible deportation back to Morocco, the French weekly magazine L’Obs reported. A document obtained by L’Obs specifies that the team of French-Moroccan police “will have a mission of interviewing Moroccan unaccompanied minors and collect information to launch investigations to identify them and take them back to Morocco.” According to the same source, about 50 young boys, aged between 15 and 17, have been wandering the Goutte d’Or neighborhood since their arrival in France. The young boys, mostly from Morocco, are continually escaping from educational centers where they have been placed. Following the French-Moroccan agreement, the Ministry of Justice was asked to identify the legal guarantees that could be made for the safety of the street teenagers upon their return to Morocco. The Group Providing Information and Support to Immigrants (GISTI) organization said, “Such a strict police arrangement would be totally against to the rights of the child.” “A legal requirement is imposed on all actors, especially on those concerned with children. If this is not taken into account, by checking the age of minors and by contacting their lawyers, the law is bypassed,” Emmanuel Daoud, lawyer and member of the bar council, told L’Obs. Paris residents feel endangered Since 2017, the situation of street delinquents has caused trouble for local residents in Paris, the Paris municipality, the Prefecture of Police, and the Paris prosecutor’s office. The minors, according to L’Obs, are on their way from Spain to northern European countries. They leave from two Spanish enclaves in Morocco, Ceuta and Melilla, heading for England or the Scandinavian countries.  Earlier this year, many residents of areas heavily populated by migrants in Goutte d’Or, La Chapelle, and Barbès, signed two petitions demanding the government act on problems caused by underage Moroccan migrants. One resident, named Mireille, said she left the Goutte d’Or after migrants had targeted her and her 15-year-old daughter. “The first time it was a Sunday night, I saw three of these young people on the sidewalk and I felt a threat. So we turned around, but right after one of them jumped to my daughter’s throat, maybe to take her collar. She broke free and started crying, we ran away.” “The next day we filed a complaint, but now I’m no longer safe in the street, neither is she. She finds it very unfair not to be able to walk freely in the neighborhood.”

Rabat – French-Moroccan football player Adil Rami is not going to put a ring on it (yet). After winning the 2018 World Cup trophy with France, the 32-year-old footballer was rumored to be engaged to girlfriend and Canadian star Pamela Anderson.  Following his victory, Rami flew to Los Angeles for a well-deserved vacation. Interviewed by paparazzi at the entrance of a restaurant, the Olympique Marseille player denied the rumors of a possible marriage with the star. “No, no, no, I’m not engaged,” he replied, smiling, in a video posted by Closer.  Wedding rumors aside, the pair, who met in May 2017 during the Grand Prix in Monaco, seem to be serious about their relationship.  Earlier this year, Anderson, 50, moved to Marseille, France, to be closer to her 32-year-old boyfriend, Rami, reported TMZ. “Pam literally packed a suitcase, hopped on a plane and left her life in L.A. to be with Adil,” said the celebrity news website. In an interview with the Daily Mail, the “BayWatch” actress opened up about her life in Marseille with her French-Moroccan professional footballer companion. “He cares a lot about me, we have a wonderful and simple life, we both have children, and we try to solve the equation as best as we can, we want to protect our love, because there is a lot of false information about us.”

Rabat – Tensions between Moroccan taxis and alternative transport may come to an end. Ride sharing app Careem has signed a MoU with two leading Moroccan taxi unions to allow taxi drivers to be hailed by the ridesharing app. The agreement, between Careem and the National Union of Taxis (UNT) and the Democratic Transportation Union (SDT), will offer Moroccan taxi drivers the opportunity to take advantage of ridesharing apps used by Careem for its services. The MoU will cover the city of Casablanca, and will extend across Morocco in the coming days. The two unions represent 5,000 and 1,700 taxis, respectively, throughout the North African country. The unions will federate their affiliates around the structuring project, Careem said in a statement on Friday. Secretary of the UNT Abdelmajid Malhin said union members have “expressed their wish to take advantage of the available transport applications and to be an integral part of the Smart City concept.” “Together, we chose a strong and reliable application.” The deputy secretary general of the SDT, Samir Faraby, said, “With Careem, our drivers will be able to enjoy material benefits and a number of services offered by the company.” He further explained, “This union also brings real added value to the population of Casablanca, which suffers a real problem in transportation.” He added, “Professional drivers will also attend training courses organized by Careem to improve the quality of service and meet new requirements of customers.” Careem began operating in Morocco in 2015. “We are proud of our presence in Morocco, and we confirm it more than ever through our merger with two of the largest taxi unions in Morocco,” said Ibrahim Manna, the managing director of emerging markets at Careem. End of war? In 2017, tensions reached a breaking point between taxi drivers, Careem and Uber. Uber could not survive protests by taxi drivers in Casablanca which complained of “unfair competition” from Uber and Careem. The taxi drivers claimed they were victims of Uber and Careem and said they were determined to remove the two transportation services from Morocco. Uber announced the suspension of its services in Morocco in February 2018. In April 2017, Moroccan newspaper Assabah reported that the Alliance of Trade Unions representing taxi drivers in Morocco had urged the National Telecommunications Regulatory Agency (ANRT) to ban the use of Uber and Careem.   Careem, however, survived the waves of anger of Moroccan taxi drivers, which were especially strong in Casablanca. Founded in Dubai in 2012, Careem operates in more than 100 cities in 15 countries in North Africa and the Middle East, as well as Turkey and Pakistan. The app has more than 4 million users and 850,000 drivers. Careem said the company has more than 300,000 users in Morocco.

Rabat – July 22: the date represents the pride of all Moroccans and activists as it reminds them of the famous Annual Battle in 1921. With limited resources, brave Moroccan soldiers did all they could to defend Morocco’s Rif region from Spanish colonizers. While the battle resulted in a victory for Moroccan soldiers and their Riffian military leader, Abd El Krim El Khattabi, Spanish historians named the battle the Disaster of Annual. July 22, 2018, is a walk to remember the achievements and glorious victory of Moroccan soldiers after a successful rebellion against the Spanish army. This year marks the 97th anniversary of the battle in which all Moroccans take pride, from the eldest to the youngest generations. It is a battle that made the list of Morocco’s exemplary accomplishments against colonizers. Dive into history The movement, led by prominent icon El Khattabi, was characterized by careful planning, determination, tactics, action plans, and a masterful performance. El Khattabi’s fierce army and guerilla tactics led Manuel Fernandez Silvester and his forces to withdraw. Silvester himself, and an alleged 13,000 Spanish soldiers, lost their lives in the disastrous defeat. The forces then settled in the city of Melilla, and Morocco’s National Liberation Movement received support and admiration from many liberation movements worldwide. The national movement aimed to stand against colonizers and to free Moroccan territory from the control of colonists. The Moroccan movement resisted Spanish campaigns for a year, which led to the intervention of the French army. The Spanish-French alliance did not stop El Khattabi and his army. In July 1925, El Khattabi confronted the French army by mobilizing 25,000 soldiers and 50,000 tribesmen from the region around Fez. El Khattabi’s siege of Fez resulted in the death of 6,000 French forces. The two powers then called for negotiations with the Moroccan movement. After several meetings with military forces, El Khattabi agreed to end the Rif war, but refused to hand over the weapons his men had looted from fallen Spanish soldiers. The alliance between Spain and France, however, stopped El Khattabi in September 1925 as the powers sent their troops into the Rif and the south resulting in several battles. The two powers used chemical grenades and other weapons that had been used in World War I. The massive attack led the Riffan leader to hand himself over to to the French occupier for the first time on May 26, 1926. France then exiled El Khattabi with his family to the island of Réunion, a French territory in the Indian ocean, where he lived for 20 years. When he was later deported from Réunion to France in May 1947, El Khattabi fled to Egypt while crossing the Suez Canal. Egypt then refused to hand him over to the French governors in Morocco, and he lived in Egypt for the rest of his life. In Morocco, resistance against the colonists continued under the leadership of the late King Mohammed V, who ascended to the throne on November 18, 1927. The Annual battle remains one of the most famous battles in the heart of the immortal ancestors of Morocco. Morocco will keep celebrating the anniversary of the battle of bravery and resistance. Spain’s propaganda fails Despite Spain’s propaganda attempts to show the war was going in its favor, the world recognized their calamitous defeat at Annual. Spain launched an unsuccessful propaganda campaign to portray the Moroccan army as savage, bloodthirsty, and greedy. To justify their allegations against Moroccans, the Spanish military propaganda insisted that Moroccans were good in “cheating the Spaniards from behind.” Never forget El Khattabi Throughout the years, El Khattabi’s name has resounded in the memory of historians and activists. The icon served as an example of an outstanding leader for the liberation of the Maghreb countries. El Khattabi was born in Ajdir, a small town near Al Hoceima. In his twenties, El Khattabi moved to Fez and studied in the famous Quaraouiyine University, where he graduated in 1908. El Khattabi had a dual education as he studied Arab Islamic cultures and Western Spanish culture. He mastered Arabic, Amazigh (Berber), and Spanish. The Moroccan politician then worked as a teacher and a judge in the city of Melilla after graduating from the University of Salamanca, Spain. He also worked as a translator and for the Spanish native affairs office. He also became a journalist for the Spanish newspaper Telegrama del Rif between 1906 and 1915. In 1907, El Khattabi was also an editor and wrote articles in Arabic for the same Melilla-based newspaper. The leader of the Annual battle led several other battles against the Spanish colonizers, including “Dahar Abbaran” and “Sidi Biban.”

Rabat – Morocco and the EU issued a joint statement Friday at the end of their negotiations saying they had agreed on the content of the fisheries agreement. A diplomatic source told news outlet Yabiladi Friday morning that “a joint communiqué will be released today by the EU and the Ministry in charge to confirm the decision, which includes Morocco’s southern provinces.” The two parties agreed “to maximize the benefits for local populations in the areas concerned, while respecting the principles of sustainable management of fisheries resources and equity.” Morocco and EU committed “to take the necessary measures for the entry into force of the Fisheries Agreement and its Protocol as soon as possible, taking into account their respective procedures.” The two parties agreed to “remain in close contact… during the transition period until this enters into force.” Spain’s Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food Luis Planas had said earlier Friday that the fisheries agreement between the EU and Morocco “has been settled on the basic aspects.” In an interview with Spanish Radio Nacional, Planas said European fishing boats would not be able to fish in Moroccan waters for “a few weeks or who knows if a few months.” The agreement could be ratified and entered into force as of September in the European Parliament, he said. Planas said he already gave instructions to compensate Spanish ship-owners and crew members during the time they cannot work, following the expiration of the previous EU-Morocco fisheries agreement on July 14. On February 27,  the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) excluded the Western Sahara territorial waters from the fisheries agreement. The ruling complicated the renegotiation of the deal, causing the previous deal, agreed in 2014, to expire before a new deal was reached. The expiration of the fisheries agreement forced EU ship-owners to leave Moroccan waters. Negotiations to renew the agreement started in April. The Moroccan government did not reveal the details of the fisheries agreement with the EU. Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said Thursday the government would announce the agreement immediately after signing it.

Rabat – Royal Air Maroc (RAM) is firing back at pilots who decided to strike after disagreements emerged between the two parties. The airline was forced to cancel 10 flights on Friday, June 20.  The cancelled flights include flights to Paris Charles De Gaulle, Toulouse, Milan, Marseille, and Bologna. Flights to Barcelona, Casablanca, Nouakchott, and Cairo could also be at risk of disruption, said the RAM in a statement.  “The company fears the consequences in this period of high traffic, marked by the return of Moroccans from the diaspora, while Hajj [pilgrimage to Mecca] is approaching,” an RAM official said to AFP. The airline recommended customers postpone their trips before August 15, 2018, at no additional cost, or to obtain a refund of the airline ticket if their flight was cancelled. The Moroccan Airline Pilots Association has refuted the term “strike” used by management, but urged the pilots in the association on Wednesday to apply certain “resolutions,” with less “flexibility” on working hours.  The airline pilots are calling for the improvement of working conditions and a reevaluation of salaries. The National Federation of Air Transport, affiliated with the Moroccan Union of Labor (UMT), the largest union in the country, called on both parties Thursday to begin “a constructive dialogue.”

Rabat – Every summer, Morocco welcomes home many Moroccan expats living overseas. The latest statistics by the Ministry in Charge of Moroccans Living Abroad and Migration Affairs only confirms this. According to Minister Delegate in Charge of Moroccans Living Abroad Abdelkarim Benatiq, 961,000 Moroccan expats returned to Morocco on July 17 alone. However, the number returning may actually peak in the last two weeks of July before Eid Al Adha, the “Festival of Sacrifice,” the second of two Islamic holidays celebrated worldwide annually. The minister gave the official statistics on Thursday during the Government Council. Benatiq said that the sea route remains the most popular route for Moroccans returning home. Forty-four percent of Moroccan expats came by ferry, of which 65 percent come through the Tangier Med port. Forty-one percent of returning Moroccans came by air. Casablanca’s Mohammed V International Airport topped the list of points of entry by air as it received 30 percent of air passengers, followed by the Marrakech-Menara airport with 16 percent. Passengers travelling by bus use the Melilla border at Beni-Ansar (30 percent of traffic) and the Ceuta border (62 percent). Benatiq commended the “efficient” cooperation by all operators at the national level through the National Transit Commission and coordination with the Spanish authorities in the framework of the joint commission. The cooperation aims to ensure the safety of the 5.3 million people who make the round trip, the government spokesperson said in a press briefing. Benatiq also said that Morocco is mobilizing staff to receive Moroccans residing abroad. The minister said that 20 rest areas were built on highways across Morocco. Benatiq also mentioned that the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity mobilized 315 medical professionals, 782 social workers, and 126 volunteers to offer services to Moroccan expats. Members of the government saluted the efforts, saying that the will of Moroccans living abroad to help develop their country calls for intensifying the national efforts to support their needs and respond to their expectations, according to El Khalfi. On June 5, Morocco launched the “Marhaba 2018” operation to welcome home for the summer Moroccans living abroad. The operation will continue until September 15. During the Government Council, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani welcomed Moroccan expatriates, wishing them a nice holiday. A recent report from the foreign exchange regulator reported an increase of 8.5 percent in remittances from Moroccan expats in the first six months of 2018 against 0.2 percent in the same period of 2017.

Rabat – Kuwaiti social media celebrity and makeup artist Sondos Al Qattan has been criticized for a statement in which she slammed reforms granting domestic workers a day off and other rights to protect them from labor abuses. Criticizing the Kuwaiti reforms, Al Qattan shared a video with her followers explaining why domestic workers should not get a day off or be allowed to keep their passports with them. “But, how can you have a ‘servant’ in your house who gets to keep their passport with them. If they ran away and went back to their country who will refund them? And what is worse is that they have one day off every week,” she said. Al Qattan added: “Honestly, with this new contract, I just wouldn’t get a Filipino maid. She’d only work six days a week and get four days off a month.” ????? / ???????? ??? ??????? ??????? ???? ??????? ???????? ??«???????»: ??? ??? ??? ????? ?? ?? ?????!? pic.twitter.com/tIRfDQHVb5 — ?????? (@Almajlliss) July 14, 2018  The now-infamous celebrity angered her social media followers and received wide backlash and negative comments for her remarks. “It is only natural that she would keep her passport and a day off in a week. This is the least she can ask for. Her job is to be a domestic helper not a slave!!” wrote a Twitter user.  “A day off is the minimum. She is a human being not a machine,” wrote another.  Recently, the Kuwaiti cabinet made provisions for the rights of domestic workers under the “kafala,” or sponsorship system, to for domestic workers from the Philippines. In the sponsorship system, employers pay for domestic workers’ travel and visas, while employees agree to work for a period of time, a type of indentured servitude ripe for abuse. In February, Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte criticized Kuwaiti employers’ alleged harsh treatment of domestic workers from his country, and asked them to fly back home. The reforms implemented by the Kuwaiti cabinet came after the Philippines and the Gulf state signed an agreement to regulate domestic workers. According to the law, employers should provide workers with food, clothing, health insurance, and housing, and should not confiscate the worker’s passport. The Gulf area is notorious for cases of violence against domestic workers; several videos depicting such violence have been posted on social media. In April, Kuwaiti authorities sentenced a married couple to death for the murder of a Filipina worker.

Rabat- During a Government Council meeting, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani reviewed the “Ikram 2” 2017-2021 plan for combating violence against women and ensuring equality between men and women on economic, social, and political levels.   El Othmani enhanced the importance of the government’s equality initiative, “Ikram,” calling for all concerned entities to accelerate its application, stressing that it is not only the government’s plan, but a plan that concerns the Moroccan nation as a whole. The head of government also recalled that the Ikram 2 initiative strives to see women as decision-makers, abiding by the 2011 constitution’s instructions stressing on equality between genders and integration of women in different fields. El Othmani invited everyone to be vigilant towards “caring for women in all parts of their lives, especially for [their] education, health, and social integration.” The meeting was devoted to passing the final text of the Ikram 2 plan which follows the “Ikram 1” 2012-2016 plan. The Ikram 1 plan was dedicated to monitoring the National Observatory on Violence against Women, a national campaign against domestic violence, in addition to the National Observatory for Improvement of Women’s Image in the Moroccan media. Despite the government’s efforts to improve women’s situation in society, such as enacting a new law against harassment, gender-based discrimination, and violence, there is yet more action to be done.  According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the African Union’s Department of Economic Affairs,  Morocco’s commendable socio-political reforms are still tainted by “alarming social inequalities” which include gender inequality. “Bosting female entrepreneurship, investing in innovative start-ups, and ensuring linkages between formal training and labor market’s demands,” is what OECD considers the first step needed to promote equality in the kingdom.

Rabat – The British Council Morocco hosted 20 English teachers today, each of whom represented a Moroccan school that won the 2018-2020 International School Award (ISA). ISA rewards schools “having an outstanding level of support for nurturing global citizenship in young people and enriching, teaching, and learning,” according to a statement from the British Council obtained by Morocco World News. Mohamed Hassim, a trainer at ISA with British Council Morocco and a teacher supervisor at the Taroudant directorate, told MWN that ISA “started in Morocco in 2009 and this is the third generation that we have of the International School Award winners.” Hassim noted that this year marked Morocco’s largest number of winners. “We have twenty schools from nine academies and thirteen directorates,” he added. According to Hassim, the event is a very important project for schools because they “get involved in international partnerships.” It is also good for students as teachers use English in a very realistic context. It is not the context that it only includes exercises and textbooks and so on, but this is an open context where they use English for realistic purpose and to open up to other cultures,” Hassim said. MWN also interviewed teachers from the schools that won ISA. Larbi Arbaoui, a middle school teacher in Taroudant directorate, told MWN “The international school award is a prestigious award that crowns dedication, collaborative work, and efforts made throughout the whole school year.” “It is an excellent experience that personally gave me a golden chance to develop professionally and enlarge my network,” Arbaoui added. Nazha El Youssfi, a teacher from Fez, said that ISA will help her develop teaching methods. She added that the award will also provide the students with self-confidence, self-esteem, and help them become global citizens.  Mohamed El Ghazi, a high school teacher from Zagoura, said that winning “was really great, because it offers you to work with national and international partners and to share several international activities, including citizenship, human right, leadership.” Aziz Asoubai, a teacher from Guelmim, said he joined ISA because he wants to get the students “out of the classroom … and  boredom and to make them learn and get new friends from across the world.” John Mitchell, country director of British Council, said, “The International School Award is a prestigious badge of honor for schools that can bring an international dimension to teaching and learning.”  At least 70 high schools from nine regions of Morocco applied to the ISA.

Rabat – Authorities at Tangier-Med port arrested a Moroccan man who resides in France today for carrying dangerous weapons abroad in a caravan pulled by his car. The search operation was conducted by a unit within the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) equipped by dogs trained especially for this kind of operations. The 31-year-old suspect, who also holds French nationality, had hidden a rifle and a large amount of ammunition in the caravan. Authorities also seized a cutlass and a military uniform. Every summer, many Moroccans who live overseas come back to spend holidays with their family via ferry into Tangier-Med, Tanger ville, and Nador. Of the 531,146 Moroccans living abroad who returned to Morocco for the 2018 summer, 60 percent came by airplane while 40 percent came by sea and roads.

Rabat – Henda Ayari’s version of events has been questioned after new evidence has emerged in Tariq Ramadan’s rape case. In October, Ayari, an author and former Salafi, had accused the prominent public intellectual of raping her. After Ayari’s accusation, four other women came forward alleging Ramadan raped them. The Islamic scholar was indicted in February for rape, including that of a “vulnerable person,” before being remanded in custody. On Thursday, July 19, Henda Ayari and Tariq Ramadan came face to face for the first time in the office of the three Parisian investigating judges in charge of Ramadan’s case. Despite confessing to having had five extramarital affairs, Ramadan has always denied the rape accusations. According to French outlet Le Point, the magistrates have several elements collected by Paris investigators which contradict the statements Henda Ayari made about the day she claimed to have been raped.  A few months ago, Ayari took to her Facebook page to tell the story of her rape, recounting that in 2012, on the sidelines of a congress of the Union of Islamic Organizations of France (UOIF), Ramadan invited her to join him in a hotel room and raped her. “I have been silent for several years for fear that he might take vengeance,” she said, explaining that he had threatened to “take it to my children. I was afraid and I kept silent all this time.” To verify her statements, the judicial police has proceeded, on July 9 to the hearing of her younger brother who according to the outlet no longer has relations with his sister.  Ayari’s brother asserted that on May 26, 2012, which is the date that Ayari said she was raped on, she was at his wedding. “It took place in Petit-Couronne, 7 or 8 kilometers from Rouen…. The party began around 6 or 7. I remember that my sister was here that night. She was with her three children. I can’t tell you what time she left…. In my memories, she was present and smiling. It seems to me that we see it on a video of the marriage which is engraved on a DVD. “ Following this statement, the investigators found two photographs of Henda Ayari at the wedding.  The same police officers also received confirmation at the civil status office of the town hall of Rouen that Ayari’s brother was married on May 26, 2012. Le Point noted that “the brother also assures that his sister was finally present at this ceremony from 20 hours to 3 o’clock in the morning and was installed at the table of friends of the bride.” Will this new evidence lead the judges to reconsider Tariq Ramadan’s indictment? To be continued….

Rabat – Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Boussaid announced, on Thursday in Rabat, that Morocco’s economy output growth forecasts were revised upwards from 3.2 to 3.6 percent for 2018 due to the good performance of non-agricultural sectors and a good crop year exceeding 10 million tons. Boussaid, who gave a presentation at the Thursday government council on the results of the 2018 appropriation bill and the prospects for the 2019 appropriation bill, reviewed the main economic indicators that showed a continuous improvement in the global economic growth outlook. Similarly, BMI Research predicted a rate of GDP growth at 3.5 percent in Morocco in 2018. However, this improvement is still threatened by protectionist conflicts, monetary austerity policies, and the volatility of oil prices, he added. At the national level, Boussaid underlined notable acceleration in the growth of non-agricultural activities, due to the good performance of all sectors, with the exception of civil engineering. The fisheries and phosphates sectors recorded an increase of 5.7 percent and 6.4 percent in the first half of 2018, he said. Tourism numbers increased by 11.8 percent, and overnight stays increased by 10.7 percent at the end of April 2018. Bank loans increased slightly by MAD 2.4 billion in the five month period, while inflation stood at 2.4 percent, he said.

Rabat – Morocco’s Goalkeeper Munir El Kajoui Mohamedi has officially signed a 4-year contract with FC Malaga.  After spending four years with Numancia CD where he sat on the bench, the Atlas Lion will play alongside two other Moroccan football players, Youssef En-Nesyri who just signed for 3 seasons and Badr Boulahroud, who has been with the club since 2015.  Muy feliz e ilusionado por este nuevo reto y formar parte de este gran club ,gracias por todos los mensajes! ???? ???? ?????? ?????? ? ???????? ???? ?????? ??????????? ??? ???????! pic.twitter.com/c33bNDg28f — Munir Mohamedi (@Munir_Mohand) July 19, 2018  “Goalkeeper Munir El Kajoui signed for FC Malaga after the end of his contract with Numancia CD. It will be presented Friday at the stadium of La Rosaleda,” wrote the Spanish club on social media yesterday.  The Atlas Lions was indeed presented to the rest of the team Friday morning. FC Malaga live-streamed his first steps with his new jersey.  As for his career with the Moroccan team, the Spanish-Moroccan football player was the only goalkeeper to not concede a single goal during the six qualification games preceding the World Cup.  Despite Morocco’s elimination in the first round of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, El Kajaoui has proven to be a valuable goalkeeper for Hervé Renard, who will probably appeal to him for the 2019 African cup (CAN).  Born in Melilla to parents from Nador, the 29-year-old footballer began his training career in 2010 with Goyu Ryu, followed by AD Ceuta and then Almeria. His transfer to Numancia in 2014 allowed him to join the national team in 2015, during a friendly game against Uruguay in Agadir (0-1).  French coach Hervé Renard will count on him in many games with the selection.

Rabat- Morocco’s GDP growth will moderately slow in 2018 and 2019, however tourism revenues will continue to support the economy, forecasts the research group BMI in its latest economic outlook report. BMI, a research firm that provides macroeconomic, industry and financial market analysis, is positive that the tourism sector will remain the tailwind for Morocco’s economic growth. Although GDP growth will slow compared with the high rate it recorded in 2017, the firm is optimistic about GDP’s regional average, thanks to the key growth drivers, tourism and the manufacturing industries’ aeronautical and automotive benefiting from foreign investment. Tourism generated revenues totaling MAD 70 billion last year.   The number of overseas visitors entering the border reached 11.35 million,  a 10 percent increase from 2016, representing an increase of more than 1 million tourists.  Tourist numbers increased from Morocco’s main EU markets, such as Germany (up 15 percent), the Netherlands and Italy (up 9 percent), France and Spain (up 8 percent), as well as the United States, which experienced a significant increase of 29 percent. Furthermore, figures from other markets show very encouraging signs: 39 percent increase from Japan and a 38 percent increase from Brazil. According to the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council, the sector’s growth will have a positive impact on both domestic consumption and exports, resulting in major growth.  Morocco’s Tourism Observatory recently reported that a total of 4.1 million tourists visited the kingdom between January and May 2018. The number of annual foreign tourist arrivals increased by 15 percent from 2017. Tourism is highly dependent on European demand, especially France and Spain as the two countries accounted for 49.0 percent of visitors in Morocco in the first four months of 2018. As for Morocco’s GDP growth, it will remain above the regional average as it is expected to be at 3.5 percent in 2018 and 3.3 percent in 2019, falling short of the 4.1 percent it grew in 2017. The research firm asserted “agricultural output expansion rates underpin the view for real GDP growth to slow in 2018.” In 2017, agriculture accounted for 12.8 percent of real GDP, owing to its fruitful activity. According to the survey, fluctuations in the country’s agricultural activity hinder its economic growth and the Moroccan economy will remain very vulnerable to shifts in agricultural output as the country’s farms are still reliant on rainfall.  Therefore, naturally, bountiful rains significantly boost yields and economic output.  The manufacturing sector will outperform past records in the coming quarters due to the booming activities of the automotive and aeronautic industry in addition to phosphates processing. However, the sector’s momentum will slow in 2019 on the back of weaker demand from key export markets. On the other hand, vehicle production is expected to grow by an annual average of 17.4 percent over the quarters of 2018 and 2019.  The report explains: “These investment flows are underpinned by the government’s extensive support and incentive programmes, and an increasingly favourable investment climate.”  Furthermore, 46.6 of Morocco’s exports go to Spain and France. Exports of goods and services will grow slowly from 2019 onwards, “softening headline growth.”

Rabat – The Chamber of Advisers’ report has negatively reviewed the Moroccan National Office of Tourism (ONMT).  The commission of inquiry into the Moroccan ONMT, set up by the Chamber of Advisers,  was presented to a plenary session held by the House of Councilors on Tuesday. The criticism started with the financial management of the board. The report indicates that the organization of trade fairs abroad is becoming increasingly expensive. The inquiry deemed other expenses absolutely “unjustified.” One such expense is the monthly rent of the office of the director general: MAD 50,000. In fact, MAD 10 million is spent each year to rent offices for official delegations traveling abroad. The report indicates that the ONMT’s delegations abroad have only 2-3 staff members.  Besides the financial issues, the commission was also not satisfied with ONMT’s human resources and administrative management..  The commission called for the modernization of the ONMT’s governance system through a monitoring mechanism strategy for control.  The committee stressed the need to review the law governing the ONMT, in order to bring the changes to the market for tourism and competition in the sector. The committee recommended updating the board of directors to ensure its effectiveness and a better representation of professionals.  The committee also recommended streamlining the office’s subsidy and advertising expenditure through continuous monitoring. The committee suggested that public institutions and private tourism institutions be brought together in a single body, in order to generalize advertising for the institutions responsible for promoting Morocco’s image. The committee also suggested a detailed practical guide for ONMT delegations abroad and a manual of procedures to make financial management transparent. The report concluded with that ONMT’s problems, financial and administrative management and governance, have affected its profitability.

By Salihah Evans Rabat – You can spend hours searching the web for everything you think you need to know without being able to gain a real since of preparedness. If you are headed to Morocco to study abroad, read on for a carefully crafted list of personal observations coupled and helpful tips that might prove useful while visiting the beautiful country of Morocco! (If you missed Part 1 with the first seven, read it here.) International phone plans can be expensive and roaming charges will quickly drive up the cost of your monthly phone bill. Luckily, getting a phone plan in Morocco is extremely affordable and involves following simple steps to complete the process. The most cost efficient option is to bring a smartphone with you and get a data plan in Morocco. You can purchase a Moroccan SIM card for around MAD 20 and get 2 gigabytes of data for MAD 70. With a smartphone, you can use calling as well as instant messaging apps to communicate with friends and family at home. Insider tip: Be sure to get your phone unlocked by your phone company before you leave so that it is ready to use with a Moroccan SIM card in when you arrive. The first few days of navigating Rabat were a bit daunting for me. To the untrained eye, it might seem like there are a hundred small alleyways, each indistinguishable from one another. It can be very easy to get lost and I noticed few street signs in;however, I learned that most people rely on landmarks to describe the physical location of a building or establishment. Funnily enough, the tendency to rely on landmarks means that if you ask someone for directions using a street name, it’s possible that will have no idea what you are talking about. It will be helpful to learn some directional phrases in Darija so that you can better communicate with taxi drivers and those you turn to for help when you get lost. Insider Tip: Take pictures to use as a point of reference in case you have trouble making your way back home during your first few days. Also, download the offline versions of navigation apps or carry around a paper map. Food is one of the most exciting parts of Moroccan culture. If you eat with a traditional family, it’s likely that you will find that the dining experience differs from what you are accustomed to. Of course, it is universally important to clean your hands before every meal. In Morocco, meals are traditionally eaten communally from a large circular dish in the center of the table. Examples of famous Moroccan dishes are harira and couscous, the latter of which is served every Friday. Something else that might different from what you are used to is the occasional use of bread in the place of silverware. Don’t be afraid to eat with your hands and use the bread to pick up the food from the dish. Traditionally, you should eat with only your right hand, using the thumb and first two fingers. Proper Moroccan etiquette maintains that you should only eat from the “triangle” directly in front of you. To remain polite, you should never reach over to the other side of the dish. Moroccans are incredibly hospitable and will almost always offer you more food on top of the generous portions that you were originally given. If you are find yourself absolutely stuffed, you can use this phrase to decline the next heaping serving: “Safi, safi. Ana shbe’t hamdoulah. Choukran bzzaf.” Get ready to try some amazing new food in Morocco! Insider tip: You might find that dinner time in Morocco is later than what you are used to. Some families will eat dinner anywhere from 9 PM-11 PM, but sometimes even a little later. Be sure to visit the nearest hanut(similar to a convenience store) to buy little snacks to hold you over until your next meal. Though rare in public facilities, you may occasionally come across Old-fashioned toilets (toilet Baldiya) in Morocco. You may even have one in your homestay, so don’t be alarmed! In fact, they are common in many countries and you are very likely to come across one again if you aspire to travel to Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. If you have never seen one before, all you need to know is that your feet are to be placed on the textured tiles on either side of the platform. It may take a couple tries before you find what works for you in terms of comfort. And it is also important to note that you will not find toilet paper with toilets. Instead, there will be a bucket of water placed to the side for washing. Moroccans always use their left hand to wash themselves. If you are not comfortable with this, always carry around personal toilet paper. Consider buying the little packs of tissues that people will try to seel you as you walk along the street. They will definitely come in handy. It is also helpful to carry around hand sanitizer! Insider tip: Try to avoid using your left hand to eat or shake hands, since it’s considered hshuma(shameful). You should research other cultural taboos so you can do your best to avoid any hshuma acts! For women, street harassment will unfortunately quickly become a daily part of your life in Morocco. Street harassment can vary in nature, ranging from stares and compliments to more aggressive behavior such as insults and following. It is best to travel in groups at night, when street harassment can be more aggressive in nature. This is generally good travel advice for any students or tourists, as it is important for everyone to be educated about personal measures that can be taken to stay safe. Insider Tip: One of the easiest ways to respond to street harassment is to simply ignore the harassers, avoid eye contact, and continue walking. For those coming from the United States, our understanding of race relations is different from the conceptualization of race that exists in Morocco. Although Morocco is an historically heterogeneous country that receives millions of visits from tourists and students each year, racism is a global phenomenon and that makes Morocco no exception. There are many online accounts written by students of color who have described experiencing racism during their time in Morocco. Racism can manifest in many ways, including gendered microaggressions and instances of racial slurs being hurled on the street. Xenophobia is also an issue in Morocco, and people with darker complexions may sometimes be on the receiving end of slurs because they are likened to the sub-Saharan migrants and immigrants. Insider Tip: Read up on the experiences of students of color who have studied abroad in and/or visited Morocco to get a better understanding of how they reflect upon their time. Self-care is of the utmost importance, so make sure that you have a support system to turn to as well as outlets to de-stress. Morocco is an extremely diverse country, and each city has a particular aesthetic and vibe. You would be doing yourself a major disservice if you were to remain in one city for the duration of your stay. Plan weekend trips to explore the variety of activities available to you in Morocco. Do you like skiing, hiking, or surfing? Or do you prefer gentler activities like sightseeing and shopping? While there are an abundance of tourist attractions in popular cities like Marrakech and Fez, lesser traveled cities like Tiznit and Azrou also hold many hidden treasures. Don’t be afraid to maximize your time. You can even plan a weekend trip to another country! For many people, Morocco is a gateway to Europe or other locales in Africa. Spain, Italy, France, and Portugal are all countries a short plane or ferry ride away from Morocco. If you can plan in advance, you can find cheap tickets to spend a weekend in another country! Insider tip: The best form of transportation for quick weekend trips is the train or bus. It can be very difficult to find American brand toiletries that you may be used to if you are coming from the US, especially with regard to feminine products like tampons. If you do find them, they could be more expensive than you might expect. Perhaps it would be easier and more cost effective to bring enough toiletries to last you until you leave. You can find most things in the hanut or medina, but large stores like Marjane and Carrefour often carry additional brands or products that you might be more familiar with. Insider tip: In continuing the theme of exploration, be sure that you branch out if you feel comfortable doing so with other types of toiletries. You just might find your new favorite!

By Francesca Ractliffe Rabat- The United States and Morocco share a robust political alliance that is mutually beneficial to the powers of both countries. US-Morocco diplomatic relations formally began in 1787 when the United States Senate ratified the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the two nations. Ever since, Morocco has been a valuable partner of the US, as the Kingdom of Morocco is the most reliable power in the North African region. Morocco provides a strategic military and economic foothold for the US in the region. In exchange for geographical and intelligence access, Morocco wins diplomatic influence and preferential treatment from the United States. The attacks of 9/11 woke the United States up from its content position as the leading country in the world with the leading ideology. Liberalism was thought to be the championing ideology. The 9/11 Commission Report concluded that the threat to the United States is not in retaliation for its military involvement abroad, but rather it is due to conflicting ideology. The US was not facing a war on terror, but a war of beliefs.  The Commission’s report posits that America must fight on two fronts. First, the US must use military, financial, and diplomatic means to fight external threats. But the bigger fight is with a hostile belief system that cannot be reasoned with but can only be ”destroyed or utterly isolated.’’ Since 9/11 the United States has shifted its focus to managing the perceived threats of extremist ideology. The Kingdom of Morocco has been a central focus of the US’s updated foreign policy. Forging strong ties with the Kingdom of Morocco and connecting the two countries through economic deals, such as NAFTA, assures military and intelligence cooperation between the two nations. Indeed, the US provides assistance to the Moroccan government to enhance the capacity of the kingdom to prevent acts of terrorism and threats to stability. In August of 2014 the U.S.-Morocco Framework for Cooperation on Training for Civilian Security Service was signed. The US works with and funds diverse Moroccan law enforcement and investigative agencies to minimize perceived threats emanating from south of the kingdom as well as from countries which the US finds untrustworthy, such as Libya. The US’s active involvement with Morocco in fighting extremism is only motivated by the US wanting to ensure its own national security. Therefore in recent years, under King Mohammed VI, the kingdom has increased its focus on counter-terrorism. In June the Moroccan government announced their decision not to repatriate the Moroccan widows of ISIS fighters. Also in June, a counter-terrorism summit focused on tackling the threat of  ‘homegrown terrorism” was hosted in Rabat with members of the US government in attendance.  Morocco is the recipient of generous grants from USAID that helps the kingdom fund education, which is part of the US’s strategy for combating hostile extremist ideology. Morocco also benefits from US government loans that guarantee “programs for the purchase of military material.” In 2013 Morocco received $2.7 billion worth of military equipment, making the US its primary provider, over French weapon companies.  The Morocco-US relationship benefits both countries. The US has a key ally in the tumultuous regions of North Africa, and Morocco receives funds and connections to advance the prosperity of the kingdom. However, neither Morocco nor the wider the world, should be naive that US funding, which is expected to be $15.9 million by 2019, is given not just in the interest of maintaining peace and security, democracy, human rights, economic development, education, and social services, but is an active strategy for advancing the American agenda of a liberal ideology that assures the authority and safety of the United States.

New York – Just as Morocco and Tunisia are looking to expand bilateral ties and increase cooperation on regional and international issues (including possibly revitalizing the African Maghreb Union), Iran is attempting to destabilize North Africa. The Islamic Republic’s strategy is to infiltrate each country ideally in cooperation with Sunni extremist movements.  It may also be considering replicating its strategy in West Africa in converting disaffected individuals in poor, marginalized communities in various African countries to Shi’a Islam and offering humanitarian aid in individual cities that the central governments may not be able to reach. Iran is seeking additional partners and customers to offset their lost revenue resulting from sanctions that are about to be reimposed by the United States that may also cause European investors to flee for fear of being affected. Iran’s Strategy in Africa Tehran is also trying to gain control of strategic waterways along the African coasts, recruit loyal proxies, and cause problems for the West by eliminating traditional Western allies. Africa has also been an effective place for Iran to buy and sell illicit arms, and now, may increasingly be used to further Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Just as important as the pursuit of its geopolitical agenda, Iran views Africa as a coveted front against Saudi Arabia. They could use corrupt and weak local governments and appoint militias to cause more difficulties for their regional rival. The evidence of an Iranian presence and their cooperation with Tunisia is largely circumstantial, but is growing. It was part of the agenda of Iran’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mohammad Javad Zarif, during his 2017 visit to certain African countries that the Islamic Republic was recruiting.  The theme of his two-day visit was that there is no limit to the expansion of Iranian support. How Iran is Arming Tunisia Tunisia recently allowed two Iranian agents to enter Libya through its territory to purchase uranium, presumably for the sake of advancing its allegedly suspended nuclear research in light of U.S. withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action, known more commonly as the Iran nuclear deal.  Iran has taken steps to purchase additional uranium and to increase its capacity for enriching uranium as a warning of the potential consequences withdrawal of the United States from JCPOA. The two agents were subsequently assassinated under mysterious circumstances. Soon after, the Tunisian clergy issued a statement condemning Saudi Arabia for their alleged misuse of money earned from the Hajj to sponsor their war efforts in Yemen. Iran has been shown by the UN to be behind the distribution of sophisticated missiles to Yemeni Houthi rebels. Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and other Middle Eastern countries are part of the Arab Coalition that is countering the Iran-backed Houthi movement, which has been largely radicalized as a result of the training from the Lebanese Shia political group, Hizbullah. Hizbullah has also threatened Morocco’s territorial integrity by supplying the Sahrawi rebel group Polisario with arms and training, echoing Iran’s practice of outreach to separatist groups, rebel movements, and terrorists in various parts of the world. None of that is coincidental, but is rather part of a political pattern, as is the most recent meeting between an Iranian official and the Tunisian president. Indeed, the relations between the countries have grown so close that Tehran asked Tunisia to mediate in the standoff with Riyadh in late 2017. These developments came only two months after Morocco severed diplomatic relations with Iran for its role in using diplomats in Algeria and Hizbullah to arm and train Polisario. Indeed, Iran played a role in instigating anti-Gulf sentiment and using Tunisia as a pathway to Libya, where it is also backing a variety of terrorist groups that may have led to the rumored Emirates-backed soft coup attempt in Tunisia, which failed and received little attention. For the UAE, there are other reasons for concern. Tunisia’s Tensions with UAE Are Helping Iran Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates have been experiencing rising tensions since at least December 2017, when the UAE received credible security information that several female terrorists with ISIS affiliation and Tunisian passports tried to enter the UAE. The UAE banned all female passengers from Tunisia on incoming flights. Tunisia, home to several thousand foreign recruits from ISIS and other terrorist groups, retaliated by suspending flights to the UAE. That dispute was resolved, but mutual distrust remained. The UAE’s spat with Tunisia has been ongoing since the 2011 Jasmine Revolution, which the Gulf monarchies viewed as destabilizing and then blamed on Tunis. Tunisia also maintains close relations with Qatar, which likewise has been critical of the circumstances surrounding the Hajj, and contributed to the Gulf State’s dissatisfaction with Tunisia. Under former president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia had been closely affiliated with the UAE, but has since moved away to pursue a more independent foreign policy. Although Tunisia has sustained steady relations with Tehran since 1990, most recently they have grown even closer, a fact that is alarming to both Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Meanwhile, Tunisia has apparently sought out Morocco in order anchor itself to the North African region, rather than to the Middle East. Is Tehran encouraging Tunisia to liaise with Morocco? On the surface, it seems an absurd extrapolation. The neighboring countries have much to gain from sharing best practices about countering extremism, increasing trade and tourism, and strengthening cultural ties. Indeed, a united Maghreb could be a formidable defense against various adversaries. However, Tunisia may feel snubbed by the economic and trade restrictions placed on it by the European Union, which had first blacklisted the post-revolutionary government as a tax haven, and later listed it as a money-laundering hub. It is becoming increasingly obvious that North Africa is becoming a playground for competing interests. Turkey is Imitating Tehran in Maghrebi Relations Turkey’s President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, visited Tunisia in late 2017, also seeking to improve ties. Turkey’s relations with Morocco are less than cordial; not too long ago Morocco shuttered Turkish schools all over the country that were involved in the dissemination of extremist ideas against Morocco’s national interests and a tolerant school of Islam. Turkey, much like Iran, has been spreading goodwill and ideologies while looking to strengthen their defense ties all over Africa, sometimes jointly with Iran against Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and sometimes against Iran instead. Turkey may be taking the same route as Tehran—opposing Morocco by allying with adjacent and more amicable states and by exerting their influence until such a point that Morocco has no choice but to give in to Erdogan’s advances. All of this comes in light of Al Qaeda choosing Tunisia as a place to regroup. Iran was found to have given protection to Al Qaeda after the 9/11 U.S. terrorist attacks. Similarly, Turkey has been linked to various extremist and terrorist organizations and groups. Just how dedicated is the Tunisian government to eradicating extremism from its borders? That remains an open question. Libya is the Crux of the Maghreb Paradox Meanwhile, Tunisia’s  growing ties with Morocco can be viewed both as stemming from genuine self-interest in becoming less dependent on Europe and the Gulf States for trade and political support, or as an attempt to move Morocco away from a truly independent foreign policy and towards an integrated pan-Maghreb approach. This could also explain the surprising outreach of both Algeria and Tunisia for a joint bid with Morocco for the World Cup in 2030. Algeria has long been Morocco’s rival for influence in the Sahel since it has been historically close to Russia, has backed Polisario, and has even allowed Iran to use the embassy in Algiers towards facilitating contacts between Hizbullah and Polisario, which ultimately led to Morocco’s break up with Iran. Algeria is also competing for influence in Libya, a country that Iran is using to mine uranium, arm terrorists, weaken Egypt’s security, and promote arms smuggling and other criminal activities to strengthen its proxies throughout Africa. Egypt and Russia are growing closer on a number of points related to stabilization in Libya. These interests, however, can create tensions among the Gulf States. Algeria might be pursuing a joint effort in aligning Libya with Tunisia, Egypt, and possibly Russia; but will such an effort benefit Morocco? Given Algeria’s and Iran’s close relations with Tunisia, the countries are less likely to be interested in a long-term solution that will help Libya than in finding an approach that will benefit their governments, without necessarily ensuring lasting stability. Libya is Iran’s backdoor to North Africa. However, it is not the only door. Increasingly, it looks as though all but Morocco are now open to the spread of Iranian influence in the region. Morocco views Libya as a security problem, with the border chief recently reporting a noticeable increased flow of migrants from the country. Great cooperation with Algeria and Tunisia could be helpful to Morocco’s defense of territorial integrity, provided that the countries are indeed looking for a mutually beneficial solution to border incursions from migrants and roaming tribes—formerly armed by Qaddafi—as well as the proliferating jihadist groups. The crux of the issue for Rabat is the fact that many migrants from Libya cross through Morocco to get to Europe, mainly to Spain and Italy, exacerbating the refugee and migrant crisis in the EU and causing friction between the African Union and Europe. The recent proposal of the African Union that would allow rescued migrants en route to Europe to be processed through Rabat and other North African points of departure before being resettled was rejected by Morocco. On a more constructive front, a Maghreb delegation held talks in June about joint cooperation with the Libyan government. One of the concerns for Morocco is the protection of Libyan oil, which is one of chief resources for the country. In such a complex and fluid environment, any increase in cooperation is likely to be viewed as a net positive. Tunisia is an Opportunity for Morocco, But Could Also Be a Threat Rabat should view the recent Tunisian overtures with some trepidation, while still agreeing on practical small steps that will not significantly alter the country’s foreign policy or national interests. While from the Tunisian perspective there is much to be gained from increasing cooperation with Morocco, Rabat’s independent stand and a recent break from Iran could be problems for its own interests, particularly if Tunisia’s amicable relationship with Iran continues to grow. Iran cannot directly sway Rabat’s policies. However, it can utilize semi-friendly and neighboring countries to start shifting Rabat’s priorities in a way that will benefit the Islamic Republic’s regime and geopolitical ambitions. For instance, joint cooperation with the two other Maghreb states backed by Iran, Tunisia, and Algeria, the latter having been a major problem for Morocco up to this point, could soften its vigilance with regards to other matters. It can also be used to strengthen Iran’s anti-Saudi and anti-UAE positions throughout the Maghreb. No doubt, the regime is seeking to capitalize on the recent tensions between Morocco and Saudi Arabia, which came in the wake of Morocco’s fallout with Iran. How Iran Seeks to Exploit Morocco’s Tensions with Saudi Arabia and UAE The events leading up to the announcement of the winner of the 2026 World Cup bid were fraught with drama related to Saudi Arabia’s backing of the United 2026 bid and what the popular opinion as well as the government of Morocco perceived as an undue geopolitical pressure on Morocco. As a result, Morocco and Saudi Arabia are experiencing public tensions which raise disturbing questions about the future of the Arab Coalition, and business and cultural ties between the two countries. The recent spat resulted from Saudi Arabia’s support for the United 2026 World Cup bid, which included open lobbying of Arab and Muslim countries to vote for the United States and against Morocco. A number of these countries would have normally sided with Morocco. Furthermore, the Saudi officials included a political element to that end, pressuring Morocco to cut its relationship with Qatar and increase its support of the Arab Coalition in Yemen. Morocco, insulted by what it perceived as a treacherous move and blatant interference with its national sovereignty, bowed out of an Arab Coalition meeting on Yemen, with some even pushing for a complete withdrawal and an overall reevaluation and downgrade in relations with Saudi Arabia. Morocco, however, has not yet taken any serious steps. Closer relations with other Maghreb countries may be seen as a challenge to Morocco’s relations with the Gulf States, particularly since these countries ultimately supported Morocco’s World Cup bid, despite other political issues and concerns. Sports, in this instance, are merely expressing ongoing geopolitical considerations. Morocco is seeking to redefine itself as an African, rather than a Middle Eastern, country, in order to shift away from seemingly irrelevant Middle Eastern disputes and concerns and towards a greater integration into the African Union. If the Gulf States succeeded, Morocco’s positioning as a leader in Africa could have been helpful to the pursuit of joint interests in countering Iran’s and Turkey’s influences, as well as the malicious spread of violent jihadist groups ranging from ISIS and Al Qaeda to Boko Haram, Al Shabaab, and Hizbullah. Morocco Should Be in Control of Its Relationships and Alliances If the spat is not resolved, pro-Iranian interests in separating Morocco from the Gulf States, infiltrating friendly proxies, and surrounding Morocco can have the opposite effect and could enable Iranian agents in Morocco and beyond. Tunisian overtures could be an important opportunity for Morocco, but could also be a threat. Rabat should continue to pursue a truly independent course of action, and, rather than acting on impulse in reaction to foolish statements from Saudi and UAE officials, should consider a long-term strategy in fostering better relations with continuous allies, building up cooperation with Tunisia and other North African countries against common threats, and staying vigilant against Iran’s threat of destabilizing the Maghreb and isolating Morocco from its Sunni allies in Africa and the Middle East. Algeria’s and Tunisia’s offering could end up being nothing more than a ploy from Iran, sent to weaponize Morocco against Iran’s adversaries in the region, Saudi Arabia and UAE,  by using carrots as an incentive to turn away from the Middle Eastern sticks in the form of Saudi pressure to cut ties with Qatar and increase forces in Yemen. Saudi Arabia and the UAE, however, should also learn from this development. Morocco is far from isolated; its diplomatic outreach to various African countries is flourishing and its position as a rising power in Africa is solidifying. It is a vital player in African affairs and if these states wish to avoid the influence of Iran, the Muslim Brotherhood, and other threats, they need to take steps to repair their relationship with Morocco before they are excluded from its success and left with nothing but regrets.

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat – Chefchaouen (or simply “Chaouen”) is a city located in the Rif Mountains of northwest Morocco. Its buildings appear to be washed in various shades of blue—hence Chaouen’s endearing nickname, “the Blue Pearl” of Morocco.  The city has long been known to backpackers for its surreal hiking spots and easy accessibility to hashish (cannabis), which prospers in the dry mountain climate. The city’s relaxing and secluded atmosphere has attracted many tourists seeking to escape their rushed city lives.  The origin of the city’s blue color is debated—some maintain the buildings were painted blue to ward off bugs, while others say a Jewish population changed the color of the buildings from white to blue in the 1930s. Blue is a symbol of spirituality and proximity to the sky and heavens.  Regardless of origin, it is safe to assume that the blue color is now maintained for both aesthetic and touristic purposes. Hike up to the Spanish Mosque. The mosque is the best place to appreciate a panoramic view of Chaouen without having to hike very far (about 10 minutes from the start of the trail). The best times to visit are at sunrise and at sunset, when the city is set aglow by the angles of the sun. Shopping in the medina (old town). Different regions of Morocco specialize in different goods. If you are planning to shop in Chaouen, take a look at the wool items (carpets, blankets, and clothing). Additionally, there are two popular argan oil shops in the area which sell merchandise ranging from perfumes to shampoos and body oils. Signs are out to help guide tourists to the locations. Check out Pizzeria Mandala and Restaurant Assaada. Pizzeria Mandala is an authentic Italian restaurant and one of the most highly rated restaurants in the area. It is very small and quite popular, so go a bit early for either lunch or dinner. Restaurant Assaada offers a wide variety of Moroccan cuisine and is also one of the most highly acclaimed eateries.  Explore the old medina. In addition to shops, the old medina contains some very scenic spots that are popular for photography. Part of the fun is hunting for new blue doors, staircases, and walls in different corners of the medina. Hike up to the Akchour Waterfalls. For those more athletically inclined, the hike up from Chaouen to see the Akchour Waterfalls is well worth the effort. It takes approximately two hours to hike up and two to come back down. Swimming in the falls is permitted. If you are looking to vacation in Chefchaouen, here are some important things to be aware of: You might be approached by hashish dealers. Possessing hashish is illegal in Morocco and can result in jail time. Additionally, the government employs undercover police in Chaouen who may approach and claim to offer hashish, but are actually trying to catch dealers. Dealers may target foreigners with offers of hashish, knowing they may not be aware of laws in Morocco.  The city is very hilly. As Chaouen is an older city located in the mountains, the majority of the streets are cobbled and unlevel. Appropriate footwear is recommended and travelers with disabilities may want to consider a more accessible destination. Spanish, French, and Arabic are all spoken, but English is less common. While some people in Chefchaouen (particularly shop owners) know a few words of English, you may have some trouble communicating if you do not know basic Arabic, French, or Spanish. Restaurants do typically provide an English version of menus.  You only need a couple of days. Unless you are looking to hike extensively around Chaouen, the major attraction is admiring the city’s unique color and shopping for local goods. Some people even experience Chaouen as a day trip.

By Johanna Higgs and Amal Ben Hadda Rabat – Marriage—what is the point of it? It is to bring two people together through love, to build an economic relationship through which families can unite, to satisfy social and cultural requirements for men and women, for women to find a means of economic sustenance, or for males to exploit females for their household labor. Throughout the world, understandings of marriage and the reasons why people marry seem to vary greatly. The requirements of marriage are often closely linked to the societal understandings of the roles of men and women within a culture. In many parts of the world, these relationships between men and women are often highly biased to favor males. As a result, the requirements of marriage, including the rights that men and women have within marriage and in divorce, frequently favor men. Such is the case in Iran. In Iran, a Shia Islamic republic, men are allowed to have multiple wives. A woman cannot divorce without permission from her husband, while men do not need to seek permission from their wives. Women need permission from their husbands to leave the country, but men do not need such permission from their wives. Relationships between men and women are strictly controlled. Men and women who are not married, or are not members of the same family, are usually forbidden to socialize with each other. The only way that men and women of different families are allowed to interact with each other is through marriage. It is also the legal way to constitute a family and to protect women’s and children’s rights. Once a woman is married, she then has the rights to a pension, housing, and inheritance from her husband. It is also through marriage that a woman can ensure the responsibility of a male for any children that come out of the relationship. Sexual relationships outside of marriage are not allowed, a rule that is enforced by the country’s moral police. They will arrest and imprison men and women when found together if they are not married or part of the same family. The situation is easing up a bit in cities such as Tehran; however, the strict rules segregating men and women continue to be enforced throughout the country. However, despite these strict moral codes surrounding sexual relationships and marriage, Iranians, and Shia communities in general, have found ways to defy the “no sex outside of marriage” laws. They do this through what they have termed “temporary marriages.” The temporary marriage is literally translated as ‘pleasure marriage’ (nikah mut’aa) and is for a limited amount of time. The couple agrees on the time period of the marriage, which in Iran is usually between three and six months. In many cases, a certain amount of money is given to the woman in exchange for the marriage. However, in some cases, men and women who are in a relationship and want to be able to live together also have a temporary marriage. They are typically carried out in mosques with the ceremony being performed by a Mullah. A piece of paper is signed in front of the Mullah and it is agreed that they are married. They are then allowed to engage in physical relations. According to Islamic oral tradition, the practice of temporary marriage is mentioned in some hadiths and is believed to have existed during the life of Muhammad, who is said to have recommended it to his companions and soldiers. Sunni scholars no longer consider it applicable and have raised concerns about the ethical implications of this type of marriage. However, Shia scholars continue to justify it as ‘a solution’ to the sexual needs of those who are not able to commit to a regular marriage. Temporary marriages have also been criticized within Iranian society. For many secular Iranians, temporary marriages are hypocritical. For example, Ali Qasemi, a young Iranian man working in the local bazar in Qom—one of Iran’s most religious cities—feels that temporary marriages are a way of disregarding Islamic law that prohibits sex outside of marriage. “People in society don’t like temporary marriages,” he explained. A university student in Tehran agrees with Qasemi: “These things are just excuses for religious men to be with other women. It doesn’t have a logical reason. I’m really against temporary marriages. If you want to be with someone just go be with them, why do you have to do these things? Why should I have to sign something just so I can touch a man? It’s really stupid. But you know these things are happening in Iran,” she said. Fatima Rezaeepour, a young English teacher living in Qom, also does not like temporary marriages. She stated: “Some boys don’t want to look for sex outside of marriage because it is against their religion, so they have a temporary marriage.” Temporary marriages also tend to favor men. A woman is expected to be a virgin until she is married. If she loses her virginity outside of marriage, then she is no longer considered fit for marriage and is therefore no longer socially valuable. Men, however, are not subject to the same ideas of shame and are therefore free to engage in temporary marriages without such stigma, whereas women cannot. Mahkan Jahandide, a Baluch woman in the city of Zahedan, believes that temporary marriages are done so that men can cheat on women. “They are just for 6 months so they can then find another woman. They just take a woman as a wife, they use her and then they will tell her to go,” she explained. Afshin Bakhshesh, a student living in the southern coastal city of Chabhar, agrees that temporary marriages tend to just suit men: “If you are a married man but if you travel alone then you’re allowed to have a temporary marriage. It is just to look after your own sexual needs. I don’t like it at all. This is so messed up. These are religious ideas and are an excuse to have sex with others,” he said. Temporary marriages are just one example of the many misogynistic religious rules that have been made by men based on their narrow selective interpretations of Islam in order to take advantage of women. They give men the right to have multiple sexual partners while stigmatizing women who do the same. They encourage moral contradictions that allow men to avoid extra-marital sex laws while not allowing women to do the same. So we must ask ourselves, what is the point of a marriage if it is just being used to benefit men? In the case of temporary marriages in Iran, the concept of marriage is being used as a means for males to get around religious rules of not having sex outside of marriage, something in the case that all of the Iranians interviewed for this article said was the case. This raises a very important question about the real purpose of marriage, temporary or otherwise, in Iran and indeed throughout the world. We should be asking ourselves why these concepts of marriage, are so often set up to benefit men? This is something that we should all be asking ourselves and actively working towards.

By Salihah Evans  Rabat – You can spend hours searching the web for everything you need to know. If you are headed to Morocco to study abroad, look no further. Read on for a carefully crafted list of everything you need to know before studying abroad in the beautiful country of Morocco!  1 – Language The official language of Morocco is Standard Arabic, but it is not used in daily life. Instead, the majority speak Darija (Moroccan Arabic), a dialect of Arabic. French is also widely spoken. In some “touristy” cities, English is relatively easy to find. However, most cities are difficult to navigate without knowing French or Arabic. It is good to know at least a few Darija phrases before arriving in Morocco. Here are a few you will use all the time. 2 – How to dress (for women)  Morocco is an Islamic country, and 99% of the population identify as Muslim. Aligning with Islam’s emphasis on modesty, the majority of Morrocans dress conservatively. Both men and women often wear djellabas and many Moroccan women wear hijabs.  As a foreigner, you are not expected to cover your hair, but many people advise you to cover your knees and shoulders to respect the culture and avoid unwanted attention. There are some more tourist friendly cities, like Marrakech, where it is considered more acceptable to wear shorts and strapless tops. However, this is not the case for the majority of Moroccan cities.  Lightweight, long, and flowy clothing are your best bet for modest and weather-appropriate clothing. Maxi skirts and dresses, tunic shirts with leggings, boho pants, lightweight jumpsuits, and t-shirts are all ideal for Morocco.   Insider tip: You can buy traditional Moroccan clothing for affordable prices in Moroccan medinas. Kaftans, jabadors, and djellabas are sold for anywhere between MAD 50-200 in most souks. 3 – How to souk shop like a pro! Souks are the name for the markets in Morocco. Souks are a large part of Moroccan culture. Large cities, like Fez and Marrakech, have huge souks lined with hundreds of shops and great prices compared to Western stores. Get ready to shop until you drop! These tips will make make you are a pro souk shopper in no time:  Insider tip: Some souks, like the one in Marrakech, even have snake charmers, storytellers, and musicians. Even if you do not plan to shop, a souk is an experience you absolutely cannot miss.  4 – Street Food Street food is one of the most distinctive things about Morocco. Do not be afraid to try food vendors on the streets of Morocco. The street foods you absolutely cannot miss are: fresh squeezed orange juice, shawarmas, maakoudas, olives, khobz, snails, and brochettes.  Insider tip: Though it is often tempting, it is best to stray away from unusually cheap meat. Any meals containing meat that are sold for less than MAD 10 should be avoided at all costs. They are not typical meat. They can be anything ranging from cat, dog, or liver to leftover scraps from a butcher.    5 – Beware of scamming Scamming has been described as a national sport in Morocco. Some argue that Morocco has the most tourist-targeted scams in the world. As a foreigner, you are likely to encounter people trying to scam you every single day. If you do not stay alert, you will be scammed. Here are a few tips to avoid scams:  Insider Tip: People are not always what they seem. Many people will appear to be friendly and gain your trust, then demand money after helping you. Use discretion when soliciting help from strangers.  6 – Stray cats  Moroccan streets are loaded with stray cats. You cannot go anywhere without seeing a handful of cats. They will sometimes brush past your legs while you sip on a cup of tea at a table outside a cafe. Expect to become very familiar with your neighborhood cats.   Insider tip: If you are allergic to cats, be sure to bring a lot of allergy medicine!  7 – Nightlife If you are used to partying every weekend at your home university, you should expect a major lifestyle change during your time in Morocco. In some cities, nightlife in Morocco is all but nonexistent. The majority of nightlife takes place in hotel bars, restaurants, and lounges but there are a few nightclubs in major cities. Marrakech, Agadir, and Casablanca are the Moroccan cities most known for their nightlife.   Because the Qur’an forbids drinking, many Moroccans do not drink. Liquor is very expensive and can only be bought in bars, hotels, and liquor stores. Liquor stores are discrete and scattered around big cities. You cannot purchase liquor outside of a bar after 8 p.m. and drinking in public is strictly forbidden. Alcohol sales stop 10 days before Ramadan and resume 10 days after it. Insider tip: Liquor is highly stigmatized in Morocco. If you are staying with a family, it is considered very offensive to come home late and smelling of alcohol. Read Part 2 for the final eight things you should know before studying abroad in Morocco.

By Anna Schaeffer Rabat – A law passed early today, Thursday, in Israel’s parliament which establishes the nation as a principally Jewish state. The law sparked controversy over its provisions to elevate Hebrew as the official state language, recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and grant Jews self-determination within Israel. Discussed and redrafted since its introduction in 2011, the bill became Israel’s 14th Basic Law in a 62-55 vote with two abstentions. It comprises 11 provisions, including preservation of Jewish heritage and recognition of Israel as the “historic homeland of the Jewish people, who have the unique right to self-determination.” Although once considered equal to Hebrew before the law, the “nation state” bill downgrades the Arabic language to “special status” in Israel. The bill’s official name is “Israel as the Nation State of the Jewish People.” A “defining moment,” but in what way? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the “defining moment” as a fulfillment of “the founding principle of our existence.” “In the Middle East, only Israel respects [rights]. This is our country, the Jewish state. In recent years there have been those who have tried to undermine that and question the principles of our existence.” “Today we made it into law: This is the country, the language, the anthem and flag. Long live the State of Israel.”  Arab members of parliament Ahmad Tibi and Ayeda Touma-Souliman accused the prime minister of passing “an apartheid law, a racist law.” Tibi further stated that the bill’s passage represents a “death of democracy” in Israel. Multiple MPs demonstrated against the decision both during debates and after the official decision. Some members ripped up the bill with their hands while Joint List chairman Ayman Odeh lifted a black flag in protest during the debate.  “As [the 1956 massacre] in Kafr Qassem was a blatantly illegal order, with a black flag over it, so is a black flag hoisted over this evil law,” Odeh said. “Today, I will have to tell my children, along with all the children of Palestinian Arab towns in the country, that the state has declared that it does not want us here. It has… told us that we will always be second-class citizens.” Minorities in Israel Of Israel’s 9 million population, Israeli Arabs measure approximately 21 percent; most of them identify as, or stand in solidarity with, Palestinians. Another 74 percent of Israel is composed of Jews; the final 5 percent, classified as “others” include Christian and Muslim non-Arabs. Since the mid-20th century, the continued Israeli-Palestinian conflict centers on the geopolitical partitioning of a highly-contested plot of land between Egypt and Jordan. Peace processes hinge on the manner in which each body recognizes the other. For years, Netanyahu has stressed the necessity for Palestinians to consider Israel a Jewish state before any compromise between the two bodies can be reached.  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas stated in 2011 that he recognizes Israel’s right to exist and hopes that sentiment is answered by Israel “recognizing the Palestinian state on the borders of the land occupied in 1967.” In a 2014 speech, Abbas addressed the proposed nation-state law under discussion and charged that Israel, instead of working towards peace, was attempting to establish an apartheid state. A legal move in the form of a nation-state law indicates a significant event in Israeli-Palestinian relations. Accusations of apartheid law Israelis against the bill gathered Saturday to protest in Tel Aviv. Demonstrating citizens expressed discontent over the nation-state law, a sentiment shared by certain Jewish organizations in Israel and the US.  President and founder of US-based pro-Israel group J Street, Jeremy Ben-Ami, criticized the bill as “born in sin.”  “Its only purpose is to send a message to the Arab community, the LGBT community and other minorities in Israel, that they are not and never will be equal citizens.”  “Two months ago we celebrated the 70th anniversary of the Israeli Declaration of Independence, where it was written that the State of Israel ‘will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or gender.’ Today Netanyahu’s government is trying to ignore those words and the values that they represent.” Adalah Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel released a response as well. “The nation-state law is a colonial law with features of apartheid, which is prohibited by international law because it contradicts the international treaty that bans apartheid crimes. It creates various avenues for segregation in land and housing and incentives based on the principle of ‘advancing Jewish settlement’ both in civil life and in obtaining citizenship based on the law of return and in language and in cultural rights in the name of self-definition.” Expressing disappointment in the bill, the American Jewish Committee stated that the legislation “puts at risk the commitment of Israel’s founders to build a country that is both Jewish and democratic.” Bill sponsor Avi Dichter dismissed negativity as “disinformation and fake news tossed around.”  “This basic law doesn’t hurt the culture of minorities living in Israel, doesn’t hurt their sabbaticals and holidays and certainly doesn’t hurt the Arabic language, which remains a mother tongue for 1.5 million of Israel’s citizens,” Dichter said. Eugene Kontorovich, international law director for conservative think tank Kohelet Policy Forum, defended the bill as “similar to provisions in many Western democratic constitutions, which provide for an official language and national character that reflects the majority of the population.” Some segments considered too discriminatory were dropped from the bill or softened.  One clause, significantly altered four days before the vote, would have sanctioned Jewish-only communities, a provision slammed by politicians as promoting segregation. The news version of the stipulation places “national value on development of Jewish settlement” and states that the government will “act to encourage and promote its establishment and consolidation.”  As a Basic Law, the legislation now holds constitution-like status in Israel.

Rabat- Seven people convicted of murder and drug trafficking were executed on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, reported the Saudi Press Agency (SPA). Two Saudi citizens and three Chadian nationals were executed for the abduction and murder of a Pakistani security guard while they were trying to rob the warehouse he was guarding, according to SPA. Another Saudi citizen was executed for killing a man by setting him on fire. In addition, a Lebanese national was executed in Tabuk Region “for smuggling a quantity of prohibited amphetamine pills,” SPA said. Amphetamines are used along with theophylline in making psychostimulant drugs such as Captagon. It is highly addictive and became illegal in most countries in 1986. “The Ministry of Interior affirms that the Government is keen on combating narcotics warning anyone who tries to commit such actions to be punished according to Islamic Sharia,” the same source added. Saudi Arabia uses beheadings by saber for executions.  In an interview with Time Magazine, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman suggested that his country could change death sentences to life imprisonment in some cases, with the exception of murder. Human Rights Watch Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on April 25 Saudi Arabia has executed 48 people since the beginning of 2018; half of them involved drug crimes. “It’s bad enough that Saudi Arabia executes so many people, but many of them have not committed a violent crime,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at HWR. “Any plan to limit drug executions needs to include improvements to a justice system that doesn’t provide for fair trials.” HRW said that it has many cases in which defendants sentenced to death received unfair trials. In 2017, nearly 150 people were executed in Saudi Arabia.  The kingdom was reported to be one of the top executioner countries in the world, with more than 2,000 people executed between 1985 and 2016.

Rabat – The National Institute of Posts and Telecommunications (INPT) in Rabat is rebranding itself as a digitally-focused school in a new campaign for dynamic, continuous growth.  The “Go Digital by INPT” initiative seeks to meet the needs of an ever-developing, increasingly digital market. The company spent years of analysis—stakeholder interviews, internal diagnoses, and 30 workshops held worldwide—identifying the needs of Moroccan companies in light of technological and national trends.   Seven first-time programs for the coming academic year reflect the institute’s new signature goal: “Being the reference engineering school that attracts the best profiles and trains the best laureates, at the service of the development of the digital ecosystem.” Students at INPT can now study data science engineering, cyber security and digital trust engineering, advanced software engineering for digital services, smart information and communication technology engineering, cloud engineering, innovation engineering, or embedded systems engineer and digital services. Each training program, designed to be “rich in new scientific skills and soft skills,” contains between 30 and 40 students to maximize quality of training.  Focused on training, research, and expertise, the school has long graduated students in fields of telecommunications and technology. Its new vision centers on three pillars. The first pillar of Go Digital by INTP has four objectives: “to recruit the best profiles; train engineers and digital professionals in line with the needs of the market; to position itself as a regional hub for digital training and finally to facilitate the integration of young graduates into the professional world.” Secondly, INTP aims to establish itself at the heart of research and innovation in the digital entrepreneurship ecosystem, constructing partnerships at both the national and international level.  The third pillar acknowledges human capital as the key factor of a digital transformation.  By playing a role in developing the digital ecosystem and sustaining dynamic transformation, Go Digital by INPT plans to “train the leaders of tomorrow.”

Rabat – Human Rights Watch (HRW) has condemned the charges against and conviction of  Hamid El Mahdaoui, who received 3 years sentence. On June 28, a court in Casablanca gave a three year sentence to the journalist for allegedly failing to “report a security threat.” The court made its decision based on phone calls Mahdaoui received from a man who allegedly claimed that he intended to create armed conflict in Morocco. “The court did not accept Mahdaoui’s main line of defense, which was that, as a well-known journalist, he repeatedly receives calls from strangers,” reported HRW. El Mahdaoui also told the court that he thought that the caller made nonsense comments that did not need to be reported to the authorities. The phone conversations date back to May 28, 2017. Authorities used a wiretap on the phone of the person calling Mahdaoui, according to documents from the court. The defense team of Mahdaoui contested the charges, emphasizing that the court “should dismiss the case on the grounds that the wiretap was illegal as the police received the wiretap order from the prosecutor only on May 30,” according to HRW. The human rights NGO said that it had consulted the court file on the wiretap authorization and called the charges against Mahdaoui “dubious.” The Casablanca Court of Instance sentenced Mahdaoui only a few days after the Casablanca Court of Appeal sentenced 54 Hirak Rif activists to sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years. All but one of the activists and journalists, including Mahdaoui, appealed the sentences. “The charges against Hamid El Mahdaoui are presented by Moroccan authorities as about protecting national security,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. Contesting the alleged lack of freedom of speech in Morocco, Whitson said: “But in reality, they reek of an arbitrary use of the law on an outspoken journalist by authorities who have been radically reducing the space for critical reporting and commentary.” Authorities arrested Mahdaoui on July 20, 2017, in Al Hoceima, home of the 2016 and 2017 protests that followed the death of local fishmonger Mouhcine Fikri in October  2016. Morocco is expected to respond to HRW’s remarks after Thursday’s Government Council, on July 19 in Rabat.

Rabat – After five unsuccessful attempts to win the rights to organize the World Cup—1994, 1998, 2006, 2010 and recently 2026—the Kingdom is not ready to give up. According to news outlet Assabah, Morocco may go against England to host the 2030 World Cup  by joining forces with neighbors Algeria and Tunisia.  The two North African countries have both expressed their willingness to consider the possibility of bidding with Morocco to host a Maghreb World Cup in 2030. Even if FIFA’s Gianni Infantino thinks that Morocco’s joint bid is a good idea, will it be enough to beat England? According to Assabah, England may be considering a joint bid with Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. Learning from its mistakes, Morocco will hopefully develop a stronger strategy. Another trio is very much interested in welcoming the teams of the 2030 World Cup: Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. The South American countries are preparing for a joint bid to celebrate the centenary of the first World Cup held in 1930 in Uruguay.  Morocco may have to hold on tight. After disappointment by 69 votes and some betrayals, the North African country knows that it will be hard to go against a country like England, who will likely receive support  from all the powerful European countries within FIFA as well as the Commonwealth countries.  Furthermore, by bidding with its neighbors Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, England increases its chances at the bid.  According to Assabah, the spokesman for UK Prime Minister Theresa May told the Associated Press that the country has the necessary infrastructure because it has already organized several major competitions, including the Olympic Games.  Additionally, England has valuable support from a deal for mutual support with China:  the former for the 2030 bid and the latter for 2034.  On June 13, Morocco 2026 lost the World Cup bid by a margin of 69 votes, making the United bid—the North American trio of Canada, Mexico, and the US—the comfortable winner of a competition many had thought would be tight.  For Morocco 2026 officials, the stakes were much more than money and mere geopolitics. It was about shared values, cultural and geographical proximity, and the sustenance of a passion-driven sport. It was, they thought, a united league of the weak and marginalized against the strong and eternally privileged. This time, Morocco is not ready to take no for an answer even against tough candidates. The kingdom is now preparing its 2030 bid “upon royal instructions” and has a relatively clear idea about the meaning of endorsements and diplomatic clout in securing the hosting rights under FIFA’s new regulations.  Following the Morocco 2026 loss, Minister of Youth and Sports Rachid Talbi Alami announced that the country would gather its forces and fighting spirit and bid again to win the hosting rights of the 2030 FIFA World Cup. Talbi further said that Morocco will continue the 2026 projects as planned, suggesting that the construction and innovation plans will be financed and completed as explained in the Morocco 2026 project. The expectation is that pursuing the Morocco 2026 projects will make Morocco a stronger and more serious bidder by 2030. When Morocco lost the organization of the 2010 World Cup to South Africa, Driss Jettou, prime minister at the time, assured that the projects planned for that bid would be continued.  This commitment was partly fulfilled by the construction of new stadiums and the redevelopment of other sites.  Today too, the promises must be kept with the aim of making Morocco the preeminent country in terms of infrastructure in Africa.  On the other hand, FIFA is increasingly interested in the financial gains generated by the World Cup. If Morocco wants its bid to be as strong as that of heavyweight competitors like China or England, the country must start the necessary studies right now to know how to design an advantageous case for both Morocco and FIFA.

Rabat- The Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) has broken up a criminal gang counterfeiting travel and residence documents used to facilitate irregular migration. The BCIJ’s organized crime squad dismantled the gang, which operated in many Moroccan cities, as a part of its ongoing efforts to crack down on criminal networks, the BCIJ said. The statement was published Thursday morning by the state-owned MAP news agency. The BCIJ’s statement said that preliminary investigations enabled the arrest of two suspected of irregular migration at Casablanca’s Mohammed V Airport. The individuals, carrying fake residency documents, were traveling to a European country.  The operation led to 14 arrests, including a woman and an Algerian citizen. They participated in counterfeiting official and administrative documents.  They also act as intermediaries targeting young victims, the BCIJ added. According to the BCIJ, authorities seized stamps of foreign embassies, Moroccan stamps, Moroccan and foreign passports, and residency documents of foreign countries. The authorities also seized machines used in counterfeiting, money, cars, and mobile phones. The operation was based on information provided by the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST).  The BCIJ’s investigations are still ongoing, under the direct supervision of the competent public prosecutor, to arrest the rest of the members of the gang. Last year, the BCIJ dismantled many criminal gangs. On December 2017, nine gang members were arrested for criminal charges, including kidnapping and ransom. In October, the BCIJ dismantled a criminal gang suspected of kidnapping crimes targeting wealthy people.

By Anna Schaeffer Rabat – When Driss Senhaji moved from Casablanca to New York as a young adult, he carried his love for football, American “soccer,” all the way to the US. Today, his Moroccan-American daughter Ranya carries the torch onwards as the #2 best forward for her age group in the entire state of New Jersey. Sixteen years old with eight championships under her belt already, Ranya finished out the last season with 23 goals. She started playing at four years old with a dedicated, football-loving coach: her father. “Because my dad came from Morocco, he loves soccer,” she said. “I started really young, but I still train with him today, and he knows more than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s cool to have him there always teaching me and explaining what goes on in games.”  Driss has played football his whole life and continues to train with his daughter. Combination coach and cheerleader, he, along with his wife, attends every one of Ranya’s games. “When we juggle together and try to keep the ball in the air, every time I kick it to him he does this fancy stuff with his feet that always makes me laugh,” Ranya said, describing one of her favorite ways to spend time with her dad. The family visits Morocco regularly, especially Driss’ hometown in Casablanca. Ranya reflected on the beauty of the kingdom and the importance of her ethnic background, a part of her identity that includes her Arabic name. “My friend group is mostly American without different backgrounds, and it’s really special to be from somewhere else and have [a Moroccan] background.”  That identity may have something to do with her love for Moroccan football; a huge fan of both the men and women’s national teams, Ranya cheered on the Atlas Lions in the 2018 FIFA World Cup during their valiant performance. Her favorite player for the Moroccan national team, midfielder Nabil Dirar, is from Casablanca just like Driss. But Ranya’s all-time favorite footballer plays for Manchester City: Sergio Agüero. Like Agüero, Ranya has always played forward, and she loves scoring. Although her life revolves around school and football, playing the beautiful game serves as a source of joy. “My love for soccer is really, really high,” she said. “I wouldn’t be the person I am today without it.”   Although she just completed her second year of high school, Ranya is committed to play on the women’s soccer team at the University of South Carolina, the number three football university in the United States.  “I would love to play professionally, overseas, maybe,” she said. “I could even see myself playing for the Moroccan national team, but my favorite club team is Man City in England. Playing soccer in America is something that I want to pursue elsewhere.” A collection of goals scored by Ranya:  All photos and video courtesy of Driss Senhaji and Cathy Levin

Rabat- Interpol announced Friday it has deployed agents in Mediterranean seaports in eight countries, including Morocco, to apprehend suspected terrorists during the summer tourist season. Codenamed “Neptune,” the counter-terrorism operation aims to assist local authorities to identify foreign terrorists using Mediterranean maritime routes between North Africa and southern Europe. The operation also addresses threats from firearms, drugs, and human traffickers, Interpol stated. The “Neptune” operation is led by Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Spain, Italy, and France, with the support of the World Customs Organization and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (FRONTEX). According to Interpol, 4 suspected foreign terrorists and a missing person were found in the first week of the Neptune operation, after 350,000 searches were made in Interpol databases. Interpol’s Counter Terrorism Director Patrick Stevens said, “While much of the world’s focus on border security has been on air and land borders, potential security threats from the sea receive less attention.” “The issue of traveling foreign terrorist fighters is of concern to all INTERPOL member countries who continue to monitor the departure and return of their nationals to fight in various conflict zones : regional and global police cooperation has never been more essential against terrorism and transnational organized crime, which is why Operation Neptune is so important.” A source at the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) explained that normally “Interpol has no operational agents” and that the Neptune operation would actually be “a technical assistance on sea border crossings,” reported news outlet Telquel. “Interpol staffing acts as observers and the work is done by the national border police,”the official added. “The Moroccan ports concerned are Tangier Med and Tangier City, and Nador port.” Interpol also provides its databases which enable authorities to track down jihadists coming back from conflict zones, especially Iraq and Syria. The Neptune operation is taking place in 18 ports of eight countries. Morocco is strongly involved in the operation since it hosted a good part of the preparations, including training sessions and coordination meetings. The most recent training session hosted by Morocco was held in February in Casablanca, the official concluded.

By Maria Kuiper Rabat- The city council of Agadir agreed to change Tamazight (Berber) street names to names of Palestinian cities in support of Palestine on Monday. Although some Amazigh (Berber) people agree the Palestinian conflict should be addressed, many are angry with what they perceive to be the continued erasure of their culture and history. Abdullah Badou, head of the Amazigh Network, said: “We do not have a problem with Palestine. Certainly, we support the Palestinians, but we do not agree with those who ignore the nature of the area and the history of Morocco.”  Likewise, Ismael Khejjou, project manager of The Voice of the Amazigh Women (Le Voix De La Femme Amazighe) in Rabat, stated he does not see the point changing the names. “Changing street names to Palestinian names is totally against our identity and we do not accept that,” Khejjou said. “We don’t want 40 strange names.” According to Khejjou, although Morocco stands in solidarity with Palestine, its original peoples believe that changing a street name is not the way to show support and help the people of Palestine, but rather it is only a visual representation of the ideological standpoint. In Agadir, the Amazigh are the bedrock of the city. Agadir is home to the Timitar festival, which celebrates the Amazigh and their music, as well as the Amazigh Heritage Museum.  The Amazigh have lived in Morocco for thousands of years, many centuries before Arab Muslims conquered the region, instituted Islam as the main religion, and Arabized the culture.  In line with Arabization, Amazigh parents cannot name their children traditional Tamazight names. According to Morocco’s Law of Civil Registry, all children born in Morocco must be given an Arabic or Islamic name.  If parents continue to give their child a Tamazight name that is not accepted by the Civil Registry, the child may have difficulty applying for a passport, getting reimbursement for medical insurance, or obtaining other services provided by the nation.  As much as 80 percent of the Moroccan population claims to have Amazigh blood, and Morocco has recently started to implement the education of Amazigh history and language in schools. King Mohammed VI announced in 2001 the opening of an academic institute to develop and promote Tamazight and Amazigh culture in the public schools in Morocco after multiple demonstrations from the Amazigh.

Rabat- Morocco has achieved significant growth in the aeronautical sector since attending its first Farnborough Airshow in 2010, the aviation outlet AIN reported. Morocco’s Investment Development Agency (AMDI) will attend Farnborough Airshow to present the advantages Morocco has as a manufacturing destination for the aerospace industry. The airshow began July 16 and will continue until July 22. The aviation news outlet thoroughly highlighted Morocco’s advantages for the aerospace industry. Morocco has been successful in touting its inexpensive labor force and political stability to motivate international investments. “Due to its political stability, solid infrastructure, and strategic location, Morocco is rapidly becoming a regional manufacturing and export base for international companies,” the Aerospace Industry in Morocco said. China, more than other countries, has benefited from Morocco’s advantages of investment in various sectors. In an April 2017 statement, the AMDI expected “the arrival of 200 Chinese companies operating in a variety of areas including the manufacturing of cars, the aeronautics industry, aviation replacement parts, electronic information, textiles, the manufacturing of machines, and many more. Total investment by companies in the [free economic] zone after 10 years is expected to reach $10 billion.” Since the aviation sector is developing, especially in the manufacture of ancillary and spare parts, Morocco could be an attractive destination for companies seeking to invest in the aerospace industry. “The Kingdom of Morocco is a dedicated industrial partner. The Boeing Eco-System is indicative of our ability to plan and execute large-scale projects in the aerospace sector and launches a new era of aerospace in Morocco,” Moulay Hafid Elalamy, Minister of Industry, Trade, Investment and Digital Economy, told the publication. AIN has listed many economic locations in Morocco which provide an important platform for Morocco’s growing aviation sector. These include Casablanca’s Aéropole Nouaceur and Midparc free zones, in addition to Tangier, Kenitra, Oujda, and Salé, which have aerospace facilities. Midparc said that Morocco is a “competitive platform for export” with an average monthly wage of $327, which is “almost ten times lower than in Spain.”  The Aviation Professions Institute (IMA) gives vocational training for professionals in the sector. “IMA’s medium-term objective is to train 800 persons per year in aviation and aerospace professions thanks to a tool of international standards, set up as a result of a partnership between the GIMAS (Group of Moroccan Aviation and Aerospace Industrialists), the UIMM (Union of Metallurgical Profession Industries) and the state of Morocco,” Midparc said. AIN noted that the Midparc Free Zone claims to host aviation companies such as Boeing, Dassault Aviation, EADS Aviation, Ratier Figeac, and Safran. In addition to more than 110 international aeronautical and aerospace companies operating in Morocco, AIN cited a recent briefing of the US’s export.gov. It said “Morocco boasts nearly 11,500 aviation professionals, of whom 50 percent are women. [Morocco’s] aerospace industry…plans to double its capacity and number of operators and create 23,000 new jobs by 2020. The Casablanca Free Zone in Nouaceur…is a designated industrial integrated platform with special support for investors in the aerospace sector.” Stephen Orr, vice president of Operation Morocco Manufacturing praised the future of aerospace and employees’ development. “Bombardier’s Moroccan facility today produces wing components, slats, ailerons, winglets, flaps, fuselage parts, fuselages, nose extensions, doors, floors, nacelles, and subassemblies for various programs of regional aircraft and business jets,” a Moroccan Bombardier spokeswoman told AIN. In late 2017, “Boeing and RAM announced orders for four 787-9 Dreamliners, worth $1.1 billion at list prices. RAM’s fleet consists of 737s, 767-300ERs, 787s, and a 747-400”, AIN reported.

Rabat – The German cabinet has approved a draft bill that would declare Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Georgia “safe countries of origin,” speeding up the process to deport rejected asylum applicants from the four countries. In order to be enacted, the draft law will need to be approved through a vote by the lower house of parliament. Based on the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, asylum seekers must prove that they are facing “fear of persecution” for certain circumstances, including race, religion, nationality, or political views. Members of Germany’s federal cabinet, however, believe that some people applied for asylum to escape financial situations and are “misusing” Germany’s asylum, according to Deutsche Welle (DW). The German government has approved only “a tiny fraction of asylum applications” from the three Maghreb countries, according to DW. Morocco World News contacted the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asking for the factors that led the German cabinet to re-evaluate safety in Morocco for refugees, but has not received an answer yet. Germany’s Minister of Interior Joachim Herrmann said he believes that people from the three Maghreb countries have no right to seek asylum. “As a rule, someone from Tunisia, Algeria or Morocco has no right to asylum, but we want only those people to stay in Germany who truly are persecuted,” he said. Opposed by left-leaning political parties The cabinet’s decision, however, has been receiving backlash from opposition parties, including Greens and the far-left Die Linke. The parties condemned the reevaluation of the law, labeling the three Maghreb countries “unsafe.” The president of the Greens explained his party’s stance, claiming that the three countries are not a safe home for “journalists, minorities and homosexuals.” “There are reports of torture and unfair court proceedings. Therefore I cannot see how these states are safe,” he added. The German government has been blaming an increase in the crime rate on the rise of refugee numbers for the past three months. Between 2014 and 2016, the total number of refugees in Germany increased by 4.9 times. Federal statistics, according to the Irish Times, show that nearly 300,000 crimes were linked to refugees/asylum seekers in 2016. The number represents a 42 percent rise in crime year-on-year, said the outlet. The president of the Green party, however, denounced the government’s statistics: “If it’s about dealing with crime in Germany, then you need a well-equipped police force.” The cabinet has been attempting to pass this law since 2016, when all German lawmakers in the lower house of parliament voted for the decision. The decision, however, was not approved by the Bundesrat (the upper house of the German parliament). UNHCR’s stance on deportation of refugees According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) countries receiving refugees must protect them; once a refugee crosses a border, the hosting country is obliged to offer them rights and protection. However, migrants are people who choose to leave their mother country “not because of a direct threat of persecution or death, but mainly to improve their lives by finding work, or in some cases for education, family reunion or other cases,” according to the UNHCR.

Rabat – Cristiano Ronaldo continues to break records even before the beginning of the Serie A matches.  First he broke Juventus’ record for a transfer. The previous record holder, Gonzalo Higuain, was the most expensive player in Juventus’ history with an estimated value of €90 million. Ronaldo’s fee transfer cost the Old Lady €112 million.

In contrast, Juventus total sales for all players’ jerseys were 850,000 in 2016. It is projected that the sales of Ronaldo’s jersey will reach 1 million due to the Portuguese legend’s advertising value. Juventus still has matches to play in the International Champions Cup. They will face Real Madrid on Saturday, August 4.  In a show of respect for his former club, Ronaldo has reportedly refused to participate in the International Champions Cup match. Ronaldo will not play against Real Madrid until the Champions League.

Rabat – Authorities have arrested a Russian national at the Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca.  A security source quoted by Moroccan news outlet Hespress said the suspect was planning to leave Morocco on a flight to the United Arab Emirates. The source added that the suspect has been the subject to an international warrant for alleged terrorism and extremism issued by Interpol in July, at the request of the Russian authorities. The 48-year old suspect entered Morocco through Bir Kandouz in Western Sahara, a town on the Mauritanian border. He entered Morocco only three days before Interpol issued the international warrant. Authorities placed the suspect in custody under the supervision of the National Judicial police for further investigation on possible terrorist connections inside and outside Morocco. The authorities are also expected to hand over the suspect to Russian authorities for further investigation.

Rabat- The High Court of Ireland cancelled the registration of a vet for permitting his stamp to be used to certify some diseased cattle “fit for export” to Morocco. The case arose from a complaint in 2011.  The president of the High Court, Justice Peter Kelly, ordered the cancellation of a 60-year-old veterinarian’s registration. The veterinarian, named Cornelius Linehan, is under charges of “professional misconduct,” reported the Irish Times. The conviction followed a series of investigations by the Veterinary Council of Ireland (VCI) in response to complaints by Moroccan authorities in August 2011 over the poor quality of beef exports to the North African kingdom. In June 2011, 20 animals exported from Ireland had died due to diseases, such as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. Four were slaughtered under emergency slaughtering procedures in Morocco. The animals had been imported by Murphy Hunter International Livestock (MHIL). Found guilty, MHIL’s David Hunter was sentenced to 4.5 years in prison and fined €100,000 for gaining money through faking the cattle’s health certificates. Morocco continues to be a favorable African destination for Irish exporters. Morocco and Ireland are growing across different economic sectors, especially agri-food, as the Irish Minister for Agriculture, Michael Creed, said in line with his meeting with his Moroccan counterpart, Aziz Akhannouch, in Rabat in 2016. Irish dairy exports to Morocco were worth over €13 million in 2016 only.

After effort comes comfort.  Rabat – France’s football player Benjamin Mendy is taking a well-deserved vacation in Marrakech, after he won the 2018 World Cup in Russia with Les Bleus.  France earned the World Cup trophy after beating Croatia 4-2 in the final match played on Sunday at the Luzhniki stadium. In his Instagram story, Manchester’s defender informed his 1.7 million followers that he was going to Marrakech, showing a picture of himself on the plane.  Very active on social media, the football player of Senegalese origin recently made headlines when he answered a tweet about the France football players’ origins which displayed flags of players’ “home” countries beside their names. Mendy quickly corrected it by tweeting the French flag instead.  Marrakech seems to be a favorite destination of football players. After their elimination in the first round of the World Cup, some Atlas Lions visited the red city, including Amine Harit, Faycal El Fajr, Hakim Ziyech, Achraf Hakimi, Nordin Amrabat, and Khalid Boutaib.

Rabat – The Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA) has visited Morocco to discuss the possibility of Morocco hosting the 2019 All-Africa Games (AAG). The visit came earlier this month after Equatorial Guinea announced in November that they could not organize the 2019 games. The sports news outlet Inside the Games reported Tuesday that “falling oil prices and economic problems” were the reasons behind the withdrawal. The meeting was attended by ANOCA vice-presidents Mustapha Barraf and Joao Costa Alegre; Morocco’s Minister of Youth and Sport, Rachid Talbi Alami; and President of the Association of African Sports Confederations Ahmed Nasser. Since no announcement of a new host was made at ANOCA’s Extraordinary General Assembly held yesterday in Algiers, the organization could propose Morocco to replace Equatorial Guinea. Morocco has been given 10 days to confirm a host city for the event. ANOCA officials tend to support Morocco for hosting the continental event although Nigeria expressed its interest in hosting, the sports outlet noted. Zambia’s Lusaka was also reported to be a potential host of the 2019 AAG, but no confirmation has been made yet. Morocco has not participated in the AAG for almost 30 years due to the African Union’s position on Western Sahara. Since Morocco was readmitted to the AU last year, the 2019 games would be its first participation in the sports event since the 1978 AAG in Algiers. The AAG are a multi-sport event held every four years. The competing nations come from the African continent and must be affiliated with the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa (SCSA). The 2015 games were held in Brazzaville, Congo.

Rabat – Belgian authorities have arrested Kaoutar Fal on suspicion of spying for Morocco, according to Belgian television channel RTBF. Kaoutar Fal, of Moroccan nationality, is being held in the “127 bis” closed center in Steenokkerzeel, Belgium. She said in a letter, obtained by the Belgian news agency Belga, that her visa was withdrawn because she had been accused of espionage for Morocco. Fal was arrested in Brussels after being accused of espionage for the Moroccan intelligence services, RTBF reported.  Fal explained in her letter that she was arrested for the first time on May 29, when she had just landed at Belgium’s Charleroi Airport. Fal was held in the “Caricole” transit center in Steenokkerzeel and later released. When she went to Charleroi Airport to pick up her passport, she was again arrested and spent the night in the 127 bis closed center, RTBF said. She said in her letter she was “kidnapped.” According to Belga, “The Aliens Office indicated that the State security requested that Fal be arrested because she represents a risk to national security.” “She is now detained on the basis of another article according to which she is illegally in the territory, and because she represents a threat to national security,” said a spokesman. “It is important for us to send her back to Morocco as soon as possible.” Fal’s lawyer Julien Hardy said that the note on which the state security had based its decisions was “extremely superficial and inaccurate.” Hardy also said his client suffered “illegal deprivation of liberty.” He lodged a new appeal with the Indictments Division and the Aliens Litigation Council (CEC). In her letter, Fal presented herself as a businesswoman and president of several organizations, including an African media organization. The letter was relayed by a Rabbi Moshe Friedman of Antwerp , RTBF noted.
 Kaoutar Fal According to Fal’s website she is “one of the founders of the female entrepreneurship Association in the north of Morocco. She has also been advisor to several Governments, Chambers of Commerce in Morocco and abroad and Director of the ESC-Tétouan the institute on the Chamber of Commerce.” Fal wrote that she “is known for the role of the President of the International Organization of African Media in Brussels, the Australian-Arab chamber representative in North Africa and the Ambassador of the International Observatory of Media and Parallel Diplomacy.”

Rabat – Two weeks after crashing into a pedestrian in Marrakech, Morocco’s Amine Harit has returned to Germany and begun training for the new season with his club Schalke 04.  The 21-year-old rising star was involved in a road accident that killed a pedestrian. The accident occurred while the player was driving with his 14-year-old brother on Saturday, June 30, shortly after midnight.   The Atlas Lion appeared in the presentation of the Schalke team on Monday, July 16. The picture was shared on the club’s social media accounts.  According to the local press, the player met club officials who advised him not to make a statement but to focus on his performance.  The French-Moroccan football player was supposed to be presented to a prosecutor in Marrakech two weeks ago. His hearing was postponed to July 11 and then again to July 25. The delays were decided by the First Instance Tribunal of Marrakech to allow the insurance company to process the claims of the rights holders of the victim. The player is exempted from attending the hearings, but his lawyer will represent him. Since the accident, the Atlas Lion has counted on the support and help of his sports director, Christian Heidel, who announced earlier this month that Harit got his passport and driver’s license back.  The sports director also claimed that the player “does not need to appear,” as his defense must only sign official documents concerning the settlement with the family of the victim.  “He will stay with the family a few more days, we also prefer him, because he would probably be alone in Germany, he will come to Gelsenkirchen at the appropriate time,” said Harit’s boss.

The 30-year-old artist named the shades “Shisha Smoke,” “Desert baked,” and “Nuts n Dates.” According to some makeup fans, the names do not reflect Moroccan culture. “‘Moroccan Spice’ by Fenty should have been called ‘Moroccan Spice on a Camel in a Harem under the Desert Night Mizmar playing in the background and Belly Dancers Abu’ instead,” wrote a dissatisfied commenter on Twitter.  “Moroccan Spice” by Fenty should have been called “Moroccan Spice on a Camel in a Harem under the Desert Night Mizmar playing in the background and Belly Dancers Abu” instead. — ????

Rabat- An elderly Moroccan has shown that it is never too late to finish school after he earned his Baccalaureate in the June exams. The 69-year-old, named Lahcen Chakiri, passed with a mark of 11.26. With help and support from teachers at Youssef Ibn Tachfine high school and Boumalene Dades high school, Chakiri was able to pass the rigorous test.  Chakiri was forced to drop out of the Boumalene Dades high school in 1967. He returned to the same school this year to pass the Baccalaureate. Chakiri is from the village of M’Semrir, 440 kilometers southeast of Casablanca in the High Atlas, and he worked in the mines for years before finally being able to continue his studies again.  Chakiri has gained considerable attention on social media for his determined spirit. He said he hopes “to inspire young and rising generations to work and persevere to achieve their goals.” He will continue to further his education and plans to attend a university in the city of Errachidia. It seems likely that he will also continue to be a positive influence for generations to come as he shows that education is for all ages.

Rabat – Real Madrid is negotiating transfer terms with English club FC Chelsea to recruit the World Cup’s golden glove winner, Thibaut Courtois, and forward Eden Hazard for a sum of €225 million. After failing to sign Neymar Junior or Kylian Mbappé, Real Madrid’s board members turned their focus to the talented Hazard, who delivered an outstanding performance during his World Cup games with Belgium. According to Mundo Deportivo, in just hours the Spanish club will close the deal with Courtois, whose contract with the English club will end in 2019. By recruiting the Belgian goalkeeper who saved the Belgian net on multiple occasions, Real Madrid will no longer need to look for a keeper and will focus on strengthening its attacking line. According to Spanish newspaper Sport, Real Madrid is proposing to sign both Courtois and Hazard for €225 million, an offer more than reasonable that will convince the owner of the Chelsea Football Club, Roman Abramovich, to sell. As for Hazard, he has always spoken of his desire to join the Champions League winner. If Hazard is signed, Courtois will surely follow his teammate. After beating England to take third place in the World Cup play-off on Saturday, July 14, Courtois announced that he would follow Hazard wherever he goes. “Where Hazard goes, I go too. We can’t be separated,” said Courtois.

Rabat – Minister of National Education, Vocational Training, and Scientific Research Said Amzazi has presented figures of the 2017-2018 school year at the 14th session of the Higher Council of Education. Of Morocco’s 7,031,355 students, 1 out of 7 are enrolled in private schools. Although many Moroccan parents enroll their children in private schools, there are still more students in public schools. While over 6 million students go to public schools, just under 1 million go to private schools.  According to Amzazi at the July 16-17 session, 52 percent of students are boys and 48 percent are girls. The total number of students has increased by 15 percent since the 2008-2009 school year. The statistics were published in the news outlet Lakome. While the number of students enrolled in primary schools is high, comparatively few reach the high school level in Morocco. According to Amzazi, nearly 62 percent of students in Morocco are enrolled in primary school, 24 percent in secondary school, and only 14 percent in high school. “In the past, a student could pass with an average of less than 5 out of 10 in primary school and less than 10 out of 20 in secondary school. Now this will end. Starting from the next school year, a student who do not get 5 in primary school and 10 in secondary and high school will not pass,” Amzazi explained. Figures on schools and teachers Amzazi’s statistics showed that there were 219,672 teachers in the previous school year. He also noted Morocco has 16,285 schools, 10,905 (67 percent) of which are public and 5,380 (33 percent) of which are private. Fifty-four percent of public schools are in urban areas, while 46 percent are in rural areas. Private schools, which represent 1/3 of the total number of schools in Morocco, receive only 14 percent of the students. The figure reveals that there are more students per school in public schools. On July 12, Amzazi said that the ministry will launch a education in Morocco of generalization and reform of the pre-primary education in Morocco. The program, including the 2018-2019 academic year, will start on July 18 and run to 2028.

Rabat – After being linked many times to Algeria, Egypt, and lately Cameroon, the coach of Morocco’s national football team has had to defend himself again, slamming those who pretend to speak for him.  “Some people talk about my future in the media to sow trouble in the Moroccan spirit and if it’s still a little too early to know what will be done, one thing is certain: Out of respect for Morocco and all Moroccans I will not leave in any way for another African nation regardless of it. Those who claim so are wrong,” wrote the French coach on social media.  Certaines personnes évoquent mon avenir dans les médias afin de semer le trouble dans l’esprit des marocains et s’il est encore un peu trop tôt pour savoir de quoi il sera fait, une chose est certaine : par respect pour le Maroc et tous les  marocains je ne partirai en aucun cas pour une autre nation africaine quelle qu’elle soit.  Ceux qui l’affirment se trompent. Hervé Renard.  Some people talk about my future in the media to sow the trouble in the Moroccan spirit and if it’s still a little too early to know what it will be done, one thing is certain : Out of respect for Morocco and all Moroccans I will not leave in any way for another African nation regardless of it. Those who claim it, are wrong. Hervé Renard. A post shared by  Hervé Renard (@herve.renard.hr) on Jul 17, 2018 at 5:18am PDT  The 49-year-old has already said he is committed to the kingdom. Last week, on his flight back home from Russia to Morocco, the Atlas Lions’ coach agreed to answer 2M’s questions about his future, saying that he has a contract with the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) until 2022.  But while Renard is keen to disparage the rumors and “fake news” surrounding his future commitment with the Moroccan national squad, he has not said anything conclusive about whether he will stay. The Frenchman’s statements on social media have left many people skeptical about his desire to retain the coaching position with the Atlas Lions, prompting many to ask what he really thinks.

By Maria Kuiper Rabat – After Associated Press stated Algeria has stopped forcing migrants into the Sahara on July 13 due to international criticism and the firing of top officials, the human rights violations still continue to go on three days later.  Since May 2017, over 13,000 migrants from countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, Guinea, and Cameroon, have been expelled from Algeria and left in the Sahara desert. The latest migrants found were on the Algerian side of the Niger border on July 15.  The mass forced migration out of Algeria is a result of multiple North African countries— Algeria, Mauritania, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt—refusing to sign a protocol on the freedom of movement of people and right of residence. The protocol is part of the African Union’s African Continental Free Trade Area agreement. The North African countries fear over-migration from sub-Saharan Africa.  The coercive journey When the migrants are abandoned in a desolate part of the Sahara desert near the Nigerien border, they pass through the cities of Assamakka, travel on buses to Arlit, then are transported to Agadez, and board flights sponsored by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) back to their home countries.  Migrants in Algeria struggle to survive as they are shut out from Algerian jobs. They are also rounded up and taken to the border with Niger by bus. Many of the people’s personal belongings and phones are taken away, and they are supplied with limited food and water. Even pregnant women and children are being forced to walk in temperatures above 40 C in the Sahara. Many men, women, children, and babies have died hoping for freedom. Ju Dennis, a Liberian, filmed his deportation with a concealed cellphone. His video showed people being packed into a truck trying to hide from the heat and the police.  “I want to expose [the Algerian government] now,” Dennis said. “We are here and we saw what they did. And we have proof.”  Government denial Last year, the president of Guinea, Alpha Conde, criticized Algeria and its government as discriminatory to migrants as well as xenophobic.  Malians, another group of migrants expelled from Niger and sent back to their country, vandalized the Algerian embassy in Bamako, Mali, to protest the mistreatment of sub-Saharan migrants.  Niger has also expressed concerns of a human rights issue, and their Minister of Interior, Mohamed Bazoum, demanded that West Africans forced out of the country be sent back to Algeria.  The European Union had also stepped in, asking Algeria to set up centers for migrants seeking asylum. Algeria, as well as other neighboring countries, refused. Although multiple nearby countries, as well as human rights organizations, have condemned Algeria’s treatment of migrants, Algeria retaliated by saying it has not done anything wrong. “Algeria has always supported African migrants and spared no effort, including humanitarian, to lend them aid and assistance,” Algerian Interior Minister Noureddine Bedoui said.  Algeria’s government originally had denied the exportation of migrants ever happened until the Associated Press and Human Rights Watch released reports on it.  After the story broke, the Algerian government assigned local journalists to report on the mass detention of migrants to prove they were using humane treatment. However, journalists were not allowed to travel past the detention centers, which is where migrants are held only before they are ejected. What is happening now Although Algeria denies abandoning migrants in the desert, Aboubacar Ajouel, the mayor of Agadez, which is the last city for migrants to go through, has confirmed that expelled migrants have arrived.  On Saturday, Chief of Mission of the UN’s IOM in Niger, Giuseppe Loprete, tweeted that 391 migrants abandoned at the border are just now being assisted by IOM Niger. Just this morning, the program manager of IOM Iraq tweeted that the migrants are safe and will be back home shortly. Since the beginning of 2018, IOM has rescued more than 3,000 people and is still working to rescue more.

By Anna Schaeffer Rabat – At an academy in Saudi Arabia, the path to piloting will open to women for the very first time.  Hundreds of women have already sent in applications to study at Oxford Aviation Academy’s new branch in Dammam, the first of its kind open to aspiring female pilots in Saudi Arabia. The opportunity follows last month’s dismantling of a decades-long driving ban for women.  Starting in September, both male and female students will train under identical curricula for a three-year program comprised of both academic and practical components. The academy is the first to train men and women together, as well as both national and international students. Oxford Aviation Academy’s MENA Region Director General Col. Othman Al-Mitairi said the academy hopes to eventually employ female instructors and aviation trainers.  “Only 40 percent of pilots in the Saudi job market are Saudis and only two of them are women,” he said. “We aspire to have 60,000 pilots and technicians over the next 20 years.”  Captain Hanadi Zakaria Hindi made history when she became Saudi Arabia’s first female pilot in 2006. Unable to study in her home country, she trained at Jordan’s Middle East Academy of Aviation. She did not receive certification to fly within Saudi Arabia until 2013. “That was really difficult, being a pilot who cannot fly in her own country,” she said. Now, Hindi flies exclusively in Saudi Arabia, saying that she feels responsible for paving the way for other Saudi women with dreams of piloting. “That’s one of the reasons I won’t accept an offer from outside the country. As the first female pilot, if I leave, who is going to fight? Who is going to open the door for others?” Academy applicant Dalal Yashar aspires to become a civil pilot. “People used to travel abroad (to study aviation), which was difficult for women more than men,” she explained. “We are no longer living in the era where women were allowed (to work) in limited arenas. All avenues are now opened for women. If you have the appetite, you have the ability.” The end of the Saudi female driving ban marked another step in a trend of social reform encouraged by Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.  Sources told Gulf News that the decision would “shatter taboos that stood for decades.”

Rabat – The largest Spanish trade union, Comisiones Obreras (CCOO) or “Workers Commissions,” has urged Spain’s new Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to boost negotiation with Morocco to open another crossing point in Ceuta to prevent further fatal stampedes.  CCOO has taken a strong stance against the prevalence of the so-called “human mule,” or workers who carry heavy weights of goods from Ceuta to Morocco. Situation needs ‘radical change’ Quoted by stampedes, the Spanish union has urged for  a “radical change in the way of understanding and addressing the serious problems that have the city plunged into a deep depression.”  CCOO also called for a new round of negotiations between Spain and Morocco to open another border crossing, which is an “urgent and essential” demand. The envisioned border crossing would aim to get the local economy out of the “extremely delicate” situation it is going through, added the news outlet. The Secretary-General of the union, Juan Luis Arostegui, warned the new delegate of the socialist government, Salvadora Mateos, of the “permanent collapse of the Tarajal border” in Ceuta, in a letter. In his warning statement, Arostegui said that the situation “not only involves multiple disorders of all kinds and conditions, but is also obstructing the only route of the commercial activity available.” According to the union, the second crossing point should serve to “separate” the traffic of vehicles dedicated to the transport of goods to Morocco from tourists and visitors. According to Europa Press, Arostegui also underscored the issue of the unemployment rate in Ceuta. Unemployment rate contradicts business activities “It does not make any sense for Ceuta to have the highest unemployment rate in Spain and, at the same time, be a leader in illegal labor, especially in construction, hospitality, commerce, and transport,” added Arostegui. The CCOO’s statements with regard to the situation of human mules in the Spanish enclaves came less than a week after Morocco moved to open an investigation into the concerning situation. The House of Representatives of the Moroccan Parliament decided to open an inquiry to find lasting solutions at the Ceuta border crossing, where several Moroccan women die every year in stampedes. The main purpose of this mission is to focus on the general conditions at the Ceuta border, in particular the situations of “neglected children and women carrying goods,” MP Abdelwadoud Kharbouch told the state-owned news agency, Maghreb Arab Press, last week. In 2017, Moroccan and Spanish authorities signed an agreement to prevent stampedes. The agreement allows women to cross the border only on Mondays and Wednesdays, while men will be permitted to cross on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The agreement, however, did not stop fatalities from occurring in Ceuta. In January 2018, two Moroccan women were killed while several others were injured in a stampede at one of the entrance gates of the Ceuta border crossing.

Rabat – A Moroccan-Canadian woman delivered a baby girl during a Royal Air Maroc (RAM) flight between Casablanca and Montreal just a few minutes after landing.  Seven months pregnant, the young woman felt the first contractions a few hours after taking off at 7 p.m. and gave birth at midnight. The Moroccan company announced the news in a statement.  According to RAM, a professional doctor intervened “successfully” to help the woman deliver the baby. The mother and her newborn are doing well and were transported to Sainte-Justine Hospital in Montreal. It is not the first time that Royal Air Maroc has welcomed a baby during a flight. In February 2014, when a 33-year-old Moroccan woman gave birth to a baby girl named Ghalia, also on a RAM flight between Casablanca and Montreal.

Rabat – After some Moroccans mocked and criticized Minister of State in charge of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid for not fulfilling his promise to help slum residents, the minister took to his Facebook page to defend himself. Ramid is caught in the middle of a new controversy as some social media users have shared a photo collage showing the minister standing in front of an elderly woman’s house in a slum during his election campaign in 2007.  The second photo shows the woman standing alone with a caption reading, “2018 and she’s still waiting for those promises.” The minister shared the same photos, next to which he wrote: “The two photos below show how much hatred some [people] bear, to the extent of photoshopping the second photo.”  “No, you slanderers…this shantytown no longer exists…look for a different [photo],” he added.  Ramid explained that the woman and all those who lived in the slum located in Hay El Farah in Casablanca moved to “decent” residences more than ten years ago. This is not the first time that Moroccans have criticized Ramid. The human rights minister’s reference to homosexuality as a “perversion” that “disgusts the public opinion” in 2017 sparked outrage among several local NGOs and some of the public. The minister’s polygamous marriage has also been the reason for national and international controversy since Morocco pledged to apply the “Ban on Polygamy” in 2012.

Rabat – Head of the Court of Auditors Driss Jettou is allegedly working on a new report that could cause a political earthquake in Saad Eddine El Othmani’s cabinet. The Court of Auditors is expected to release a report dedicated to the management of the accounts managed by all ministers, directly or indirectly. According to Moroccan newspaper Assabah, 100 accounts are suspected to have “bad management.” Jettou’s report, which aims to ensure transparency, is expected to  to reveal the alleged management dysfunctions in more than 100 accounts by ministers, general directors, and senior officials. The newspaper reported that Jettou has already “warned” officials against “any lack of strictness that cause delays in carrying out development projects.” Jettou’s call echoes King Mohammed VI speeches urging the government to come up with a new development model to meet the demands of citizens as the current model has failed. . Dysfunctions in delivering development projects, such as Al Hoceima Manarat Al Motawaset, pushed King Mohammed VI to sack four ministers on October 26, 2017. Days before his decision, the King delivered a speech at the opening session of Parliament, calling for a stronger model to meets the needs and aspirations of the Moroccan people.  “Although Morocco has made tangible progress, which is recognized throughout the world, we have to admit that our national development model no longer meets  citizens’ growing demands and pressing needs; it has not been able to reduce disparities between segments of the population, correct inter-regional imbalances or achieve social justice.”  Sources quoted by the newspaper said the development of several sectors is “hampered by the issues of financial governance.” The sources added that several “planned and uncompleted development projects are subject to new calls for tenders.” The projects cover multiple sectors, including health, education, employment, vocational training, tourism, culture and communication, equipment and transport, national planning and housing, youth and sports, and public administration reform. Taking note of King Mohammed VI’s calls, Head of Government El Othmani urged his cabinet ministers to leave their offices and inspect the projects on their own.  “This is a principle we have agreed upon. The government official cannot just work from his office, review files, and give instructions,” El Othmani said in June. He also advocated for “productive and direct interaction to meet the legitimate expectations of citizens.” The prime minister warned his ministers to take King Mohammed VI’s accountability guidelines seriously.

Rabat – The court of Breda in the Netherlands has sentenced Moroccan-Dutch kickboxer Mohamed Jaraya to two months of prison and 140 hours of community service for violent actions.  The 22-year-old athlete got in a fight in the same court last February during a trial on the murder of a Moroccan-Dutch citizen. Jaraya was also sentenced for violently beating three people at a New Year’s Eve party in Breda. According to Dutch outlets, Jaraya explained to the judge that he was drinking that day. “I’m a sportsman, I never drink, it was the first and the last time I had a few drinks, but I do not remember having hit so many people, I know what I risk, my career is at stake I understood the lesson well, my career is my life, that’s all I have.” Jaraya has made a name for himself in the world of kickboxing, following in the footsteps of his compatriot Badr Hari. Jaraya is not the only Moroccan kickboxer who has got in trouble with the Dutch justice. In 2017, Badr Hari was sentenced to six month in prison in a case of aggravated assault of Koen Everink in the skybox at the Amsterdam Arena. He was also sentenced for an attempted assault in the Jimmy Woo nightclub. Hari was sentenced on appeal to two years in prison, including ten months of probation in October 2015. He was also required to pay €45,000 in damages.

By Chase Lacy Rabat – After Palestine suffered the horrific events of 1948, neighbors Lebanon and Jordan were major recipients of Palestinian refugees. Both pursued radically different policies at the outset that have evolved into their own unfortunate realities.  Lebanon has hosted hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees, and the UN Relief Works Agency (UNRWA) has 450,000 Palestinians registered as refugees there. However, a new census released by the government puts the number at approximately 175,000. Palestinians, however, are poorly treated in the country and subjected to horrendous conditions.  Jordan has the highest population of Palestinian refugees, with over 2 million in the country. Jordanians of Palestinian origins make up nearly half—or more—of the overall population. Citizenship revocations, administrative under-representation, and economic deals contribute to the continued injustices against Palestinians.  Palestinians in Lebanon are subjected to terrible conditions by the Lebanese government. Palestinians are effectively treated as inferior residents. They are banned from working in most job fields and professions, banned from owning property or businesses, banned from formal education systems, and are left with few options but to live in dilapidated camps. The Lebanese government refuses to give Palestinians citizenship even when they have Lebanese mothers, for fear that they will never leave or that demographic changes could destabilize Lebanon’s fragile political system. Bassam Khawaja, a spokesperson for Human Rights Watch says, “This is a cruel and false hypothesis. Nothing prevents Lebanon from respecting Palestinians’ basic human rights while withholding permanent residency or citizenship. But instead, generations have grown up in limbo, without basic protections.” Inside the camps that Palestinians live in, housing, water, electricity, and refuse services are decaying, dangerous, and responsible for gangrenous living conditions. The structures worsen progressively, since Palestinians are prohibited from bringing materials into the camps to repair their homes.  A study released in 2012 called “Health and Living Conditions of Palestinian Refugees Residing in Camps and Gatherings in Lebanon: A Cross-sectional Survey,” sheds light on the effects of the horrific conditions. The study found, in a random screening of 2,501 households, 31 percent of the 11,092 individuals surveyed had chronic illnesses and 24 percent had had an acute illness in the six months prior to the survey. Eighty-two percent of the 2,501 household respondents were women; 52 percent reported chronic illness in their household, 28 percent reported an acute illness in their household, and 55 percent were psychologically distressed.   The study also found that 42 percent of households had water leakage from roofs and walls, and 8 percent of the buildings were constructed with materials that are known to be hazardous to health. The study found a positive correlation between households that had water leakage and inhabitants that reported chronic illnesses. A 2016 report by the American University in Beirut and the UNRWA indicates that conditions in Lebanon have worsened for Palestinians. 78 percent of Palestinian Refugees in Lebanon (PRL) reported dampness in their homes and 62 percent report water leakages. Fifty-two percent of homes have poor ventilation and 55.2 percent suffer from a lack of electricity. For Palestinian Refugees from Syria in Lebanon (PRS), 81.1 percent of households have dampness, 68 percent have water leakages, 54.6 percent have poor ventilation, and 57.6 percent do not have proper electricity. A majority of PRL and PRS households, 81.3 percent and 83 percent, respectively, reported that at least one family member suffered from chronic illness. Sixty-three percent of PRL and 75 percent of PRS respondents reported at least one family member had suffered from an acute illness in the prior six months. Both groups of Palestinians reported 10 percent who were disabled. Palestinians rely on cash assistance and medical care from the UNRWA. However, UNRWA is severely underfunded and cannot give adequate monthly stipends to Palestinian families. Neither can they offer a full range of medical services. Palestinians with severe illnesses such as cancer must appeal to other NGOs for their care. Jordan has pursued policies working against the future hopeful state of Palestine, its people, and Jordanians of Palestinian descent.  A 1954 nationality law granted full Jordanian citizenship to Palestinian residents of the West Bank and Jerusalem in 1949 and after][. However, since 1988, Jordan has been revoking the citizenship of Jordanians of Palestinian origins, rendering them stateless, or downgrading their rights in Jordan. Jordan has increasingly used this practice in recent years. Since 1983, Jordan has issued color-coded travel cards to Palestinians in the West Bank and those living inside the kingdom, creating a three-tiered citizenship framework. Jordan gave West Bank residents green cards and yellow cards to those living on the East Bank. Palestinians holding green cards lost their right to live in the East Bank and their Jordanian nationality after 1988. They could maintain Jordanian passports, but held no rights as Jordanians.  Between the years of 2004-2008 alone, Jordan has violated the 1954 law 2,700 times.  The government has revoked yellow cards that entitle full citizenship rights or replaced them with green cards which only entitle the individual to the passport. Yellow card holders must renew their permits for the West Bank from the Israeli Military’s Civil Administration to keep their Jordanian nationality and the right to reside in and return to the West Bank.  Those that were unable to renew Israeli permits, never obtained permits for living in Jordan, failed to obtain an Israeli family reunification permit, or did not have a Palestinian identification document have had their nationality withdrawn.  The government does not officially notify Palestinians when their nationality is revoked, so individuals usually discover it during routine events, such as renewing passports, driving licenses or registering the birth of a child.  Once nationality is stripped, Jordanians of Palestinian origins lose access to free education; must pay higher university, medical, and license renewal fees; and cannot be employed by the state or practice in organized professions such as law. Many private sector employers will also not hire them.  Unlike Palestinian refugees from the West Bank and Jerusalem, Gazans fleeing after the 1967 war were never afforded citizenship status by Jordan since Egypt had administered Gaza previously.  Many are packed into the Jerash camp, locally known as the “Gaza camp,” with little hope to improve their state. They are restricted from employment by the state, organized professions, and many private sector jobs.  Access to higher education is restricted due to higher prices that individuals of foreigner status must pay and the fact the Jerash camp is the most destitute of the Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan.  Jordan gerrymanders its voting districts in favor of the Hashemite monarchy to sustain the political status quo.  Districts with the highest concentrations of pro-monarchy ethnically Jordanian residents receive a disproportionately high number of representatives in contrast to their actual population.   Districts with high numbers of Jordanians of Palestinian origins have comparatively fewer representatives. Amman’s second district, which has 9.71 percent of Jordan’s voting population, has only 5.2 percent of the seats. Likewise, Zarqa’s first district, with 10.42 percent of the voters, has only 6.9 percent of the seats.  On the other hand, Bedouin strongholds loyal to the royal family, such as Kerak, have 4.05 percent of the voting population but 8.6 percent of the seats. Ma’an, with 1.43 percent of the voters, also has 8.6 percent of the seats.  In 2014, state-owned companies Arab Potash and Jordan Bromine signed a deal worth USD 500 million that would see Israel export from its Tamar natural gas field to Jordan. The deal operates through an American intermediary, NBL: Eastern Mediterranean Marketing.  In 2016 Jordan inked an energy deal with Israel worth USD 10 billion. The deal includes Houston’s Noble Energy and Israel’s Delek Drilling supplying Jordan’s National Electric Power Company with 45 billion cubic meters of natural gas over a 15-year period. The companies also use NBL as an intermediary. Despite alternatives such as solar or its own oil shale reserves, Jordan chooses to economically link itself to Israel and help fund Israel’s military aggressions and illegal settlements.  Lebanon has denigrated Palestinians to a shocking degree, refusing citizenship, forcing many to live in squalor, stateless, and without hope. Jordan is undergoing processes to rid the country of Palestinians, or at least to undermine their influence at the administrative level. Jordan is subjecting Palestinians to subjugation, and/or they are part of financing the Israeli occupation and human rights violations on Palestinians.  This is the third in a 5-part opinion series evaluating the conduct of MENA region states in upholding their commitments to Palestine. Read the first part about Egypt here, and the second part about the Gulf states here  Part 4 will investigate the nature of Turkey’s relationship with Israel.

Rabat – King Felipe VI of Spain has spoken positively of Moroccan-Spanish strategic ties, which he says are based on “mutual trust, respect, and cultural affinity.” The Spanish monarch reiterated the strategic bond uniting the two neighbors in Seville on Monday at the 5th World Congress of Middle East Studies (WOCMES). “The relations between Morocco and Spain are strategic because we are neighbors who have shared concerns and who face common challenges and threats that we can transform into opportunities for close cooperation together with will and determination.” The king also welcomed the friendship between the two countries. Spanish-Moroccan relation reflected in an artistic way According to the Spanish king, the strong ties between the two countries are “perfectly reflected in the high patronage of the ‘Three Cultures of the Mediterranean Foundation,’ we, His Majesty King Mohammed VI and myself, share.” These relations are “reflected, in an artistic and visual way, through this beautiful building where we are gathered today,” said Felipe VI in reference to the Hassan II Pavilion in Seville. The Spanish king spared no efforts to express gratitude over the contribution of Morocco in making the foundation successful. Created in 1998, the foundation is based on principles of peace, dialogue, and tolerance, which it promotes through meetings between people and cultures of the Mediterranean. “I personally remember how much the Moroccan contribution to this great project was decisive, and I appreciate the efforts made by the two countries, throughout these years, for this space to continue to be a Sevillian monument that honors, and for the ongoing dialogue and exchange between the different cultures we share between us and with other countries in the region,” said the king. Both Morocco and the Regional Government of Andalusia created the foundation, which the king said forms a “remarkable example of what Moroccans and Spaniards can achieve when they join forces to strengthen our relationship.” Adviser to King Mohammed VI Andre Azoulay; Morocco’s Minister of Communication and Culture Mohamed El Aaraj; and Ambassador of Morocco in Spain Karima Benyaich all attended the inaugural session of the congress. President of the Andalusian Government Susana Diaz and representatives of the Spanish government and the Andalusian government also attended the congress. Azoulay calls for further dialogue The adviser to Morocco’s King Mohammed VI also made a statement in the inaugural ceremony, emphasizing the “outstanding cachet” of the 2018 World Congress of Middle East Studies. Azoulay, who is also the Deputy Chairperson of the Three Cultures of the Mediterranean Foundation, said that this year’s congress is  “is haloed by the triple seal of Spain, Morocco, and Andalusia and the pioneering approach and visionary strategy of HM King Mohammed VI.” Azoulay invited the parties of the meeting to reinforce dialogue and conviviality “forged by the knowledge and respect of all our stories added in the richness of all their diversity.” The adviser added that the World Congress of Middle East Studies “has had the talent and the will to bring together, for collective, scientific, and expert reflection on how the relations, teachings, or debates are discussed.” The event began July 16 and will end July 20. It has convened 3,000 researchers and academics from more than 100 countries. The attendees will discuss several themes and issues faced by the Arab-Muslim world.

Rabat- Some Moroccan social media users have launched an online campaign with the hashtag “Be_a _man” (in Arabic) to prevent women from wearing bikinis or revealing swimsuits to the beach. Other Moroccans criticized the campaign for promoting “sexist” propaganda. While some anticipate the summer season to head for the beach,  others are not pleased with the activity and have launched hashtags like “Say no to nudity and cosmetics.” They also call for a ban on bikinis at beaches. The new “anti-nudity” campaign calls for Moroccan men to “act like men” and force their wives and daughters to cover themselves at the beach. The online campaign started on July 9 on a Facebook page, called “The national campaign for the implementation of Islamic bank in Morocco.” The post reads: “You are responsible for what your daughter and wife wear… so don’t be a dayooth.” The Arabic word refers to a man who permits his female relatives to engage in illicit relations.   The post has been shared 3,448 times on Facebook and received mixed reactions. While some commenters were supportive of the campaign, others highly criticized it as sexist and derogatory to women. Several women online responded with “Be a woman,” inviting Moroccan women to choose their clothing for themselves. One commenter wrote: “Be a woman and wear whatever you wish to.”  On Twitter, many users expressed views similar to: “Be a man and curb your desire to control women and what they want to wear,” and “Be a man and stop violence against women instead.” The new controversial campaign has caused social media users to ask “What does it mean to be a man?” #??_???? ? ???? ?? ?????? ??????? ?? ?????? ?? #?????? ? ?? ?? ???? ?????. — Aziz Enhaili (@AEnhaililook) July 14, 2018  #??_???? ? ???? ?? ????? #??????. — Aziz Enhaili (@AEnhaililook) July 14, 2018

Rabat – The European Union Foreign Affairs Council has decided to include Western Sahara in the Association Agreement and the EU-Morocco agriculture deal. “This is a measure that is in line with the decision of the EU Court of Justice on the liberalization agreement of agricultural and other products issued on December 21, 2016, which is aimed at extending tariff presence” to the region, a source quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) said.  The decision of the EU foreign ministers also enables the EU “to continue to boost its partnership with Morocco and lead the way on the fishing agreement between the two partners in the coming months, the source added. The EU foreign ministers also called on the EU Parliament to adopt the decision as soon as possible. Prior to this statement, a source from the EU told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that products from Western Sahara will be included in the agreement without “any hindrance.” The EU Court of Justice (ECJ) decided on December 21, 2016, that the deal between EU and Morocco, signed in 2012, on the mutual liberalization of the trade of agricultural and fishing products did not apply to Western Sahara. Representatives of the EU and Morocco currently negotiating the new fisheries deal to include the region in the agreement.  The fisheries deal between Morocco and EU expired on July 14, pending a possible renewal in the coming days. Both parties failed to reach a decision to renew the deal’s terms, with  Morocco requesting a financial compensation of EUR 80 million for allowing European fishing boats in the region. The North African country then said that it will not sign a renewal with financial compensation lower than EUR 80 million.

Rabat – On the eve of the 2018 FIFA World Cup final in Russia, on Saturday, Argentinian football legend Diego Maradona warmly embraced Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, reiterating his support for the Palestinian people. Abbas and Maradona met before Sunday’s final World Cup game between France and Croatia in Moscow. During his meeting with Abbas, Maradona told the Palestinian leader: “In my heart, I am Palestinian.” Expressing respect, Maradona shared a photo of himself and Abbas hugging on his Instagram. Este hombre quiere paz en Palestina. El señor presidente Abbas tiene un país hecho y derecho A post shared by  Diego Maradona Oficial (@maradona) on Jul 14, 2018 at 3:17am PDT  The post was accompanied with a message in Spanish, saying  “This man wants peace in Palestine. Mr. President Abbas, you have a full-fledged country.” Abbas, however, received a backlash for attending the World Cup game amid Israeli violent air attacks against Gaza. n Saturday,  Israeli air raids killed two teenagers in Western Gaza. Abbas also spoke with Russian leader Vladimir Putin during his visit.  Maradona’s recent support for Palestine is not the first of its kind. In 2012, Maradona said that he is a “number one fan of Palestinians.” “I respect them and sympathize with them, he told reporters in Dubai in 2012. “I support this nation’s cause, since I  grew up struggling and standing against injustice,” he said. A year earlier, Maradona was spotted wearing a kaffiyeh (a traditional Middle Eastern headdress) offered to him by one of his fans. “Long live Palestine,” the Argentine football legend shouted on the occasion.

By Anna Schaeffer Rabat – Protests erupted across Iraq after security forces opened fire and killed a demonstrator during the July 8 youth protest in Basra. Today, the violent clashes between police and protesters entered its eighth consecutive day with three fatalities and over 100 injured. Initially, youth gathered in Basra to voice discontent over the lack of basic necessities like employment and electricity; after police shot a young activist, demonstrations spread across the nation with slogans pronouncing, “The people want to overthrow the regime,” and “Iran, out out! Baghdad is free!” In Basra, clashes between demonstrators and security forces resulted in 50 people injured—mostly protesters—after a failed attempt to storm the governor’s headquarters. Anti-riot police fired tear gas and water cannons at demonstrators to quell the effort. Just to the south, demonstrators throwing stones pushed into the Zubeir oil field; security forces responded by firing more tear gas.  One man in his mid-thirties, unemployed for three years, pledged, “I will not leave my place here until I get all my rights. The government lies to us; they always give us such promises and we get nothing.” In response to the continual demonstrations, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi promised new funding and investment in Basra totalling USD $3 billion. The dedicated capital is intended to restore housing and schools in the oil-rich but neglected Shiite heartland. In addition, a six-minister committee formed in response to the protests promised to launch a water-allocation project and create jobs for those inhabiting areas surrounding the oil fields. One activist responded to the governmental promises as “anesthetization to the residents of Basra.” He demanded greater power given from Baghdad to develop a fresh local government in that region. “Every year, they give the same promises, and nothing happened on the ground.” Protests spread across Iraq Expanding protests reached Baghdad on July 14, with hundreds gathering in Tahrir Square to demonstrate against lackluster public services, rampant unemployment, and corruption.  In the neighboring Dhi Qar province capital Nasiriyah, protesters and police clashed violently. Deputy Health Director Abdel Hussein al-Jabri reported 15 demonstrators and 25 police injured. In Muthana, a province bordering Basra, demonstrators gathered in the hundreds to torch sections of the governor’s headquarters and set fire to offices run by Badr, an Iranian-backed political party. Guards opened fire in response and wounded multiple protesters. Airlines Oman Air, Royal Jordanian, and flydubai suspended international flights to Najaf, a shrine city, after protestors stormed and damaged the passenger terminal of Al Najaf International Airport.  In the southern Iraqi city of Samawah, two more people lost their lives on Sunday. Ahmad al-Kanani, spokesman for Maysan health authorities, reported that the pair of demonstrators received fatal gunshot wounds from “indiscriminate gunfire.”  Governmental response to protests The prime minister held a meeting Sunday with security and intelligence leaders in Baghdad after his visit to Basra. A statement from his office accused “infiltrators” of feeding on “peaceful protests to attack public and private property” and asserted, “Our forces will take all the necessary measures to counter those people.” “When the state responds to citizens’ demands, it is a strength, not a weakness,” Abadi said. He ordered security forces to avoid using live fire against unarmed protesters but stated, “Iraqis do not accept chaos, assaults on the security forces, state and private property, and those who do this are vandals who exploit the demands of citizens to cause harm.” What’s happening now? The Al Najaf International Airport remains closed until further notice, and the second consecutive day without internet service across the country has left some citizens without access to the outside world. Unemployment, a major catalyst for the original July 8 protest, remains a focal point during demonstrations. Official numbers estimate that 11 percent of Iraqi people remain unemployed and youth joblessness hovers at twice that number. Eighty-nine percent of Iraqi exports derive from the oil sector; however, the department creates only one percent of jobs. Foreigners fill the majority of oil-related jobs. The protests follow a three-year war against the Islamic State terrorist group, a conflict that has torn Iraq apart and devastated its infrastructure. Iraq’s government assesses the damage at USD $88 billion necessary for reconstruction. Some consider the demonstrations a continuance of those launched July 16, 2015, when a young man died at the hands of police during a protest. In the following years, sporadic protests calling for governmental reform have erupted in various Iraqi cities. The current protests share themes with past demonstrations, including discontent with corruption and lack of basic services.

Rabat –  Last Wednesday, Ireland’s Senate approved a bill prohibiting the purchase and import of products or services coming from occupied territories, including Israeli settlements. As for Western Sahara, there is no clear international legal consensus on its occupation by Morocco, according to the bill. Named “The Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018,” the legislation prohibits economic activities with “illegal settlements in territories deemed occupied under international law.” “Whether or not certain territories are occupied for the purposes of international law is often contested. Differing views exist between states as to whether, for example, Morocco occupies Western Sahara. If enacted, it will apply by default only to territories where there is clear international legal consensus on the status of the occupation,” reads the bill. The Civil Engagement Group, the upper house of the Irish Parliament, hopes that the implementation of the proposed law could possibly “be extended to territories when a similar case for occupation can be made, such as Western Sahara, where the suffering of the Sahrawi people is longstanding and well-reported.” The Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories and the Syrian Golan Heights are the only territories which have been confirmed as occupied under international law. “Ireland and its EU Partners have a clear position on Israeli settlements. The West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Gaza, and the Golan Heights are territories which have been occupied by Israel since 1967. Israeli settlements are illegal under international law, constitute an obstacle to peace, and threaten to make a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict impossible,” the bill said. Ireland’s Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Simon Coveney, opposed this bill, saying that trade is within the EU’s ability. He also called the move “irresponsible and opportunist.” The drafted law proposes punishing anyone who imports or assists in the importation or sale of goods or services to Israeli settlements within the occupied Palestinian territory. The bill also punishes all those who “engage or attempt to engage in the extraction of resources from a relevant occupied territory or its associated territorial waters.” Morocco denies inclusion of Western in the draft bill Some Moroccan outlets such as Hespress and Lakome reported that the bill also prohibits imports from Russia-annexed Crime, the north-west of Cyprus, and the Western Sahara. In a statement to Moroccan news outlet Le Site Info, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied that Western Sahara is connected to the Irish bill. “By reading the bill of the Irish Senate, it never mentioned the southern provinces of Morocco or the Moroccan Sahara as areas where import and export is prohibited, not even among the Irish Senate debate,” official from Moroccan Foreign Ministry was quoted as saying. “According to the same the draft law, the prohibition is only limited to the import and sale of goods and services coming from the occupied Palestinian territories, in addition to some other areas which do not comprise the Kingdom of Morocco and its southern provinces at all,” the official added. The ministry considered the news claiming the Irish bill prohibits import of products from Western Sahara as “false.” It accused the Polisario Front of spreading the news, noting that “their attempts failed.” “The media of separatists is responsible for publishing this false news. During their visit to Ireland last January, some separatists tried to campaign for the inclusion of the southern provinces in this bill,” the same official said.

Rabat – Following the adoption on Friday, July 13, of the first UN-sponsored “Global Compact” on migration, Omar Hilale, Morocco’s Ambassador to the UN, highlighted Morocco’s leadership role in global migration, praising King Mohammed VI for his personal involvement in tackling migration. Speaking to American Television News in the immediate aftermath of the adoption of a text he called a “global vision,” Hilale said that migration is a global issue that can only be solved through “courageous steps” and a strong coalition of countries committed to dialogue and multilateral conventions. The text adopted at the end of Friday’s summit promised to commit the UN and its different organs to providing a strong multilateral framework to ensure that the dignity and the rights of migrants are respected. “This a historical day for multilateralism,” Hilale said, arguing that Morocco will always be present in such situations. Morocco takes the lead on migration “This is not a new issue for Morocco,” the Moroccan diplomat said, underlining Morocco’s implication in all migration-related dialogues since 2000. According to Hilale, Morocco, Mexico, the Philippines, and Sweden, were the countries that initiated and coordinated the entire process which led to the adoption of the Global Compact. “We called for realism and global vision during the negotiations,” Hilale said. As the global summit to finalize the adoption of Friday’s agreement is expected to take place in Marrakech next December, Hilale stressed Morocco’s role in the entire process, from the conception of the idea to the government’s adoption in recent years of rules and regulations to facilitate migrants’ social and professional integration in Morocco. Morocco under King Mohammed VI has taken bold steps in its foreign policy by committing global standards on immigration and related issues, including global and continental security, the Moroccan official suggested. Marrakech will be the culmination of Morocco’s local, regional, and multilateral commitments,” the diplomat said, promising that Morocco will be active after Marrakech in terms of upholding the spirit of the Global Compact. During an AU summit last year, African Heads of states designated King Mohammed VI as Africa’s leader for migration. Since then, many Moroccan cities have hosted African summits on migration, and Morocco has given legal status to over 80,000 “irregular” sub-Saharan migrants. “We are the voice of Africa,” Hilale said, referring to the King Mohammed’s position in the continental vision on migration. He added, “When there is political will, there is possibility to agree on projects.”

Rabat – It is official: 31-year-old midfielder Nordin Amrabat has left Watford for Al-Nasr Riyadh. After being linked to Turkish club Trabzonspor, it seems that the Atlas Lion and his now-former club were convinced by the Saudi Arabian club’s EUR 8.5 million offer. The Moroccan international player, who was on loan to Leganes last season has signed a 3-year contact for a EUR 3 million salary per year. ????? ??????? #??????? ??? ????? ????? ?? pic.twitter.com/LXWDJsz2YT — ???? ????? ??????? (@AlNassrFC) July 16, 2018  Amrabt is not the only Moroccan who has been seduced by the Saudi Arabian championship. Earlier this year, Wydad of Casablanca gave in to the appeal of another Saudi club,  selling its striker Achraf Bencherki to Al Hilal for $9 million. As for Atlas Lion Karim El Ahmadi, he signed few days ago with Al Ittihad Jeddah for a two-year contract. Amrabat’s introduction to football was his father’s idea, who advised to persevere in pursuing his his dreams. His father’s suggestion made him think he could play at the amateur level while going making a living in a different profession. At the time, Amrabat played for SV Huizen in Almere. The Moroccan-Dutch winger worked one time in his early life at a Michelin-starred restaurant, cleaning dishes and preparing desserts. The player was discovered as a successful amateur football winger by Dutch second-tier side Omniworld. A few years later, the young footballer moved to the professional level. He played in the Union of European Football Associations’ champions league withr of PSV Eindhoven, who at the time were champions of the Dutch football league. His rich football resume has since seen him move through Holland, Turkey’s Kayserispor, Watford and now Al Nassr.

Rabat – A study on food habits shows Moroccans are gravitating towards consuming more processed foods than healthy traditional diets. Penn State geography researcher Bronwen Powell conducted a food research on this matter to find out the factors driving this diet shift  in Morocco, Penn State University wrote on its website on Thursday.  Powell is studying food markets to analyze nutritional transition habits towards unhealthy diets, which could affect Moroccans’ health. Since Powell’s visits to  different Moroccan markets, she thinks that changes in markets and the food environment are the cause of these nutritional trends. Powell stated that people in rural areas, while having difficulties reaching rural markets, depend on the food offered in them. “In rural areas, people may ride a donkey to the nearest road, then catch a truck to the market. If people are only traveling to rural markets, then what’s in that market is what they are going to eat. Diets are very seasonal.” Therefore, these people, according to Powell, have no choice but to buy the foods for sale, whether they are healthy or unhealthy. “When people go to the market, they may not always choose to purchase healthy foods, especially if there is heavy marketing for unhealthy foods,” she said. The researcher stressed the need for producing important foods locally due to lack of suitable infrastructure to transport highly perishable foods. “Throughout much of the developing world, there isn’t an infrastructure to ensure that highly perishable foods, such as fruits and vegetables and animal-source foods, can be transported to distant markets. So, in those contexts, those foods and nutritionally important foods may need to be produced locally.” Powell also indicated that Moroccans are using unhealthy essential foods, including wheat and legumes. “Processed wheat flour is increasingly being used instead of whole wheat or barley flour to make bread, meat and other animal sources of protein are replacing legumes, and people are more and more favoring imported vegetables instead of traditional (wild) vegetables.” Although wild food holds an important place within the Moroccan food practices, Powell noted that Moroccans’ demand for fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes has declined recently. “Many of the traditional foods being lost from Moroccan diets, such as whole grains, especially barley, and fruits and vegetables, are also those associated with lowering the risk of obesity and Type 2 diabetes,” Powell added. Unhealthy diet may result in obesity Consuming unhealthy food or undernutrition may result in health problems connected to overweight, obesity or food-related chronic diseases. According to UN State of Food Security and Nutrition in their World 2017 report, 20.6 % of the Moroccan population over 18, were suffering from obesity in 2014. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute’s 2015 Nutrition Country Profile, 57 % of all Moroccans are overweight, 22 % are obese and Type 2 diabetes is on the rise in the same year.  The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 16.4% of overweight and obesity was recorded for the year 2011 in Morocco. This means that obesity among Moroccan people is rapidly increasing over the years. Powell has been studying traditional food systems for over 10 years in Morocco. Her research is mainly based on market survey data collection on the ground. She has a team of colleagues from Cadi Ayyad University in Marrakech, helping her in her investigation. “I have a team of research assistants in Morocco who are collecting market survey data. They go every week to the markets to ask vendors where they got their food and trace food back to its source,” Powell said. Powell hopes, through her research’s outcome, will useful to the concerned authorities to support healthier dietary choices. “With the results of this project, I hope that we can start to  have better advice for agricultural extension agents and departments or ministries of agriculture and health, to inform them about how to best ensure that markets have a diversity of healthy foods available to people,” she said.

Despite Morocco’s defeat that in the African Nations’ Cup that day,. Moroccans went out in massive crowds in the main streets whistling and screaming with joy, “We lost the cup, but we won a young prosperous team and a great coach.” To Moroccans, this wasn’t a defeat. They agreed that the team’s qualification to the CAN 2004 finals was itself a source of pride for all Moroccans and a reincarnation of Moroccan football after their 1976 CAN Cup Championship victory.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and Chairman of the Justice and Development Party (PJD) has heavily criticized the PJD’s Abdelali Hamieddine for his anti-monarchy comments. In a national seminar on Morocco’s policy held recently in the Khmisat province, Hamieddine said that “the monarchy in Morocco is a central institution in political life. But that does not mean that its current form is useful for democracy and political life. He also claimed that monarchy “hampers progress, evolution and development” of the country, adding that “if it does not change, it will not serve either itself or the country.”  Hammieddine’s comments angered El Othmani, who ordered an investigation into the publication on the party’s official website of statements filmed during the seminar.  The committee published the result of its investigation in a statement on Sunday, and emphasized that the members of the PJD media did not publish the publications with a “bad intention.”  The statement added that the publication was an error made by the webmaster of the party’s website, who allegedly did not check and approve the content before publishing it. El Othmani also commented on Hammieddine’s statement, emphasizing that his party considers the monarchy as the “leader of the reforms.” “Our relationship with the monarchy is not based on interests or tactical or pragmatic logic. The party believes in the monarchy that is one of the essential constitutional pillars of Morocco,” said El Othmani on Saturday at a PJD meeting held in Rabat. Concluding his statement, El Othmani said that “taking these pillars into account is the sine qua non of the existence of the party. The party will never turn away from these beliefs.”

Rabat – In a report published on July 11, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in collaboration with the African Union’s Department of Economic Affairs assessed the economic performances of African countries. Findings indicate that Morocco’s commendable socio-political reforms are still tainted by “alarming social inequalities” and an increasing income inequality gap. Africa’s Development Dynamics 2018, as the report is called, highlighted African countries’ socio-economic performances in accordance with the AU’s Agenda 2063 initiative and a particular focus on growth, job opportunities, and social inequalities. Pointing out African countries’ performances in terms of growth, labor market, educational facilities, and basic social infrastructures, the study says that Moroccan society is characterized by vast and alarming inequalities, despite discernible advances in some key sectors—housing and infrastructure, for example—in the last decade. The study found that Morocco’s Gini Coefficient,the inequality index used by most economists and international institutions, is the highest in North Africa. Morocco’s Gini Coefficient of 40.3 percent puts the country far above Algeria (23%), Egypt (30.8%), and Tunisia (35.8%). By this measure, Morocco is Northern Africa’s highest income-unequal country with the region’s largest gap between the top and bottom of the socio-economic ladder. The study also looked at the policies and reforms countries have adopted in recent years to tackle poverty. This included healthcare systems, access to education, electricity and clean water consumption, and the number of people living in “decent life conditions.” According to the report, all the indicators point that Morocco is outperformed by other countries in the region, save for Libya, whose ongoing political instability has made it the worst regional performer in many regards since 2011-2012. Unstable and fragile labor Market Job insecurity was a primary finding in the report’s “diagnosis” of Moroccans’ concerns. According to the study, the informal sector represents 11 to 33 percent of Morocco’s per capita GDP, whereas 60 percent of Moroccans work in said sector. For most Moroccans, the study suggested, wages fail to cover decent life expenses in many of the country’s big cities.  In addition to job insecurity, there is also an “alarming lack of opportunities” for the majority of skilled workers and young graduates. Stability provides hope But other indicators painted a positive portrait of Morocco, suggesting that there are reasons to be hopeful about the country’s prospects. Although the country’s current growth level has so far failed to meet society’s needs and expectations, Morocco’s stability remains its hallmark in the region. Morocco’s growth is buttressed by the country’s stability, the report said, adding that political stability in Morocco has translated into a “stable economic growth always higher than the regional mean between 1995 and 1999.” Along with the foreign investments that the kingdom has attracted over the years, Morocco’s rising competitive businesses, transforming industrial sector, and phosphates and agricultural products exports give the North African country some room to capitalize on its growth to tackle its issues. To stimulate progress and decrease the rich-poor gap, Morocco’s “primary challenge” will be to promote gender equality by “boosting female entrepreneurship, investing in innovative start-ups, and ensuring linkages between formal training and labor market’s demands.”

By Maria Kuiper Rabat – The looming growth of unemployment has menaced the Middle East and North Africa since the beginning of the Arab Spring in late 2010.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF), headquartered in the United States, recorded the region’s unemployment rate at 25 percent—the highest in the world—before the Arab Spring began.  The International Labour Organization (ILO) ranks North Africa as having the worst regional unemployment rate in the world, with women and youth especially at risk. ILO states that in 2018, North Africa will “remain at a steady 8.7 million”. It also mentions that five million Middle Easterners will face unemployment and one-third of those unemployed will be women.  People aged 15 to 30 in the Middle East and North Africa make up 60 percent of the region’s entire population, according to IMF.  Saudi Arabia, which is the Middle East’s largest economy and nineteenth overall in the world according to GDP, has an estimated youth unemployment rate of 32.6 percent by the ILO. The IMF reports that the unemployment rate for young women is 62 percent.  The Middle East and North Africa’s gender gap is triple the size of other developing economies in the world; women are three times less likely to be working than men.  Unemployment in Morocco In Morocco, the unemployment rate rose from 10.2 to 10.5 percent from January 2018 to March 2018. The highest rates of unemployment in Morocco are held by women and young people. Unemployment rates for women stand at 14.1 percent and the rates for young people, aged 15 to 24, are estimated at 35.1 percent by the ILO.  Morocco’s youth makes up about 17 percent of the country’s entire population yet stands as the front runners for the rate of unemployment. In 2016, the United Nations held a forum consisting of 341 Moroccan women from all regions and all demographics. Most women held low-level jobs and corroborated with each other that their employments “do not reflect the needs of Moroccan women to be able to secure administrative leave to fulfill their familial responsibilities.”  From 2017 to 2018 in Morocco, the estimated number of working-age people set to join the labor-force was 245,000. A recent study reported Morocco would have to add 115,000 additional jobs each year as well as maintain its current opportunities to just remain at only 47 percent of the current population in the workforce.  The Middle East and North Africa need workforce opportunities to grow, or else by 2030, unemployment levels may reach 14 percent. The most common reasoning for an increase in unemployment is rapid population growth combined with only a steady or slow creation of jobs. By 2020, Morocco is projected to grow by another one million people. If the nation does not want unemployment rates to rise, it will have to create jobs for its people at an expeditious rate.

Rabat- The Tourist Brigade of Marrakech arrested 1,817 unlicensed or “fake” tour guides in the first six months of 2018 under charges of fraud, drug-dealing, and violence against tourists in the region. Unlicensed tour guides continue to prove a challenge for Morocco’s growing tourism sector, especially in cities considered large tourist attractions like the Red City of Marrakech. The Red City’s Tourist Brigade seized 115 beggars for “disturbing the peace of tourists,”110 individuals in possession of drugs, 90 others in possession of sharp weapons—suspected of attacking tourists—and 63 suspects of robbery. Marrakech’s Police Prefecture reported that 98 of the arrested individuals suffered from mental illnesses; the Tourist Brigade delivered them to local social welfare institutions. Although some justify the phenomenon of fake tour guides by the lack of job opportunities in the local market, unlicensed tour guides threaten the country’s economic progress since some of them manipulate, harass, and assault foreign visitors in the kingdom. Reviews on the world’s largest travel website TripAdvisor warned against “fake” tour guides speaking English and directing tourists in Rabat. One reviewer wrote: “Upon entering, fake tour guides speaking English will tell you the entrance is closed and try to direct you in a different direction. Ignore these people! The entrance is correct.” The commentators provided tips to visitors based on their own experiences with fake guides.  “Be aggressive and tell them “no” or “la shokran” (Moroccan Arabic: no, thank you) and keep walking…These men are fake tour guides trying to get you to follow them throughout the Kasbah for a fee,” the review reads.

Several social media users criticized the French football team for having many footballers of African descent amongst its ranks. “It’s a crazy thing. Too much sacrifice and work. We are world champions,” said the happy footballer. France clinched the World Cup title after defeating Croatia 4-2 in the tournament’s final match on Sunday at  Luzhniki stadium. Talented French youngster Kylian Mbappe won the FIFA Young Player award after delivering astonishing performances throughout the world premier tournament. Mbappe, who also plays for Paris Saint Germaine, is the second French player in a row to clinch that title after teammate Paul Pogba. “Technical qualities such as skill, style and charisma are taken into account, but so are other important factors such as a sense of fair play and a genuine impression that the player is playing for the love of the game,” said FIFA.

Rabat – Thousands of protesters in Rabat rallied once again on Sunday to denounce the harsh sentences against the 54 detainees of the Hirak movement. More than 6,000 participated in Rabat’s march, including families of the detainees and the Secretary-General of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU) Nabila Mounib. Casablanca witnessed nearly 10,000 demonstrators voicing their protest against the rulings.  Demonstrators carried banners saying, “Justice” and “Free the Activists.” and chanted slogans denouncing the security crackdown against the 2016 and 2017 protests. Demonstrations erupted after Al-Hoceima province fishmonger Mouhcine Fikri,  was crushed to death by a garbage truck while trying to retrieve confiscated goods. Since a June 26 ruling by a Casablanca court that gave sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years for the Hirak Rif activists, the government received a nationwide backlash. Activists, politicians such as Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, and international NGOs expressed solidarity or protested in Casablanca and Rabat, calling for the freedom of the detainees. Reacting to criticism, several government officials said their hands were tied, emphasizing that the cabinet could not interfere because the judiciary is independent. El Othmani regretted that his government cannot intervene in the Hirak Rif case, because the “judicial power” is an independent authority. All of the detained activists, including Nasser Zefzafi and Nabil Ahamjik, decided to appeal the court’s decision, except Rabie E Ablaq. El Ablaq was on a hunger strike for more than 40 days and suspended the strike just a week ago.

Rabat – France will lift the 2018 World Cup trophy after beating Croatia 4-2 in the final match played on Sunday at the Luzhniki stadium. Mario Mandzukic opened the scoring for France through an own goal at the 18 minute of the match. Mandzukic guided the ball into the top corner from Griezmann’s free kick, giving France the lead. Less than ten minutes later, Croatia responded to France with an excellent equalizer played by Ivan Perisic in the penalty zone. At the 38th minute of the game, France scored its second goal through a penalty. The finalists ended the first half with a 2-1 result, with Croatia hoping to stun its rival in the second half. Croatia, however, was not lucky enough to score an equalizer with the rival scoring two more goals in the first minutes of the second half.

France killed the match at 65 minute of the match through its superstar Kylian Mbappé. Croatia scored a goal following a glaring mistake by France’s goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.

Rabat – The EU-Morocco fisheries deal, one of the pillars of the longstanding strategic relationship between Morocco and the European Union, is on the brink of disintegrating as the two parties fail to agree on renewal terms. “Should any of the boats fail to comply with the deadline, sanctions will follow,” a Moroccan source told Le 360, suggesting that Rabat is inflexible on its current position. Javier Garat, president of the Spanish Confederation of Fisherman, said yesterday that is a pity and a big regret that the two sides failed to reach an agreement that could have spared fishermen the ordeal of living in uncertainty while discussions continue. “We regret that negotiations have so far failed to reach a conclusion that would have prevented European fishers from leaving Moroccan coasts,” the Spaniard said. But while the two parties’ failure to find accommodating terms might herald alarming prospects for their longstanding strategic partnership, there are voices of optimism and hope on both sides. They echo the belief that the EU-Morocco alliance is important to the point that neither party can just decide to walk away while serious negotiations are underway, regardless of each party’s demands and requirements. According to such optimists, diverging interests and differences in perception are part and parcel of bilateral relations. But when a partnership is strong and valuable, and when both parties are conscious of the fruits they reap from collaborating, alliances always survives temporary differences. “A renewal is very much possible in coming days,” another Moroccan governmental source told Le 360, explaining that although the deadline has passed, negotiations never stopped between the two parties. “There are still Moroccan diplomats in Brussels discussing with their European counterparts as they try to find a solution,” he offered. The two sides—Brussels and Rabat—“will most probably reach an agreement in coming days, very soon,” another source was quoted by Medias 24 as saying. Most importantly perhaps, while current news had European fishermen worrying that the failure to renew the deal before the deadline would mean an indefinite halt for their activities, Medias 24 reported that both Rabat and the EU are environing a temporary resumption of the deal before reaching a final agreement. Quoting Moroccan sources, Medias 24 reported that a temporary resumption would entail continuation of activities until the renewal process is finalized, as opposed to putting everything on hold before negotiations reach a conclusive deal. As a result, instead of waiting for the bureaucratic and diplomatic hurdles that could take months or possibly a year, European fishermen can resume activities as soon as a basis is found for extending the deal. While there is little doubt regarding both parties’ willingness to save their mutually beneficial relationship by salvaging the expired deal, one question still hovers in the air, sidestepped and unanswered by officials on both sides: who will compromise? Within the framework of the expired deal, Morocco allowed 126 European fishing boats (90 from Spain and the rest from 10 other EU countries) to operate in Moroccan waters. In return, Morocco was getting EUR 40 million as financial compensation. Now, however, Morocco is requesting that the EU doubles that number, saying that it won’t sign a deal with financial compensation lower than EUR 80 million. Earlier this year, in February, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that the EU-Morocco fisheries deal is not applicable to Western Sahara. ECJ’s ruling argued that local populations were not getting benefit from the deal. Morocco, which saw the ruling as an attack on its national sovereignty, seized the European commission, making the case that not only was Morocco spending the lion’s share of the deal’s financial compensation in development projects in Western Sahara, but that it would not allow anyone to challenge its territorial integrity. On March 21, the European Commission dismissed the ECJ ruling, paving the path for a new deal that would include Western Sahara, a point Morocco said was non-negotiable. The two parties started negotiations on April 16, hoping to open what both expected would be a brand new chapter in their relationship. But since then, having easily compromised on the political and social implications of the renewal, Brussels is yet to agree with Morocco’s financial demands. Which leaves but one explanation: a certain –understandable—refusal on the EU’s part to always be the one making crucial compromises. Javier Garat, the Spanish fisherman, thinks that both sides should compromise on certain details. He argues that, after all, renewing the deal would yield enormous benefits for both Rabat and Brussels. While the EU must pay considerably more than it was, Rabat should reconsider its requests, perhaps a slight decrease in the MAD 800 million it is asking. Many European and Moroccan families’ livelihood depends on this deal, the Spaniard suggested. Many Moroccan officials, as quoted in recent news reports, agree with that. It, however, remains to be seen whether the EU will succeed in convincing Morocco to be a bit more flexible on its financial demands.

Rabat – The royal family of Spain is battling another corruption scandal. Princess Corinna Zu Sayn-Wittgenstein allegedly accused former King of Spain Juan Carlos I of using her name to purchase multiple properties in Morocco and elsewhere without her permission. German aristocrat Princess Corinna Zu Sayn-Wittgenstein made her claims against the former king in alleged leaked audio recordings. In the leaked audio recordings, Carlos’ alleged lover Corinna claimed that the former king has allegedly put her name on several properties, including a ground in Marrakech.  International media also reported that Carlos used the princess’ name to hide his fortunes, which is estimated at EUR 2 billion.  The princess’ allegations were published by the Spanish newspapers El Español and OK Diario. In 2015, the princess claimed in a conversation with a former Spanish officer in London that “she was being drawn into money laundering,” according to Telegraph. The princess has also accused the king’s lawyers of putting her name on overseas properties without her permission. In the leaked recordings, which were unveiled on Wednesday, the princess said she was facing a “nightmare.” “But if do it, it is money laundering,” she allegedly said in the recordings. “They are putting me under tremendous pressure to return these things, but if I do it I am breaking the law I could go to jail.” The Monaco-based princess added that the king made her put the properties under her name not “because he loves me a lot but because I reside in Monaco.” The palace has not yet responded to the claims made by the German aristocrat. When the leaked recordings went public, Corinna issued a statement in which she denounced “a campaign of politically motivated discredit” against her. “I have always acted entirely correctly and I continue to live my life with a peaceful outlook, irrespective of years of constant harassment and attempts to publicly discredit me with endless false information,” she explained. In June, the brother-in-law of Felipe VI King of Spain, Inaki Urdangarin, was sentenced by the Spanish Supreme Court to five years and ten months in prison on corruption charges.

Rabat – Morocco’s Royal Navy rescued at least 80 sub-Saharan migrants from an overcrowded boat in the Mediterranean on Friday, July 13. After receiving first aid from the members of the Royal Navy, the undocumented migrants were transferred to the Zahta military port in Ksar El Kebir, a city in North Morocco. Authorities have intervened to stop 162 other migrants as they were planning to reach the El Dorado through rickety boats. Friday’s attempt came in the wake of a UN conference held in New York on Friday. The conference aimed at finding lasting measures to protect the safety and dignity for all migrants, regardless of their document’ statues The conference has also decided to sign the Global Pact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in Marrakech on December 10-11. Morocco’s efforts heard During the conference, several UN representatives, including UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres saluted Morocco’s efforts to address migration issues. Morocco’s role in intercontinental migration has grown, as it is increasingly viewed as a destination country, in addition to a transit nation. King Mohammed VI Morocco also launched the National Policy on Immigration and Asylum in 2013. In 2017, UNHCR’s Assistant High Commissioner for Protection Volker Turk told Morocco World News that Morocco is now establishing itself as a destination for refugees and migrants. “Morocco remains a transit country for refugees and migrants, it is also fast becoming a country of destination,” said Volker. Morocco, however, has been calling for more lasting solutions recently to end the struggles faced by migrants. Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said in June that Morocco will refuse any action from the European Union to outsource migrant reception centers to Morocco, emphasizing that this suggestion is an “easy solution.”  Hundreds of sub-Saharan migrants arrive in Morocco using perilous crossing from the North African country to Europe, especially Spain. The number of undocumented migrants using sea routes from Morocco to Spain has more than tripled in the last two years.

Rabat – After Ronaldo’s departure that has caused shockwaves within the football world, Real Madrid is seeking to recruit a new talented replacement for the attacker.  Several names have been proposed, including Neymar Junior and French superstar Paul Pogba. Several media believe that the Belgium star, Eden Hazard, who currently play with Chelsea is preparing to join Real Madrid, to strengthen its attack line. The Danish former footballer, Brian Laudrup, has informed Sportske Novosti about Hazard’s exit. “I spoke to Eden Hazard a few days ago, he is preparing for a move to Real Madrid and it is a good move both for him and for Real.” “Again in Russia, he proved how good he is,” he said. Speaking to beIN Sports last month, Hazard indirectly revealed his intention to join Los Blancos. “I think Real is everyone’s dream,” he said. “For now, it’s the World Cup. As I have said at least 100 times, I am at Chelsea and for the moment nobody has made me an offer,” said the footballer. Chelsea finished fifth this season, thus, it will not play the Champions League, but such a talented player as Hazard should compete in the biggest tournaments. Real Madrid is the perfect destination for every football star. Hazard delivered an outstanding performance in the Premier League with 12 goals in 34 matches last season. In the World Cup, the 27-year-old attacking midfielder has led his Belgian team to several victories against football giants as he scored the second goal for Belgium in the ranking match against England offering his country’s the third place globally.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Interior has given instructions for measures to be put in place to strengthen security after the terrorist attack against a National Guard patrol in Tunisia on July 8. The ministry called on its forces to increase security across the country, based on the exchange of security information between Morocco and its European partners, reported Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia on Thursday. The strategy aims at reinforcing internal security and to fight against any attack that would undermine the stability of the country. Quoted by the same source, the Ministry of the Interior said: “The Moroccan security services have stepped up coordination and exchange of information with the European and Maghreb security services on possible terrorist threats.” The security cooperation also includes the Tunisian security services. According to Al Ahdath Al Maghribia, the measures came as a security plan hastily put in place by the Moroccan authorities. The plan aims at protecting and preventing any harm to national security or physical safety of foreigners and tourists, in addition to diplomats and employees working in consulates and embassies. The security measures will cover hotels, tourist and entertainment resorts, and foreign chambers of commerce offices. The ministry also gave instructions to security forces to carry out careful inspection of passengers’ identities and baggage at airports, especially the Mohammed V Airport in Casablanca. At the national level, checkpoints were set up at city entrances to check passengers’ identities and inspect suspicious buses and vehicles. Security cells, directly linked to the Ministry of the Interior, have been established in each city. These cells are composed of members of the National Security, the Royal Gendarmerie, auxiliary forces, the Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DST) and the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST). They were put on full alert in case of threats or suspicious movements that may affect public security, Al Ahdath Al Maghribia added. For decades, Morocco has collaborated with partner countries, especially Europe and the US, in combating terrorism at the national and international levels.  On June 12, French and Belgian authorities announced a joint anti-terrorism unit with Morocco to share their intelligence experience in the fight against terrorism.  In December 2017, the US Department of State said that Morocco, along with the US, was making leading global efforts in the fight against terrorism and its ideologies. It also noted Morocco’s security achievements in countering terrorism in 2016. In response to terrorist threats, Morocco’s proactive, collaborative measures to prevent potential terrorist attacks have proven their effectiveness. Last June, Director of Counter-Terrorism Bureau (BCIJ) Abdelehak Khiame told the French magazine Valeurs Actuelles that Morocco’s anti-terrorist model is successful thanks to an “anticipatory philosophy,” which deals with terrorism at its very roots. In the last 10 years, the Moroccan security services have been waging a pre-emptive campaign which has enabled them to dismantle tens of sleeper and active cells linked to terrorist networks, especially the so-called Islamic State (ISIS). Since the beginning of July, BCIJ has dismantled two separate terrorist cells, totaling eleven pro-ISIS suspects in different regions in Morocco.

Rabat – The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has called on Portugal and Spain to ban sardine fishing in 2019 due to a reduction in stocks over the past few years. A report from ICES notes that the sardine stock has declined since 2006 and is now under 0.4 tonnes. The statement, which was widely reported by both international and local media, emphasized that “there should be zero captures in 2019.” The zero catch may help the increase of adult stocks by 20 percent and would give Sardines a breathing space to recover, according to Algarve Daily. The statement added that “the number of young fish has been below average since 2005, reaching its worst result in 2017” (less than 5,000 tonnes). In 2017, ICES urged Portugal and Spain to suspend sardine fishing completely in 2018, according to the Portugal News The proposal was dismissed by APROPESCA fishing association, which claimed that the proposed fishing ban in 2018 “would lead to the death of the industry.” “If the ban goes ahead, it will lead to the death of the fishing industry, especially those operating smaller vessels. The minister has no idea of the damage that a ban will cause to countless families,” the chairman of the association said. Spain and Portugal are among the largest consumers of seafood in Europe, according to a study by the New Economics Foundation (NEF) in 2017. The research listed Spain as the third largest seafood consumer with an average consumption of 42 kilograms per person annually. Portugal led the list with an average consumption of 54 kilograms per person annually.

Rabat – Morocco has denied widespread reports that Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan was gifted a private jet, slamming the allegations as “fake news from Algerian media.” On July 10, Algerian news outlet Algeriepatriotique claimed that King Mohammed VI “has just offered his son, Crown Prince Moulay Hassan, a brand new Gulfstream G650 VIP jet.” The publication was published under the title “Mohammed VI has his son protected by the Israelis.” Quoting the Middle East Eye (MEE), the Algerian news outlet reported that Morocco ordered the jet in 2015. The source added that Israeli aerospace and defense company Elbit Systems has equipped the alleged gift. MEE also shared pictures of the said private jet. The news, which was termed as “fake news,” was widely reported by some Moroccan news outlets, including Le Desk and Telquel. In response, a military source condemned the fake news, emphasizing that the small jet was purchased by the Royal Armed Forces (FAR) for official trips of senior officials. According to Moroccan newspaper Assabah, the same source added that Morocco received the new jet as part of its strategy to reinforce its air defense. Assabah explained that the airplane, which was used by government members and senior officials, can no longer be used for domestic and international flights after 25 years of services. The source also denied that the private jet is equipped with advanced military assets. “The information leaked by some anti-Moroccan parties is part of a propaganda war, against Morocco’s strategy to reinforce its military equipment and the development of its efficiency,” added the unidentified source. Slamming the allegations, the unidentified source added that Algeria “recruited an army of instigators, which includes five thousand people,” who share “negative comments on the kingdom and make up rumors and fake news about Morocco.” The same source also accused Algeria of fabricating videos and sharing them to “undermine the security” of Morocco. In recent months, Morocco has received several shipments of US-made weapons and tanks as part of agreements signed between Morocco and the US” in order to reinforce its military defense potential. The North African country is also expected to receive a new delivery of US-made anti-ship missiles; including the AGM-158 JASSM, RGM and UGM, reported Defense Industry Daily earlier this month.

Washington D.C – “This journey of creating mobile apps started a year ago when I started working here in Morocco with Moroccans friends for seven months and we failed terribly,” stated winner and CEO of Weego, Saad Jittou. After struggling with the startup, 23-year-old Jittou was selected as the winner of Seedstar 2018 and will be representing Morocco on the international stage. Jittou is the CEO and founder of Weego, an app that allows individuals to move easily by utilizing public transportation. The young entrepreneur has collaborated and launched other projects such as Pikala Bikes and his own accessories brand. Starting with a group of young entrepreneurs, the Moroccan team built the app from the ground up and launched it in Dakar, Senegal. Weego was then picked up by the Ministry of Transportation in Morocco. From there, they attended Viva Tech Paris, where a lot of major corporations noticed and became interested in their work. After two months, the team moved their app service into the Moroccan Market. Pitching with seven other major startups in La Factory, Weego won first place to continue to Regionals in Beirut, where they will be supported by SEEDSTAR. Weego was started because of a need for communication between the public transportation companies and the people waiting to use their services. “I was thinking about how to solve a big problem, which is waiting for long hours and in complete uncertainty for the buses. It’s a big problem. Working women who work far from the center of the city where they work in factories and they will wait for the bus for long amounts of time in far zones. They leave at 7 PM at night and they feel unsafe. [Weego] is a solution where they can wait in the factory and be notified when the buses arrive,” said Jittou. This offers security and comfort for workers to relieve stress and offers an opportunity to use time more efficiently. “I did not expect to win. I am the youngest candidate here. It’s a lot to take in this stage,” exclaimed Jittou. Regionals will be in November in Beirut, where teams compete for the national stage in April 2019 in Switzerland.

Rabat – Algeria has stopped mass expulsions of sub-Saharan migrants, after global outcry caused by the alarming conditions and the “indiscriminate and inhumane” manner in which Algerian authorities were deporting migrants, according to the Associated Press. But expulsion numbers have considerably decreased since late June following the global outcry caused by news of sub-Saharan migrants’ plight in Algeria.  An OIM (International Organization for Migration) spokesperson told the BBC this week that the number of migrants entering Niger and Mali from Algeria have “dropped significantly.”  Mass deportation and human rights abuses The move comes after reports of mass expulsions and immigrants being forced to march in the Sahara Desert sparked outrage and criticism in the media and international organizations. Algerian authorities have been said to have forcibly and inappropriately expelled over 100,000 migrants from West Africa in recent years.  International organizations, including the UN, OIM, and Human Rights Watch, have decried the patent mistreatment to which migrants were subjected during expulsions, as well as Algerian authorities’ glaring disregard for migrants’ rights. The Associated Press, which has been covering Algeria’s tough measures on immigration and the country’s somber records on migrants’ rights, has reported galling scenes during expulsions.  Many of the expelled sub-Saharans were abandoned in the Sahara Desert at the mercy of unbearable heat (above 50 degrees centigrade) and hordes of dangers and insecurity involving human traffickers. Since May 2017, more than 13,000 migrants were indiscriminately “dropped off” in some of the most dangerous spots of the Sahara Desert. Once abandoned in the Sahara, migrants had to walk cross the desert in what one of the interviewed migrants likened to “walking through hell.” Outrage and condemnations Although Algerian government has consistently denied mistreating migrants, criticism and condemnations from both African officials and international observers (generally human rights activists) have piled up both in African and international circles in recent months.  “Algeria has the power to control its borders, but that doesn’t mean it can round up people based on the color of their skin and dump them in the desert, regardless of their legal status and without a shred of due process,” Sarah Leah Whitson of Human Rights Watch has been quoted as saying. And while some African states had replied to news of mass expulsions by recalling their ambassadors from Algiers, the African Union Commission’s chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat complained this week about the situation, hinting that the news is even more worrying as it is happening on African soil. “We cannot accept African countries ill-treating Africans, even if they enter the country illegally,” Mahamat said. Algeria’s response In May, Algeria’s foreign affairs ministry denied all allegations of ill-treatment and inappropriate expulsions, saying that the reports were accusations aiming to undermine Algeria’s image and taint is relations with its southern neighbors. The ministry said that expulsions were done in “full respect for human rights and dignity” and with consultation of migrants’ home countries. In addition to decreasing the number of expulsions, Algeria recently fired two top security officials believed to be connected to the expulsion rounds and other trafficking networks. But with suspicions that the North African country’s softening stance on mass expulsions is a strategic move to temporarily fend off criticism and appease the outrage it caused in recent months, it remains to be seen how Algeria fares on migrants’ rights in the near future.  Meanwhile, Algeria, like a number of other African countries which included Morocco, recently declined the European Union’s proposal to establish immigrants’ treatment centers to categorize immigrants seeking to reach Europe.

Rabat – Morocco’s government has expressed concern about the increase in fuel prices and protectionism ahead of the presentation of the draft of 2019 Finance Bill. The government said in a statement that 2019 “will be fraught with challenges due to increasing protectionist tendencies in the international economy and rising oil prices.” Reuters reported on Friday that the North African country is the “largest energy importer” in the region with MAD 70 billion of imports in 2017. Morocco’s government spokesperson Mustapha  El Khalfi said following the weekly Government Council that the 2018’s budget “was based on an estimate of $60 dollars per barrel while the average price on the international market rose to $73.” The Governor of Central  Bank Abdellatif Jouhari also expressed concerns about rising oil prices, emphasizing that this increase may have an “immediate impact” on Morocco’s economy. The government has been under heavy pressure with millions of Moroccans expressing their anger about the increase in fuel prices and the high prices of primary goods. Last April, millions of Moroccans launched a boycott campaign to targeting dairy products, bottled water and a major fuel company.   Like the government, Morocco’s High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) attributed the increase of fuel prices in Morocco to the increase in prices on the international market.  In a statement published in June, HCP said that fuel prices continued to rise, reaching MAD 10 per liter at the end of May 2018, compared to MAD 7 at the beginning of 2017. On June 8, El Khalfi acknowledged the pressure resulting  from the rising fuel prices, emphasizing that the government “is aware of the problem of hydrocarbon prices and the need to find practical solutions to this issue.”

Rabat- Morocco’s observatory, Oukaimeden Sky Survey (MOSS) at Cadi Ayyad University of Marrakech was first to discover binary asteroids, “2017 YE5” described as a “Potentially Hazardous Asteroid,” reported NASA. According to NASA Morocco’s Oukaimeden Sky Survey spotted the Near-Earth asteroid, YE5 on December 21, 2017 and provided the information to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA. The MOSS team discovered more than 1000 asteroids between 2011 and 2017 and sent more than one million astrometric measurements to the Minor Planet Center in Boston. At the time of YE5’s discovery, there were no details about the asteroids’ physical properties until the end of June 2018. The World’s largest radio telescopes at the Center for Solar System Studies in Rancho Cucamonga, California and at Green Bank Observatory (GBO) in West Virginia, discovered that the 2017 YE5 asteroid is actually made up of two space rocks revolving around each other. The binary asteroids are each about 3,000 feet (900 meters) in size and orbit each other once every 20 to 24 hours. YE5 is the fourth equal mass binary near-Earth asteroid detected so far. According to NASA, there are about 4,700 potentially hazardous asteroids. If a near-Earth asteroids smashed into Earth, it would wipe out a city or even destroy a continent. A twin asteroid would double the damage. YE5  which approached Earth on June 21, will come closer to Earth again in the next 170 years coming within 3.7 million miles of humanity’s homeworld, explained NASA.

Rabat – As Rabat and Brussels show no signs of reaching an agreement following a month-long negotiations to renew the EU-Morocco fisheries deal, Europeans fishing boats have started preparing to leave Moroccan waters, heightening fishermen’s concerns about the future of the deal and raising questions as to how long the rift between the two strategic partners will last. During the third rounds of the fisheries deal-related discussions between Morocco and its EU partners, the North African nation hardened its stance and asked for a financial compensation of MAD 800 million, as opposed to the 400 million of the expiring agreement. According to Moroccan outlet Akhbar Al Youm, European diplomats did not compromise with Morocco’s financial demands for renewing the deal, leading European boats no choice but to depart from Moroccan waters since the deal expires on July 14. The Casablanca-based daily reported that European fishermen have until July 15 to leave Moroccan coasts. “The worst that could have been carefully prevented has finally happened,” complained Javier Garat, a Spanish fisherman president of the association of European fishing companies operating in Moroccan waters under the terms of the EU-Morocco deal.  For Garat, however, it is just a matter of time before Rabat and Brussels manage to find a mutually acceptable basis for renewal, as both parties have reaped enormous benefits off the agreement in the recent years. “The two parties have converging positions, but there exist some minor details [differences] that have not been addressed,” the Spanish said. He added, however, that European fishermen will have to wait for weeks or even a year before the two parties satisfy all the diplomatic and bureaucratic requirements associated with the renewal process. Citing Spanish sources, Akhbar Al Youm reported that further discussions are expected between Rabat and Brussels given that European fishermen and many workers’ rights advocacy groups are putting enormous pressure on their respective governments to save the “crucial” agreement. “It would be a great pity if the deal is not renewed by its expiry date, because Morocco has made it clear that during second roundtables that all European boats should depart from European water [should Brussels fail to compromise],” Pedro Maza, president of a fishermen’s association in Spain, said last month amid rumors that Brussels and Rabat were having a hard time finding a common ground regarding the renewal of the fisheries agreement. But even in the event of new discussions to renew the deal, Rabat is very unlikely to compromise on its current position. This week, Aziz Akhannouch, Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Rural Development, was adamant about Morocco’s requirements to sign a new deal. In addition to the MAD 800 million Morocco is requesting from the EU as financial compensation, European fishermen and fishing companies should henceforth be careful about other tiny details of the deal, including quantity, species, and biodiversity, the Moroccan minister said.

Rabat- Morocco’s recent efforts at modernization and digitized economy have not gone unnoticed in international circles, with a new study ranking the North African nation among the countries leading technological advances and innovation-driven development in the MENA region. Despite some structural setbacks, especially regarding institutional hurdles sustained by a political culture still–to a considerable degree–unwelcoming of unorthodox ways of creation wealth or capital, Morocco is among the innovation and information technology trailblazers of North Africa and the Arab World, according to the latest Global Innovation Index annual report. Published by Cornel University, the 2018 Global Innovation Index looked at the factors driving innovation, sustainable and efficient energy-driven development in the four corners of the world, with a special focus on renewable energy, inputs in knowledge production, competitive businesses, and the place of smart energy in the future of economic development and scientific breakthroughs. Morocco, which ranked 76 out of 126 nations on the global stage, is 8th in the Arab world behind most of the energy rich Gulf countries but ahead of some other regional leaders, including Lebanon (90th). Morocco is second in North Africa behind Tunisia (66th) but ahead of Egypt (76th) and Algeria (110th). Regarding specific numbers and overall performance, Morocco has an overall efficiency ratio of 65 and the country fared relatively well in some sub-disciplines, especially in infrastructure (50th), institutions (75th), knowledge and technology outputs (78th), and creative outputs (70th). Morocco’s lowest performances come in Business sophistication (115th), Market sophistication (93th), and human capital and research (84th), suggesting that despite efforts to further modernize the country’s industrial and information sectors, the North African nation still needs to further boost investments in knowledge creation and impactful research projects. The 2018 Global Innovation Index comes at a time when Moroccan authorities and leading entrepreneurs are growing conscious of the role that technological advances and efficient energy play in achieving sustainable development and other millennium objectives. Moroccan universities are among the top performers in the region, while the Innov Invest and Maroc Numeric projects have invested colossal funds to promote innovation in information technology and research. In Africa, only South Africa and Tunisia outperform Morocco when it comes to investments in education, knowledge creation, and information technology-related businesses. And while the global innovation scene is largely dominated by Europe, developing or middle income countries like China, Brazil, and India featured remarkable innovative traits that signal that the non-Western world will be the battleground of the world’s future, the report noted.

Rabat- Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari has finally decided to sign the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), expressing his country’s willingness to finally join other African nations in realizing a continental dream of boosting intra-African exchanges.  President Buhari made the announcement on July 11 following a closed-door meeting with South African president Cyril Ramaphosa, who was on a working visit in the West African country. Speaking at a joint president with his South African counterpart, President Buhari expressed his “readiness to sign the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement,” according to the Nigerian Guardian. “I am very careful about what I sign, whether it is my checkbook or agreements, especially when it involves nation-states,” the Nigerian president said, confirming earlier reports that Nigeria had qualms about the AfCFTA’s political and economic implications for the Nigerian economy. President Buhari further explained that he is a “slow reader” and needed more time than his advisors to reach a decision regarding the continental agreement. Although many of his advisors had told him that the deal involved numerous benefits for the Nigerian economy, President Buhari said he wanted to base his decision on his own reading of the agreement text. “I was presented with the document, I am a very slow reader, maybe because I am an ex-soldier. I didn’t read it fast enough before my officials saw that it was alright for signature. I kept it on my table. I will soon sign it.” In March of this year, Nigeria shocked Africa observers and analysts when it backed down from signing an agreement to whose buildup it had hugely contributed. Many African leaders, including Morocco’s Mohammed VI, South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa, and Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, described the AfCFTA as an opportunity to strengthen intra-African exchanges and reclaim Africa’s financial independence.  For the 44 countries who in March signed the agreement in Kigali, Rwanda, the AfCFTA, when fully implemented, will be a platform to help accelerate the process of Africa’s economic independence, dispelling the global market’s so-called neo-imperialism keeping many African countries from fulfilling their potential. However, President Buhari said at the time that he would not sign a contract that could have detrimental implications for his country’s economy. But the Nigerian leader’s protectionist rhetoric was later slammed by some who saw it as a bogus protectionism since it allegedly aimed to protect the interests of cooperate Nigeria over those of Nigeria as a nation. Despite strong criticism regarding its feasibility, the AfCFTA envisions guaranteeing free movement of persons and goods across the continent, in addition to establishing a single currency in the long term, attracting investments, expanding intra-Africa connectivity, and “unleashing the creativity of Africa’s youth and entrepreneurs.”

Rabat – President of the international football federations (FIFA) Gianni Infantino said that joint bids for World Cup are his favorite.  “I believe in joint bids because the World Cup is an enormous event,” said Infantino as he was commenting on the countries that showed interest in submitting joint bids to host the World Cup in 2030. After its loss to United 2026 on June 13, Morocco expressed its intention to bid for 2030 World Cup. Algeria and Tunisia have both expressed their willingness to study the possibility of bidding with Morocco to host a Maghreb World Cup in 2030. In a press conference held in Moscow today, Infantino expressed satisfaction with the 21st FIFA World Cup in Russia and the use of video assistant referee (VAR).  Infantino described Russia 2018 as the “best World up” ever. He also stressed that the tournament has “changed” the host country for the better. Amid controversy over the use of VAR during the ongoing World Cup games, Infantino said that VAR  is “cleaning football.” FIFA has been the target of an international backlash targeting referees and the VAR. Morocco was among the countries that were deprived of the use of the VAR during its participation in the 2018 World Cup. Moroccans fans, international commentators and footballers blamed the non-use of the VAR for Morocco’s elimination. Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) also condemned the mistakes committed by referees in Morocco’s World Cup games against Spain and Portugal. However, FIFA said that the referees’ decisions without the VAR were 95 percent correct in 335 analyzed incidents and were 99.3 percent correct with the use of var. According to FIFA’s numbers, VAR examined 335 incidents, including all goals, an average of 6.9 incidents examined per match. The World Cup has reached its final phase with the two finalists, Croatia and France,  preparing to play the final game on July 15.

Rabat – Omar Balafrej, MP of the Federation of the Democratic Left (FGD) has criticized Moroccan fuel companies of “immorally and unreasonably” making an additional profit of  MAD 17 billion from the liberalization of fuel prices. Balafrej has also proposed the retrieval of the extra profit the companies made, owing to the liberalization of fuel prices enacted in December 2015. Balafrej recommended Tuesday in a plenary session of the House of Representatives retrieving MAD 17 billion in profits from oil companies for government-funded projects. “I found it strange that none of the MPs or heads of parties have raised the issue of retrieving the 17 billion dirhams. It’s not a ‘trivial’ amount,” he said. Balafrej fervently explained to MPs the potential projects that the government could implement with MAD 17 billion.

“With 17 billion dirhams we could build: two tunnels under Tichka, train railway to Al-Hoceima or Rachidia, 17 university hospitals, and 6,000 cultural centers. As for education, which is the major priority, 1,000 community schools could be built and enough teachers could be employed, functional housing could be provided for all teachers in Morocco; free transport for all school and university students, computers for all school and university students in Morocco, and MAD 1,700 scholarships could be provided to each university student.”  MP Abdellah Bouanou of PJD also stated in May that the difference between the government’s set prices and today’s prices is nearly MAD 1 per liter. “Moroccans annually consume some 6.5 million tons [of fuel]. So, we easily reach 7 billion dirhams in additional profit in one year.” Balafrej’s call for national reconciliation Balafarj also made remarks on the sentences pronounced against Moroccan activists involved in the Al Hoceima protest. Balafrej’s proposed projects covered the main economic and social sectors including education, transport, and health. However, at the end of his 2-min talk, Balafrej stressed that national reconciliation should be given priority over education.  “Today, there are concerns more important than education, and there are those who will be surprised at this because I have always insisted on education,” Balafrej said. Criticizing the heavy sentences given to Hirak Rif activists on June 26, the politician said: “Today’s priority is for national reconciliation, because we need relief. Enough nihilism, don’t be nihilistic.” Balafrej and MP Mustapha Chennaoui of the FGD party have already taken action towards securing the release of political detainees . On June 29, they  introduced a proposed law requesting general amnesty for all political detainees involved in social movements over the past two years.  The proposal is based on Article 71 of the Moroccan Constitution, which stipulates that general amnesty can be requested by Parliament. In Article 1 of the draft law, the FGD called for “general amnesty for all acts related to protests that occurred in Morocco from October 28, 2016 to June 28, 2018.”

Rabat – The Minister of Education, Vocational Training and Scientific Research, Said Amzazi, said that the development of preschool education necessitates an annual budget of MAD 3 billion. In his presentation held on Thursday, July 12 in front of the Government Council, Amzazi said that his ministry will launch a national program of generalization and reform of the pre-primary education in Morocco. According to Amzazi, the ministry will launch the program on July 18 to include the 2018-2019 academic year and will run to 2028. According to the official, the program aims at reaching a school enrollment of 67 percent by 2021-2021 and 100 percent by 2027-2028. Through this program, the ministry of education pledged to reduce dropout rates and to improve the education system. According to Amzazi, the program also aims at offering training to teachers, reinforce integration of teachers into the job market, and add 57,000 additional classes and 55,000 teachers by 2027-2028.
In 2017, the ministry of education announced that the number of student dropouts decreased by 15.3 percent to a record low of 279,111 during the 2016-2017 academic year from the 329,618 in  2015-2016. More work to be done School dropouts remains an issue that Morocco still is working to reduce.  In its 2017 annual labor survey, Morocco’s High Commissioner of Planning (HCP) unveiled worrying figures of children who left schools for employment. The report says that 247,000 out of 7,049,000 children aged between seven and 17 face the burden of employment. Some of the children’s responsibilities are considered vastly too dangerous for their age. Lack of schools in rural areas is also contributed to the issue of school dropout. Despite progress in access to preschool education in Morocco, only 43 percent of Moroccan children aged 4-5 were enrolled in preschool and only 27.9 percent in rural areas between 2015-2016, according to a 2017 World Bank report. The report also added that the quality of preschool education “varies tremendously, and the lack of an effective quality-assurance mechanism at this level hinders substantial improvements in quality and consistency.”

Rabat – Spain’s Atletico Madrid was not happy to hear about Morocco’s Ayoub El Kaabi’s transfer to Chinese football club. The Atlas Lion reportedly  signed a two year contract with the Hebei fortune on June 11, and was confirmed by his former club Berkane’s Sport Renaissance (RSB) on social media that day. According to close sources cited by Arabic outlet Assabah, the Spanish team blames RSB Berkane’s lack of communication regarding the transfer of the striker. Very interested in the 25-year-old footballer, Atletico Madrid had reached out to the Moroccan club several times to get a deal but in vain. Atletico Madrid,  informed of the deal by social media, expected more professionalism from the Moroccan club. citing it was the first to make an offer on El Kaabi, and had offered a considerable sum.. However, RSB  opted for the Chinese Championship, selling its best scorer for almost EUR 6 million. “RSB Berkane agreed to Ayoub El Kaabi’s transfer (…) He signed a two-and-a-half-year contract in his first professional experience outside Morocco. On this occasion, we thank Ayoub Al Kaabi after a special season with the team. We wish him all the success in his career,” wrote his former club on Facebook.

Rabat – The House of Representatives of the Moroccan Parliament has opened an investigation into the prevalence of so-called human mules at Ceuta crossing points, where several Moroccan women die every year in stampedes. According to MP Abdelwadoud Kharbouch, the investigation falls within the domain of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Islamic Affairs and Moroccans Residing Abroad. Several representatives of different Moroccan parliamentary groups were appointed to conduct this mission, including Kharbouch. “The main purpose of this mission is to focus on the general conditions at the Bab Sebta (Ceuta) crossing, in particular the situations of neglected children and women carrying goods,” Kharbouch told the state-owned agency, Maghreb Arab Press. The investigation also aims at monitoring the situation of mule women, who carry heavy loads of goods through the Ceuta checkpoints. The decision also seeks to study “the human and social conditions in which [these women] work, as well as the impact [smuggling] has on the national economy and the social component in the region.” According to official numbers given by Kharbouch, 8,500 human mules, of which about 3,000 are estimated to be women, carry goods out of Ceuta’s crossing points. The investigation, launched on July 11, will continue until July 13. On Wednesday, members of the parliament held a meeting in Tetouan with concerned representatives of security forces. The commission will meet to evaluate the outcome of the investigation on Friday, July 13. In January 2018, two Moroccan women were killed while several others were injured in a stampede at one of the entrance gates of the Ceuta’s crossing border. In 2017, three fatal stampedes were reported. The first two incidents each claimed the lives of one Moroccan woman and the third tragedy,  which occurred on August 28, killed two and injured several others. Spanish authorities made a deal with the Moroccan parliament in an effort to prevent such tragedies in the future. The agreement, which dates back to June 2017, allows women to cross the border only on Mondays and Wednesdays, while men will be permitted to cross on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Rabat – The latest report from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations shows that the global capture of fish is in decline.  The world caught 90.9 million tons of fish in 2016, down from 92.7 million tons in 2015. Total global fisheries and aquaculture production reached 170.9 million tonnes in 2016, with aquaculture representing 47 percent of that total. The total incomes of fisheries and aquaculture production in 2016 was estimated at USD 362 billion, of which USD 232 billion was from aquaculture production.  In 2016, human consumption from fish jumped to 20.3kg per capita in comparison to 10kg in the 1960s. This development is mainly due to the aquaculture growth. The report ranked China as the leader of major fish producing countries, with 15.2 million tonnes of fish in 2016. Indonesia follows, with 6.1 million tonnes. The United States of America and Russian Federation are ranked 3rd and 4th, with a production amount estimated at 4.9 million tonnes and 4.5 million tonnes, respectively. Morocco is 13th globally and first in Africa, with 1.4 million tonnes of fish production, showing an industry growth of 6 percent over the past two years. Over the past two years, China and Morocco were the largest exporters of octopus. Japan, the United States and Mediterranean European countries like Spain and Italy are the most important consumer markets.  In aquaculture, China is the top produce. In 2016, China farmed 49.2 million tons of fish. India comes in second, with 5.7 million tons.   Morocco’s fish production depends almost entirely on fisheries; it produced only 1000 tons of aquaculture fish in 2016. Egypt’s aquaculture production is the top in Africa, with 1.4 million tons in 2016. Both Morocco and Egypt are expected to double aquaculture production by 2030.
 Risks and Challenges However, the fisheries and aquaculture sector is facing some challenges, including the need to reduce the amount of fish stocks fished beyond biological sustainability. Moreover, with the emergence of new technologies in fisheries sector, the opportunities for improved fishing practices have multiplied. They can be used to select and target species, as well as reduce the loss of fishing gear. They make it possible to collect more information and use it more efficiently and effectively, increasing the predicted capacity. For some fishers and aquaculture farmers, new technologies have also created obstacles for them, due to their high price point.
 However, if abused, new technologies can also facilitate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing or can increase fishing power in general, and thus, the overexploitation of resources.
 To ensure the appropriate use of these new technologies, an effective management is in place to enhance the sector and improve the sustainability of fisheries.
 Climate change and marine pollution is another challenge that is negatively impacting the fishery sector. Many marine species are moving towards the poles, away from the rising heat at the equator, and into deeper water. An increase of fish density at higher latitudes causes a decrease in fish richness in tropical regions and lack of fish in inland waters.

Rabat- The International Monetary Fund and cost-estimating website HowMuch.net have listed Morocco among the countries that hold the largest stashes of foreign currency in the world. Morocco’s foreign reserves are estimated at USD 24.7 billion. Foreign exchange reserves are the foreign currencies that a country’s central bank holds. They also indicate the economic “health” of a country, according to HowMuch.net:  “They provide policymakers with a tool to control inflation, ensure the continual flow of imported goods into the country, and generally provide a sense of security in uncertain economic climates.” Albeit not in the top 10 countries with largest foreign currency reserves, Morocco’s reserves are worth USD 24.7 billion, compared to Hungary’s USD 28 billion, Bulgaria’s USD 25 billion, and Egypt’s 20.1 billion in reserves.   The top 10 countries with the biggest foreign currency reserves include: China leads with USD 3.162 billion of foreign currencies, followed by Japan’s (USD 1.205 billion);  Switzerland; (USD 785.7 billion); Saudi Arabia (USD 486.6 billion); Hong Kong (USD 437.5 billion); India (USD 397.2 billion); South Korea (USD 385.3 billion); Brazil (USD 358.3 billion); Russia (USD 356.5 billion); and Singapore (USD 279.8 billion). The survey excluded countries with less than USD 5 billion in reserves from the world economy data. Asia is the leading continent in terms of largest foreign currency reserves owing to China, Japan and Saudi Arabia’s large oil exports, in addition to other natural resources such as gas, iron ore, gold, and copper. According to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Saudi Arabia ranks as the largest petroleum exporter as it possesses around 18 percent of the world’s petroleum reserves. saudi Arabia’s oil and gas sector totals 50 percent of gross domestic product, and 70 percent of export earnings. Europe ranks second thanks to Switzerland’s foreign reserves, meanwhile North and South America are comparably smaller. Meanwhile, only four African countries made it onto the map of countries with the largest reserves: Morocco, Egypt, South Africa, and Mauritius.

Rabat – President Donald Trump has vowed to use American might to save “sad and vicious” Africa from its unending cycle of conflicts and political violence, according to a BBC report. Donald Trump made his comments while answering the remarks of a Tunisian journalist during a two-day NATO summit held earlier this week in Brussels. The Tunisian journalist reportedly expressed gratitude toward U.S. involvement in maintaining security and political stability in many hot spots on the African continent, especially in North Africa, where ISIS and Al Qaeda-affiliated insurgent groups have been wreaking havoc over the years. In response to the journalist’s comments, President Trump said that the U.S. has a long history of intervening in places that need help. “We want peace for Africa,” Trump said, going on to add that the continent is mired in conflicts and wars that no one in the global community can possibly understand. “Africa right now has got problems that like few people would even understand,” Trump remarked, explaining that his conviction that “through strength, you can get peace” and that his number one goal is to build a “tremendous military” to bring peace in Africa and all over the world. “If you saw some of the things that I see through intelligence—what’s going on in Africa—it is so sad, so vicious, and so violent. We want peace for Africa. We want peace all over the world.” But for all of Trump’s apparent commitment to global peace, his “sad” and “vicious” Africa rhetoric immediately stirred controversies in some African circles, with journalists and Twitter users slamming the American president’s condescending and patronizing tone. For these commentators, Trump’s comments reflect stereotyped discourse about Africa as a continent of war, famine, and all sort of problems. Such stereotypes fail to capture the diversity that exists across the continent’s many regions and countries, critics complained. “There are 54 countries in Africa! So which Africa is this has got ‘problems like few people would understand?’” one user asked. Others pointed out the hypocrisy in the U.S.’s obsession with saving others with problems in distant countries while veiling its own problems and unresolved social issues. “If Trump thinks Africa is vicious and violent, he should see an American school when a mass murderer is on rampage,” one Twitter user commented.

Rabat – Over 531,146 Moroccan living abroad have returned to Morocco via the country’s different entry points since the beginning of operation Marhaba 2018 on June 5. Responding to the chamber of representatives’ question  regarding preparations taken to ensure successful transits, the Minister Delegate for Moroccans Residing Abroad and Migration Affairs, Abdelkrim Benatiq, noted that 60 percent of the expatriates entered the country via  airways while 40 percent entered by sea or roads. As part of  Marhaba 2018, some 24 ships were mobilized, 11 of which to Tanger Med port, 4 between Tanger ville port and Tarifa, 3 between Almeria and Nador, and one between Nador and Martil. 
Benatiq also recalled that the Morocco-Spain Joint Commission held a meeting on May in M’diq to strengthen cooperation and streamline the transit operation to handle the large numbers of people who enter Morocco via Spain.

Rabat – Saudi Arabia welcomed FIFA’s decision to end pirated sports channel BeoutQ for illegal distribution of the 2018 World Cup, underlining its efforts to fight against illegal activities.  Last month, Qatar’s BeIN Sports had urged FIFA to take measures against the Saudi Arabian channel, investing GBP 12,000 to stop BeoutQ from stealing broadcasts of sports events.  On Wednesday, FIFA issued a statement opposing Beoutq, . “FIFA observes that the pirate entity beoutQ continues to illegally use the broadcast signal of the 2018 FIFA World Cup,” said the football giant in its statement.  “Therefore, the FIFA has to ask it council to initiate legal actions in Saudi Arabia and works in parallel with other rights holders assigned to protect his interests. The FIFA urges authorities in Saudi Arabia and various countries where these activities are illegal have been observed to support the fight against piracy,” adds the statement. Following FIFA’s declaration, Saudi Arabia’s media ministry said that this decision would “supplement the relentless efforts by the KSA Ministry of Commerce and Investment in fighting beoutQ’s activities”. “These efforts and others reinforce the Government of Saudi Arabia’s devotion to protecting intellectual property (IP) rights within KSA,” it said in a statement. Last month, before the beginning of the World Cup, tension mounted between Qatar and Saudi Arabia regarding transmissions BeIN Sports, which owns the broadcast rights to the World Cup, accused the Saudi-based pirate network of stealing the transmissions of games before the tournament and matches during 2018 World Cup in Russia.  The Saudi channel is “geo-locked”, so internet users across Saudi Arabia can access the channel for GBP 80.

Rabat – Latin American human rights NGOs and civil society associations denounced serious human rights abuses committed by the Polisario in Tindouf camps. Many Latin American NGOs and associations issued a statement, in which they condemned the “terror” imposed by Polisario in Tindouf camps where “Saharawi women, victims of inhuman treatment, are detained and deprived of the most basic freedoms.” These organizations and associations include the Global Africa Latina Foundation, Mexico’s Socpinda organization and the “urban civil association,” Oaxaca’s human rights organizations, Dominican Republic’s Committee for World Peace, Human and Municipal Rights, and the “Peru’s Foundation of Education and Enterprise,” according to the state-owned press Maghreb Arab News (MAP). The organizations accused Polisario of kidnapping and humiliating Sahrawi women in Tindouf camps. “Women kidnapped and held against their will in Tindouf camps by Polisario, are deprived of their rights as women and the opportunity to realize their dreams and ambitions and forced to submit to a cause without horizon.” Maloma Morales, a Spanish young Sahrawi woman was kidnapped in December 2015, after she had traveled with her adoptive family members to the camps to visit her biological mother. In August 2014, Mahyuba Mohamed Hamdidaf, another Spanish young Saharawi woman was kidnapped in Tindouf camps as soon as traveled to see her grandparents who were seriously ill. In June 20, the Members of the European Parliament condemned forced marriages, deprivation of liberty, ill-treatment, and torture imposed on women in Tindouf camps in Algeria.  The MEPs called on the Algerian and Spanish government to take action to end the situation. The organizations expressed their support for Morocco’s efforts to combat terrorism, drug and human trafficking crimes in the Sahara region borders. The NGOs further expressed their support for Morocco’s efforts and UN Security Council resolutions aimed at finding a mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara conflict. Earlier this month, Khat Achahid, a group of former Polisario members, wrote a letter to the AU about the Polisario Front’s violations of human rights and executions of Sahrawis. The group accused Polisario’s leader of human rights abuses in Tindouf camps, including arrests, torture, and executions when he served as Polisario’s Minister of Defense. The movement stated that 650 people went missing from Tindouf camps from 1975 to 1991, and they were subjected to various types of torture and executions without trials.

Rabat – Brazil’s vote in favor of Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid has not gone unnoticed. Nearly a month after the FIFA vote, Alejandro Dominguez, President of the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL), described Brazil’s decision as “shameful.” In an interview with Globo television on July 10, Dominguez criticized Brazil’s change of heart to vote for the Morocco bid,  as all members of the CONMEBOL agreed to vote for United 2026. Dominguez said that the confederation is suffering “diplomatic issues” due to the vote held on June 13 in Moscow at the FIFA 68th Congress. Brazil was the only South American country to vote against the United 2026 bid at the vote. After the direct threat from US President Donald Trump before the vote, CONMEBOL along with several other countries, including South Africa and Saudi Arabia,  decided to cast their votes in favor of the North American bid. The threat also pushed CONMEBOL to reject the request from Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid committee for one final presentation of its candidacy before the FIFA vote. “We have to answer with a refusal to your request due to the fact that the time available for presentations at the Moscow meeting will be limited,” CONMEBOL wrote in their refusal letter to the Moroccan committee. Finishing its statement, the confederation added that it has already “confirmed its commitment to support the Canada, Mexico and USA bid.” Morocco lost its chance to host the 2026 World Cup as the United bid clinched 67 percent of the vote. However, the North African country is determined to be the second African nation to host the tournament after South Africa. Morocco has also voiced its intention to bid for the World Cup 2030. The decision received applause from neighboring countries, including Algeria and Tunisia. Both countries said that they are ready to consider the possibility of jointly bidding with Morocco to host the 2030 World Cup. A joint North African bid would face a another joint bid, as in 2017 Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay submitted their application to bid for the 2030 World Cup. Egypt and England also voiced their intention to host the 24th FIFA World Cup.

Rabat – In response to reports in the Senegalese press accusing the Mauritanian government of causing distress in a Senegalese village by suddenly closing the border with Senegal, Mauritanian authorities have issued a statement denying the allegations, slamming the reports as incomplete and sensationalist narratives.  Yesterday, the Senegalese daily? Les Echos ?relayed that Mauritanian authorities had closed borders with Senegal in the Morphil region of Senegal.?   According to the report, dozens of villagers in the Senegalese locality were denied free movement to attend their farming and fishing activities on the Mauritanian side of the 700 km border between the two countries.?   Les Echos quoted Senegalese villagers complained that police patrols limited villagers’ movements and prevented them from tending to their daily businesses. “Meanwhile, Mauritanians are free to enter Senegal,” one of the villagers fumed.?  However, the Mauritanian government said in a statement that the decision was wrongly relayed in the Senegalese press, as it only concerned the closure of risky and unofficial transit points between the two countries.?  The statement noted that while there are 35 official passage points at the border between the two countries, some fishermen and farmers continued using “unauthorized” entry points.?  “Only irregular and unauthorized entry points [in Mauritania] have been closed,” the statement read.

Rabat – Hakim Ziyech’s future destination remains a mystery. After being rumored to sign with AS Roma, it seems that the Moroccan football player may possibly join the French Championship with Olympique Lyon (OL) or even stay with his current club Ajax Amsterdam The 25-year-old football sensation is still studying all his possibilities. In an interview with Dutch outlet 11Lions, Ziyech said that he “is not sure to leave Ajax”. “Football can be unpredictable,” he added.  According to the Daily Mirror, the Olympique Lyon has  expressed its intention to sign the Moroccan international.  The Atlas Lion would  replace French football player Nabil Fekir who has expressed his willingness to  sign for Liverpool.  According to the British newspaper, Ajax is asking for EUR 23 million to let go of its midfielder. Ziyech was named best player of the year in Netherlands’ national league. .. Ziyech chose to represent Morocco’s Atlas Lions when he had the opportunity to join the Netherlands. The football player  made his debut with Morocco in a friendly match against Côte d’Ivoire in October 2015.

Rabat – Moroccan and Algerian activists are standing side by side for the same goal: the reopening of borders between Morocco and Algeria. According to Arabic outlet Al Ahdath Al Maghribia, the two countries’ citizens decided to organize two marches—one from Oujda and one from Maghnia—to the border between the countries. The initiators launched the event on social media, deciding to march on July 22 “to call on the authorities of both countries to open borders,” according to the same outlet. Thousands of people responded favorably to the march, including residents of the Moroccan Oriental region, reported Al Ahdath Al Maghribia. Two marches will take place at the same time, one from Oujda to the border “Zouj Bghal” and the other from Maghnia to the borders. Morocco and Algeria may possibly consider the proposition. Last week, Algerian Minister of Youth and Sports Mohamed Hattab said that his country is “ready to study a possible joint bid” with Morocco and Tunisia to organize the 2030 World Cup. Many hope that relations between Morocco and Algeria will improve, especially after the latter decided to vote for the former instead of United 2026 to organize the 2026 World Cup. Unfortunately, Algeria’s vote didn’t make a difference. The closure of the border between the neighbors dates back to 1994. The decision to close the borders was made by Algeria after Rabat imposed visa regulations on Algerian visitors in the wake of a terrorist attack on the Atlas Asni Hotel in Marrakech. Despite Morocco decision to lift the visa requirement in 2004 and Algeria’s decision to follow suit the following year, the closed-border situation has not changed.

Rabat- A recent shocking video of an Algerian man violently slapping a sub-Saharan child has angered social media users, who denounced the violence and called for the Algerian government’s action.  The 34-second-long footage captured the moment on July 8 when an Algerian man near a bus station hit a child so forcefully across the face that he fell hard to the muddy ground. As the child cried in pain, bystanders laughed in amusement.  dégoûté par cette violence, SVP plus de RT pour signaler cette violence envers les enfants, saisissez le ministre, les réseaux sociaux peu importe, il faut que ça fasse du bruit. @radioM_me@NouredineBedoui pic.twitter.com/QkJ6rokFeb — Kamel (@KamelDjez) July 11, 2018  Many social media users expressed disgust at the violent act. One Twitter user commented: “Cruel. The man did not consider that he was also a child.”  Cruel le monsieur pense pas q il était enfant et qu il en possède pas et qui il n a pas eu une éducation enfantine mal élevé par ses parents qui sont responsables des conséquences il y’a un Dieu mais je dirais a l enfantà sa place excuses moi et j ai les larmes aux yeux ???? — Serghini anbari seddik (@SeddikAnbari) July 12, 2018  “Sick. How do you sleep in peace?” Écoeuré, écoeurant. Comment peut il dormir tranquille? — SissoU (@ASA0477) July 12, 2018  “The tragedy is that there are some people who found this funny and were laughing,” another wrote. le malheur il y a des gens qui trouvent ça amusant et rient de pleines gueules. — ??? ???? (@kseptis) July 11, 2018  The video appeared on Wednesday, only days after fire broke out in the camps of sub-Saharan migrants in both Fez and Casablanca.  Although Moroccan authorities have not yet revealed the causes of the July 8 fires in both cities, some sub-Saharan migrants claimed that drug-addicted “hooligans” near Ouled Ziane bus station in Casablanca have previously tried to set camps on fire. The violent act towards the child was not the first incident of its kind, especially near the Ouled Ziane bus station. In November 2017, violent clashes between sub-Saharan migrants and a group of Moroccans broke out in the area, resulting in arson in the same park.

Rabat- In response to terrorist threats, Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) dismantled today a terrorist cell consisting of seven pro-ISIS extremists acting between Zaouiat Cheikh, Oulad Teïma, and Marrakech. The Ministry of Interior issued a statement this morning announcing the arrest by BCIJ of seven pro-ISIS extremists aged between 22 and 32. BCIJ acts under the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance.  The first investigations revealed that the suspects were actively promoting propaganda for ISIS through campaigns praising the barbaric acts of the terrorist group. According to the ministry’s statement, the suspected individuals were involved in “gathering and recruiting young people to plan terrorist attacks which undermine the security and stability of the Kingdom, at the instigation of an ISIS leader.” The arrest enabled the seizure of various electronic devices, knives, and electrical wires, in addition to written material released by ISIS and some of its branches, the statement said. The statements noted that some members of the cell were linked to the pro-ISIS terrorist cell  dismantled on October 14, 2017 in Fes. This operation enabled the seizure of firearms, live ammunition, and chemicals used to manufacture explosives. The suspects apprehended this morning will be brought to justice at the conclusion of  an investigation conducted by the public prosecutor is concluded, according to the statement. Since the beginning of this year, BCIJ has carried out several operations dismantling terrorist cells and arresting suspects with alleged links to ISIS. Just last Monday, BCIJ arrested four suspects with alleged ties to ISIS in Casablanca, Nador, Tangier, and Tiznit.

Rabat- Minister of Employment Mohamed Yatim has denied recent rumors claiming that he took a second wife, expressing disgust at the act of polygamy. Recently, several Moroccan news outlets either reported that Yatim had already or was going to marry a second wife. Reacting to the speculations, Yatim explained in a statement to the Justice and Development Party (PJD) that he is currently in a government mission, not in a honeymoon. Yatim condemned polygamous marriage and reiterated that he would never engage in it no matter the circumstances or justifications. Polygamy is not an uncommon issue among Moroccan ministers; former Minister in Charge of Relations with the Parliament and Civil Society, Habib Choubani, and Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid are both pro-polygamists with two wives. In 2012, Morocco announced its commitment to applying the “Ban on polygamy.”  According to the 2004 Moroccan Family Code, a husband must obtain his wife’s consent before marrying another woman.  The text reads: “The judge shall not authorize polygamy unless he has verified the husband’s ability to guarantee equality with the fist wife and her children in all areas of life, and there is an objective and exceptional motive that justifies polygamy.”

Rabat – Amine Harit’s hearing was postponed again. According to Le Site Info, the First Instance Tribunal of Marrakech decided to push the Atlas Lions’ audience to allow the insurance company to process the claims of the rights holders of the victim. The 21-year-old rising star was involved in a road accident that led to the death of a pedestrian in Marrakech. The accident occurred while the player was driving with his 14-year-old brother on Saturday, June 30, shortly after midnight.   The Schalke 04 attacking midfielder was supposed to be presented to a prosecutor in Marrakech, two weeks ago “in a state of freedom and with his passport withdrawn.” The hearing was first postponed to July 11, to “allow for negotiations with the victim’s parents with a view to amicable settlement,” explained a close source to the case to AFP. However, Al Akhbar reported last week that the Moroccan football player has made a financial agreement with the family of the victim. Harit “had to propose a fairly large amount to the family.” Last week, the family of the young victim spoke to the media about their son’s death. The mourning family complained about the way Moroccan authorities handled the accident. Moreover, they claimed that they did not want money. Harit was granted the right to leave Morocco in a temporary release;he recovered his passport and his driving license, which police had retained, on Tuesday, June 3.

Rabat- After they were caught on camera drifting to sleep while in Parliament, some MPs have been caught again but this time checking and scrolling on their mobile phones. Rafiaa El Manssouri, MP of the Istiqlal party team and member of the Finance and Economic Development committee, was speaking at the parliament while many MPs appeared to be neglecting her speech. Her talk would normally receive attention since it concerns important economic and social issues. “It is true that we are an independent national opposition in the government. We were part of the previous government, we backed the reform.” The MP continued her speech, wondering, “What is the point of public policies if the citizen was not the center of its attention?” while the focus of some of her MP colleagues’ attention was their phones and tablets. El Manssouri was talking about issues related to governmental national support, IMF support, and social sectors, during a session of the House of Representatives discussing the exploration mission report on fuel prices.   Although El Manssouri spoke fervently on the government’s unwise investment of the financial support it has received from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), her talk was clearly not of  importance to some MPs. “We are not against the fact that the country receives [external] financial support, but the bad thing is that the country, as “a good student” of IMF, received MAD 35 billion and used it in its budgets balance, instead of investing this fund in social sectors, including education and health.” It seems like the deputies of the nation are more concerned by their phones than the issues of the country. “It is time for the government, if it fails in this issue, to come courageously and daringly, and say: ‘I apologize, I couldn’t do it,’ and return back to indexation,” El Manssouri concluded her speech. Moreover, other MPs were seen talking on their phone inside the Parliament while the voice of Aziz Rabbah, Minister of Energy, Mines, and Sustainable Development, spoke about energy issues after showing a pertinent video clip. It seems like the Parliament has become a cyber cafe for MPs to leisurely scroll on their social media accounts. The controversial video sparked outrage and received severe criticism by Moroccans on social media and Youtube.

Rabat- Libya today has become quite a persistent headache for the world community, in general, and Europe, in particular. NATO is surely regretting bitterly it has not finished the work it started in 2011 to oust the dictator Qhaddafi.  The help extended generously to the revoutionaries, then, by NATO certainly destroyed the Qhaddafi system, but with it went, to date, the Libyan state. Today it is merely a collection of city-states, or worse tribe-states motivated by rentier privileges oil offers and religious extremism. Alas, today Libya is a non-state to be added to the growing list of Arab failed states resulting from the destructive chaos of the Arab Spring. Libya could have simply gone into limbo like Somalia, at some point, if it had remained docile and quiet and the world would have gladly forgotten about it. But, it has not because it has gone awry and it has become a threat to its neighbors north and south. Andrew Engel, in a research paper entitled : « LIBYA AS A FAILED STATE Causes, Consequences, Options » published by  The Washington Institute for Near East Policy on November 2014, argues quite rightly :  « Libya’s postrevolutionary transition to democracy was not destined to fail.1 With enormous proven oil reserves, the largest in Africa and the ninth largest in the world,2 many of them underexplored, Libya was singularly well endowed. After the revolution, the country rapidly restored production to 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd),3 along with 3 billion cubic meters of gas, and held up to $130 billion in foreign reserves.4 Estimates of Libya’s potential for postwar foreign direct investment ranged from $200 billion over ten years5 to $1 trillion more broadly.6 In other words, Libya was well positioned to transition away from decades of authoritarianism, begin building much-needed state institutions, and provide significant goods and services to its population. Following the revolution, many Libyans dreamed—not unrealistically—of their country developing along the lines of Persian Gulf states with similarly small populations and abundant natural resources. » For the lat few years, welcoming and friendly Italy has been patiently bearing alone the brunt of an African migration invasion originating from the Libyan shores. This migration, had it been in a trickle fashion could have gone almost unnoticed by other European nations as their dynamic markets could have accommodated happily this cheap god-sent labor, but it turned dramatic as the number increased and thousands drowned in the Meditrranean Sea. Alarmed by this human tragedy, that could ultimately go crescendo if unchecked, humanitarian European NGOs called for immediate action. Some suggested flatly to welcome the migrants on the European soil. Under pressure, the European heads of states met to find an acceptable solution. Of course nobody expected Europe to open the gate for mass migration, because such a thing is synonymous of economic suicide for a continent that is hardly recovering from a severe recession. Instead, Europe has made public its willingness to help the migrant boats in the Mediterranean and set up migrant quotas for member states, a decision that was rejected right away by some member countries. This means quite clearly that this thorny issue will certainly not be easy to solve within the European Union, in the short term. The question, then, is what to do to solve this problem, in the long term ? Actually, two possibilities arise at this point : For sure, the sitution in Libya cannot be allowed to remain as it is, for more the status quo perdures, more the risk of proliferation of extremist groups on the Libyan soil will increase and the temptation for the Libyan Islamists to join forces with other extremist groups. Indeed, few years ago, ISIS has conducted highly-publicized collective summary executions of religious and ethnic groups. The presence of religious extremist groups on Libyan soil can also threaten other North African states as well as Europe and the West. In the long run, instability in Libya could be a lethal threat to the nascent democracy in Tunisia where the Islamists would feel emboldened to destabilze the existing government further, especially after the unfortunate terrorist attack on the Bardo Museum on March 18, 2015, which was directed at crippling the tourist industry, the economic lifeline of the country. Tunisia has painstakingly adopted a very progressive constitution that enshrines women rights and democratic values and sets the groundwork for a long term democracy. So far, Tunisia is the only Arab Spring country that has gone democratic rather than going the way of instability and chaos. Therefore, it has to be nurtured and protected to serve as a role model for other Arab countries in the future.  A chaotic and Islamist Libya could embolden the various terrorist groups in the Sub-Saharan region to create a crescent of terrorism and instability all the way from Somalia in the Horn of Africa to Senegal on the Atlantic Ocean shore, and become a fertile ground for the rise of Islamist governments in this vulnerable area. So stabilizing Libya would be tantamount to cutting the grass under the feet of the violent Islamists, who dream of the establishment of an Islamic Caliphate in the Sub-Sahara region. Libya, today, is split between an Islamist rule in the west and the south and a secular power in the east. The two blocks have failed militarily to neutralize each other and have also failed to reach a compromise in the recent UN-conducted negotiations in the city of Skhirate in Morocco. So, all the classical avenues for conflict resolution have been explored to no avail. Short of an external invasion, the only solution possible today is an internationally-guaranteed package to bring back the Senussi monoarchy to reign and have a limited rule, as a referee power, and guarantee, as it were, a democratic system. Concerning this alternative, Prince Idris calls for the restoration of the monarchy and on this particular point Oskar Aanmoen
Senior Europe Correspondent of Central Royal : « Although it will become difficult for Libya to become a monarchy again, it is not impossible. Prince Idris wants the Libyan people to be able to choose whether they want to get the monarchy back. The Prince, therefore, does not want to force monarchist reforms in the country, but he wants a referendum, after peace has been created in the unstable African nation. As the Prince said, he wants to “leave the freedom of choice to the Libyan people.” According Prince Idris, an election next year will not be possible. Still the restoration of the country’s 1951 post-independence constitution would create peace so there can be held democratic elections later. The 1951 constitution will give the three historical districts of Tripolitania, Cyrenaica and Fezzan more independence, which can stop the rivalry between different ethnic groups. Prince Idris has said that he is willing to act as temporary head of state. He added, however, that if he were head of state he would not enter into political life and that being head of state would not include being head of government. This would be something that, in practice, would give Libya a temporary monarchy until elections have been held and a possible referendum on a future permanent Libyan monarchy. » A national conference could be held anew in Morocco or elsewhere in the region, to officially enthrone the descendant of the Senussi dynasty and negotiate a constitutional monarchy status for the country, with a new constitution to be presented to the people for a referendum. If accepted, then the monarchy could be restored with the mandate to, firstly, nominate a national union government that would put together a national army and a police force and, then, organize legislative elections within two years’ time, at the latest. In this regard, Declan Walsh wrote an insightful article entitled: « A Radical Idea to Rebuild a Shattered Libya: Restore the Monarchy » in The New York times of February 24, 2016 : « Frustration with the United Nations process has helped the royalists. They would be happy with any symbolic figure who could lead the country for a while, said Mr. Sikta, the campaigner. But the preferred candidate was Crown Prince Mohammed. “Not forever,” Mr. Sikta said. “Just until we hold an election. He can use his influence to bring the militias into line.” But a king without an army would seem foolhardy for a country awash with weapons and violent grievances. And, in the tradition of Libya’s unruly polity, even the royal family is not immune from factionalism.  In the hotel lobbies of Tunisia and Morocco, where much of the discussion over Libya’s future is taking place, the crown prince faces competition in the form of a cousin, Prince Idris al-Senussi, who is also offering his services as a nation-builder. “Libyans need someone they can look up to, a father figure,” Prince Idris, a businessman based in Italy, said by telephone. “I don’t say that I should lead. But if people want me to hold a position, then I am willing.” » During the popular uprising following the advent of the Arab Spring in 2011, NATO’s aerial bombardment helped the rebels defeat Qaddafi but the demise of the dictatorship instead of bringing peace, stability and welfare enthroned  the religious-ethnic dictatorships still in place today preventing the stability of the country and fragilizing regional security especially at a time when violent Islamism has become a furtive threat worldwide. NATO may be called upon, anew, to finish the job and mop up the mess in this country. It does not have to go it along but can bring in the Arab countries of the south Mediterranean into the picture,  mainly ; Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt with ground forces to stabilize the country in conjunction with the West through the implementation of the following necessary actions : Libya is on the verge of implosion, due to both internal and external challenges. The Skhirate Accord is a good move forward to resolve the Libyan internal conflict, but it is not enough, given that many national groupings have different agendas for the country and have the necessary firepower to see them through. Now if the armed groups are kept on the loose and not checked, Libya will turn into a new Somalia, that could ultimately be hijacked by terrorist groups like ISIS or al-Qaeda, that have grand designs of their own for the region and the world. In the present set up the future is very grim and Libya is a lethal danger to Europe, Africa and the Middle East, so action from the international community is needed urgently, before it is too late.

Rabat- Morocco’s high speed train (LGV) will become operational by the end of 2018, according to the National Office of Railways (ONCF). The final operational tests before the commercial launch of the LGV began in June. Following a series of tests carried out since February 2017, LGV is expected to start operating during one of the final three months of 2018. ONCF previously affirmed the tests occurred over several kilometers of the new line with successive increases in speed, maintaining that the line is suitable for circulation at 320 kilometers per hour. In May, the test train reached a speed of 357 kilometers per hour between Tangier and Kenitra, reported ONCF. This upcoming fall, the LGV—which is the first of its kind in Africa—will link Tangier to Kenitra with a travel time of only 1.5 hours. LGV will also connect Tangier to Casablanca in 2 hours and 10 minutes, replacing  the current trip’s five hour minimum travel time.  In October 2017, the French Development Agency (AFD) granted a loan of EUR 80 million to fund the last segment of the Tangier-Casablanca high-speed train project. This followed the French agency’s initial grant of EUR 220 million in 2011 for the establishment of the project, which was originally scheduled to be finished in 2015, but was postponed to 2017 because of delays caused by infrastructure projects.

Rabat – Despite widespread dissatisfaction among the Moroccan people over slow governmental progress, Morocco’s Minister of General Affairs and Governance, Lahcen Daoudi, appears confident about his party’s future in the upcoming legislative election. As statistics show, the previous legislative elections were marked by low participation due to a couple of reasons, mainly the lack of confidence in politicians and dissatisfaction with governmental performance. Nevertheless, Daoudi seems very optimistic about his party’s chances at winning the next elections. “We will remain at the top of the elections thanks to the pace of achievement that we are maintaining, by giving priority to the public interest of the state, and our review of the political behavior of some people belonging to our party,” the Moroccan newspaper Al Massae reported today. During the last few years,  disappointment was shown by many PJD supporters, along with the discontent that the majority of Moroccans felt, due to the party’s failure to solve the country’s main economic and social problems. These include education, health and employment in addition to the increase in commodity prices.  However, Daoudi claimed his government-majority party has gained the people’s political trust and citizens votes “thanks to their project.”  “Although we are not in a clean environment… under the monarchy which is the secret of the unity of our nation, we restored political confidence that others failed doing. People did not vote for Justice and Development Party, nor for Daoudi nor Benkirane, but voted for our project.” On the other hand, Al Massae said the minister found Moroccans’ criticism over unemployment to be overstated. “Some Moroccans criticize their country in a way that is sometimes exaggerated and reckless. Unemployment exists in most countries of the world, and information technology has taken over the workforce with a single click on the computer button and a touch on the phone. Objective criticism is required today.” The minister also noted the government will resolve all problems related to electricity and water.  “In 2021, we will eliminate problems with electricity and water definitely .” According to the newspaper, Daoudi did not deny the significant influence that social media is exercising on political youth to develop the parties’ debates and ideas, in addition to public opinion which changes at every moment. For this reason, the minister should not forget about his controversial presence at the sit-in, supporting Central-Danone workers, which caused an unprecedented backlash on social media. The minister’s act was described as “irresponsible” and “unworthy” by thousands of Moroccans, following the boycott targeting three companies in Morocco.

Rabat – Judicial police in the city of Agadir dismantled a four-suspect network for their involvement in cocaine and psychotropic tablets trafficking. The arrest operation was carried out following information provided by the General Directorate for Surveillance of the National Territory, said a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). The statement reported the searching operation of the car and home of one of the suspects resulted in the seizure of 2,520 Rivotril tablets, 95 grams of cocaine, and cash and mobile devices. Police placed the alleged suspects in custody pending further investigation to determine possible suspects involved in a wider network. A court in Temara, a city near Rabat, sentenced nine suspects to 10 years in prison last week for their involvement in international drug trafficking. Another defendant received six years in prison, while two others were given five years in prison. The court sentenced nearly 10 other suspects for their involvement in the same network. The sentences ranged from three to 10 years in prison. The defendants were charged last Wednesday for a 2017 case, when the Counter-Terrorism Bureau (BCIJ) seized 2,588 tons of cocaine and arrested 10 individuals. The latest arrests in Agadir can be seen as part of the Kingdom’s mission of cracking down on illicit drug smuggling.

By Salihah Evans Rabat – Despite receiving an invitation, FIFA was informed that the Wild Boars Football Team and their coach will be unable to attend the World Cup in Russia.  The rescued team “will not be in a position to travel” due to health reasons. AlThough the players appear to be doing well, doctors say they will need to remain in the hospital under medical supervision for at least seven days.

On Twitter, England team player Kyle Walker asked how he could reach the Wild Boars—to send them jerseys.

According to Morocco’s Tourism Observatory, the number of annual foreign tourist arrivals increased by 15 percent from the previous year, while the arrival of Moroccans living abroad has decreased by one percent. The surge of the kingdom’s major tourism markets for travelers coming from  Italy (16 percent), Germany (12 percent), France and Holland (eight percent), the United Kingdom (seven percent), and Spain (four percent) has contributed to the increase in the rate of tourist arrivals. Fez registered an increase of 17 percent, Rabat eight percent and Tangier seven percent. With respect to overnight stays, the country’s classified hotels also saw an increase of seven percent during the first five months of 2018, albeit slight compared to 2017.

Rabat – Many state-owned strategic institutions are on the verge of bankruptcy due to financial and legal problems, which may lead the government to privatizing the establishments as a solution. Since the beginning of this year, there have been rumors circulating in Moroccan media, such as in Infomediare, Lerporter, Economie Entreprises, in addition to other national outlets, about Morocco’s intention to privatize some public institutions, including the National Railway Office (ONCF). The Moroccan weekly newspaper Al Ousbouea reported Thursday 5 that many Moroccan public economic institutions, particularly the strategic ones, such as the National Railway Office (ONCF), the Airports Authority (ONDA), the Moroccan motorway operator (ADM) and the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE), are going bankrupt due to the accumulation of debt due to low profits.  The decline in profits is due to the fact that these institutions have engaged in major structural projects: new train stations, airport expansion, and construction of major water channels. They suffer from poor liquidity, therefore accumulating debt that they cannot afford, wrote Al Ousbouea. Despite the government’s interference to pump billions into their budgets, these institutions are being driven to bankruptcy because of the implementation of substantial judicial sentences against the handling companies that worked for these institutions. As a result, they did not receive their dues for years, which led them to resort to the judiciary to get compensated, the same source added. Due to lack of the governmental financial support, the institutions are still requesting more loans from banks, with permission from the Ministry of Economy. The weekly newspaper noted that the Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Boussaid gave permission to ONCF to receive interest-free loans. The government has implicitly pointed out its intention to privatize some public institutions. Boussaid explicitly referred to this when he said, “ONCF and ONDA could be converted into a joint stock company to achieve greater transparency and governance, and this conversion will develop their services and business activity.” This is similar to what happened to Maroc Telecom, the main telecommunication company in Morocco, 17 years ago. On 20 February 2001 the Moroccan government sold 35% of Maroc Telecom’s shares to French mass media company Vivendi.

Rabat – The online boycott of Morocco’s top brands, which has extended its reach to celebrities and politicians, received a big round of applause from King Mohammed VI’s  former Advisor Abbas Jirari. In a recent interview with Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum, the former professor at Collège Royal of Rabat, voiced his stance regarding the ongoing boycott against high commodity prices launched  April 20. According to  Jirari, the government could have managed to solve the issue of the boycott if the reasons of the campaign were analyzed. “Instead of decreeing a law to fight the boycott, government officials had to analyze the reasons that drove people to boycott,” said the King’s advisor. The boycott takes aim at the “monopolization” of the top milk supplier in Morocco, dairy company Centrale Danone; oil distributor Afriquia gas; and bottled water firm Sidi Ali. The companies have all suffered losses in revenue due to the boycott, especially Centrale Danone, who has been issuing statements to reconcile with consumers since the launch of the boycott. Boycott: Citizens’ position According to Jirari, the boycott is “a citizen position and an ancestral principle of giving up products that become expensive.” Speaking about the business, he said that operators “must seek to have reasonable gains, while taking into account the economic situation of our society, most of which cannot come with high prices.”  “The middle is getting weak and is reaching the poor at the bottom of the social ladder,” underscored the King’s adviser in his interview. This situation, according to Jirari, is “abnormal” as Morocco  has the assets and “resources that allow all citizens to have their chances.” Employment becomes a dream? Jirari also criticized the lack of job opportunities in Morocco. “Staying without a job for four years after graduation is not a healthy” situation in a country like Morocco, he said. “It will be almost a year since the king explained that the development model in Morocco is failing and that it will be necessary to prepare a new model, but no one has answered the call.” In his recent speeches, King Mohammed VI called for a new development model that will serve the interests of citizens and meet their needs while promoting social justice and dignified life for all. In October 2017, the King said in his speech during the opening session of the new legislative year that despite Morocco’s tangible progress, “we have to admit that our national development model no longer responds to citizens’ growing demands and pressing needs.” He added that the current development model “has not been able to reduce disparities between segments of the population,” and has failed to “correct inter-regional imbalances or achieve social justice.” The King also urged his government to reconsider the country’s development model  “in order to keep abreast of changes in the country.”

According to El Othmani, the program enabled to identify Morocco’s achievements in addition to the weaknesses that need to be overcome at the policy level as well as through programs.

Rabat – The European Commission has revealed details about a new trust fund for North Africa to strengthen border management and protection of migrants in the region. The trust fund comprises 3 new migration-related programs of more than €90 million. One of these programs, which is worth €55 million, is dedicated to border management for Morocco and Tunisia.  It will support the efforts of national institutions in both countries to save lives at sea, improve maritime border management, and combat smugglers operating in the region, the European Commission said in a press release on July 6. “Today’s new programmes will step up our work to managing migration flows in a humane and sustainable way, by saving and protecting lives of refugees and migrants and providing them with assistance and by fighting against traffickers and smugglers,” said High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini. The program, under the,  EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, will increase EU assistance to refugees and vulnerable migrants, and improve countries affected by increased irregular flows along the Western Mediterranean, in particular, Morocco, to better manage their borders. “Partnership is key to respond to the challenges posed by irregular migration. By working together with our southern neighbors we can tackle this challenge and bring benefits to the partner countries, the migrants and Europe. Today’s new programmes will provide support to authorities to improve border management but at the same time will also ensure protection and emergency assistance for vulnerable migrants,” Commissioner for European Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations, Johannes Hahn said.  This program is implemented by the Italian Ministry of Interior, together with the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD). The second program will strengthen the EU assistance to “vulnerable migrants”, which supports the 2014 Moroccan National Strategy on migration. Moroccan civil society association and organizations are given privilege to benefit from this fund program of €6.5 million to facilitate access basic services for vulnerable migrants. The International Organization of Migration (IOM) defines vulnerability within a migration context as “the diminished capacity of an individual or group to resist, cope with, or recover from violence, exploitation, abuse, and violation(s) of their rights. The third program, which worth €29 million, will focus on the protection of refugees and migrants at disembarkation points and in detention centres in Libya. The approval of these three migration-related programs comes after the European Council’s leaders decided to increase the EU support and assistance to refugees and vulnerable migrants in the Central Mediterranean region.

Rabat – Abdellatif Hammouchi, the chief of Morocco’s DGSN (an elite police agency specialized in countering terrorism), has again won international validation, with an Italian newspaper describing him as the “super agent who never sleeps.” Following the Spanish outlet El Pais, which last week paid tribute to Hammouchi’s “contributions to maintaining national security” in Morocco, the Italian daily II Post recently praised the Hammouchi-led DGST-DGSN’s (the Directorate of National Security) efforts in dismantling terrorist networks and ridding Morocco of terrorist strikes in recent years.  The Italian outlet called Hammouchi “the super-agent fighting Islamist extremism,”giving figures about the DGSN’s impressive performance both in terms of intelligence gathering and field operations.   According to the report, Hammouchi is “powerful, respected, and controversial,” almost like “a movie character.”  II post went on to describe Hammouchi as the perfect embodiment of leadership and crisis management, suggesting that his strong and winning personality plays a crucial role in the DGSN’s agents’ efficiency in their missions and assignments. Hammouchi, II Post added, is the “workaholic” responsible for the modernization of Moroccan anti-terrorism system.  In addition to describing the Moroccan official as a movie character, the report noted that he is the “most informed man in Morocco,” “has an incredible memory,” and “is one of the finest connoisseurs of extremist Islamism.” While II Post and El Pais’ description of Hammouchi may easily come across as outsized and embellished, Hammouchi’s formidable success as chief of Morocco’s elite police units has won him international accolades and validation from various international observers, journalists, and security experts over the years.  Last month, French outlet Valeurs Actuelles hailed Morocco’s successful anti-terrorism model, calling he country the bastion of security and stability in the MENA region.  Valeurs Actuelles also showered DGST-DGSN with accolades, describing the units as Morocco’s FBI and the main architect of the North African country’s anti-terrorism’s recent achievements.

By Renee Sang Rabat- The official capital of Morocco and located along the coast, this beautiful city has much to add to your profile. Its rich colors and historic architecture speak for themselves, and you’ll find yourself taking photos down every avenue and alleyway.  Although there are almost too many places to narrow it down, here are the best 10 spots in Rabat that every traveler or resident should share on their Instagram feed. With bright blue walls contrasted against white, the Kasbah des Oudaias centuries-old neighborhood is an absolute must-visit destination in Rabat. Each home is uniquely its own with its potted plants and intricate doorways, and you surely won’t find any two houses that look the same. Any traveler visiting the Oudaias won’t mind getting lost among all the beautifully painted alleyways.  At the end of a beautiful stroll through the alleyways of the Kasbah you’ll find a great panoramic view of the sea and the city. You will surely be overcome with awe while taking in the beauty on all sides. Be sure to visit on a clear day, which shouldn’t be hard with Morocco’s sunny weather!  The beach in Rabat is frequented by tourists and residents alike. Although it tends to get more crowded in the summer, it’s worth a trip to capture a few pictures or watch the sunset when most of the crowds have cleared. One of the best waterfront views can be found in the marina, right by a popular boat restaurant, called Le Dhow.  With a view that overlooks Salé on one side and the Kasbah on the other, you’ll likely be visiting this site more than once.  The Mausoleum of Mohammed V speaks for itself in its grandeur, both inside and outside of the structure. The neighboring mosque is not open to non-Muslims, but the Mausoleum is still a beautiful structure that is a necessary feature on anyone’s feed. Don’t be afraid to snap a picture with one of the ornately dressed guards at the door! As one of the key symbols for Rabat, the Hassan tower (Tour Hassan) is located opposite the Mohammed V Mausoleum. Behind the tower is a beautiful view overlooking the city as well. Be sure to visit this historic site during your time in Rabat and learn about the story behind this unfinished tower. Address: Boulevard Mohamed Lyazidi, Rabat Hours: 9 a.m. – 6 p.m. everyday Even if your intention is not to shop, traversing the souks in the medina is a cultural experience that every visitor needs to explore at least once. From spices, artisan crafts, and scarves to electronics, you’ll be sure to find goods of every kind in this market that spans in many directions. Be sure to capture a picture (or several) in one of the less crowded alleyways, as the vibrant architecture and deep colors inside the medina will not need any additional filters. The medina gives a personal perspective to life in Rabat, and you’ll find it occupied by travelers and residents alike. Bring your bargaining skills if you plan on shopping!  Since its opening in 2014, the Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art has housed works from artists like Henri Matisse and Salvador Dali. Although there are limited areas that allow photography inside the museum, there are no restrictions on the colorful murals outside the museum!  Hours: 10 a.m. – 6 p.m. everyday The Chellah is an old fortified enclosure that surrounds Roman and Phoenician ruins teeming with history. Deemed an official World Heritage site, the ancient architecture is a worthy backdrop for a photoshoot. You’ll also find a collection of stork nests that have made the minaret and surrounding ruins into their home. Be prepared for an abundance of cats that like to hang around the area waiting to be fed as well. If you are headed to the Kasbah, be sure to check out one of the alternative entrances that takes you into the Andalusian Gardens. Filled with a pleasant aroma of freshly bloomed flowers, this route is a highly recommended detour for nature lovers. After some pictures, you can follow the path straight to the café for some mint tea and traditional Moroccan cookies with a beautiful view of the beach.  If there is one road to know the name of in Rabat it is Avenue Mohammed V.  At one end of the busy street you’ll find souks and food vendors, and as you walk along the avenue you’ll also pass cafés, Parliament, and eventually the train station (Gare de Rabat Ville). Lined with rows of palm trees, this street serves as a centerpiece for the bustling capital city that is Rabat.

Rabat – After MPs Omar Balafrej and Mustapha Chennaoui of the Federation of the Democratic Left (FGD) party introduced a law relating to a general amnesty for Hirak Al Hoceima activists to Parliament, the proposed law posed a dilemma for President of House of Representatives Habib El Malki, according to the weekly newspaper Al Ousbouea.  Since the proposed law was tabled in Parliament, El Malki has been faced with its refusal by some Parliamentary party teams such as Popular Movement and Democratic Constitutional Rally, the legislative institution’s interference in the judiciary, and the silence of other Parliamentary party teams regarding the law. Although the Parliament can request a general amnesty according to Article 71 of the Moroccan Constitution, the weekly newspaper noted, there is a fear of interfering in powers, which has remained, according to customs and traditions, in the hands of the king since the time of Morocco’s independence. On the other hand, El Malki sought the help of other Parliamentary party teams, especially PJD, PAM and Istiqlal (Independence), and requested them to take responsibility and make a decision about the proposal in a meeting inside the House of Representative’s office, said the same news outlet. The Parliamentary representatives and presidents of Parliamentary party teams wanted, through this meeting, to put an end to the proposal before it reached a competent committee, to avoid any possible anger from the nation, the newspaper wrote. Al Ousbouea noted that the debate over the proposed law was not resolved yet, and the decision of approval or refusal has been delayed to another future meeting. The head of the Independence Party team, Noureddine Madiane, called for giving the floor to the nation deputies to talk about Hirak Rif’s sentence. It seems inconceivable that the Parliament remains outside the nation’s debate, especially that many Moroccan human right, political and cultural activists have condemned the “harsh” sentences against Hirak Rif activists. Head of Government Saâd Eddine El Othmani and El Malki responded favorably to Madiane’s call, the article concluded. Last month, Balafrej published a general amnesty draft law on his Facebook account relating to all social movements of the past two years. This came shortly after the Hirak Rif activists were given ‘heavy’ prison sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years for their involvement in the demonstrations that shook the Al Hoceima province from 2016-2017.

Rabat – On the sidelines of the African Union (AU) summit hosted in Nouakchott earlier this month, Sidi Mohamed Ould Maham, head of the Union for the Republic party, criticized the absence of Morocco’s King Mohammed VI from the summit. It seems like the diplomatic crisis is still ongoing between Morocco and Mauritania although they appointed ambassadors in both countries. , Maham published a tweet in Arabic on July 6, in which he implicitly criticized Morocco’s King for not attending the AU summit.  Maham, head of Mauritania’s ruling party, considered King Mohammed VI’s absence as a boycott. He also said that the Mauritania’s presence at the international level creates “disturbance” to the King. “We understand that some brothers are boycotting us without a good, or at least, a declared reason. However, we will not accept for a moment that our presence in the international arena and our existence as a sovereign and independent state in its decision is bothering them.” ????? ?? ??????? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ???? ?? ???? ??? ?????? ??? ??? ??? ???? ??? ????? ??? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????? ????? ????? ??????? ??????? ?? ?????? ???????? ?????? ?? ?????? ???? ??? ?? ???? ????? ???? ?? ??????? ??? ????? ????????? ??? ??????? ?? ???? ????? ?? ??. — ???? ???? ??? ??? (@SMohamedMaham) July 6, 2018  “They have to realize that we are part of the solution and we are not a party to the conflict, and that the policy of arrogance towards brothers will never achieve any solution,” he added. Prior to that, the fact that the Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz was not present at the reception of Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs, was seen as a “negative message” to the Kingdom of Morocco.  On the other hand, the Mauritanian president did welcome the Polisario Front’s leader, Ibrahim Ghali, when he arrived at Nouakchott International Airport to participate in the AU summit. In addition to a reception, Ghali was escorted to his residence. Aziz’s lack of a reception could be interpreted as a response from the Mauritanian president to the fact that King’s VI did not attend himself the AU summit. However, the Mauritanian Foreign Minister Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed denied in a statement to the media that the guests’ receptions at the AU summit do not carry any negative messages towards any country. He explained that it is normal that President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz did not receive all the guests of the summit at Nouakchott International Airport. As for the Mauritania-Morocco relationship, Ould Cheikh Ahmed said it is improving, specifically referring to the recent appointment of ambassadors in both countries.

Rabat – Mattéo Guendouzi is taking his career a step forward, playing for the “big league”.

Guendouzi’s  father stood up the French coach who was supposed to meet him during his stay in Paris. Annoyed by this behavior, Hervé Renard decided, with Nasser Larguet, to move on.

Rabat – Morocco continues to reinforce its military defense potential. The North African country is set to receive a new delivery of US-made anti-ship missiles; including the AGM-158 JASSM, RGM and UGM. According to Defense Industry Daily, which is dedicated to tracking and analyzing military contracts, awards and programs,  the anti-ship missiles are designed “to attack well-defended targets without putting its carrier aircraft in the crosshairs of new long-range surface to air missile systems.” Providing specific details about the missiles which are expected to be delivered to Morocco in the coming days, the source said that AGM-88E are designed to “attack and kill enemy radars.” “The sub-sonic, wave-skimming GM-84 Harpoon has been adapted into several variants and exported to many navies around the world,” Defense Industry Daily added. As Morocco does not have launching platforms for such missiles, the military expert website predicted that Morocco will use these six missiles with the RMAF f-16C for anti-ship missions. In April, Morocco hosted the US Formed Forces, joint military exercise, known as African Lion 2018. The military exercise was attended by 15 countries, including Burkina Faso, Canada, Chad, Egypt, France, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Mali, Mauritania, Senegal, Spain and Tunisia. On May 8, the defense and weapons procurement publication Defense World, reported that the Northrop Grumman Corporation “was awarded a  [USD] 9,491,066 modification (P00001) to foreign military sales (Morocco) contract W56HZV-18-C-0065 for eye safe laser range finders for Morocco’s M1A2S tank.”  Morocco has also purchased 220 Abrams tanks  “refurbished for the Kingdom through the US Army’s Excess Defense Articles (EDA) program.” Morocco was positioned as the second largest arms importer in Africa in the 2018 report released by Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The report also shows that the US is Morocco’s main military supplier, holding 52 percent of imports in Morocco.

Rabat – Security experts, humanities scholars, and ulemas (religious scholars) met at an international summit last week in Rabat to discuss the risks of extremist discourse and counter its growing appeal within communities in low income neighborhoods. The conference, organized by the Mohammadia League of Scholars, convened Moroccan and foreign experts on religion and security-related fields to focus on the importance of discourse—either written or spoken—to prevent radicalization and ideology-related violence. Under the theme “Analyzing Extremist Discourse,” conference participants argued that violent discourse is the root of terrorist acts and that effective counterterrorism measures should target radical discourse. In his keynote speech, Ahmed Abbadi, Secretary General of the Mohammedia League of Scholars (Morocco’s council of religious scholars), said that the conference was an opportunity to “deal with terrorism in its own terrain.” The conference aimed to to understand, decipher, and deconstruct the rhetoric used by terrorist groups to recruit or win the sympathy of target populations. According to Abbadi, terrorism is a multidimensional problem, and tackling it requires authorities to limit its appeal to vulnerable groups.  He added that fighting against extremism includes a special focus not only on the security aspect, but also on the social, economic, and ideological appeal of fundamentalist rhetoric. Abbadi concluded his remarks by pointing that although Moroccan security forces have been effective in dealing with terrorist threats, there is still room for improvement and more efficiency, especially with regards to the human and socio-economic aspect of the fight against terrorism. For more efficiency, he said, authorities need to invest more in advocating the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) which fights poverty and promotes inclusive policies. Abdulaziz Othman Altwaijiri, the director of the Islamic Organization for Education, Science, and Culture (ISECO), said that education is the most effective way of countering terrorism and fundamentalist rhetoric. For Altwaijiri, “Terrorism stems from false and misleading interpretations [of Holy Scriptures].” Authorities and specialists should promote education and raise society’s awareness about “appealing but false” claims, Othman said. He added that anti-terrorism should be a broad initiative that combines tight security measures, improving the education level, and fighting poverty.

Rabat – The Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has announced that the former coach of FC Barcelona, Luis Enrique, is now the new manager for Spain’s national football team for a two year contract. Luis Enrique, who coached Barcelona from 2014 to 2017, has been out of management since he left Barcelona last June. During his three seasons of managing Barcelona, he won two Liga titles, one Champions League and three King’s Cups.  The RFEF president, Luis Rubiales, said in a press conference: “The decision was unanimous. I like his commitment and he has turned down better-paid jobs in order to coach Spain. He’s a coach who has all the requirements the federation was looking for.” Enrique will replace interim coach Fernando Hierro, who took charge of the national team just days before the current World Cup. Hierro was acting as interim after the previous coach Julen Lopetegui was fired a day before the tournament. Lopetegui’s sudden sacking came after he agreed to coach Real Madrid,  replacing Zinedine Zidane, without informing the national team. Luis Enrique’s first game in charge will be against England at Wembley stadium in London on September 8, at the UEFA Nations League. The RFEF has also appointed Jose Molina as sporting director to replace Fernando Hierro.

Rabat – The Lebanese woman who claimed to be victim of sexual harassment  has been sentenced to eight years of prison in Egypt. Her incarceration is for insulting and undermining the Egyptian. The woman shared a video on Facebook in which she claimed that she was the victim of sexual harassment on the streets. She mentioned an altercation in which she was robbed and she called Egypt “a country of bast****.” Mona al-Mazbouh, a tourist, was arrested in late May at the airport in Cairo when she was leaving.  Her accusations had outraged Egyptian citizens, some of whom filed complaints and have been summoned to testify.  After the backlash, Mona al-Mazbouh broadcast another video stating that she did not intend to insult Egyptians, and that her previous video did not implicate “all the Egyptian people.” According to AFP, Mazbouh’s explanations were not sufficient for the Cairo courts, which sentenced her to 11 years in prison. The court eventually  changed its verdict to 8 years, on Saturday, July 7. Mazbouh was found guilty of “harming the Egyptian people,” and accused of spreading “false rumors.”  According to the same outlet, Mona al-Mazbouh’s lawyer has appealed the judge’s decision, and a hearing will be held on July 29.

Rabat – The UN Human Rights Committee (OHCHR) has denounced the human rights situation in the Polisario-run Tindouf camps, condemning Algeria for not bearing its responsibility towards victims of violations in the camps. On the sidelines of the 38th session of the Human Rights Council, June 18 to July 6 in Geneva, an expert of the committee emphasized that Algeria is obliged to take good care and support “victims and witnesses of human rights violations.” According to Morocco’s state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the committee heavily criticized the creation of a “parallel” governmental and jurisdictional system in the Polisario-run camps. Slamming Algeria’s proxy Polisario, the committee noted that “the state party, in this case Algeria, has de facto transferred to Polisario its jurisdictional powers for the territories where the refugee camps were established in Tindouf.” The committee also questioned whether Algeria is making efforts to end the situation. “What measures does Algeria envisage to put an end to this situation that is contrary to its general obligations requiring it to ensure respect for the rights guaranteed by the Covenant for all persons within its territorial and its jurisdiction.” For decades, Algeria has been ignoring its responsibility in the four-decade conflict over Western Sahara, which led to a strong condemnation from both Morocco and the UN in April.  On April 28, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 2414, which officially called on Algeria to be involved in the UN-led political process to find a solution to end the dispute over Western Sahara. Recently, in conjunction with the illegal maneuvers of the Polisario Front east of Morocco’s defense wall, Morocco called for a population count in Tindouf camps as a prerequisite for sustainable solutions. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita reiterated Morocco’s call in his recent meeting with the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Köhler, who was on a 10-day visit in the region. During his talks, Morocco stressed the need to pressure Algeria to authorize a census of inhabitants at the Tindouf camps. The unbearable situation in the Tindouf camps made Sahrawis very concerned about their future. In a recent op-ed, ex-police officer of the Polisario Front Mohamed Salma denounced the situation of Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps, emphasizing that “Algeria has been involved in the crime of preventing the return of the Sahrawis due to its security control over the borders of the camps.” He added that Algerian authorities also were involved in the arrest of many Sahrawis who attempted to flee the camps and handed them to the separatist group.

Rabat – Minister of Energy, Mines, and Sustainable Development Aziz Rebbah was enjoying a sand bath. Visiting the Draa-Tafilalet region over the weekend, Rebbah took some time to try the sand therapy of Merzouga. The 38-second video of the minister buried up to the neck in sand has gone viral on social media. In the video, a background voice narrates, “the minister of energy is treated by solar energy.” ”I went to Merzouga because I suffer from sciatica; that’s why I am buried in the sand to seek treatment,” said the minister, when contacted by Arabic outlet Chouf TV. This therapy is indeed an effective treatment against rheumatism, polyarthritis, lower back pain and some skin diseases. It is a literal sand bath: immersing oneself for a few minutes in the hot sand of the dunes of Merzouga. Even though this practice is usually used by locals, Merzouga is nevertheless a health tourism destination. The sand bath is practiced between June and September, when the sand is at its hottest.

Rabat- After a fire broke out Sunday morning in camps of sub-Saharan migrants in Fez, another fire erupted a few hours later in Casablanca camps. Sunday evening, July 8, fire consumed the belongings and camps of sub-Saharan migrants in a park in front of Ouled Ziane bus station in Casablanca, following gas bottle explosions. The camps were home to dozens of undocumented sub-Saharan African migrants.  Fortunately, security forces managed to evacuate the area and extinguish the fire. Like the first fire in the migrants’ camps near Fez’s ONCF train station, no injuries were sustained. The fire in Fez resulted in the damage of nearly 50 informal shelters used by migrants. Authorities have not yet revealed the causes of the fire in Fez and Casablanca. However, some sub-Saharan migrants claimed that drug-addicted “hooligans” in the region have tried many times to set their camps on fire. “Those unsober hooligans come to our camps, but we don’t chase them away because we don’t have the right to because it’s their country,” a migrant said to Moroccan news press, Hespress. “We are strangers here, so we can’t bother them,” he added. Last Sunday was not the first day to witness such incidents, especially near the Ouled Ziane bus station. In November 2017, violent clashes between sub-Saharan migrants and a group of Moroccans broke out in the area, resulting in a fire in the same park.

Rabat – Tangier, Morocco’s gateway to Africa and Europe will possibly host the final game of the Spanish Supercopa (Super Cup), which is scheduled for August 12. Spanish sports outlet Marca reported today that the decision on the venue to host the final game between Barcelona and Sevilla is pending the approval of the world’s governing football body (FIFA). The date for the game has been agreed on after a meeting with the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) and representatives of the two finalists. President of RFEF Luis Rubiales commended Morocco’s perfect weather, saying that the “climate is good in Tangier to host the match.”  He added that the other options, Madrid and Valencia, “do not meet the necessary conditions because of the environment.” Rubiales said that the federation would compensate the economic losses of playing the Supercopa final in a single game (as opposed to the usual two games) by paying a compensation of more than EUR 950,000 to each club. The federation will also give 6,000 tickets to each club’s fans. In 2017, Tangeir hosted the final game of France’s Trophée des Champions, the annual super cup in France. The final was played by Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco at the Grande Stade de Tanger. The Supercopa is traditionally contested by the winners of Spanish La Liga and the Copa del Rey. FC Barcelona clinched both championship titles in the 2017-2018 season.  In such an event, when a team wins both La Liga and the Copa del Rey, the second-place team of the Copa del Rey plays against the winner of La Liga in the Supercopa.

Rabat – Mohamed Abdennabaoui, President of the Prosecutor General’s Office, has given new instructions to prosecutors to protect victims of human trafficking, especially women and children. Abdennabaoui stated, in a circular addressed to crown prosecutors and public prosecutors, that some individuals were prosecuted for crimes such as corruption and prostitution, despite the fact that they were victims of human trafficking. These victims, according to the circular, should be identified, along with their nationality and age. They should also be given the opportunity to change their place of residence without disclosing their identity, appointments with specialist doctors, and social care, the Moroccan newspaper Al-Massae reported today. “When some public prosecutions deal with victims’ complaints or examine the procedures presented to them, not all victims registered in the court minutes were given much importance. It was given only to those who filed complaints or who were caught during investigations,” Abdennabaoui added. Abdennabaoui called for prioritizing the protection of victims of trafficking from the early stages of the investigation. “Judicial follow-up should not be conducted on victims who committed criminal acts under threat, when such acts are directly related to being victims of human trafficking in accordance with the Criminal Code.” He also called for prosecutors to take any additional measure as “an effective guarantee for victims of human trafficking by means of a justified decision in accordance with law.” The law already provides some protective measures for victims of human trafficking. Suspects or defendants can be prohibited from contacting or approaching the victim. Foreign victims are allowed to remain in Morocco until the end of trials. Importantly, victims are exempted from the judicial fees associated with civil claims for compensation for damage caused by the crime. Victims should also benefit from legal assistance in all proceedings, including appeals and all measures for the implementation of judgments. Abdennabaoui concluded by calling for regional and local committees to coordinate services to ensure protection for women and children victims of human trafficking by intensifying their role to find quality solutions for them. The Moroccan government has made efforts and suggested steps to solve this issue. It has carried out increased investigations in human trafficking crimes this year. However, according to the 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report issued by the US Department of State, the government did not finance specialized protection services dedicated for the victims of human trafficking.

Rabat – The administration of Casablanca’s Ain Sebaa 1 prison has categorically denied that a Hirak Rif activist was filmed inside the prison. The prison’s statement was published a few days after a video, purporting to be footage of a Hirak activist, circulated on social media. The prison says that it has no cells similar to the one that appears in the video. According to the statement, the footage was clearly faked because the face of the alleged activist did not appear in the video, which has since been removed. According to the prison, this was not the first attempt of the video makers, as they have allegedly tried to mislead public opinion and undermine the image of the prison with other faked videos. On June 26, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals sentenced 54 Moroccan activists for their involvement in the 2016-2017unauthorized protests in the Al Hoceima province. Four prominent activists, including Nasser Zefzafi, received sentences of 20 years, while others received sentences ranging from 1 to 15 years. All the activists finally agreed to appeal their sentences, except Rabie El Ablaq. El Ablaq received a sentence of 5 years and a fine of MAD 2,000, but decided not to appeal the court’s decision. El Ablaq has also been on a hunger strike for more than 40 days now. The activist was transferred to Moulay Youssef Hospital in Casablanca on Monday due to his hunger strike.

Rabat – Ahead of a Wednesday summit in Brussel, the diplomatic rift between Washington and its strategic European allies, especially NATO members, is leaving many European politicians wondering whether the 70-year-old military alliance can survive Trump’s isolationism. Trump’s anti-Europe stance on tariffs and trade, together with his bold “America First” rhetoric, is threatening to disrupt the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) established reputation for “consensus and solidarity,” the Guardian noted yesterday. Speaking to a crowd of supporters on Thursday last week, Donald Trump said that he would tell Europe that America can no longer afford to pay and provide for their security. “I’ll tell NATO you got to start paying your bills,” President Trump said. Direct and indirect investment combined, the US covers about 76 percent of the alliance’s expanses. The president then recounted a conversation he had with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, when he supposedly told Merkel that America was seriously considering withdrawing its military personnel from Germany, as the US does not benefit from keeping military bases in the European country.  “You know Angela, I can’t guarantee it, but we’re protecting you and it means a lot more to you than protecting us because I don’t know how much protecting we get by protecting you.” NATO will not ‘split asunder’ But Trump’s overt criticism of Europe is mitigated by American diplomats and strategists, most of whom continue to support American involvement in the collectivist agenda of NATO and similar multinational organizations. The US NATO ambassador, Kay Bailey, said in a press briefing last week that America is committed to firm and strong cooperation with NATO allies to deal with common security challenges, including Russian interventions in Ukrainian affairs and its meddling in the UK.  For optimists like Ambassador Bailey, Trump will be survived by America’s alliances.   “The notion that NATO is going to split asunder I think is absurd,” said Professor Daniel Drezner of Tufts University. Drezner explained that NATO is a combination of countries and even continents that have so much in common that a single man cannot lead to its collapse. American fatigue But even so, the pessimist camp believes that Trump’s anti-globalization and isolationist rhetoric is not much of an exception. They argue that Trump’s ideas are part of a growing tendency in American public life, where many people feel tired of America having to resolve the world’s problems while it has many of its own that have not been solved in years. A senior European official told the Guardian that, for all his brutal and undiplomatic take on foreign policy, Trump’s rhetoric is far from a one-off. The source explained that President Obama tried to pull America’s focus away from Europe, although in a more diplomatic way. “The presidents have understood the fatigue of the Americans towards foreign involvement in their own different ways.” Europe’s fears Russia’s assertive regional and global role under President Putin has increased the perception of Russia as an “existential threat” for European countries, especially in the UK and France where there have been recent reports of Russian meddling in domestic affairs. Many in Europe think that the declining solidarity and collectivist commitment within NATO will damage European security. Disunity and disagreements within the alliance “would weaken [Europe] and provide new opportunities for countries like Russia to take advantage of that,” Erik Brattberg, director or the Carnegie Endowment Europe’s program said. Europe’s world—in terms of security—would be “shattered” if things do not return to normal when Trump leaves the presidency, the senior European official further said. Whatever America does is the most defining contributor—both in funds and military personnel—to the functioning of the 70-year-old security alliance. Leon Panetta, a former US defense secretary, said, “Europeans are scared to death” the US will bring its troops home from Europe in the face of mounting threats from Russia. “They are scared to death. They are worried about a very unpredictable president of the United States. They are increasingly worried he is going to do things not based on what’s in their best interest, but solely on his vision of ‘America First,’” he said.

By Salihah Evans Rabat – Moroccan authorities made an official statement on Monday denying that 45 migrants died off the coast of Larache, near Tangier.  According to Le360, Morocco’s Interior Ministry responded to media allegations that Moroccan authorities extracted the bodies of 45 irregular immigrants that had reportedly drowned in the Atlantic off of Morocco’s northwest coast, 80 kilometers south of Tangier on Sunday. The Interior Ministry, however, reported that the boat was only carrying 33 African migrants. According to the department, all 33 migrants were successfully rescued. Five of the migrants, including a pregnant women, were admitted to Larache hospital. Two were released from the hospital later that day while the remaining three continue to receive care but appear to be in stable condition.   Thousands of sub-Saharan African migrants immigrate irregularly to Europe through Morocco annually. Smugglers exploit the desperation of migrants and overpack small rubber boats with migrants. The journey across the Mediterranean is dangerous and often fatal. The International Organization for Migration reports that over 1,000 irregular migrants have died in the Mediterranean so far this year.

Rabat – Morocco’s failure to win the rights to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup has reawakened a popular desire to end the decades-long regional rivalry in the Maghreb. Saudi Arabia’s lobbying against Morocco’s bid to host the footballing world’s most riveting celebration in 2026 angered Moroccan circles. In fact, in the aftermath of Morocco’s defeat at the June 13 vote, a number of Moroccans angrily spoke of the Arab world’s propensity for “hypocrisy” and “betrayal.” Setting aside the strategic alliances and power dynamics dictating global affairs, Moroccans seemed unapologetic about one thing: Arabs betrayed Morocco. The feeling was a strong message as to the necessity of a united Maghreb—a bit like a homecoming story. United Maghreb and culture Writing in the aftermath of Morocco’s 1-0 loss to Portugal in the group phase of the World Cup, Moroccan poet and columnist Karim Boukhari extolled the technical prowess of Moroccan players. Although it is paradoxical to celebrate defeat, he wrote, some defeats are essentially beautiful because they uncover so much more than they disappoint. But a reader who thought Boukhari was simply paying tribute to the Atlas Lions and forward Nordin Amrabat’s “heroic and patriotic performance,” missed the columnist’s larger point.  The “revealing beauty of defeat” of which he spoke resonated far beyond the national team’s “honorable” World Cup display. Boukhari was rhetorically setting the mood for regional unity in battles to come. “After losing the 2026 FIFA World Cup battle, Morocco should now know that our true friends and allies are first and foremost our neighbors. We share a history, a culture, and so many other beautiful things,” he said. “Maghreb United? Yes, definitely, for sports and brotherhood can mend what politics have for so long broken.” Tahar Ben Jelloun, perhaps Morocco’s most celebrated writer around the world, made the same argument in a recent column. The story behind Morocco 2026’s humiliating blow is simple: pan-Arabism has always been a pipedream. “Now we know our true and false friends. Algeria, loyal to our Magrhebi brotherhood, voted for us. Why not envision a common bid with Algeria and Tunisia for 2030?” he asked. Ben Jelloun pointed out that sports may turn out to be the “cement” the region needs to consolidate its “shaky fraternity.” Unity through sports Authorities in the concerned countries seem to have heard the message of cohesion and rapprochement that the footballing fever has created. Morocco, which after the June 13 defeat decided to bid again to host the World Cup in 2030, is now considering the prospects of a united Magrheb with Algeria and Tunisia. In response, Algeria’s Sports Minister Mohamed Hattab said his country would “study” the implications of a shared bid with Rabat and Tunis. “When we look at our cities, with the sporting and cultural facilities we have, we can host major world events,” Hattab said. Tunisia, unsurprisingly, said it would welcome the move, too. All parties seem convinced that the logistics and technical problems that FIFA’s task force—the expert committee responsible for assessing bidders’ preparedness—raised would be considerably mitigated if the three countries joined forces. The cautious optimism of authorities has been met with the fervor of writers, public personalities, and activists. The public believes that culture and sports can heal festering social wounds created by political rivalry. For them, where politics has failed for decades, cultural and sporting events could prove effective. The Algerian writer Kamel Daoud, who has reportedly signed a petition initiated  June 19 calling for the Algeria-Morocco border to be re-opened, has consistently said over the years that closed borders between two “sister nations” has resulted in years of reciprocal contempt and ignorance. Like his Moroccan friend Tahar Ben Jelloun, Daoud has argued that the closed borders policy and the ensuing arms race between Rabat and Algiers is “stupid and detrimental,” a self-flagellation of the highest order. Sports and cultural events have always been miles ahead of politics in driving the social mood and setting societal norms. Popular culture initiates, and politics follows suit and dictates boundaries, but ultimately politics prevails. The cult-like celebration of Gareth Southgate, England’s manager at the World Cup, as the best example of English masculinity speaks volumes about football’s potential for change and impact beyond the sporting realm.  Beyond the nationalistic bigotry of fans, the waving of flags, and footballers’ play-acting antics, there is always a genuine undertone of inclusion, empathy, and togetherness. But can pan-Maghrebism (which was tried once in 1989 and failed) replace the dying (or defunct) pan-Arabism? Will politics follow suit this time? “This will not happen overnight,” said a professor of international relations on condition of anonymity. He explained that the region’s complications are huge and beyond the mending and unifying power of any singular event, no matter how strong the popular will.  But, he maintained, “Sports can be a very good starting point, as a shared organization of the World Cup would necessitate open borders. Also, if Arabs do not want us,” he laughed, “Why not go back to our origins?”

Rabat – Courted by Borussia Dortmund, Arsenal, Olympique Marseille, and lately Olympique Lyon, Mehdi Benatia may ultimately choose to stay with Juventus. Having returned from the World Cup, Benatia was uncertain about his future international career. He was eliminated from the World Cup with the Moroccan team in the group stage, having lost out in the “group of death,” against Iran, Portugal, and Spain. While there were rumors of his departure from Turin during the summer Mercato (trade), the Juve may not be ready to let go of its defender yet.  According to Tuttosport, the Italian club is proposing a brand new contract to the 31-year-old Atlas Lion. Two months ago, Beppe Marotta, the sports director at Juventus, said he was not ready to give up his defender and shot down rumors of a transfer, saying the French-Moroccan sensation is not going anywhere.  However, according to Tuttosport, if Benatia refuses to renew his contract with Juve, the leaders of the club will begin their negotiations with Uruguayan defender Diego Godwin to replace him in the defensive hinge of the Turin squad. If he decides to stay, Benatia may play alongside one of the best footballers of his generation, Cristiano Ronaldo. The latter is rumored to join the Biaconneris with a contract until 2022 and a salary of EUR 30 million per year. Benatia had a great season with his club this year, winning the Italian Cup in May when he scored a double. Benatia, 31, has spent most of his career in Italy, where he has played for Udinese, AS Roma, and Juventus. He joined the latter on loan from German football giant Bayern Munich. Earlier this year, Benatia was voted best Maghreb player in 2017 by France Football, ahead of Algeria’s Riyad Mahrez and Morocco’s Hakim Ziyech.

Rabat- El Bachir Sirej has shared a video on Facebook complaining about a French water and electricity operator in Tangier,  Amendis, which he described as a “thief” for overcharging people. In the video which is circulating social media, Moroccan actor El Bachir Sirej complained that Amendis charged an elderly woman MAD 1,200 for a month. He claimed she used very little electricity. “I live between Spain and the US. When I came back [to Morocco], I paid [Amendis] but they kept charging me and taking my electricity meter…is there nobody out there to stop this ring of thieves?” Fuming, Sirej called on the people of Tangier to stand up against the company: “Get up! Unite and speak up for your rights…. They do not have the right to take your meter, it is yours, you paid MAD 8,000 for it.” Sirej referred to previous protests against Amendis, recalling that people in Tangier had launched a boycott once, but it was not successful. “These people should be jailed. There should be an investigation against them… because when you go to complain to the company [employees] they tell you: it’s the system!”  Sirej called on the government to intervene and find a solution: “I call on his majesty or anyone in the government…I will make a speech every three days until someone addresses the problem.” Amendis is a subsidiary of Veolia, a French transnational company of transport, energy services, water, and waste management.  Since 2002, Amendis has been the only operator providing Tangier with electricity, a drinkable water supply and the collection and treatment of waste waters. Amendis serves the 1.8 million inhabitants of the Tangier-Tetouan region. In 2015, Tangier residents protested Amendis’s high prices, carrying slogans reading “Leave, Amendis!” But Amendis has remained.  Moroccans have recently launched a boycott against the “exorbitant” prices of dairy, fuel, and mineral water of three prominent companies: Centrale Danone, Afriquia, and Sidi Ali. Whether a regional boycott against Amenids will break out or not, Moroccan citizens have proved that they will not tolerate prices they deem excessive for the purchasing power of the regular consumer.

Rabat – British oil and gas company Sound Energy has reportedly discovered large oil deposits in Anoual near Tendrara, in eastern Morocco. The British firm is now planning to sell 30 million shares on the stock market in order to collect the USD 15 million they will need to to dig three new wells in the region, reported newspaper Akher Saaa on Monday. The news followed a recent statement of the company that announced the completion of a modeling study which predicted a significant oil source at Sound’s Anoual permit site in June. According to the company, the discovery will reinforce its cash position as it initiatives its exploration program. The operation was scheduled to take place on July 6. “We expect this new deposit to be the target of our next exploration well,” said Brian Mitchener, Exploration Manager of Sound Energy. According to British-based energy outlet  Proactive Investors, the company said that the operation is in addition to the identification of the 5.5 trillion cubic feet (TCF) by Sound Energy. “The AIM-quoted explorer is acquiring and processing further 2D seismic data over the area, which is now being evaluated as a candidate for the planned third exploration well (TE-11).” Mitchener expressed his satisfaction with the project, emphasizing that he is “delighted to report receipt of the final basin model and the potential for a new oil play in the Paleozoic over the Anoual licence.” 
 Morocco has several international companies exploring the country’s potential resources in partnership with Morocco’s National Hydrocarbons Office (ONHYM). Along with Sound Energy, British giant SDX Energy is operating in Morocco’s gas exploration sector.

Rabat – Gianni Infantino has invited 13 members of a Thai youth football team who have been trapped in a cave in Thailand to attend the World Cup final. Infantino, FIFA President, wrote, “I would like to join you in expressing my deepest sympathies and support to the families of the players and coach,” in a letter to the team. “FIFA would be delighted to invite them to attend the 2018 World Cup final in Moscow as our guests.” The members of the team, aged 11 to 16 along with their coach have been trapped inside a cave for 15 days. The team were trapped after a sudden downpour closed off their exit. Former Thai Navy SEAL diver Saman Kunan died last week while on a rescue operation mission to install air tanks along the exit route on July 5. The evacuation of the young boys started on Sunday. Thirteen divers and five Thai Navy Seals entered the cave at 10 a.m. local time to begin rescuing the team and its coach. Quoted by news outlet Time, rescue mission chief Narongsak Osatanakorn told reporters that “Today is D-Day. We are 100% ready.” He further explained, “There’s a storm coming and if we wait for the rains, conditions won’t be as perfect as they are now.” The rescue team managed to bring out four boys on Sunday. After Sunday’s successful operation, the rescue team began again at 11:00 a.m. Monday. The Guardian quoted Osatanakorn today as saying: “The factors are as good as yesterday [and] the rescue team is the same team with a few replacements for those exhausted.”  Today’s operation resulted in the rescue of the fifth boy. Last week, the boys wrote handwritten letters to parents to console them, with their coach apologizing to the parents. The coach also promised to take good care of the boys.

Rabat – A terrorist attack has killed at least eight members of Tunisia’s security forces and injured several others near Tunisia’s border with Algeria. State-owned news agency Tunis Afrique Presse (TAP) reported that a group attacked a patrol of Tunisian security forces affiliated with the Tunisian Ministry of the Interior in the northwestern province of Jendouba. The ministry confirmed the incident. The ministry’s spokesperson, Sofian al-Zaak, spoke to reporters but did not give specific details about the death toll, according to news outlet DS. “The terrorist attackers threw a grenade at the first security car and there were confrontations with firearms,” he added. No terror group has claimed responsibility over the attack so far. Several international sources reported that the death toll has reached at least nine. Yesterday’s death toll is the highest in a terrorist attack in Tunisia since 2015, when ISIS carried out three major attacks. The first targeted a beach resort in Sousse, killing both Tunisians and foreign tourists. The second attack targeted a museum in the capital, and the third killed at least 12 presidential guards.

Rabat – Thousands of Moroccans marched in Casablanca in solidarity with Hirak Rif activists, who were handed sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years. Since June 26, the day a Casablanca court decided the sentences for 54 leaders of the Hirak Rif 2016-2017 protests, the government has received harsh criticism for the activists’ convictions and sentences. Thousands of citizens are determined that the sentences were “harsh” and “unfair,” since the activists were jailed for their involvement in protests decrying social disparities in the Al Hoceima province. Almost 10,000 protesters in Casablanca marched, carrying banners saying “justice” to call for the activists’ immediate release. The backlash over the sentences mounted as government officials said their hands were tied, emphasizing that the cabinet could not interfere since the judiciary is independent. Several politicians, however, showed solidarity with activists, including Head of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU) Nabila Mounib and leader of the Party of Progress and Socialism Nabil Benabdellah. Mounib also called on human rights NGOs, political parties, and citizens to participate in Sunday’s national march to support the activists. In a statement to Moroccan press, Mounib recalled that her party was among the first to show solidarity with the “political activists.” The leader of the PSU has long criticized the government’s approach in handling the Al Hoceima situation. Protests in Al Hoceima began in October 2016 with the death of informal fishmonger Mouhcine Fikri. After his goods were confiscated and thrown in a dump truck, Fikri attempted to retrieve them, but was crushed to death. In June 2017, Mounib said that “the government failed utterly to deal with the Rif protests.” In her interview with France 24, the politician said, “he parties’ leaders of the coalition government are merely opportunists.” criticizing the criminalization of protests after Fikri’s death. On June 26, the Casablanca Court of Appeals sentenced prominent Hirak activist Nasser Zefzafi and three other leaders involved in organizing protests, to 20 years in prison. The four are among 54 activists whom authorities arrested during protests in Al Hoceima in 2016 and 2017. The demonstrations were deemed “unauthorized” and met a stern response from security authorities. NGOs and citizens criticized the heavy-handed approach. Sunday’s march is not the first of its kind. Four protests erupted across Morocco in Nador, Casablanca, and Rabat to condemn the sentences given the Hirak activists. The protest leaders were reluctant to appeal the court’s verdicts. However, they agreed to appeal after a series of negotiations with their lawyers.  Only one of the activists, Rabie El Ablaq, who received a sentence of 5 years and a fine of MAD 2,000, decided not to appeal the court’s decision. El Ablaq has also been on a hunger strike for more than 36 days now.

Rabat – “I am not leaving the team,” he said. Two weeks after Morocco’s elimination from the 2018 World Cup, Atlas Lions’ midfielder Mbark Boussoufa has talked about his future with the national team. In an interview with Emirati newspaper “Al Ittihad,” the 33-year-old footballer expressed his commitment to his country, saying that he will stay with the Atlas Lions as long as he is needed. “I will stay with the Moroccan team. I will answer the selection’s call to represent my country. I am fully committed to play official and friendly games,” said Boussoufa. The football player also praised his coach Hervé Renard, thanking him for his “amazing” job. “It was Hervé Renard who asked me to stay. He is an incredible coach who does a very good job. He knows how to motivate. He is the warrior that the selection needed for a long time. He needs to stay with us.” Mbark Boussoufa is not the only Atlas Lion who hopes Renard does not leave. The captain of the national team, Mehdi Benatia, former Atlas Lion Youssouf Hadji, and his older brother assistant coach Mustapha Hadji, all publicly expressed their wish for Renard to stay. Hervé Renard has been the center of all kinds of rumors: rumors that he would join the Egypt and Algeria football teams, rumors of his feud with Mustapha Hadji, rumors of his required “conditions” for the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), rumors he wanted to leave Morocco’s team. “No one speaks with my name,” said Renard to end the speculation. He added that he has “a contract with FRMF until 2022.” “Many things are possible in the world of football. Sometimes there are leaders who are not happy with their coaches and they decide to replace them. There may also be a desire to leave from the coach. For the moment, we are not there. We will see what will happen in the coming weeks,” Renard said.

Rabat – A fire broke out today morning during the evacuation of a group of undocumented sub-Saharan migrants from a property owned by the National Railway Office (ONCF) near Fez’ train station. No injuries were sustained, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Civil protection forces have managed to control the fire, added the source. The fire has resulted in damage to nearly 50 plastic shelters used by migrants. The blast also caused the explosion of seven small gas cylinders that migrants used to cook, according to local authorities of the prefecture of the Fez-Meknes region. Authorities and regional human rights commissions contributed to the evacuation of the premises in normal conditions. #???..?????? ???? ????? ????? ???? ?????? ?????? ????? ???????? ?? ?????? ?? ????????? ???????? ??? ????? ??? ?????? ?????https://t.co/4X2ir1D5pM pic.twitter.com/YI6Me0lgMk — Agence MAP (@MAP_Information) July 8, 2018  In November 2017, violent clashes between sub-Saharan migrants and a group of Moroccans broke out near the Ouled Ziane bus station. The clashes caused a fire in the park the immigrants were using as a shelter. Every year, hundreds of sub-Saharan migrants arrive in Morocco using perilous crossing from the North African country to the Eldorado. The number of migrants using the sea route from Morocco to Spain has more than tripled between 2016-1017. Approximately 3,300 refugees Fez to Europe from Morocco in the first four months of 2017 compared to about a thousand in the same period in 2016. Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita called on Europe to find a strong solution to solve the issues of migration. The minister said in June that Morocco will refuse any action from the European Union to outsource migrant reception centers to Morocco, emphasizing that this suggestion is an “easy solution.” The official said that Morocco “rejects and has always rejected these kinds of methods for managing the issue of migration flows.”

Rabat – A series of photos of Morocco’s Atlas Lion’ Nabil Dirar puffing smoke from a shisha pipe (hookah) have sparked controversy on social media. Like most  Moroccan footballers, Dirar joined his fellow teammates such as Amine Harit and Munir El Haddaddi to spend part of his summer holiday in Marrakech. Dirar’s shisha party has not gone unnoticed, with fans wondering whether footballers are allowed to partake in smoking shisha. Typically, smoking is heavily discouraged in all professional sports that involve physical endurance, as smoking is harmful for the lungs and respiratory system, and can affect performances.. Dirar’s fans heavily criticized him for smoking shisha as it is forbidden by the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF). In 2016, the FRMF announced disciplinary sanctions against players who appeared in a video smoking a hookah in a hotel room in Marrakech. Similarly the video caused a stir on social media, and for that case the  federation decided to ban players Fahd Moufi and Adnane Boumous from completing training with their colleagues.

Rabat- The new Dolphin Park opened its doors on Friday, promising a host of summer fun for tourists, travelers and residents of Agadir. Named “Agadir Dolphin World,” the tourist resort has been a subject of controversy even before it opened. Established through a Russian investment amounting to MAD 8 million, the park occupies an area of  1500 square meters of Agadir’s Anza district. . Agadir Dolphin World was inaugurated on Friday, with   the Russian general consul in Casablanca, Andrey Tsyberko, the Wali of Souss-Massa region, Ahmed Hajji, and the president of the regional council, Brahim Hafidi in attendance The establishment mirrors the friendly ties and bilateral cooperation  between Morocco and Russia, Tsyberko told state owned press, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).

The  trade cooperation between the two countries is a “satisfactory” one, as described by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. The statement comes in line with  Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev’s visit to Morocco to discuss joint trade cooperation in October 2017.
 Russia ranked in 2016 as Morocco’s ninth supplier and 22nd client, however according to El Othmani, “there is still work to be done” to strengthen cooperation on energy, culture, and agriculture. In 2017, upon the announcement of the project, Moroccan animal and marine protection organizations expressed condemnation and worry over the conditions of dolphins in similar resorts and captivities. The organizations complained that resorts deny dolphins their natural hunting habits and put them at the risk of overexposure to the sun, they told Huffpost Maghreb.

Rabat – Morocco’s Tanger Med Port has emerged as a productive North African shipping hub, as statistics reveal a 7 percent increase in container traffic for the first half of 2018.  The port’s two terminals TC1 and TC2 processed 1,668,566 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) by the end of June, an increase of 7 percent, according to a statement from the port published by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The statement added that 252,194 cars were handled on both vehicle terminals during the first six months of 2018, representing an increase of 18 percent compared to the first half of 2017. The Renault terminal processed 204,244 vehicles, of which 160,757 were for export, while the Common User Terminal recorded a total of 47,950 vehicles for the first half of 2018.  International Road Transports (TIR truck) traffic, according to the statement, recorded a 14 percent growth by the end of June with 185,052 units. Despite the productivity of the port in terms of vehicle transports, the hub recorded a decrease in passenger traffic by 13 percent, with a total of 733,646 passengers passing through the port. The drop in passenger traffic resulted from a significant decrease in companies’ (4 foreign and 1 Moroccan) ferry services.  Currently, they average 17 rotations per day, whereas Tanger Med can process up to 50 rotations per day. Since the launch of the 2018 Marhaba operation, Moroccans residing abroad have been protesting the high prices of ferry services.  Thanks to the port, the city of Tangier has established itself as the gateway to Africa,  and has significantly boosted Morocco’s economic activities. In February, Spanish business newspaper Cinco Dias underscored the importance of the 10-year old Tanger  Med Port, which is internationally considered as one of the major ports in the world.

Rabat – Scott Pruitt, the Administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), resigned Thursday “under heavy fire for a series of ethics-related controversies,” Reuters reported. “The unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us,” Pruitt said in his resignation letter. US President Donald Trump accepted Pruitt’s resignation and lauded his efforts. Pruitt’s resignation comes after months of controversies over his expensive trips taken at taxpayer expense and “violating law by installing the $43,000 phone booth for Pruitt’s office without telling lawmakers first,” according to Reuters. Ethics accusations against Pruitt also involved him giving his wife a job at the Republican Attorneys General Association with a salary of USD 200,000. Allegations of ethics violation in December Morocco trip A number of US senators have asked for an investigation into Pruitt’s visit to Morocco last December, especially since it was related to energy and gas issues, but had nothing to do with environmental protection. Pruitt’s travel records showed the US government spent USD 17,000 in taxpayer money on the trip to promote US exports of “liquefied natural gas,” which is not part of the EPA’s jurisdiction. The Washington Post Donald Trump, the trip “was partly arranged by a longtime friend and lobbyist, who accompanied Pruitt and his entourage at multiple stops and served as an informal liaison at both official and social events during the visit.” Tellingly, the lobbyist was later hired as a lobbyist for Morocco at USD 40,000 per month. The position raises questions as to whether Pruitt visited the kingdom to do his friend a favor and bolster the lobbyist’s relationships in Morocco. Pruitt was nominated by Trump and served as EPA administrator from February 17, 2017, to July 6, 2018. Prior to that, he had served as Oklahoma attorney general in 2010. He tried to fight many of the civil laws legislated under former President Barack Obama on abortion rights, gay rights, and affordable health care. The Environmental Protection Agency is a US federal government agency responsible for protecting US citizens’ health and environment by monitoring all activities that can contribute to increasing pollution and affecting the climate.

Rabat – The Criminal Chamber at the Court of First Instance in Temara has handed sentences ranging from 3.5 to 10 years to 15 defendants charged with international drug trafficking. On Wednesday, the court sentenced nine defendants to 10 years in prison with a fine of MAD 500,000. One was given six years in prison and a fine of MAD 250,000. Two were given five years in prison and a fine of MAD 250,000. four years in prison and a fine. Two other defenders were fined MAD 250,000. The last defendant was sentenced to 3.5 years in prison and a fine of MAD 250,000.  The case goes back to October 2017 when the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) seized 2,588 tons of cocaine and arrested 10 individuals suspected of being involved in a criminal network of international drug trafficking. The record amount of cocaine was partly concealed in a foreign-registered vehicle and partly in a farm on the coastal road between Temara and Skhirat. However most of the stash was found on a farm near Oued Cherrat, in Bouznika province, another portion was found in Nador. The market value of the quantity of cocaine seized is estimated at hundreds of millions of Moroccan dirhams, and the investigations carried out revealed that the criminal network had operations in several Moroccan cities.

Rabat – Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces (FAR) have ordered a strategic redeployment of Moroccan warships in response to Algerian threats, bringing Morocco-Algeria hostilities to new heights and raising concerns of direct confrontation. According to Assabah, in its July 7-8 issue, Morocco’s move is a response to Algerian military maneuverings and a show of force on the Mediterranean in recent months.  Morocco, which has acquired US-made state-of-the-art military equipment, has deployed frigates and a newly acquired warship off its northern coast to both respond to the alarming presence of Algerian ships and to thwart criminal activities at sea, according to Assabah. The outlet reported that Morocco aims to showcase its navy offensive capabilities should there be indirect provocations from Algeria. “Morocco’s FAR are ready for confrontation at sea,” the report said. In addition to responding to Algerian frigate movements off Moroccan coasts, the Moroccan navy is also taking preemptive measures against terrorist infiltrations and piracy.  However, the report added, Morocco’s move is solely aimed to deter, not to provoke. Assabah also noted rumored deals between the US navy and its Moroccan counterpart to provide the North African country with new American frigates.  Morocco’s navy is allegedly interested in acquiring American frigates similar to the Spanish navy’s Descubierta-class corvettes. These ships can strike a target with their harpoon anti-ship missile system. Equally important is the FAR’s plan to purchase the German Type 212 submarine. The submarine’s many properties, including high speeds and secrecy in waters, will position Morocco as a regional and continental leader in terms of naval capabilities, Assabah added. In the coming months, the Mohammed VI warship will also be inaugurated. According to military sources quoted by Assabah, the warship’s shooting accuracy and its highly advanced missile system are set to give the Moroccan Navy the technical means to assert itself as one of the African continent’s strongest and most equipped navies.

Rabat – Tunisia has echoed Algeria’s interest in bidding jointly with Morocco and Algeria to host the 2030 World Cup. The President of the Tunisian Football Federation (FTF), Wadie Jary, told BBC on Thursday that his country is open to the idea. “We have not received any official offers, but we are open to this idea and we would like that to happen,” he said. The Tunisian official’s remarks came a few days after Algerian Minister of Youth and Sports Mohamed Hattab said that “with the sports infrastructure that was built, Algeria is ready to study a possible joint bid” with Morocco and Tunisia to organize the 2030 World Cup. Tunisia and Algeria were among the 65 countries that voted for Morocco to host the 2026 World Cup. Morocco, however, lost the hosting rights to the FIFA 2026 World Cup to the joint North American United 2026 bid, which won 134 votes.

Rabat – The Moroccan-Spanish footballer Munir El Haddadi has shared a series of photos on Instagram from his family vacation in Morocco’s red city, Marrakech. The footballer, who is now loaned to Alaves from FC Barcelona, spent a one week vacation in Marrakech and shared pictures of himself and what attracted him in Marrakech. El Haddadi joined Alaves on loan for the 2017-2018 season. Munir has also represented the Spanish national team, the Spanish under-19 football team, and the Spanish under-21 football team. Born to Moroccan parents in Spain, the footballer represented Spain at the youth level and made a brief appearance as a substitute at an international game against Macedonia in 2014.  MARRAKECH!?? A post shared by  Twitter: @Munirhaddadi (@munirhaddadi) on Jun 28, 2018 at 9:00am PDT  Because of El Haddadi’s 15 minutes playing with Spain’s national team on the pitch in 2014, he cannot now represent Morocco.  In 2017, El Haddadi urged Morocco to help him convince FIFA to let him represent Morocco. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) asked FIFA to let him play for Morocco. The FIFA Players’ Status Committee ruled that El Haddadi’s sporting nationality could not be changed from Spain to Morocco March 13. When the decision was appealed,  the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) confirmed the FIFA ruling with a verdict in May.

Rabat- In a plenary session on Thursday at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, European Union (EU) deputies rejected some MEPs’ amendments regarding Western Sahara. The MEPs introduced amendments on MINURSO’s mandate, which has been extended for six months until October 31, 2018. The MEPs’ suggestions stated that the EU should apply the ruling of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on an EU-Morocco agriculture and fisheries deal, which the ECJ deemed invalid. In favor of the EU-Morocco fishery ties which date back to 1988, an absolute majority of the EU voted against the amendments perceived as “hostile”to Morocco’s interests. The Polisario Front has constantly appealed against the EU-Morocco agreements that allow Morocco to sell fishing rights in the waters off the Western Sahara, urging the Court of Justice to intervene. On January 10, the court’s Advocate General, Melchior Wathelet, commented on the agreement, saying that it should be declared null and void because it includes Western Sahara. The court’s stance sparked strong reactions from Morocco as well as experts and analysts concerned with the Western Sahara issue. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said, “Nothing in the [court’s] verdict challenges the political legitimacy of Morocco to conclude agreements with the EU.” Echoing the statements of many experts—such as former policy advisor at the European Parliament, Jeanne Laperrouza—Professor of international law Reda El-Fellah previously told Morocco World News the ECJ has no power over the legality of the EU-Morocco agreements. Laperrouza had said that the EU and UN are competent enough to address the annulment of an international agreement, and, “The ECJ court does not have the authority to conclude that Sahara waters do not fall within the sovereignty or jurisdiction of Morocco.”

Rabat – The Council of the EU has given the EU Commission the “green light” to start talks with Morocco and seven other MENA countries on exchanging data with Europol. The European Parliament issued a press statement, Thursday, July 5, about upcoming talks. “The aim of strengthening cooperation is to prevent and combat terrorism and organized crime, and to better address migration-related challenges such as the facilitation of irregular migration and trafficking in human beings.” The MEPs (Members of the European Parliament) stressed the need for “personal data safeguards” ahead of talks with the eight Middle Eastern and North African countries. “Clear safeguards are necessary not only to protect data, but also to ensure that fundamental rights and freedoms are respected, given the differing legal frameworks, societal characteristics and cultural backgrounds of the eight countries as compared with the EU.” The agreement cannot be concluded if it fails to comply with EU law on the protection of personal data, to ensure equivalent protection. The European Parliament set out certain “limits and guiding principles” to the Council, Commission, and the countries concerned for the negotiations. “We have set out a number of red lines, including on further processing, data retention periods, the principle of specificity, and the prohibition of data exchange if there is a risk of cruel or inhuman treatment. There can be no weakening of the level of protection provided in EU law, either directly or indirectly, and we call for European standards of data protection, human rights and accountability to be upheld,” said Civil Liberties Committee Chair and rapporteur Claude Moraes. The negotiations on data exchange will be held with Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel. After negotiating the agreements, Parliament will have to approve them before they can be concluded. Europol, formally known as the European Police Office is the European law enforcement agency, serves to maintain security in Europe by supporting EU Member States in combating major international organized crimes and terrorism.

Rabat – In response to controversy over ticket prices for the ferry between Spain and Morocco, Secretary of State to Minister of Equipment, Transport and Logistics  Mohamed Najib Boulif shared a statement with ticket prices for all the ferries. In recent weeks and with the onset of the summer season,  Moroccans residing abroad (MREs) have complained about the cost of tickets for the ferry.  Increases in ferry ticket prices led to massive demonstrations at departure points for the ferry to Spain: Algeciras, Tangier, Almería, and Nador.  In response, Boulif shared a statement from the ministry showing ticket prices for each crossing point. Boulif took to his Facebook on Friday, saying that he had received several complaints. “I have been contacted by many citizens, mainly our Moroccan brothers, who complain about the high prices of cruise tickets between southern Spain and Morocco.” He added that after monitoring the situation closely and communicating with the ferry companies, “I would  like to inform everyone of the prices we officially stood on… and which we will follow closely during the coming weeks to take steps that are necessary in accordance with the laws in force and the agreement signed between the ministry and the companies.” According to the statement, a round-trip ticket from Algeciras to Tanger Med Port for a single passenger is MAD 480, while a one-way trip is set at MAD 280. A one way trip for one passenger and his vehicle is MAD 1,370, while a round trip is MAD 2,340. A round trip for a vehicle and two passengers from the same crossing point is MAD 2,860. The price doubles depending on the number of passengers and crossing points. Find all prices in the statement below:  Moroccan news outlet Al Yaoum 24 reported that Moroccans living in southern Spain and working in ticket sales points say the prices have never been that high. Morocco launched the “Marhaba 2018” operation to welcome home for the summer Moroccans living abroad on June 5. The operation will continue until September 15. Morocco’s Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity mobilized to welcome nearly 2.5 million Moroccans residing abroad and returning to Morocco for the summer holidays. The Marhaba team spread across the Mediterranean, including Taourirte, Tazaghine, Jebha, Tangier Med, Tangier City, Nador, and Al Hoceima, in addition to the borders at Bab Sebta (Ceuta) and Bab Melilla.

Rabat – Is Amine Harit free of all charges? According to Arabic outlet Al Akhbar, Moroccan footballer Amine Harit has made a financial agreement with the family of the victim. The Schalke 04 football player supposedly “had to propose a fairly large amount to the family.” According to Al Akhbar, “The negotiations were not easy and it was the footballer’s lawyer who put the two sides in contact.” The Atlas Lion was involved in a road accident that fatally injured a pedestrian in Marrakech. The accident occurred while the player was driving with his 14-year-old brother on Saturday, June 30, shortly after midnight. Twenty-one-year-old Harit has recovered his passport and his driving license, which police had retained, on Tuesday, June 3. On Tuesday, the Schalke 04 sports director, Christian Heidel, announced that his player had regained his passport and license, shortly after landing in China with the rest of the team. Heidel said that Amine Harit got his passport and driver’s license back. He can now return to Germany, where his club Schalke 04 and his teammates are waiting on him to begin training. This week, the family of the young victim spoke to the media about their son’s death. The mourning family complained about the way Moroccan authorities handled the accident. Moreover, they claimed that they did not want money. “I just want to understand why they didn’t call me when my son died. He had the accident around 11 p.m. and I received the call at 7 a.m.,” the mother said. Addressing rumors of an amicable agreement involving money, she clarified her situation. “Amine Harit’s father and his uncle came to offer their condolences. When they left, the press said they came to give us money,” she said, insisting that there was no money involved. “I don’t want money; nothing will ever replace my son.” As for the victim’s father, all he wants is that “the justice do its job.” Did the family have a change of heart?

Rabat – Mohamed Abdennabaoui has spoken on individual freedoms and torture in Morocco with Spanish international news agency EFE. Amid the uproar over the harsh sentences given to the Hirak Rif activists and journalists, many Moroccan human rights activists are worried about the negative impact the court’s ruling could have on Morocco’s human rights image internationally. However, Mohamed Abdennabaoui, President of the Prosecutor General’s Office, seems less worried about international opinions, despite the fact the heavy sentences handed down against Hirak Rif activists have been followed by international media and human rights organizations. Abdennabaoui said that human rights and individual freedoms, as sensitive issues, should be interpreted according to the culture of each country. He implied there are some human rights which are not accepted by Moroccan culture. “There are secular states and others where religion, cultures, and customs have an important position. There is a new generation of human rights that is not accepted by all cultures.”  ‘There are no freedoms without limits’ When asked about Morocco’s laws punishing homosexuality, extramarital sexual relations, or proselytizing to Muslims in Morocco, Abdennabaoui gave conservative answers. He did not deny that individual freedoms are part of human rights, but said they are determined by the culture, religion, and customs of each society. “There are no freedoms without limits. All freedoms are determined by law…. We cannot criminalize facts that are not punishable by law, and vice versa.” Abdennabaoui noted that freedom of belief is guaranteed in the country as long as it remains in the private sphere and does not extend to proselytizing, which is punishable by up to three years in prison. The news outlet described Abdennabaoui as intransigent when he said that there is no room for tolerance of public eating during the month of Ramadan. It is an act “that violates the law” and “disturbs public order,” he answered. “The law is the collective conscience of the society that created it, and interpretations only fit with the jurisprudence…. If I stop applying existing laws, I will provoke disorder. Democracy is the application of law.” Morocco’s image abroad is not of much importance according to Abdennabaoui. What matters to him instead is Moroccans’ opinion. “What worries me is what the Moroccans say and not the Europeans, because the law is carried out in Morocco.” The debate on individual freedoms “should be resolved in Parliament,” he said, because the role of the prosecutor’s office is to ensure respect for the law and maintaining order. But since Abdennabaoui is concerned about Moroccans’ opinions, one is left asking why he does not side with those who have expressed outrage over the sentences given to the Hirak Rif activists. “The individual is part of the community; if he commits a tolerable act I apply the principle of granting opportunities, but if what he does affects the common memory, in this case I position myself with the community.” “I can contribute in cases where there is no conflict of public order, [but] we cannot play with fire. It is not about being modernist or conservative, it is a matter of public order,” he said. The Spanish outlet noted that this was “an expression he kept repeating and to which he returned again and again.” Concerning accusations of Morocco torturing political prisoners, Abdennabaoui asserted that torture practically does not exist in the country since the government recently established mechanisms to control police stations and detention centers. “There may be cases of mistreatment, but the state does not admit these practices.” Although the Spanish media follows Morocco’s political issues closely and the Hirak activists’ case is a hot issue, the outlet did not ask Abdennabaoui about it. Previously, Abdennabaoui told local media that the 20-year sentences were legally the minimum punishment for four activists convicted of a capital crime while participating in the 2016-2017 Hirak protests. Despite holding a high position of authority and influence in Morocco, Abdennabaoui came off as less than diplomatic in the interview, especially on the sensitive issue of human rights. Abdennabaoui’s conservative positions could undermine Morocco’s major efforts to promote its public image over the last 10 years.

Rabat – Morocco’s Health Ministry has ordered the recall of all batches of certain valsartan-based medicines supplied by the Chinese manufacturer Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical. Valsartan-based medications are used to treat clients with high blood pressure to reduce complications such as heart attacks. The medication is also used by patients who have had heart disease or a recent heart attack. The ministry called on medicine distributors and pharmacies to stop selling all valsartan-based medicines, including VALSARTAN WIN 80 mg and 160 mg, CO-VALSARTAN WIN 80 mg/12.5mg and 16 mg/25 mg and ATENSIL 40 mg, 80 mg and 160 mg. According to a statement from the Ministry of Health, tests detected the appearance of an impurity, probably carcinogenic, in drugs containing valsartan manufactured by Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical. “If you use any of the medicines listed above, it is important to consult your doctor to replace it with another valsartan drug from a different source or take alternative treatment,” the ministry advised citizens. However, it is important for people using the medicines “not to interrupt” their treatment, and the ministry recommended patients consult their doctor or pharmacist with any questions.  The alert affects several countries since N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was detected in the active substance “valsartan,” added the statement. Analysts did not expect to find NDMA, and its presence must be linked to changes in the way the active substance was manufactured. The ministry noted that “only the drugs mentioned above are affected.”

Rabat – The Andean Parliament has once again expressed support for Morocco’s efforts to find a solution to the decades-long conflict over Western Sahara. The President of the Andean Parliament, Fernando Meza Moncada, endorsed Morocco’s Autonomy Plan on Thursday in Rabat, describing the Moroccan initiative as “very positive.” Moncada told MAP that the Andean Parliament supports Morocco’s territorial integrity, emphasizing that he believes that “the ideology of the enemies of Morocco concerning the Sahara issue is obsolete. Moncada made his statement after his talks with Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Mohammad Ali Lazrak. According to Moncada, the ideology “only complicates” the finding of a solution to the dispute over Western Sahara, referring to Algeria’s continuous refusal to engage in the UN-led political process as a main party to the conflict. Morocco has been calling on Algeria to contribute to finding a solution for the dispute. The last attempt was voiced by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita in his recent interview with France 24. “If we want to find a solution to this problem, it is necessary that this part [Algeria] is involved as much as it has contributed to creating this problem,” said the Moroccan minister. Moncada described the Moroccan Initiative for Autonomy as “very positive.” This adds the Andean Parliament to the list of international communities that are backing Morocco’s initiative. During his discussion with MAP, Moncada emphasized that his visit to Morocco is an opportunity to “consolidate the relations between Andean member states and observer countries,” stressing that “Morocco is the most important observer country of this legislative institution.” He added that his visit will further reinforce political and economic relations between the two sides and address the challenges facing the greater international community. In June, the Andean Parliament unanimously supported Morocco’s autonomy plan, seeing it as a lasting political solution to the Western Sahara conflict. Moncada also visited Morocco in April, where he reiterated his support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. During his April visit, Moncada said that his visit was a message of solidarity and consideration from the Andean Parliament.

Rabat – Saman Kunan, a former Navy SEAL diver, died yesterday as he attempted to rescue a group of 12 Thai boys trapped in a cave with their 25-year-old football coach. The 38-year-old former Navy SEAL was part of the rescue team that had been battling a race against the clock and worsening environmental conditions, working day in and day out to find an exit from the cave where twelve boys and their coach have been trapped for twelve days. Kunan was given tributes from around the world. The diver’s body is set to “receive a royal-sponsored funeral in coming days,” according to the Guardian.  Kunan has been  hailed a “national hero” with Thai authorities and SEAL members applauding his bravery. Kuman volunteered to supply the trapped boys with oxygen by diving deep inside the cave to place air tanks along the cave. On his way back, however, he fell short of air supply and became unconscious. “His job was to deliver oxygen. He did not have enough on his way back,” said Chiang Rai region Deputy Governor Northern Thailand region where the rescue mission took  place. “He always participated in SEAL activities until the last step of his life. Saman left us while working as a diver and in a time where all divers are joining forces to complete the mission. His efforts and determination will always remain in the heart of all divers. May you rest in a peace and we will accomplish this mission as you had wished,” read a statement by Thai navy SEALs. Offering condolences to the deceased’s family, the Thai armed forces wrote: “Cave diving is one of the most difficult jobs in the world.” Emotional footage has emerged of Kunan’s involvement with the rescue, showing an optimistic and driven man embarking on a risky task with composure and an unfailing sense of responsibility. The footage reinforced the tributes paid to Kunan. In the video, Kunan said, “I am at Suvarnabhuni airport waiting to board the plane to join the mission in Chiang Rai… See you this evening. We will bring the kids home.” Clinging to hope When the trapped boys were discovered on July 2 by a team of British divers, the news was widely celebrated both in Thailand and around the world, with people sending prayers and good wishes. They expected a successful rescue mission in the following hours. “More than 130 million liters of water has been pumped from the cave this week,” the Guardian reported earlier today, hinting at the enormous efforts that rescue teams have invested in saving the boys. Bill Whitehouse, a veteran British diver, told the Associated Press that Kuman’s death is “awful news.” Whitehouse added that the tragedy “illustrates the dangers in the operation that is being undertaken, it isn’t a walk in the park… It is a very unforgiving environment.” While the joy of the boys’ discovery has been dampened by Kuman’s death and the dire environmental conditions around the cave, rescuers from Thailand and several other countries are still working day and night to find an exit for the trapped boys. Apakorn Yookongkaew, one of the commanding officers of the rescue mission, said: “Even if we lost one of our men, we cannot lose hope in the mission. We will rescue the boys.”  Yookongkaew further noted that environmental conditions in the cave are expected to worsen in coming days. “We can’t wait. There is no time,” one of the divers said.

Rabat- Khat Achahid, a group of former Polisario members, has written to the AU about the Polisario Front’s violations of human rights and executions of Sahrawis. The movement, which calls itself “Polisario Khat Achahid” (Polisario Line of the Martyr), sought to turn African leaders attention to the Tindouf camps and the actions of Polisario’s leadership. The letter was published in Arabic in the Mauritanian outlet Aqlam Horra on June 28, 2018. The letter was addressed to the AU summit in Nouakchott, which ended Monday, July 2. Khat Achahid considers the Polisario leadership to be “only individuals who cling to power,” and some of them as “prosecuted criminals,” who exploit the suffering of their families in Tindouf camps. Since the Western Sahara conflict has not yet come to a solution, the dissident Polisario faction sees this as “a human crime” against their people, “who have been suffering in the camps for more than 45 years.” The letter continues to deny Polisario’s right to negotiate on behalf of the Sahrawis with the Moroccan government or other parties about their fate since “this leadership represents only themselves and their interests.” The Polisario Front, according to Khat Achahid, is not authorized to negotiate or speak on behalf of the Sahrawis. “It is not the ‘sole legitimate’ representative of the Sahrawis as it falsely claims,” the movement added, wondering who has given it this “sole legitimacy!” The movement claimed the participants from the Polisario Front in the AU summit did not represent any political currents because of “the lack of democracy, pluralism and freedom of opinion” within the Polisario. “There is only one leadership, one party, and one opinion. Appointments in the African Parliament are not made through elections, but by the leadership, to those who are more loyal and obedient to them.” Khat Achahid also accused Polisario’s leader, who is taking part in the summit, of “gross human rights violations in the camps, including arrests, torture, and assassinations when he served as Polisario’s Minister of Defense.” The movement stated that 650 people went missing from Tindouf camps from 1975 to 1991, and they were subjected to various types of torture and executions without trials. Khat Achahid further provided examples of the Polisario leadership’s crimes against human rights. The examples included executions of Sahrawi young men in the Sahara camps. “A few weeks ago a young Sahrawi was executed, but the leadership claimed that he committed suicide in his prison cell and was buried at night, without allowing his family to participate in the funeral or perform an autopsy. This led to a popular uprising against Polisario’s leadership autocracy.” Finally, the movement emphasized its belief in the leading role of the African Union in supporting democracy and human rights in Tindouf camps, “which have been under the authority of Polisario’s leadership for more than 40 years.” Khat Achahid called upon the African Summit’s leaders to take into account their opinion because they “represent an important section of the Sahrawi society,” and not only Polisario’s opinions. Akhat Achahid also requested the AU to send independent international observers to the camps to verify the truth about the facts in their letter. The group further called on the AU to consult with them, “as an important part of the Saharan public opinion inside and outside the camps, to find a final solution to the conflict in Western Sahara within the framework of the UN-supervised negotiations between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Sahrawis’ representatives.” In April 2017, Khat Achahid accused Polisario leaders of accumulating fortunes at the expense of the local population, in the aftermath of the UN Security Council’s unanimous passing of Resolution 2351 regarding Western Sahara.

Rabat – Morocco’s Atlas Lion Karim El Ahmadi has been linked to a possible move to Saudi Arabia’s Ittihad Jeddah football club. Dutch sports sources, including Karim El Ahmadi, reported that El Ahmadi’s current team Feyenoord will soon sign a contract with Ittihad Jeddah for the Moroccan footballer. According to Voetbal International, Feyenoord head coach Giovanni van Bronckhorst recently hinted that he will send El Ahmadi on an “adventure.” The Dutch club already sent the footballer on loan to UAE team Al Ahli Club in 2011. After the Ahli adventure, Feyenoord signed another deal with Aston Villa for another two seasons (2012-2014), for GBP 2 million. The footballer made 56 appearances with Aston Villa. El Ahmadi joined Feyenoord in 2008 and played two seasons with them before joining Al Ahli on loan. El Ahmadi also made the list of the Atlas Lions who participated in the 2018 World Cup. If El Ahmadi accepts his deal with the Saudi club, he will be the second Moroccan to join a Saudi club after Achraf Bencharki, who decided to join Saudi Football Club Al Hilal earlier this year.

By Chase Lacy Rabat- According to Bloomberg, the Moroccan government has finalized a plan to cap fuel prices and awaits approval by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. General Affairs Minister Lahcen Daoudi said that El Othmani is expected to sign it soon, and that all he knew was the plan would be implemented this year.  The fuel price cap comes amongst growing anger and demonstrations against rising living costs, that have fueled the ongoing boycott against three companies: Sidi Ali, Afriquia gas, and Centrale Danone.  In 2015, Morocco lifted fuel subsidies, deregulating the fuel distribution market; now prices have reached a five year high. The public became more angry when a parliamentary report was leaked, revealing fuel distributors had increased their profits. As prices increased, distributors’ profit margins widened, but they did not expand Morocco’s storage capacity as pledged.  Once approved, the plan will allow the government to impose a temporary measure in an attempt to avoid excessive price fluctuations.  According to Daoudi, the government can adjust these prices every 15 days. Once implemented the plan will last for a period of six months to a year.  Distributors, such as Total Maroc and Vivo energy, will be affected by these price caps on fuel and are in consistent talks with the Moroccan Petroleum Group (GPM).

Rabat- Morocco’s High Commission for Planning will  present its annual report on Morocco’s economy on July 10. The HCP’s High Commissioner, Ahmed Lahlimi Alami, will preside over the Casablanca press conference to provide predictions on the kingdom’s economic progress from 2018-2019 on the national and international level. HCP previously revealed a slowdown in Morocco’s national economic growth during the first three months of 2018 due to a downturn in agricultural activities in comparison to 2017. In 2017, the national economic growth saw improvements in agricultural value and the growth rate of non-agricultural activities. The growth rate stood at 3.9 percent by the end of 2017, compared to 1.2 percent a year earlier.

Rabat – In a BBC interview, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said he was disappointed to see that none of the African teams made it to the second round in the 2018 World Cup in Russia. When asked if he was saddened by Africa’s early exit, Infantino replied, “Of course.” Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, and Tunisia—all the teams from Africa that qualified for the competition—were eliminated in the group stage. It was a first in 36 years. “The World Cup is for the whole world and the African teams were very, very close at the end,” Infantino added. “An Asian (team) made it—an African not—but I think they will be ready soon for the next one,” he told BBC Sport. The elimination of the African teams has been contested. Many African teams blame FIFA for prioritizing big teams and foregoing the use of video assistant referee (VAR) for the games with African teams. For example, the Moroccan team felt VAR was not used properly in its games against Portugal and Spain. On June 25, the referees awarded an equalizer to Spain, even though the corner-kick preceding the final goal of the match should have been played from the opposite side. The international media, including Le Parisien, heavily criticized the refereeing during the game. In the Portugal-Morocco game on June 20, the referee refused to use VAR three times when Portuguese footballers committed mistakes Morocco felt were obvious that could have resulted in penalty kicks for Morocco. After the game, FIFA issued a statement to deny a Moroccan footballer’s accusation that Mark Geiger, the American referee in the Morocco-Portugal game, had requested a Portugal jersey. FIFA said the referee acted in “an exemplary and professional manner as an appointed match official.”

Rabat – The Moroccan Delegate Ministry for Moroccans Residing Abroad held a two-day workshop on “Innovation and new technologies: opportunities for Morocco,” July 4-5 in Skhirat near Rabat. The workshop was attended by Moroccan skilled workers, entrepreneurs, and professionals living in France. The experts gathered together to discuss ways of “integrating Morocco in the ongoing worldwide digitization of markets.” One year after the establishment of the “13th region,” a virtual region dedicated to Moroccan entrepreneurs living overseas, the workshop aims to stimulate initiative among the Moroccan diaspora in cutting-edge sectors such as tech, energy, and education. Opening the workshop, Abdelkrim Benatiq, Minister Delegate responsible for Moroccans Living Abroad (MRE) and Migration Affairs highlighted the strong ties linking Morocco to France. “The relationship between the two countries is primarily based on a long history of commonality, openness, sincerity and continuity,” he said, before highlighting another important pillar of the relationship. “Thanks to their dual membership and their skills and potential, Moroccans living in France have made themselves a lever for development and cooperation strengthening the partnership between the two countries, hence the need to channel their efforts for a better targeting of their contribution to development.” “There are 1,500,000; of whom 690,000 are binational. Thanks to the trust shown to them by their host country, they have managed to merge brilliantly into the economic echelon of the kingdom, constituting an undeniable added value in several sectors,” he said. Benatiq noted that in order to mobilize Moroccan workers in France, the department in charge of MRE adopted a thematic approach through the organization of a series of 12 workshops. The workshops are meant define the best tools to build an active and sustainable partnership between Moroccans living in the diaspora and at home. The minister underlined that the Skhirat workshop is a part of these meetings that aim to mobilize the expertise of Moroccan skills in France, support Moroccan reforms, create links with Moroccan professionals, support investment projects, and promote the transfer of technology. “France is on Morocco’s side for this initiative,” said the French ambassador to Morocco, Jean-François Girault, who also highlighted the strengthening of an exceptional partnership. The ambassador stated that the consolidation of the countries’ bilateral relations relies on Moroccans living in France. “Young Moroccans are attracted to education in France, as nearly 60 percent of them choose French schools,” he noted. Moroccan students are in the lead of international students admitted to prestigious French schools.  The French diplomat also highlighted the kingdom’s policy towards the development of the tech sector through the implementation of Morocco Digital 2020, calling for the strengthening of cooperation in digital entrepreneurship. Organized within the framework of the 13th Region Moroccan Entrepreneurs of the World (MeM) by CGEM, the event was attended by Adil Zaidi, president of the virtual region. He said, “Via this platform, we see in which sector to direct the investor” and “We are a package for him to have information.” Speaking with Morocco World News, Zaidi explained, “This region also includes a student forum to involve young people. The 4th generation having already started in the rank of MRE.”  Zaidi also announced the creation of regional business environment committees with a rating system to further promote investment. Hicham Zanati Serghini, General Manager of the Central Guarantee Fund (CCG), focused on the Innov Invest fund, which has MAD 50 billion in commitments. “We managed to innovate,” he says, speaking about this product among others.

Rabat – Moroccan football legend Moustapha Hadji has responded to claims of a fallout between himself and the Atlas Lions’ Coach Hervé Renard. He “categorically” dismissed the claims, disparaging them as unfounded speculations. Hadji is the Moroccan national football team’s second assistant coach. Last week there were reports that Hadji’s relationship with many of the team’s key players created an unfriendly climate, leading to complications with the head coach Hervé Renard. Sources at the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) alleged that Hadji’s departure from the coaching staff was one of the requirements Renard submitted to FRMF to retain his managing position with Atlas Lions. Speaking to 2M Radio, Hadji spoke of the warm atmosphere and the “fraternal” terms that marked the Atlas Lions’ stay in Russia during the group phase of the FIFA World Cup. He called Renard an “elder brother” and suggested that their relationship has reached a level beyond football or professional collaboration. Hadji is annoyed that people speak on his or Renard’s behalf about the pair’s relationship. “No one has the right to speak on Hervé’s or my behalf,” he said. “Our partnership goes beyond a simple professional relationship. He is first and foremost a friend and an elder brother.” “Our collaboration, including with Renard, Patrice Bomel (the first assistant coach), the whole technical staff, and the team itself is exemplary and exceptional. Football aside, if one day I have a problem, I know I can count on Hervé Renard.” Proud of Atlas Lions Of Morocco’s recent participation in the World Cup, Hadji said he keeps fond and positive memories, especially of the team’s “beautiful performances” and their “fighting spirit in defending our national colors.” He said that the Lions’ World Cup performance was “extraordinary and encouraging.” He added, however, that the first game against Iran was “frustrating.” Although Morocco lost 1-0 to the Iranian squad with an own goal, according to Hadji, Morocco was vastly superior to Iran in footballing terms. “We could beat Iran 10 times out 9 were we to replay the game,” the Moroccan emphatically said. The former Atlas Lion also said that the team’s last two matches against Portugal and Spain were even more “frustrating and dramatic,” because Morocco tactically dominated both games and could have written a different story had it not been for refereeing errors.  “If there had been no VAR [ideo assistant referee], we would have passed the group stage.”

Rabat- The UK’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, has saluted Morocco’s efforts to find a fair solution to the Western Sahara issue. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita met Johnson in the first strategic dialogue between Morocco and the UK on Thursday in London. Johnson deemed Morocco’s approach to the Western Sahara conflict “serious and credible,” joining the list of several countries that expressed the same view, such as Mali, Chile, France, Azerbaijan, and the US, in addition to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Morocco has proposed an autonomy plan which seeks to find a fair solution to the issue of Western Sahara. According to Bourita, the Sahara region is part of the kingdom’s ongoing efforts to build a democratic and modern society based on the rule of law; individual, collective, and economic freedoms; and social development. During the meeting, the two foreign ministers discussed terrorism, trade and investment potential, culture, and sports. The meeting was attended by senior officials of both countries. The first Morocco-UK strategic dialogue aimed to strengthen the bilateral relations between the two kingdoms on a cultural, educational, economic, and political level.

Rabat – Morocco and the UK signed an agreement outlining the conditions for the establishing of British schools in the North African country. The decision was announced on the sidelines of the first session of the Morocco-United Kingdom Strategic Dialogue, which kicked off in London on July 5. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita signed the agreement with his British counterpart, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Both parties underscored that the agreement is a recognition of the excellent longstanding relation between Rabat and London. The agreement also highlights the importance of national education and the willingness of both parties to foster cross-cultural understanding through the promotion of culture and languages, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The agreement further seeks to consolidate the links between the educational institutions of Morocco and the UK, in accordance with the agreement signed between the two countries on October 27, 1980. The agreement noted that the “British School” in Morocco is an educational institution (primary and secondary) that follows the British curriculum. All religiously-affiliated schools are excluded from the convention. Morocco welcomes the opening of British schools or their subsidiaries only after the exchange and diplomatic memorandum between Morocco’s ministry and the embassy of the UK in Morocco.  The schools need to also meet the standards of safety and health stipulated in Moroccan legislation. The signed convention emphasized that the operators of the British schools “must” collaborate with the Moroccan education authorities, adding that the school certificates issued by the British schools and recognized by the British National Center must be recognized by Morocco in accordance with the regulations in place.

By Anna Schaeffer Rabat – The Union of Tunisian Imams have implored their Grand Mufti to issue a fatwa, or religious edict, to discourage Muslims from participating in the Hajj this year in response to violence perpetrated by Saudi Arabia in Yemen.  The ever-rising cost of the pilgrimage to Islam’s holiest site contributes to the massive riches of the Saudi government, whose usage of that money to fund wars, even massacres, in other Muslim nations goes directly against what numerous outspoken Muslim leaders consider ethical.  General-Secretary of the Union of Tunisian Imams Fadhel Ashour said it would be better “to spend this money to improve the conditions of the Tunisian people.” Instead, he said, “It is used to kill and displace people, as is the case currently in Yemen.” The three-year Saudi military campaign “to restore legitimacy in Yemen” has killed more than 14,000 men, women, and children. Millions on the verge of starvation and thousands dead from record-high cholera outbreaks pushed the UN to call the “Yemeni genocide” the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Rather than use Hajj profits to benefit poorer surrounding nations, Saudi Arabia continues to fund the war in Yemen as well as the deadly crisis in Syria.  How much profit does Hajj yield? The Qur’an states that practicing Muslims who are able should observe Hajj pilgrimage, the fifth pillar of Islam, at least once during their life; because of the steep costs resulting from both travel and imposed taxes, the trip requires extensive saving for a great number of the millions of believers who travel to the holy site. Al Arabiya reported in 2014 that the average cost for a worshiper from an outside country is approximately USD 5,000. The cost for Tunisians, whose imams have called for abstaining from the 2018 Hajj, is over USD 4,500. According to figures by Al Jazeera, it costs the average person from Malaysia half a year’s salary to complete the Hajj. For someone from Bangladesh, the Hajj costs more than three years’ earnings. Regardless of what nation a pilgrim hails from, their minimum Hajj cost begins at USD 2,000; often, the pricetag soars higher than USD 14,000 for one person. Recently increased taxes add to the head-reeling sum of money—estimated to exceed USD 150 billion per year by 2022—swallowed directly from Hajj profits by Saudi Arabia. Should believers boycott the pilgrimage? Because a considerable share of the fortune contributes to Saudi conflict or weapon acquisition, Muslims worldwide question whether boycotting the Hajj is the best course of action.  A developing perception in Muslim nations considers Saudi Arabia’s actions as exploitative, utilizing the holy site to punish its opponents or advance its political ends.  One Twitter user encouraged other Muslim countries to follow in the footsteps of the Tunisian imams. He cited “increase of Hajj costs, paying Hajj revenues to the US, using revenues to kill Muslims as in Yemen, [and] Al Saud [House of Saud] role in helping the Israeli occupation” as reasons to take “a strict position and boycott Hajj for this year.”  Journalist Kamel Abderrahmani said the pilgrimage has evolved into “one of Saudi Arabia’s commercial pillars.”  “In other words, the Saudi God is a business and worship at the same time,” he wrote. Abderrahmani urged all Muslim nations to boycott the Hajj and use the money instead to “build hospitals, schools and universities to protect our children from ignorance and an archaic conception of life and religion.” In contrast to the cries for an anti-Hajj edict in Tunisia, the Tunisian political party Ennahda Movement warned of the potential for a strained Tunisia-Saudi Arabia relationship.  “These are isolated and ideological calls that only serve personal purposes,” said an Ennahda statement.  Tunisian Minister of Religious Affairs Ahmed Adhoum announced 236,000 Hajj applications for 2018 alone. The number of pilgrims whose applications will be accepted by lottery has risen from 10,374 in 2017 to a current count of 10,892. If the Grand Mufti of the Republic in Tunisia issues a fatwa against the pilgrimage, profits made by Saudi Arabia could decrease by more than USD 50 million.

Rabat – Four Hirak Rif activists, who were sentenced to 20 years in prison on June 26, have decided to appeal the court’s decision. A member of the defense team, Asmae Elouadie, said that most of the 54 sentenced activists were convinced to appeal against the heavy sentences given to them for their involvement in the Hirak Rif movement in 2016 and 2017. Today, 10 days after the sentences were handed down, is the last day the sentences can be appealed. “After several rounds of negotiations, the detainees finally agreed to appeal their sentences,” she said. Nasser Zefzafi’s father, Ahmed Zefzafi, also confirmed the news. “It is a decision taken by all the detainees and they announced it to the families during the weekly visit of the families to the prison of Oukacha,” in Casablanca. However, Rabie El Ablaq, who received a sentence of 5 years and a fine of MAD 2,000, decided not to appeal the court’s decision. El Ablaq has also been on a hunger strike for more than 35 days now. The activist was transferred to the Moulay Youssef hospital in Casablanca on Monday due to his hunger strike. “Rabie is very hard to convince. He is obstinate and does not want to hear anything. He refuses to stop his hunger strike and to appeal,” said El Ablaq’s lawyer. The lawyer added: “If things remain like this, I will appeal on his behalf.” A few days after the court’s decision to sentence the Hirak Rif activists to 1 to 20 years in prison, those who received 20 years in prison announced they would not appeal the sentences, including Zefzafi. Journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui, who received 3 years in prison, was among the detainees who originally refused to appeal the court’s decision. Nevertheless, his wife confirmed to Al Bayan that he changed his mind and decided to appeal. The government received nationwide backlash, with journalists, citizens, politicians, and celebrities condemning the sentences.  The cabinet, however, said that the judiciary is fully independent and that it cannot interfere in such cases. Head of Government and leader of the ruling Justice and Development party (PJD) Saad Eddine El Othmani expressed regrets that his government could not intervene.

Rabat – Alpha Condé, Guinea’s president and former chairman of the African Union, has said in a recent interview that the role of the African Union in the Western Sahara question will be to accompany and support the UN peacekeeping efforts. In a wide-ranging interview with RFI, President Alpha Condé, true to the pan-Africanist outlook and rhetoric that has earned him both praise and criticism in African circles, was adamant that it is time for the continent to rise to its numerous challenges and compel the world “to take us seriously.” During the 31st AU summit for heads of state in Nouakchott, Mauritania, on Sunday, July 1, the AU recognized the UN’s centrality in the Western Sahara dispute between Morocco and the Polisario Front and appointed a troika to translate the ideas in the annual report into reality. The AU’s troika will be composed of the AU president, his predecessor and successor; the AU Commission’s chairperson is set to support the three leaders in their mission at the UN. When asked about the AU’s motivations in appointing a troika to accompany and ensure UN Security Council’s guidelines in the Western Sahara conflict, Condé, not usually forthcoming about strategic questions, was unusually candid. Condé told RFI the UN Security Council is the only body with the legitimacy to intervene in Western Sahara, oversee the development of the process, and find a way to commit the parties to the outcomes of negotiations. He said that the AU will solely follow, accompany, and ensure the implementation of the UN-led process. “It is the African Union that transferred the Western Sahara dossier to the UN in the first place,” Condé said, adding that the newly-appointed troika’s role is to “follow the UN process and inform the AU thereon.” Condé’s comments come in the aftermath of a continental milestone in the Sahara question, as the latest AU annual report announced that the continental body would henceforward refrain from pushing towards a “parallel agenda.” The body promised to fully support the UN-led negotiations to attain a “sustainable, peaceful, and mutually acceptable political solution.” Condé insisted that the troika’s role will only be an advisory and supportive one with regards to the UN agenda.

Rabat – Two years after the use of plastic bags was banned from medium and large distribution companies and convenience stores, plastic bags are still commonly used in Morocco. According to Minister of Industry Hafid El Alamy, plastic bags have not been completely eradicated because new sources of plastic bags have emerged, such as illegal manufacturing workshops, smuggling, and illegal distribution. “We notice a kind of awareness, but also a change in the understanding of the problem of plastic bags, but there is still a long way to go.”  The Minister also spoke of the importance of awareness-raising among citizens towards the dangers of plastic bags. On the other hand, he said the ban’s impact has been “extremely satisfactory and encouraging.” Medium and large distribution companies are exclusively using substitute products he mentioned, in a meeting with industry stakeholders and civil society representatives on Tuesday, July 3. According to a review of control and support operations published by online outlet Media24 after the meeting, the Ministry of Industry recorded 3,826 offenses among 682,467 inspections it carried out. Approximately MAD 5 billion in fines was imposed on 757 judgments. More than 750 tons of plastic bags were seized in workshops and outlets. More than 89 tons were collected at border inspection posts. The Ministry has made two separate funds available to industrialists to dispose of plastic bags: a conversion fund of MAD 200 billion for companies impacted by the ban and a business competitiveness support fund called “Imtiaz” (“excellence”) for investment projects in alternative industries. The conversion fund included 25 beneficiary companies, 18 of which changed their business to manufacture substitutes to plastic bags. Others continued to make bags, but began to make them biodegradable to comply with the law. As for the “Imtiaz” fund, 19 investment projects received money from the program, at a total of MAD 52 billion. There have been 250 suppliers of substitute products in Morocco since the ban took effect. This was considered a positive result compared to the ministry’s expectations. As one roams the streets of Morocco and its shops and traditional souks, one notices that plastic bags are still used by grocery stores and street vendors in Morocco. Shops dedicated to selling plastic bags are still open as well. In addition, many Moroccan customers are still using plastic bags. They are easy to use and merchants offer them for free, unlike alternatives which are considered expensive in reference to the purchasing power of Moroccan citizens.

Rabat – US President Donald Trump tweeted this week on Wednesday that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is “driving [fuel] prices high” and asked them to “REDUCE PRICING NOW.” The US President used his usual American foreign policy card, threatening to withdraw American support from “those countries” that are “manipulating” oil prices.  The OPEC Monopoly must remember that gas prices are up &amp; they are doing little to help. If anything, they are driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members for very little $’s. This must be a two way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 4 juillet 2018  He said that the US is protecting many OPEC countries for “very little.” Suggesting that OPEC countries should produce more crude oil to increase supply and lower prices if they want to keep America’s strategic partnership, he said: “This must be a two-way street.” Oil prices have risen in the past 12 months to a peak in late June and early July. OPEC members agreed June 23 to increase crude oil output by pumping 1 million barrels more daily, but it is still unclear how much of the oil produced would ease off prices in a period—the northern hemisphere’s summer—generally associated with high oil demand. Saudi Arabia obliges Following Trump’s OPEC complaint, Saudi Arabia, the biggest crude oil exporter, assured Trump they could increase oil production and ensure price stability in the global market, according to Reuters. Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s state-run crude oil company, has reportedly announced sizable cuts for its August prices, reflecting the Gulf kingdom’s promise to its American ally to help stabilize the global oil market. But while some have interpreted the Saudi move as a traditional Saudi card to always scramble to soothe American frustration and oblige to US demands, other reports have suggested that Riyadh’s move is the result of deep political calculations: step in to stabilize oil prices and compel the US to adopt tougher measures on Iran. Saudi cooperation not enough, Iran toughens stance But in the current market where several OPEC countries have reduced production capabilities due to internal political turmoil—Libya and Venezuela are cases in point—it is uncertain whether Saudi Arabia can sustainably fill Iran’s position. Although Saudi Arabia is traditionally known for indirectly dictating most OPEC decisions, it is doubtful whether the Gulf state will have similar clout in current circumstances.  Because many OPEC countries are facing domestic troubles, the general expectation is that Iran, which is the fifth largest crude oil exporter, has a larger and increasingly discernible impact on how fuel prices behave in coming months. Trump’s policy of economic sanctions on Iran has been accused by some bankers and energy experts as the primary factor in the market’s current level of high and unstable prices, CNBC recently reported. Hossein Kazempour, Iran’s OPEC Governor, thinks prices are rising because of Trump’s tweets. Speaking yesterday in reaction to President Trump’s series of tweets about OPEC’s fuel prices, the Iranian official accused the U.S president of driving oil prices up with his tweets. “Please stop it,” Kazempour said. “You impose sanctions on major producers, founders of OPEC, and yet you are asking them to reduce the prices?! Since when did you start ordering OPEC! Your tweets have driven the prices up by at least $10 per barrel. Please stop it; otherwise it will go even higher.” Later speaking to Reuters, the Iranian declared that oil prices will rise to USD 100, and it will all be Trump’s “fault.” “The responsibility of paying unnecessary prices for oil by all consumers of the whole world, especially in U.S. gas stations, is solely upon [Trump’s] shoulders and the price of over $100 per barrel is yet to come.”

Rabat – Several dozen public personalities have signed a statement calling for the boycott against Centrale Danone to be suspended, arguing that the company should now be given time to prove its loyalty to its recent declarations on its pricing policy. “The boycott campaign in which we participated was never meant to destroy any investor’s efforts in our country. The goal was to compel capital owners, shareholders, and investors to respect market rules and regulations regarding price and competition,” the statement said. Centrale Danone has heard the message The group noted that Centrale Danone’s executive board has accepted citizens’ demands for a “fair and affordable price,” and said their call to suspend the boycott is solely meant to grant Centrale Danone and consumers sufficient time to “experiment” the new pricing model the dairy company has promised to implement. “Our call is a reaction to Centrale Danone’s recent proposals. We want boycott campaigns to remain citizens’ means to make similar demands in the future. For this reason, we are asking Moroccans to suspend the boycott for ten weeks, from July 7 to September 14.” In the aftermath of a nation-wide boycott that started April 20, Centrale Danone, whose high prices angered consumers, experienced a considerable drop in its market share of dairy products. The dairy firm announced on June 4 that the boycott had had a “very significant impact” on its business, causing a net loss of MAD 150 million in its revenue during the first half of 2018. Amid the company’s concerns about its decreasing market share and its worsening reputation, the French company’s CEO, Emmanuel Faber, travelled to Morocco to “personally address” the consequences of the boycott on the company’s financial returns and market reputation. Faber said that he had come to listen to Moroccans and try to change the situation. He called the boycott a “strong message” and promised that his company would spare no efforts to reconcile with consumers. Protecting the market The call for the suspension, whose signatories include academics, consumers and workers’ advocacy groups, journalists, and political party representatives, noted that the 10 weeks would be an opportunity to see whether Centrale Danone has taken consumers’ demands seriously. The statement also called on the government to introduce institutional measures to guarantee a free market, free of monopolies and dubious pricing. “Consumers’ needs and demands should be an integral part of the pricing process,” they declared. The group also noted that both the government and citizens have a “solemn” obligation to protect market standards by ensuring affordable prices and perfect competition in commodity markets.

Rabat – Things are moving fast between Moroccan football player Achraf Hakimi and his new club Borussia Dortmund.  According to the well-informed Spanish outlet Marca, Hakimi’s club Real Madrid and the German club have almost closed the deal for the loan of the 19-year-old player. The agreement is practically closed and only  the terms of the salary the Moroccan requires must be decided. Last week, rumors of Hakimi’s transfer circulated when the German outlet Kicker announced that Real Madrid was set to sign a deal to loan Hakimi to Germany’s Dortmund as the football club wanted a “backup” for their Lukasz Piszczek. According to Tribuna, the Spanish giant aims for Hakimi to “gain the similar experience as Dani Carvajal,” who played for Bayer Leverkusen for the 2012/2013 season. The young football player Hakimi made his official debut at the Santiago Bernabeu in October 2017. He has since become one of Morocco’s most important players, as he has proved his worth alongside the Atlas Lions during the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

Rabat- The Moroccan kickboxing star Badr Hari has said he will continue to live in Morocco until his two daughters become adults. In an interview with the Dutch magazine Linda, Badr Hari, now living in Rabat, said that he would like to stay in Morocco until his daughters reach the age of eighteen. “At first, I did not intend to stay in Morocco for so long. But as my children get older, I increasingly think that I will stay here until they are 18 years old, so they can finish their school well.” Hari talked about his oldest daughter Amber, now five years old, who is enrolled in an American school in Morocco. “She thinks and talks in English, but also speaks Dutch and Moroccan Arabic,” the kickboxer said. Hari praised the language skills of his wife Daphne, who speaks Arabic. “She is much smarter in terms of languages than me.” Hari regretted that he had to leave his small family and return to the Netherlands in April 2017 to serve the rest of his sentence, having already spent 8 months in custody for multiple violent crimes. “I must honestly say it was too hard. I returned to the Netherlands and left a five-year-old girl, a girl who talks to me every day. I was really her boyfriend and suddenly, I disappeared.” To handle this, Hari told his eldest daughter that he had gone to train for several months. “You cannot explain to a five-year-old child what a prison is, but that had resulted in awkward situations. Normally I talk to her every day when I’m away from her and we can see each other too.” Hari’s daughter started begging him to come and see her, but that was not possible for him. “‘Dad, I want to see you.’ But how was I supposed to do that?”  When Hari returned home, his little family was so happy. Recalling that moment, the kickboxer described the scene as magic. “I saw my children when they woke up the next day. My daughter Amber looked at me for five minutes and then whispered: ‘Dad, you’re back.’ I also saw my little daughter Houda. It was magic.” Badr Hari is a famous Moroccan-Dutch kickboxing heavyweight fighter at the international level. He won the 2014 GFC Fight Series 1 Heavyweight Tournament in Dubai and was a runner up in the 2009 K-1 World Grand Prix Final in Japan.  In his most recent fight on March 4, he beat his opponent Hesdy Gerges in Rotterdam, Netherlands. In his 120 fights, Hari has had 107 wins, 13 losses, and 2 disqualified. The Moroccan kickboxer is also known for his social charity for Moroccan causes, especially for the inhabitants of his native city Kenitra.

Rabat – During a parliamentary session on July 2, MP Noureddine Mediane said that the Rif activists are victims rather than instigators, suggesting they are prey to the government’s “repeated failures” to effectively deal with the country’s socio-economic problems. Mediane, a member of the Istiqlal (Independence) party’s executive board, said that the government and its representatives in some areas should have been more compassionate in treatment and sentencing during the Rif movements, as the government’s policies helped crystallize the tension and social movements that erupted in the Rif.  He accused the government of promoting inadequate policies, calling it the “creator” and the primary cause of the Rif movements. “Although Morocco has experienced advances in human rights and democracy, we should recognize some levels of regression and abuses in the system,” Mediane said.  Elaborating that Morocco has made significant steps towards judiciary independence and human rights since the 2011 Constitution, he nonetheless suggested that some regions have been kept on the margins and are therefore unable to benefit from the country’s recent reforms.  But even in regions that have seen some levels of improvement in terms of accountability and governmental responsiveness, there are still “lapses” and “regression” in the implementation of policies and laws, Mediane remarked.  Citizens and advocacy groups are “deeply concerned about human rights abuses” in Morocco, the conservative MP said, adding that “the government is entirely responsible since it has consistently failed its mission to guarantee [citizens’] constitutional rights, including the right to a decent livelihood.” Citing Rif, Jerada, and Zagora, Mediane said that the government and local authorities have failed some regions by not providing them with basic social needs in terms of infrastructure and job opportunities. The harsh sentences handed to the Rif activists have sparked public anger and frustration on social media, the MP noted. However, the government’s response came in waves of “enormous indifference and incendiary statements.” “Had the government intervened at the propitious moment and with the effectiveness expected of them, we would not have reached this point,” he said, concluding that “the government should recognize that the people in the Rif did not cause the crisis; instead, they are victims of failed policies and ineffective development models.”

Rabat- Police in Marrakech and the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST) arrested two Algerian individuals who burgled a Saudi national’s hotel room in Marrakech. According to the General Directorate for National Security (DGSN), the judicial police carried out an investigation Wednesday morning into items stolen from the hotel room of a Saudi national. The suspects, aged 45 and 46, targeted the room’s iron safe, which contained foreign currency, three bank cards, three Swiss watches, and travel and identity documents. The suspects also stole from the Saudi national’s wardrobe. When they were arrested in Casablanca, they were found to have all the stolen items on them.  DGSN reported that one of the suspects, an undocumented resident in Morocco, had premeditated the theft. DGSN added that the two suspects entered the kingdom two days apart. The two are currently in custody, pending the investigation of the public prosecution into whether they were involved with a criminal ring outside Morocco.

Rabat- The technical director of the Moroccan football team, Jamal Fathi, considers the controversy over Moroccan-Belgian footballer Marouane Fellaini to be overstated, explaining that it was Fellaini who refused to join the Moroccan team. After his brilliant performance with the Belgium team in the 2018 World Cup in Russia, especially in his most recent match against Japan, the Moroccan-Belgian player Marouane Fellaini has caught the attention of Moroccan sport followers lately. As a result, many Moroccan fans have blamed Fathi, a former Moroccan Olympic team coach, for not recruiting Fellaini into the national team. In response to speculations about Fellaini on social media, Fathi reported to the daily Moroccan newspaper “Al Akhbar” that everyone can join the Moroccan team without exception. He said he had already given a chance to Fellaini to join Morocco in 2005, but Fellaini could not prove himself good enough for the national team at that time. Fathi recalled that he was behind the appearance of some talented players like Benatia, El Ahmadi, and Dirar, in addition to many local players. “Some people have a short memory. We had already sent an invitation to Fellaini to join the national Olympic team. However, he declined the invitation. He was even playing for the Belgian team that we faced in Belgium and we beat 3-1.” “Mohamed Fakhir had also sent Fellaini a second invitation to play with the national team of Morocco, but his invitation was expressively refused, favoring the Belgians’ team,” he added. Fathi does not understand the reactions and criticisms brought over the emergence of Belgium’s defender in the 2018 World Cup. “We must end this story that has lasted 13 years.” Fathi denied claims that he had said “Fellaini’s physique and height were not those of a footballer.”  He stressed that this talk cannot be made by a national sports coach who operates within a training and coaching framework. “My position within the training system, whether at the local, African or international level, requires me to set an example for other national coaches,” he concluded.

Rabat – “Nothing can replace my son,” said his mourning mother. The victim’s family has broken silence, days after their son’s death. A 28-year-old pedestrian was killed by Moroccan footballer Amine Harit, who was driving with his 14-year-old brother in Marrakech in a car race on Saturday, June 30, shortly after midnight. Speaking to Arabic outlet Hespress, the victim’s mother—who is still in shock from losing her child—complained about the way that the Moroccan authorities handled the accident. “I just want to understand why they didn’t call me when my son died. He had the accident around 11 p.m. and I received the call at 7 a.m.,” she said. Addressing rumors of an amicable agreement involving money between the family of the culprit and the victim, she clarified her situation. “Amine Harit’s father and his uncle came to offer their condolences. When they left, the press said they came to give us money,” she said, insisting that there was no money involved. “I don’t want money; nothing will ever replace my son,” she added. As for the victim’s father, all he wants is that “the justice do its job.” “I was really upset to learn that people think that we asked for money. I cried because of that,” he said. On Tuesday, the prosecutor at the Court of First Instance in Marrakech decided to grant Amine Harit a temporary release, returning his passport and allowing him to leave Morocco. Schalke 04 Sports Director Christian Heidel announced the news that Amine Harit received his passport and driver’s license back. The Schalke 04 attacking midfielder was supposed to be presented to a prosecutor in Marrakech on Monday “in a state of freedom and with his passport withdrawn.” The hearing was postponed to July 11 to “allow for negotiations with the victim’s parents with a view to amicable settlement,” explained a close source to the case to AFP.

Rabat – Will Achraf Hakimi Succeed to Kylian Mbappe (2017), Renato Sanches (2016), Paul Pogba (2013) and Lionel Messi (2005)? The Atlas Lion has been nominated for the prestigious distinction of Golden Boy 2018 by Italian outlet Tuttosport, which has unveiled its list of 100 football players competing for the trophy. Nine African players, including Hakimi, are on the list. The winner will be announced on October.

Hakimi can be proud of himself for earning his place among football’s biggest names. The Moroccan sensation delivered a spectacular performance in the 2018 World Cup against the deadly group of the World Cup: Group B. Besides being a true fighter with the national team, the 19-year-old sensation had a great season with his club Real Madrid. He has become the first Moroccan footballer to win the Champions League. In February, CIES Football Observatory ranked the international footballer among Europe’s “50 most promising under-20 footballers.” Hakimi has a new challenge waiting on him this year. The central defender is expected to join Borussia Dortmund on loan from Real Madrid next season. The German outlet Kicker announced that Real Madrid is set to sign a deal with Germany’s Dortmund for Hakimi as the football club is planning to look for a “backup” for their Lukasz Piszczek.

Rabat- Following Belgium’s victory over Japan, joyful Belgian striker Michy Batshuayi said in a video online that his team qualified thanks to two “Khorotos” in the team, referring to Moroccans in Belgian slang. In the dying minutes of the match between Japan and Belgium on Monday, Moroccan-Belgian midfielder Marouane Fellaini scored Belgium’s second goal past Japan’s goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima, tying the score 2-2.  In the last seconds of the game, Moroccan-Belgian winger Nacer Chadli scored Belgium’s third goal, winning the game for his team and qualifying Belgium for the World Cup’s quarterfinals. “Today, Belgium was qualified thanks to two Khorotos [Moroccans]…thank you for today guys, for this victory!” Batshuayi beamed in the video, adding the caption “Who said Morocco was eliminated hahaha.” To qualify for the semifinals, Belgium will have to beat Brazil in the quarterfinals, Friday, July 6, at the Kazan Arena. The winner of that game will take on either France or Uruguay in the semifinals. Portugal’s 1-0 win against Morocco, albeit a performance deemed excellent by many, eliminated the team from the World Cup since it had already failed to score in its opening match against Iran. However, playing to save their pride, the Atlas Lions scored 2-2 against Spain in their final game after they gave a hard time to the European giant.

Rabat – The Council of the Fez-Meknes region has agreed to pay Air Arabia to open two new routes to Tangier and Agadir. The council met Monday, in the regular July session, to discuss the two partnership projects. The council have studied and adopted a series of projects to improve the Fez-Saiss airport’s links to other regions and improve the living conditions of the rural population through better infrastructure and social services. During this meeting, the council studied a draft convention and partnership with Air Arabia, as well as another similar agreement that will be concluded shortly with the council of the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region to open a Fez-Tangier route. The agreements will cost MAD 5.8 million for the Fez-Agadir line and MAD 4.92 million for the Fez-Tangier line. The Agadir council will contribute MAD 2.9 million and the Tangier council MAD 2.46 million. As part of this partnership, the airline will guarantee frequent flights even in the event of an insufficient number of passengers. The company must also provide services to people with special needs, in addition to public transport lines between the airport and the city of Fez.

Rabat – The journalist Taoufik Bouachrine, held facing charges for alleged sexual misconduct, was allowed to visit a doctor for McKenzie therapy on Monday. Bouachrine was transferred to Casablanca’s Bouafi Hospital to receive treatment for a shoulder ache. Bouachrine’s hospitalization resulted in the change of his trial date, which was originally scheduled for Monday, July 2. The journalist will appear before the court on July 9 instead. The news was confirmed by Abdessamad El Idrissi, a member of Bouachrine’s defense team. Bouachrine was arrested in February after several women lodged complaints against him for sexual assault, rape, and violence. Authorities allege that they have more than 50 tapes supporting the charges filed against him. The videos will be admissible evidence in his trial. In the five months since his arrest, Bouachrine has been denying the charges against him. According to his lawyers, the charges are a “conspiracy.”

Rabat- The Moroccan boycott against high prices of gasoline, soda-mineral water, and milk might have inspired Saudi Arabia’s new boycott. The country is boycotting Almarai, the same dairy company expected to replace Centrale Danone in Morocco. Saudi Arabia’s Almarai, the largest dairy company in the Middle East has become a boycott target for Saudi consumers as the company raised its milk prices by 7 cents. Saudi citizens launched an online campaign with hashtags reading, “let_it_go_sour” and “change_it_with_another” (in Arabic), similar to how Morocco’s boycott emerged, when Moroccan boycotters wrote “let_it_spoil” and “let_it_rot” referring to Centrale Danone’s milk boycott. Unlike Centrale Danone, Almarai was more quick to publicly react to the consumers’ boycott launch, saying in a press release that it raised milk prices because of its own increased production costs. Saudi boycotters wrote comments on Twitter like: “ Honestly, Almarai thinks that it’s the only brand in the market.” ??????? #??????? ???? ????? ?????? ?? ????? #???_?????_??????? ???? ??? ???? #????_???? — Suliman Kordi (@sulimankordi) July 4, 2018  “ Thank god, I have been boycotting Almarai for a year and four months now.” ??? ????? ?? ???? ?? ??? 4???? ???? ????? #???????
????? ? #???? ?? #??? — ?????? (@umar0555) July 4, 2018  Recently, Almarai has shown interest in investing in Morocco following the launch of the ongoing boycott on April 20 targeting the leading dairy brand in the country. For years, many Moroccans expressed their wish to have Almarai dairy product brands in Morocco due to their “high quality.”
 
According to Moroccan news site Hespress, the Saudi company has bought land belonging to the headquarters of Centrale Danone in the kingdom and is expected to open its first subsidiary by the end of 2018 or early in 2019. Founded in 1977 in Saudi Arabia, Almarai is a partnership between the Irish agri-foods pioneer, Alastair McGuckian, and Saudi prince Sultan bin Mohammed bin Saud Al Kabeer. Almarai is now the world’s largest vertically integrated dairy company.

Rabat – After Mohamed Abdennabaoui, President of the Prosecutor General’s Office, criticized complaints about the sentences for Hirak Rif activists, he asserted that the 20-year sentences were the minimum a judge could have given the four leaders. Abdennabaoui was invited on Tuesday by Morocco’s state television channel Al Aoula in its program “Daif Al Aoula” to comment on the sentences given to the Hirak Rif activists. While the sentences against Hirak activists were deemed “heavy” by many Moroccans, journalists, celebrities, and human rights activists, Abdennabaoui said that the judge’s 20-year sentences were already lowered due to mitigating circumstances. “When the judge pronounced 20 years of imprisonment, he made extenuating circumstances.” The four activists were charged with undermine the security of the state; offenses against the internal or external security of the state in Morocco are punishable by death. The official further insisted on the need to believe in the independence of the judiciary, especially since the verdicts can be appealed. Abdennabaoui explained that the punishments for some of the charges brought against the activists were the death penalty and 30 years of imprisonment. The activists were not given the death penalty because of mitigating conditions, and instead given the minimum penalty of 20 years for the charges. “The law, in Article 147 of the Criminal Procedure Code, is clear. The judge, when it comes to facts involving capital punishment or life imprisonment, can only, at best… reduce [the sentences] to between 20 and 30 years in prison.” Since the Hirak Rif activists were arrested amid their protesting for social and economic reforms in the Rif region, their court trial, Abdennabaoui said, was decided upon accusations of their acts during the protests.  “The people involved have been prosecuted and condemned, not for their social or economic demands, but for serious facts. The case included such things as burning a police building, throwing stones, damaging the property of others, and conspiring against state security.” Another issue related to this trial was also raised during the television program concerning the journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui’s trial, in which he was sentenced to three years and an MAD 3,000 fine. Abdennabaoui said that the three-year prison sentence was handed down on the basis of the Penal Code, not of the press code. “The press code applies to facts relating to the exercise of this profession. If a journalist commits murder or robbery, he becomes an offender under the penal code.” He added that El Mahdaoui was prosecuted for failure to report crimes against the state, which is not included in the press code. “Now, we have to wait, the concerned [journalist] having appealed and having a solid defense,” he concluded. El Maehdaoui was arrested on July 20, 2017, for giving a speech at Place Mohammed VI in Al Hoceima, encouraging people to join a banned protest.  On Tuesday, June 26, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals sentenced Hirak Rif activists to 1 to 20 years in prison. The activists were arrested for their involvement in protests that rocked Al Hoceima in 2016 and 2017.

Rabat – In a hot political climate characterized by popular uproar over the harsh sentences handed to Hirak activists, veteran Moroccan statesman Abderrahmane El Youssoufi has suggested that Morocco’s future hinges on a “sincere and responsible dialogue” about the country’s most pressing issues. A veteran figure of Morocco’s recent political history, the Tangier-born statesman made his comments during a ceremony in his hometown as he presented his three-volume memoir published earlier this year. Although Youssoufi truly gained center stage in Morocco after he led the government—as prime minister—from 1998 to 2002 , the 94-year-old politician and former leader of the Socialist Union of Popular Forces (UFSP) is also known for his left-leaning militancy  and resistance efforts during the late years of French colonialism and the early decades of Moroccan independence. Providing insights gained from his personal experience in nation-building and community organization, Youssoufi said that the future of Morocco depends on the ability to uphold a sense of nationhood and collective responsibility. “The future of this country can only be built through sincere, frank, and responsible dialogue, and not through the hegemony of certain ideas or norms over others,” he said, hinting at inclusive policies and the “sacredness of citizenship” as the means to address Morocco’s persisting political and socio-economic issues. He said that the Tangier of the 1930s and 1960s had “a rich political and humane culture.” He added nostalgically, “It was here, in the streets of this Tangier that my whole destiny was shaped. It was here that I learned to defend and cherish justice and human rights in the existential and humanitarian sense of the terms.” Youssoufi also recalled that the Tangier of his childhood and early youth was “a true melting pot, a site of perfect co-existence between men and women from different cultures, regions, and continents.” He then explained that these values of coexistence and inclusiveness should be upheld, nourished, and protected to ensure “a future Morocco” built on justice, inclusive citizenship, and the respect of human rights.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita is continuing his round of calls for Algeria to admit responsibility for the four-decades-long conflict over Western Sahara. In a recent interview with France 24, Bourita said that the solution to the conflict requires Algeria’s contribution to end the dispute. “If we want to find a solution to this problem, it is necessary that this part [Algeria] is involved as much as it has contributed to creating this problem,” said the Moroccan minister. He added that Morocco has long acknowledged that other parties have an “important role” in the conflict. “And for us, the main party on this issue is Algeria,” he said.  Morocco was not the only party to urge Algeria to bear its responsibility in the conflict. On April 28, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 2414, which officially called on the eastern neighbor to “get more involved” in finding a solution to the dispute. He added that a “new episode on the issue” can only start, when all “the parties to the conflict are around the table.” The Moroccan official also expressed condemnation, emphasizing that he “regrets” with “bitterness” how a problem that was created during the Cold War has continued “and that it slows bilateral relations with the Arab Maghreb.” According to Bourita, Morocco has always contributed to the construction of the Arab Maghreb, and “the challenges today are collective and we will win together or we will lose together,” referring to Morocco and Algeria. In recent months, Bourita has been renewing his calls to convince Algeria to recognize its responsibility in the conflict and to contribute to the UN-led political process. Algeria, however, expressed its reluctance several times, with both Foreign Affairs Minister Abdelkader Messahel and Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia denying Algeria’s responsibility in the conflict. Nevertheless, Algerian media acknowledged that the April 11 crash of an Algerian military plane put the eastern neighbor in an embarrassing situation since there were members of the Polisario onboard. For decades, Algeria has been supporting the Polisario Front with military equipment, which has been used recently to undermine the UN ceasefire agreement east of Morocco’s defense wall.

Rabat – Rumors have been circulating on social media that the Real Madrid star, Cristiano Ronaldo, will transfer to the Italian club FC Juventus. Real Madrid’s board members are believed to have accepted a reasonable deal estimated at EUR 100 million, despite Ronaldo’s EUR 1 billion release clause. The contract expires June 2021, four months after Ronaldo’s 36th birthday. According to Spanish football newspaper Marca, Ronaldo has a guarantee signed by Real Madrid, allowing him to break his release clause in case of a “reasonable” offer. FC Juventus has a better opportunity than ever to recruit Ronaldo, as it is the only club bidding on the footballer currently. The bid is proposed at a perfect moment, profiting from the disagreement between Ronaldo and Real Madrid President Florentino Perez and also Ronaldo’s desire to leave Real Madrid. According to Tuttosport, Ronaldo and Juventus have already reached an agreement for a contract until 2022 and a salary of EUR 30 million per year. Doing the math, the player would cost Juventus EUR 220 million over four years. But having Ronaldo in their side will certainly leave a mark on the club and increase its chances of winning the Champions League, which it has only done twice. Real Madrid has won the title 12 times. If Ronaldo departs, Real Madrid will seek a new striker with exceptional talent and performance. The Brazilian star, Neymar Junior, may be the best candidate to fill the blank. Everyone within the team is wondering about Ronaldo’s departure. Fans on Madrid streets are also questioning Ronaldo about his fate with Real Madrid. If Ronaldo joins the Serie A champions, their forward line will be strengthened. They could take down the other Italian clubs and even become unbeatable in the Champions League tournament.  Ronaldo created a controversy in the world of football, after speaking to the press upon his third consecutive win of the Champions League when he announced his intention to leave Real Madrid.

Rabat – Will Hervé Renard really remain head coach of the Moroccan national football team? The question has been circling as the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) and the national team’s current head coach give different accounts of the latter’s prospects with the Atlas Lions. The rumors began with reports in late June that FRMF and Renard held discussions about the team’s future under Renard’s guidance.  It was said that the general mood of the FRMF, the players, and the Atlas Lions’ technical staff was to continue with Renard, whom many have hailed as the principal instigator of the squad’s improved performance and increasing team spirit. In support of earlier FRMF claims, later news reports indicated that Renard was grateful to the Moroccan public for their heartfelt support and love during his team’s performance at the World Cup.  It was later alleged that Renard told FRMF president Fouzi Lekjaa that he would like to continue with the national squad for the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) 2019, but required that three conditions be met to continue his mission with the national team. On July 2, however, Hervé Renard took to Facebook to dismiss all the allegations that have been circulating since the Atlas Lions’ “honorable” World Cup exit.  “Contrary to what can be said in some media, I didn’t have any meetings since the end of the World Cup. So, I didn’t have to express any particular requirements for the future,” Renard wrote on his Facebook page. A coveted coach Renard’s contract with the Atlas Lions will end in 2022, and the Frenchman is Africa’s highest-paid head coach with a monthly wage of MAD 800,000. According to FRMF sources, a breach of contract would come with a release clause of MAD 40 million. But Renard, a much-coveted coach, can only be barred from breaching his contract by his own desire to remain or stay with his current team, especially as many of the Frenchman’s reported suitors can pay FRMF’s reported release clause in the blink of an eye.  Qatar, for example, is alleged to have approached Renard, asking him to coach their national team for the 2022 World Cup, which Qatar is hosting. The Qatari federation has reportedly proposed Renard a desirable contract, including a formidable monthly wage of USD 2.5 million.  Renard, however, again denied that story, calling it “fake news.” Speaking to Le Maroc Diplomatic, the Frenchman said: “All of it is false. I have not received any proposal from Qatar.”  But while Renard is keen to disparage the rumors and “fake news” surrounding his future commitment with the Moroccan national squad, he has not been equally keen to say anything conclusive about whether he will stay.  The Frenchman’s ambivalent statements on his Facebook and Twitter accounts have left many people skeptical about his desire to retain the coaching position with the Atlas Lions, prompting many to ask what he really thinks. According to quoted FRMF sources, though, Renard will hold a “conclusive meeting” with FRMF president on July 9, and the expectation is that the big question—whether or not Renard will continue with Morocco—will be sorted out after that meeting.

By Chase Lacy Rabat- The South Sudanese plans to extend the presidential term of Salva Kiir have been rejected by the opposition.  MP Paul Yuana Banju said the presidency proposed a bill to Parliament to amend the constitution and extend the terms of Kiir and his officials until 2021.  Atem Garang, another MP, said that the bill is guaranteed to pass since the ruling party holds a majority of seats in Parliament. Lam Paul Gabriel, deputy spokesman for the opposition SPLA-IO, told reporters in Juba that Kiir’s intentions are “definitely illegal” and “anti-peace.” He also said that Kiir’s continuation in office undermines the peace process.  The government’s move comes amidst the ongoing peace talks between Kiir’s government and the SPLA-IO, led by Riek Machar.  Last Wednesday a “permanent” ceasefire agreed in Khartoum between the two sides of the civil war, to take effect in 72 hours, was almost immediately violated.  Lul Ruai Koang, spokesman for Kiir’s SPLA, said rebels had attacked Maban in Upper Nile state, near the border with Sudan. He claimed that 18 civilians were killed and 44 wounded. The fatalities included three Ethiopians and two Sudanese. Lam Paul Gabriel claimed their forces had taken a heavy bombardment in Maban and denied the SPLA-IO attacked civilians.  Edmund Yakani, director of the Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, said to AP, “It is contradictory to be working for a peace settlement of the political crisis while at the same time fostering the extension of the government’s mandate.” South Sudan’s peace talks in recent weeks in Ethiopia and Sudan are expected to continue in Kenya. However, the government’s move and the cease-fire violations further dampen hopes for peace in South Sudan. South Sudan’s civil war began in 2013 when President Salva Kiir accused then Vice President Riek Machar of plotting a coup d’etat. The conflict has since killed tens of thousands, created a humanitarian catastrophe, and destroyed the country’s economy.

Rabat – The House of Representatives has approved a draft bill for Morocco’s central bank that will increase the autonomy and authority of the financial institution.  The House reached a conclusion on the Bank Al Maghrib (BAM) bill Tuesday, July 3, in a plenary session. Broadening the scope of the bank in response to the institutional reform laid out in the 2011 Constitution, the bill aims to establish BAM as an independent entity and elevate legislation to international standards. Currently, the bank’s primary responsibilities encompass currency issuance, policy implementation, money market surveillance, and exchange reserve management. Realization of the approved bill additionally enables BAM to facilitate price stability and execute government-designed guidelines for the foreign exchange rate. Designed to empower BAM in inclusive risk prevention, the legislation determines the latitude of power available to the bank in relation to the exchange rate. Additionally, the proposal seeks to promote good governance. The draft bill includes 44 amendments that will affect 26 of the 80 original articles in the current legislation. Of the House, 136 deputies approved the bill while one rejected it and 18 abstained.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of General Affairs and Governance, Lahcen Daoudi, who has been in the news recently for his remarks on the boycott, participated in the government’s oral questions session on Tuesday. Daoudi has returned to the forefront of the political scene. He answered questions from MPs in a plenary session of the House of Councilors. The minister has taken up his old habit of quarrelling in Parliament. He quarreled with the councilors and entered into heated exchanges with the president of the Istiqlal party (Independence for Unity and Equality) in Parliament, Abdeslam Lebbar.  Lebbar asked about public affairs and the governance sector, particularly the “decline of Morocco’s middle class.” “The middle class is suffering, unemployment is increasing dramatically, and the government is helpless. The endurance ability for this class is being lost, which is dangerous.” Lebbar also raised the issue of high prices and protests which “have become a common action.” “Lack of social services, such as health and public education are affecting the people of the middle class, since they cannot afford to go to private institutions.” Daoudi did not appreciate Lebbar’s interruption during his answers. Lebbar said that the government has failed on all social aspects. Daoudi reminded the councilor of the government’s achievements and that the government is challenged with a deficit from previous governments. He claimed that Lebbar wanted only to overstate the situation. Daoudi had submitted his resignation on June 6 to the politburo of the PJD, the day after he participated in a sit-in organized for employees of Centrale Danone. The sit-in followed weeks of the boycott against three Moroccan companies: Centrale Danone, Sidi Ali, and Afriquia. Daoudi’s resignation still awaits the approval of King Mohammed VI to be effective.

The King said that the fight against corruption is a priority and requires more efforts. The sovereign added that the fight against corruption can be applied through “coordination of experience and the pooling of expertise.”

Rabat- Al Hoceima’s Public Prosecution has decided to investigate the arrest of a 14-year-old boy for joining protests against the harsh sentences given to Hirak Rif activists. Police arrested the teenager, named Bilal Lamqadam, early on Sunday morning at his family’s house in Imzouren, near Al Hoceima. Police also arrested other protesters for throwing stones at security forces during the protests, as detailed by Moroccan newspaper, Akhbar Al Yaoum. As a minor, Lamqadam was placed in a reformatory in the northern city of Nador, 120 kilometers from his home town. Lamqadam’s arrest led to varied reactions on social media, but many commenters condemned the arrest, rueing Lamqadam’s young age. One Facebook user wrote : “Arresting a child equals arresting a future and a dream.” 
“The child, Bilal Lamqadam arrested and locked in Nador reformatory, Imzouren is bleeding!” another wrote. 
 On Tuesday, June 26, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals sentenced Hirak leaders Nasser Zefzafi and Nabil Ahemjik, as well as activists Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid, to 20 years in prison; other activists were sentenced to 1 to 15 years. Following the court’s decision, demonstrations reverberated on June 27 in the capital of the Rif region, Nador; near the Parliament in Rabat; on Boulevard El Oumame Al Moutahida in Casablanca; and in Meknes on  June 29. Hashtags like #stop_this_farce” (in Arabic) and #Free_Hirak_activists_now” have  also emerged to decry the sentences against the activists. The activists had been arrested for their involvement in Hirak Rif protests, which rocked the Al Hoceima region in 2016 and 2017.

Rabat – Moroccan forward Aziz Bouhaddouz has sent an emotional message to his and the Atlas Lions’ fans, thanking them for their support and loyalty during the national squad’s World Cup experience in Russia. Bouhaddouz took to his Facebook account to say that failure is an important aspect of sports and life, and that the team’s Russian experience has taught him a lot about life and people. “I have learned a lot and I am proud to have had this opportunity,” he said. “Many thanks to all our supporters who followed us in Russia. Many thanks to our supporters worldwide. Many thanks to all Moroccans who showed their loyalty and love. You were and are the best.” Expressing gratitude for the opportunity to represent Morocco and its national colors at a tournament of the World Cup’s standing, he said that he enjoyed every moment of the Russian adventure, especially the relationship the team enjoyed with Moroccan people.  For all the good feelings though, the Moroccan forward said he is disappointed with fans who showed less faith in the team and did not support it as they should have. “I am disappointed in many people who did not support my selection. But if you are seeking success, you must also learn to ignore the obstacles and fight personal defeats.” In Morocco’s first World Cup game, Bouhaddouz’s own goal in the final minutes handed victory to Iran. The Moroccan forward nonetheless received massive public support, as many Moroccan football fans felt that Bouhaddouz’s mistake is part of the game, and that the forward needed a show of public support to let go of his anxiety and focus on the next matches against Portugal and Spain.

Rabat – Eight days after being sentenced to 20 years, prominent Hirak Rif activists, including Nasser Zefzafi, have refused to appeal against their sentences and have started a hunger strike. The list of the convicted activists who have chosen not to appeal their sentences includes Nabil Ahamjik, Samir Aghid, and Ouassim el Boustati, who were also sentenced to 20 years. Zefzafi’s father, Ahmed Zefzafi, confirmed his son’s decision to Moroccan news outlets. The editor in chief of Moroccan news outlet Badil.info, Hamid El Mahdaoui, who received a sentence of 3 years, at first also refused to appeal the court’s decision. “My husband contacted me from prison and told us of his decision not to appeal his verdict,” said El Mahdaoui’s wife to Badil.info. “I will not participate in this charade and I say to Judges Ali Tarchi, Mahjoub Raqi, Fatmi Damane, Mohamed Mesaoudi and Hakim El Wardi, we will meet in the ‘Great Judgment,’” she added. However, Badil.info posted an update yesterday, saying El Mahdaoui decided to appeal after all. The activists have only ten days from the date of sentencing to appeal. They will have to decide by Friday, July 6. The activists’ sentences, ranging from 1 to 20 years, received backlash nationwide, with politicians, celebrities, and international NGOs decrying the heavy judgments against the 54 detainees. Protests erupted in Nador, Casablanca, and Rabat to denounce the sentences last week. The government coalition parties and Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi reacted neutrally to the sentences, saying that they respect the independence of the judiciary. In a press briefing after the Government Council on Thursday in Rabat, El Khalfi argued that the cabinet cannot interfere “because it does not fall within its jurisdiction, in accordance with the constitution and the democratic rules.” The activists had been arrested for their involvement in Hirak Rif protests, which reverberated across the Al Hoceima region in 2016 and 2017.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat- Scottish singer Sharleen Spiteri took the stage during Rabat’s Mawazine Festival, performing with her band of almost 30 years, Texas. However, the Glasgow-native is quick to correct any misconceptions that listeners may have about the origins of the musical group: “there’s nothing about Texas that’s got anything to do with us.” Speaking to a press conference at Rabat’s Villa des Arts and in a conversation behind the scenes, Spiteri spoke about the band’s 2017 record Jump on Board, reflected on her atypical Scottish upbringing, and answered Morocco World News’ questions about the #MeToo movement.  You said that you’re proud of your 30 years or more of Texas. Would you tell us how you started Texas?  Spiteri: I met Johnny, who is the bass player of Texas and my songwriting partner, one week before my 18th birthday. So I was 17 years old. To be really honest, I’d never ever thought of being in a band. Everyone in my family played music, but everything was self-taught. I always imagined that people who were musicians were from another world. I just didn’t thank that’s what I would do. I was going to art school and working as a hairdresser.  I met Johnny and he said to me, “Do you write?” and I said “yeah,” the way you do when you’re this young. And we started writing. […] We wrote together for one year and we started trying to put a [record] deal together and we did all the demos, “I Don’t Want a Lover” and “Everyday Now.” That was how it started. And we signed to Universal Records. And we were signed to Universal for [over] twenty years.  And would you tell us about your inspirations for your last album, Jump on Board? Spiteri: Jump on Board was very influenced by a lot of Glasgow rock bands like Orange Juice and Hipsway, and their jangly guitars. What we wanted to do when we wrote Jump on Board, we wanted to make a record that would make you feel happy. We wanted to make a record that basically helped you escape from everyday life, and just have that moment of forgetting when you get home from work.  We wanted to make a record that basically helped you escape—something that made you feel happy inside and like you want to dance. And that was really what we were trying to achieve for ourselves, first of all. And luckily enough, it’s been successful.    What does it feel like to be here in Morocco for the second time, and the first time at the Mawazine Festival? Spiteri: It’s such a beautiful country. We got in late last night. We arrived just as Bruno Mars was doing his last song. There were a lot of young people dancing in the streets and the atmosphere was just fantastic. Have you prepared anything special or different for the audience tonight at Mawazine?  Spiteri: There’ll be a few surprises. I think the most important thing about going to a show is that we entertain—that the band and the audience come together and [make] a big fantastic mood and that people are just happy and enjoying themselves. We have a big catalogue, we have a lot of songs from over the years. [The setlist has] a mix of everything, some old, some new. Maybe some covers. Hopefully it’ll be entertaining! I see that you’re drinking Moroccan tea. What do you think of Moroccan food? Spiteri: I’m going to be honest, I haven’t eaten since I got here last night. I literally got out of my bed 45 minutes ago.  Was this because you were tired or because you were stressed? Spiteri: Oh, I’m not stressed! I’m 50 years old. Seriously, I don’t do “stressed.” When you become my age, you don’t give a shit. I don’t need any of that bullshit in my life. It’s one of the great advantages of getting older. The things that you care about [now] are so different from when you’re young. Life is shorter, so want to enjoy every single minute that you have. And that’s all I really care about. Do you listen to “Arabic music” or to any Moroccan singers? Spiteri: I grew up with so much different music as a child because both my parents aren’t British. I have a French grandmother and a Maltese grandfather. My father grew up in Egypt and came to the UK when he was eight or nine years old. So there was lots of different music that I heard as a child from that side [of the family]. And then on my mother’s side, our family are Norwegian and Irish. So, I grew up very differently. Even just the food was different at my home and my friends’ homes. I didn’t grow up with typical British food. Maybe that’s why I’m still alive!  Can you tell us about the band’s name, Texas: Spiteri: So the band was named after the movie Paris, Texas. When Johnny and I first met, we both loved Wim Wenders, the director of the movie Paris, Texas and who has made many great movies. But the thing that really stood out to us as well was the opening sparseness of the movie and the soundtrack that Ry Cooder had made for it. We were obsessed with that slight guitar sound and it really inspired the first record we made. If you had to rename the band— Spiteri: Put it this way, if we had to rename the band, it would not be Texas. Because when you’re 17 years old, and you’re like what are we going to call our band? I had never been to Texas, I had no idea what Texas stood for! We were only referring to the movie. And it’s weird because suddenly you realize what Texas stands for: there’s great things about Texas, but there’s really shitty things about Texas as well. Then you travel and people think you’re some country rock band. And then you have the moment where people you meet go, “so you’re American?” And then they can’t understand why you’re not American and would call yourself Texas. And you spend hours on end explaining to somebody, “No, I’m not from Texas; the band is called Texas.” There was a great moment years ago with Lionel Richie. I went to this Universal [Records] dinner that Lionel Richie was at. And the lawyer from Universal Records says [to him], “This is Sharleen Spiteri from Texas.” And he went, “ahh, you’re from Texas?” And I said, “No, I’m from a band called Texas.” And Lionel Richie could not get his head around this at all. He would go away for 10 minutes, and then come back to me and ask, “Are your parents from Texas?” And you’re speaking to Lionel Richie, who’s one of the greatest songwriters, and you’re saying “Listen, Lionel, seriously, forget Texas, it’s just a name.” “At the end of the day, the connection was Paris, Texas the movie and Ry Cooder’s soundtrack to Paris, Texas. Apart from the that, there’s nothing about Texas that’s got anything to do with us.” MWN: What do you think emerging artists today are up against? Do you have any advice for young female performers? Spiteri: I always feel like such a fool giving anybody young advice. I was up against something different in the 80s. It’s easier to make records nowadays, so you can make records with no money. But the amount of records, you have to fish through so much now to find the people that are really good at what they do. But most of the good stuff rises to the top and sticks.  MWN: I understand that you’re reluctant to give too much advice to the young people, but particularly for young women performers who are trying to break on to the music scene. What kinds of things do you think they’re up against, and how have you worked against that in your career? Spiteri: As far as young women coming up and coming through, times are changing. They’re changing slowly. The only thing I would say to young women is, remember what it is that you’re trying to change. The #MeToo and Times Up movements it’s about, for me, it’s about when my daughter says, “I’m not prepared to do that, I don’t want to do that, that’s not right,” that she’s not going to be ostracized or looked down upon or not employed or not able to do something because of that. Men are important in my life, and them being different from us [women] is important. I don’t want to water them down. But for the bad ones that are out there – it’s not just against women, it’s violence against young men as well, and that’s important. You’re hoping that you’re creating a society where young women can say ‘no.’ And the fact that women in Hollywood are not paid the same as a man is fucking ridiculous. If you’re grossing at the box office more than he’s grossing at the box office, why are you not getting paid more?   I just hope that young women now feel that they can speak out if they’re in a situation where they’re uncomfortable or in danger.

Rabat – Amine Harit has reached an agreement. The prosecutor at the Court of First Instance in Marrakech has decided to grant the Moroccan international football player a temporary release, returning his passport and allowing him to leave Morocco.  The Atlas Lion was involved in a road accident that led to the death of a pedestrian in Marrakech. The accident occurred while the player was driving with his 14-year-old brother on Saturday, June 30, shortly after midnight.   On Tuesday, the Schalke 04 sports director, Christian Heidel, announced the release of his player, shortly after landing in China with the rest of the team. Heidel said that Amine Harit got his passport and driver’s license back.  “Amine has had his appointment today with the police and the prosecutors, everything happened very quickly, he was auditioned again, the police submitted the report, Amine got his passport and his license back,” said Heidel.  The sports director also claimed that the player “does not need to appear,” as his defense must only sign official documents concerning the settlement with the family of the victim. The procedure suggests that the footballer came to an amicable arrangement with the family of the victim. “He will stay with the family a few more days, we also prefer him, because he would probably be alone in Germany, he will come to Gelsenkirchen at the appropriate time,” added Harit’s boss. The Schalke 04 attacking midfielder was supposed to be presented to a prosecutor in Marrakech on Monday “in a state of freedom and with his passport withdrawn.” The hearing was postponed to July 11, to “allow for negotiations with the victim’s parents with a view to amicable settlement,” explained a close source to the case to AFP. Responding to the tragedy,  the father of the victim called on authorities to take the necessary measures to hold the footballer responsible if found guilty. Investigations are ongoing in order to determine the circumstances of the incident. Schalke 04 expressed worries over the Moroccan player, expressing solidarity and support for Harit. Earlier this week, Heidel said that he is “very worried” about the 21-year-old footballer, emphasizing that the whole team is behind him.

Rabat – The Barid Al-Maghrib Group (GBAM), Morocco’s postal service, has concluded three cooperation agreements with the Chinese postal operator China Post Group to boost e-commerce exchanges and facilitate the transfer of money between Morocco and China. The three agreements were signed by the Director General of Barid Al-Maghrib, Amin Benjelloun, and President of China Post Group Li Guohua. They are part of GBAM’s commitment to continue its international partnerships and strengthen its cooperative relationship with the Chinese postal institution, says Barid Al-Maghrib. The first agreement concerns the creation of an e-commerce marketplace, directly administered by GBAM, enabling Moroccan artisans and small businesses to promote and sell their products in the Chinese market. The second agreement provides for the introduction of a package offer adapted to the e-commerce market. It is a service of small postal packets with shipment tracking, and will soon be proposed to GBAM’s customers. Finally, the third agreement will regulate a money transfer corridor between the two countries, while promoting cooperation between Al-Barid Bank and Postal Saving Bank of China, a subsidiary of China Post Group. The three agreements will realize the MoU on cooperation signed in Rabat in September 2017 between Barid Al-Maghrib and the Chinese post office.

Rabat- Commenting on the sentences given to the Hirak Rif activists during a Parliament session, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has said that he could never rejoice at the imprisonment of a Moroccan citizen. El Othmani recalled his own arrest and imprisonment in Derb Moulay Cherif prison in Casablanca during Morocco’s “Years of Lead” or “Years of Embers” between the 1960s and 1980s. El Ohmani said he relates to the suffering of prisoners.  El Othmani said that at the time he was handcuffed and blindfolded for long periods of time while in jail: “The circumstances were insufferable and unimaginable.” The Years of Lead are considered the worst years in the history of post-independence Morocco. In those decades, the right of expression was suppressed, dissidents and democracy activists were arrested and jailed, and some disappeared. El Othmani regretted that his government cannot intervene in the Hirak Rif case, because the “judicial power” is an independent authority. On Tuesday, June 26, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals sentenced Hirak leaders Nasser Zefzafi and Nabil Ahemjik, as well as activists Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid, to 20 years in prison; other activists were sentenced to 1 to 15 years. The court’s decision resulted in nationwide controversy and protests calling for the release of the individuals. Demonstrations took place on June 27 in the capital of the Rif region, Nador; near the Parliament in Rabat; and on Boulevard El Oumame Al Moutahida in Casablanca. Meknes saw a protest on Friday, June 29. The activists had been arrested for their involvement in Hirak Rif protests, which reverberated across the Al Hoceima region in 2016 and 2017.

Rabat – In her new television show, “Hello, Maroc!” American lawyer, MENA consultant, and religious scholar Courtney Erwin demonstrates her mastery of Modern Standard Arabic through storytelling that bridges her experiences between Morocco and the US. Featured on the television station Télémaroc, “Hello, Maroc!” is the first Moroccan television show written and hosted by an American woman in Fusha, or formal Arabic. In 10 episodes, Erwin, or “Coco,” as she’s called in the program, discusses subjects ranging from dreams to violence, gender to heroes.  The most striking aspect of the show is its total focus on Erwin; she is the cast, narrator, subject, and oftentimes, the only person seen onscreen. Erwin’s day-to-day life is revealed in sweeping shots of her wanderings—pondering natural expanses and Arabic novels, buying vegetables in the souk, preparing soup in her kitchen. Erwin has worked across the Middle East and North Africa as an outspoken advocate for the universal right to education, spearheading interfaith, peacebuilding, and human rights endeavors. Erwin currently lives in Morocco, where she serves as the Senior Program Specialist at the Mohamedian League of Religious Scholars. She also recently launched an immersive cultural, educational, and spiritual program, Illuminated Tours Morocco, with Dr. Omid Safi of Duke University.  Erwin sat down with MWN to discuss her experience studying Arabic, living in Morocco, and filming her first television program. How in the world did you come to write and star in an Arabic television program in Morocco?  Erwin: [Laughs] My friend Chama Darchoul is a journalist who writes a column for Al Akhbar, a daily paper owned by Rachid Niny, who recently had launched [the TV channel] Télémaroc and was looking for content. We were talking one day, and Chama proposed the idea. She told me that it could be about anything. I would think of a topic, write out the concept in Arabic, work with my Arabic teacher to correct my mistakes, and then re-edit. It took a very long time. The shows are each about six minutes, but for that short time period, filming alone could take an entire day, while recording my voice-over would take over an hour. I always used the framework of stories because I believe that stories are what connect. So, I would start with a story in Morocco and then link it to the US (or vice versa). Then, I would tie in my lesson-learning from the story, linking the topic to larger themes of mutual recognition and solidarity, love, and acceptance across the two cultures. What are your hopes for the program, in terms of audience and impact? Erwin: The purpose for me is to be a bridge between the two cultures and tell the stories between the US and Morocco. If the audience here in Morocco can connect to the stories and see themselves in the stories, then I’m delighted. When I asked people what they liked about the show, they said that they liked seeing how I see Morocco. And also, how I see America from here. I enjoy “switching people’s shoes” so that they can experience moments that shift their perspectives. Also, I love Arabic so much, and I have spent so much of my life learning it. If I can motivate Moroccans and Americans alike to re-engage with Fusha, and think, “If she can do it, I can do it,” then that is wonderful. I hope I can serve as an example to show non-native speakers that they really can learn and understand formal Arabic. Now that you said “hello” to Morocco, are there other projects, cross-cultural or otherwise, that you have in mind? Erwin: This opportunity appeared because I was in the right place at the right time, and I had a friend with a cool idea who encouraged me to do something I never would have done otherwise, and I am unbelievably grateful to Chama, Rachid Niny, my film and audio crews, and Telemaroc for believing in me…Though I am not pursuing other series, two projects have emerged out of this project. For the first, I would like to, ideally, take these stories, add twenty or so to the collection, and then put them into a book in Arabic…Eventually, I’d love to send the collection to Arabic institutes to serve as fairly easy-to-read and cross-cultural stories for students of formal Arabic.  I’m also currently working on another writing project of letters to my father that attempt to connect Islamic civilization to his world, which is the world of an older, more conservative gentleman raised in the Southern states in the US, who may not always have a positive impression of Islam or the MENA region. I’ve written about 13, so far. They are also thematic, and actually, the idea for the show is linked to that [project]. Where would you say that you are right now in your Arabic language journey, and where would you like to go this year? Erwin: I think this is the first year that I feel less inhibited when speaking in Arabic, making mistakes and being okay with that. I study two hours every day, five days each week. I’ve been in Morocco for three years now…so, that’s a lot of hours. I recently asked my Arabic teacher, “When I’m speaking, what is the percentage breakdown of the accuracy of my speaking compared to my mistakes?” She said I was about 70 percent accurate and 30 percent inaccurate—like using the incorrect tense or preposition with a verb—but that will come with time… Right now, I’m reading novels and conducting formal correspondences in Arabic. I would say that I probably have 1-2 more years before I obtain a pretty solid level. And then? Erwin: I don’t know yet! I always want Arabic to be an essential part of my life. I anticipate living in Morocco for at least half of each year for the rest of my life. Before I moved to Morocco, I lived in Qatar, and it took at least three years before I felt like I understood the nuances of culture there. Personally, I don’t think that I can be effective as a liaison and “translator” across cultures, without living here. In my experience, a week or two every year in a place and reading a lot about it does not provide the same insights. I need to talk to people, eat together, laugh together, tell stories, open up about our dreams and struggles, and spend time in the community in order to understand the community, and allow them to understand me. Do you see yourself as a community builder in Morocco? Erwin: I find myself having conversations with my Moroccan friends, which they might not be able to have with other people due to the constraints of living in one’s own society. In that respect, I think I can help to open up conversations and create a safe space for exchange, and I like that. And that’s what Morocco is for me, as well. I am able to benefit from looking at my life and country in a different way. And rather than being a community builder here alone, I really try to bring the two communities together. For example, the “Hello, Morocco” episode on violence covers discussions of violence here and in the US and how each community sees the other. In this way, I hope to turn the mirror around and generate reflective conversations in society. Is there anything you would like to add? Erwin: We see a number of political tensions and cultural misunderstandings play out between the US and Arabic-speaking countries, and there are not enough non-native Arabic speakers in the US who speak Arabic really well. I should not be such an anomaly. The link between language and culture is so strong; there is no way I could have any understanding of a community without knowing the language.  When is season two? Erwin: [Laughs] You’ve got season one. Like so many great HBO and Netflix shows: one season is all you get.

By Salihah Evans Rabat – The biannual summit of the African Union began on Monday, July 2, 2018, in Nouakchott, Mauritania. Radio France Internationale (RFI) has reported that irregularities found in the recruitment process have led foreign ministers to “temporarily suspend” the Pan-African Parliament’s budget. In addition, the body could potentially be investigated for corruption.  The theme of this year’s summit is winning the fight against corruption. Corruption is an economically-crippling issue that influences countries throughout the African continent. Annually, Africa loses an estimated USD 50 billion to tax evasion alone. The executive council hopes to increase transparency within the Pan-African Parliament to fight against corruption.   The Pan-African Parliament was established March 2, 2001, at the Fifth Extraordinary Session of Heads of State. The purpose of the Parliament, outlined in Article 17 of the African Union Constitutive Act, is “to ensure the full participation of African peoples in the development and economic integration of the continent.” After 33 years of absence, Morocco rejoined the African Union in February 2017. Morocco formally joined the Pan-African Parliament in May of 2018.

By Renee Sang Rabat – In a recent spotlight by Spanish newspaper El País, the head of the Directorate of National Security (DGSN–DGST), Abdellatif Hammouchi, has been honored for his contributions to maintaining national security. There are no shortage of anti-terrorism successes that can be attributed to Hammouchi. El País states that Hammouchi is known among Moroccans as “the man who never sleeps” and their best-informed agent, but his contributions are not limited to his own country. In Europe, Hammouchi played a role in finding the perpetrators of terrorist attacks, specifically in Spain and France. It is due in part to his support that individuals involved in the deadly Barcelona attacks of August 17, 2017, as well as the Paris attacks of November 13, 2015, were found. Hammouchi has previously been named an officer of the Legion of Honor in France as well as being awarded the Honorary Cross of Police Merit from Spain.  As an advisor to King Mohammed VI in affairs of terrorism and the head of both the DGSN and DGST, two security corps in Morocco, officials in Europe have hoped that he will maintain his position for many years to come. El País, a Spanish publication that recently published an article about him stated, “The security of Europe is linked to cooperation with [him].” Among Hammouchi’s skills is fluency in Arabic, French, and English, and proficiency in Spanish. Hammouchi has also been cited to have an excellent memory, as “[he] is able to retain and give back the names of hundreds of jihadists,” according to one of the officials who has worked with him. The official also said Hammouchi has greatly modernized the DGSN with how he trains the members of this security force. Due to his successes and professional handling of anti-terrorism affairs, it is likely that Hammouchi will keep his position for a long time to come.

By Chase Lacy Rabat – The Wild Boar youth football team that went missing in Northern Thailand’s Tham Luang Nang Non-cave were found on Monday. A video released by the Thai Navy confirmed the group is still alive. In a statement, the governor of the Chiang Rai region, Narongsak Osottanakorn, said, “I confirm they are all safe.” On June 23, the team went on an excursion into the popular cave, but after walking inside, sudden heavy rainfall trapped them underground.  The cave complex is a massive network of tight and narrow tunnels connecting cavernous openings, and the continuous flooding makes the rescue operation particularly perilous.  Rescuers suspected that the boys went to an area known in the cave as “Pattaya Beach,” however upon reaching the massive chamber, they discovered that there was too much flooding. Continuing for another approximately 400 meters they found the group had taken refuge on a muddy incline above the water level.  British cave divers were the first to make contact with the exhausted group inside the massive cave complex. However daunting challenges remain to rescue the twelve 11-16-year-olds and their 25-year-old coach.  Apakorn Yukongkaew, naval special command chief in the Thai Navy, said that they were trying to pump water out of the cave, and that they were establishing a telephone line in the cave.  The commander of the Marehong River Line Unit, Wutthichai Poocharoenyos, said if the water levels go down the boys would be able to walk out of the cave, but if not they will have to dive. He also added that there were US Navy SEAL officers and medics assisting the boys. Thailand’s rainy season does not end until September or October; the Thai military said that food for four months is being sent to the boys. Unless the cave can be pumped out enough for them to walk out, they will remain there until the end of the rainy season.  In the worst case scenario, continuing rains and struggling pumping systems could flood their small sanctuary, forcing the group to take a risky dive through narrow and muddy waters. Complicating matters are general weakness from undernourishment and that apparently none of the boys know how to swim

Rabat – Amid a swirl of controversy about fuel prices in Morocco, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and Governance issued a joint statement with relevant ministries that gasoline stations are required to advertise the name of each type of fuel and its price, including taxes. The ministry said that the joint decision was published in the official bulletin of June 21, stipulating that fuel distributors must make the prices, inclusive of taxes, visible to customers through price boards on the roads with access to the distribution station. The joint decision of the ministry of governance and the Ministry of Industry, Investment, Trade, and Digital Economy as well as the Ministry of Energy, Mines, and Sustainable Development aims to ensure transparency to make the selling prices of fuel visible to customers. The statement, quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), added that the decision aims also at the “generalization of the display of all types and fuels sold in stations, instead of displaying only the two types (Gasoil and Super) as is currently the case.” The joint statement added that a maximum of 10 months has been granted to distribution companies to implement the measure. The statement also urged gas stations to update their prices. The increase of fuel prices in the country has sparked an uproar in Morocco, especially after the launch of the online boycott in April against high commodity prices, which specifically targets Afriquia gas. Anger mounted when the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) justified the increase of prices due to the international oil market. HCP said that fuel prices continued to rise, reaching MAD 10 per liter at the end of May 2018, compared to MAD 7 at the beginning of 2017. HCP claimed that fuel distributors in the Moroccan market source 100 percent of their fuel from the international market, and importers tend to increase their purchases when prices fall and reduce them when prices rise again. In June, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi recognized that the cabinet needs to solve the issue of gasoline prices. El Khalfi also promised that the government has been following the issue and studying possibilities to solve it.

Rabat – An Iranian general has accused Israel of causing climate change in Iran by stealing the country’s clouds passing over the Mediterranean. However, Iran’s national meteorology service disagreed with the general’s point of view. Brigadier General Gholam Reza Jalali, head of Iran’s Civil Defense Organization, claimed that Iran was facing “cloud theft” during a press conference, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported. “Iran’s climate change is suspect,” he said. “Foreign interference is suspected to have played a role in climate change.” Jalali accused another unnamed neighboring country of cooperating secretly with Israel in this action. “Joint teams from Israel and one of the neighboring countries make the clouds entering into Iran barren.” “We are faced with the cases of cloud theft and snow theft,” Jalali added, citing a recent four-year study showing that all mountains over 2,200 meters in altitude between Afghanistan and the Mediterranean are covered in snow, except in Iran. However, Jalali’s claims were contradicted by Ahad Vazife, the head of Iran’s meteorological service. “Perhaps they have documents in this regard, and I’m not in the pipeline, but based on meteorological information, there is no possibility that a country will steal snow or clouds,” Vazife told the Iranian Students’ News Agency. “Iran has suffered a prolonged drought, and this is a global trend that does not apply only to Iran,” Vazife said. He added that a country cannot steal clouds because if it were possible, the US would steal clouds from other countries and would no longer have a water shortage. In 2012, former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claimed that Iran’s growing drought was due to “Western countries” planning to cause drought in the country. He claimed these countries had affected the climate with their technologies. On the other hand, the online outlet the Times of Israel reported that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu “offered to share Israel’s water expertise with Iran,” saying “the Iranian people are victims of a cruel and tyrannical regime that denies them vital water.” Netanyahu told the Iranians that Israeli technology could help Iran with their water problems since Israel has succeeded in dealing with similar water issues.

Rabat – The Office Cherifien de Phosphates (OCP) has “temporarily suspended” its activities in Kenya following accusations of “contaminated” and “fake” fertilizers, recent reports have indicated. Kenyan authorities, who recently initiated a nation-wide anti-corruption campaign, are accusing OCP of introducing contaminated products in the Kenyan market.  According to Moroccan outlet Medias 24, roughly 5,200 tons of fertilizers have been reported by  laboratory tests conducted by Kenyan authorities to contain mercury, making them “substandard” and contaminated. In the wake of the fake fertilizers scandal on May 22, three OCP Kenya directors were arrested by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, according to reports in the Kenyan press.  The  officials were accused of “attempted murder” for shipping 5.8 million kilograms of substandard and “dangerous” fertilizers. Fleeing control? On June 28, Kenyan outlet Daily Nation reported that a cargo ship of 10,000 tons of Moroccan fertilizers fled Mombasa Port to avoid inspection. As this came in the heat of the fake fertilizers scandal, many in Kenya saw the move as a further proof of wrongdoing by OCP.  “If it had genuine cargo, why did it make a U-turn even after they had paid KES 18 million  [USD 179,000] as taxes?” asked George Kinoti, director of Kenya’s Criminal Investigations. Acknowledging that it “rerouted” a cargo ship, OCP Kenya said, however, that the move was a reaction to the “unfair treatment” and “unnecessary tests” to which some circles in Kenyan authorities wanted to subject the company. OCP further denied the allegations, citing a smear campaign by its competitors to “sabotage” its success in the Kenyan market. Defamation campaign In a statement issued in the immediate aftermath of the scandal, OCP said that it was “shocked” by the “unfounded accusations,” which it believes are “based on opportunistic misinformation and defamatory public denunciations.” OCP also said that its fertilizers “undergo rigorous tests” before shipment and that it “complied fully with Kenyan procedures and regulations.”  “The full compliance of this cargo with such procedures and regulations has been indisputably confirmed by independent expert analyses performed by several internationally renowned inspection agencies,” the company’s statement further asserted. Continuous continental commitment  OCP, which in February 2016 launched a comprehensive South-South policy via its OCP Africa initiative, has established itself as a key partner of a number of African governments and investors in agriculture and food security. The company said that it “has decided to temporarily suspend exportations” to Kenya because the “legal security” of its activities in the East African country is “no longer assured nor tenable.” But despite perceiving the situation in Kenya as an “unfair” and politically motivated campaign, OCP says it remains committed to its role as a continental driver of sustainable agricultural development to ensure continental food security.  The company underlined that its fertilizers have been lauded by several local farmers who have hailed the effectiveness of OCP’s products. It promised to “support Kenyan authorities” in their investigations and resume operations in the country as soon as the situation reaches an end. “We are only on temporary leave,” OCP recently told Medias 24, explaining that “the situation in Kenya will not affect our commitment to agricultural development in the country.”

Rabat- The Centre Marocain de Conjoncture (CMC), a Casablanca-based economic research institute, has revealed in its latest annual report that “persisting social inequalities” are hurting Morocco’s economic growth, barring the country’s ultimate dream of asserting itself as a developed country. Titled “Persisting Inequalities: An Impediment to Growth,” CMC’s 2018 report presents Morocco as a country of persisting socio-economic disparities. According to CMC researchers, while the North African country’s economic path has gained international praise from investors and financial institutions, the gap between poor and rich Moroccans has “considerably widened” in the last decade. Despite major investments in recent years, Morocco’s economy is still “fragile,” and collective welfare has not been positively impacted, the report argued. Instead, “social and territorial disparities have reached a worrying level.” “In Morocco, territorial inequalities are still large and preoccupying,” CMC said, explaining that Moroccans’ socio-economic status, education level, and access to basic social services and necessities are “inextricably linked with where they live.” A deep-seated and “internalized” culture of poverty has been holding Morocco’s potential back despite considerable efforts to invest in infrastructure and other economic sectors, according to the report. “There is a negative relationship between the persistence of strong income inequalities and long-term national economic performance. Programs and strategies adopted in Morocco have not helped the country’s socio-economic development model.” “They [the economic strategies] are now presenting signs of dysfunction, suggesting their limits to solve the country’s crucial problems.” Among the “appropriate” strategies and measures to solve Morocco’s persisting problems, the Casablanca-based institute proposed an inclusive and pro-poor economic policy. The fight against poverty should entail the implementation of inclusive policies to confront the issues at their root, the report maintained. Regarding the “way forward,” the report cited, among others, redistribution of wealth, a system of expansive healthcare, and quality education in public schools. For CMC researchers, huge investments in infrastructures and other “material” sectors cannot deliver on expectations when there is a “lack of investment in human development.” “Poverty reduction is the pillar of sustainable development,” the report concluded.

Rabat- A communiqué of the Ministry of National Education shocked social media users when it recently announced that it will allow first and second year middle schoolers to pass with grades as low as 7.5 out of 20. The communiqué, released on June 28, entails that students with far below the average grade (on the curve) of 10 will pass the 2017-2018 academic year into the next middle school levels in the regions of Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima. Many Moroccans believe the move is bad news for the quality of Morocco’s public education. The release reads: “At the requests of parent-teacher associations and parents of students in the region, we are honored to announce that the baseline of the [passing mark] will be no less than 7.5/20.” Some Facebook users expressed shock and condemned the ministry’s decision to lower the passing score in order to meet students’ levels, instead of helping students raise their educational level to meet the average educational level, at the very least.  The students’ parents are also subject to criticism, as they are responsible for their children’s education. At the same time, the Ministry of Education has been taking strict measures against private schools that inflate students’ grades, especially those in the baccalaureate level, as shown in the huge disparities between their continuous grades and their baccalaureate results and regional grades.

Rabat – The Moroccan football team’s coach, Hervé Renard has clarified his situation once and for all, shutting down all speculations during an interview with 2M. In the past few days, Hervé Renard has been the center of all kinds of rumors: rumors that he would join the Egypt and Algeria football teams, rumors of his feud with Mustapha Hadji, rumors of his “conditions” for the FRMF, rumors he wanted to leave Morocco’s team, and attempts to understand his cryptic messages on social media. Intercepted on his flight back home from Russia to Morocco, the French coach agreed to answer 2M’s questions about his future.  Renard who was “very touched by the Moroccans’ support” has talked about his adventure at the World Cup, slamming Spain, Portugal, and the referee. Addressing the rumors, “No one speaks with my name,” said Renard. He added that he has “a contract with FRMF until 2022.” “Many things are possible in the world of football. Sometimes there are leaders who are not happy with their coaches and they decide to replace them. There may also be a desire to leave from the coach. For the moment, we are not there. We will see what will happen in the coming weeks,” added the coach of the Atlas Lions.  Yesterday, Renard, who has also coached Côte d’Ivoire and Zambia, gave some explanations on social media, regarding his “conditions” to stay with the national team. Renard said that he did not have any meeting with FRMF.  “Contrary to what can be said in some media, I have had no meeting since the end of our participation in the World Cup. As a result, I could not express any particular requirement for the future,” he said.  Last week, Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported that Renard had set conditions to remain at the head of the Atlas Lions following their defeat at the World Cup in Russia. Renard’s first condition was reported to be that Nasser Larguet, the squad’s technical director, be allowed to stay at his post. Renard was also said to have asked the FRMF to allow him more room regarding the choice of players and staff members that he wants to works with. Renard would get rid of assistant coach Moustapha Hadji, who is said to have issues with many of Renard’s key players.

Rabat –  Moroccan television network Arryadia had said that the mercato (summer transfer window) over Moroccan international footballer Hakim Ziyech would be concluded Monday. The Moroccan player was set to leave Dutch team Ajax to join Italian giant AS Roma. Arryadia television tweeted in French on July 1: “Hakim Ziyech to AS Roma for an amount of €30 million. The official announcement is on Monday.” AS Roma has not yet confirmed the news. The 25-year old talent had reportedly reached a deal with AS Roma with a five-year contract earlier in June. Ajax and AS Roma have not yet signed the contract. Ziyech would be the second Ajax footballer to join AS Roma after Justin Kluivert. The Moroccan-Dutch footballer attracted a great deal of attention during his spectacular performances during the 2018 World Cup qualifiers and the World Cup. Hakim #Ziyech à l’ @ASRomaFRA pour un montant de 30 M€. L’annonce officielle lundi. @AFCAjax pic.twitter.com/BsLunW2W7c — Arryadia TV officiel (@arryadiatv) July 1, 2018  Quoting Italian sports news outlet Corriere dello Sport, AS Roma reported that the Italian giant is “running out of time to sign Ziyech.” The outlet added that Ajax and Roma have agreed on a deal, but Roma may have to sell some of its players in order to pay the EUR 30 million transfer fee for the Moroccan midfielder. Ziyech is also making the headlines of Dutch football for his excellent seasons with Ajax, which named him player of the year in 2018 after he led them to a major win over AZ Alkmaar (3-0) in the Netherlands’ Eredivisie competition in April. Ziyech chose to represent Morocco’s Atlas Lions when he had the opportunity to join the Netherlands. The footballer made his debut for Morocco in October 2015 in a friendly with Côte d’Ivoire. Ziyech also played for Netherlands Under 19, Under 20, and Under 21 teams between 2012 and 2014.

By Anna Schaeffer Rabat – Just three days after European Union members settled a long-battled migration deal, nearly two hundred people went missing in the Mediterranean. After weeks of tense dialogue and dispute, the 28 EU members reached a compromise at a Brussels summit Friday, June 29. To discourage refugees from boarding smuggler boats en route to Europe, “disembarkation platforms” will be constructed in North Africa. Additionally, the agreement includes plans for secure centers within the EU to process arrivals into two groups: those “in need of protection” and others—“economic refugees”—to be sent back.  What’s happening in Libya? This year alone, more than 1,000 people have died attempting to make the journey from Libya to Europe. The figure comes from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), whose Chief of Mission Othman Belbeisi called the head-reeling number an “alarming increase in deaths at sea off the Libya Coast.” Libya is a key point for Africans embarking towards Europe, often on desperately overcrowded inflatable boats. Sometimes, the vessels hold over three times the intended number of passengers. Sixty-three people, including three babies, are missing and feared dead from a wreck Friday, the same day the EU reached their agreement. During the weekend over 170 more men, women, and children went missing in the Mediterranean from three separate boats.  The spokesman for Libya’s navy, General Ayoub Kacem, said departures have increased in anticipation and fear of closed European borders. Recently, Rome closed its nation’s ports to NGO rescue ships.  A speech by Doctors without Borders (MSF) Migration Advisor Aurelie Ponthieu on the EU’s battle towards a compromise emphasized the true nature of the situation. “Policy makers are failing to see that the majority of people have no choice but to come to Europe; fleeing conflict, crisis or chaos in Libya,” Ponthieu said. “Policies of containment and walls of deterrence are not the answer to this global humanitarian crisis. They will only continue to push people into long, dangerous journeys and into the hands of smugglers.” “Until we can offer safe and legal alternatives to leaky boats and life-threatening journeys in Libya, this extreme suffering will continue.” What happens to the “rescued?” In addition to the nearly two hundred missing and dead this weekend alone, a Libyan coastguard boat arrived Monday in Tripoli with 235 people retrieved from two operations. The substantial figure includes 29 women and 54 infants. Upon arrival back on Libya’s coast, authorities placed the individuals in detention centers.  IOM Director General William Lacy Swing will travel to Tripoli this week to “see firsthand the conditions of migrants who have been rescued as well as those returned to shore by the Libya Coast Guard.” Swing addressed the exploitation by smugglers of desperate migrants, racing against the clock to reach Europe before further border crackdowns.  “IOM is determined to ensure that the human rights of all migrants are respected as together we all make efforts to stop the people-smuggling trade, which is so exploitative of migrants.” Reactions to EU compromise Responses to the heavily disputed settlement range from backlash to praise. EU President Donald Tusk warned of its potential to fail, while Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and the Czech Republic—each with staunchly anti-refugee atmospheres at present—lauded the deal’s success.  The new populist government in Italy, after closing their ports to rescue ships, originally refused the deal, but eventually acquiesced. France and Austria both withdrew their nations from hosting secure centers for refugee arrivals.  Morocco refused the implementation of reception centers in Morocco. Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita stated, “[Morocco] rejects and has always rejected these kinds of methods for managing the issue of migration flows.” MSF immediately reacted to the deal, emphasizing the settlement will succeed in turning away from Europe’s shores the most vulnerable men, women, and children.

Rabat- King Mohammed VI has inaugurated the urban bypass N2 Highway linking the city of Rabat to Salé over the Bouregreg River. The sovereign named the bridge “Ribat Al Fath.”  The project is part of the King’s 2014-2018 Rabat development program launched in 2015 to improve road security and help with the city’s traffic congestion. The new bypass is 8 kilometers long, extending from Tadla Avenue in Rabat to the national highway N6 in Salé. The bypass has a vehicle-carrying capacity of 30,000 cars daily, encompassing 28 percent of the total traffic between the two cities. The bypass also includes a tunnel connecting the Mohammed VI Avenue crossroad in Rabat and an above-ground passage at Zarbia Road in Salé. The project’s construction budget reached MAD 520 billion, carried out by the Bouregreg Valley development agency.

Rabat – Will another Hollywood production shoot in Morocco? According to American movie-focused outlet Omega Underground, the third part of the Sherlock Holmes saga could film some scenes in locations within the Kingdom. Besides Morocco, the movie is already set to shoot primarily in London, the home of the characters. For this new adventure, American actor Robert Downey Jr. will again don his Sherlock Holmes suit, while British actor Jude Law will assume his role as Holmes’s sidekick, Dr. Watson. Original director Guy Ritchie has not been confirmed yet to return. Warner Bros. plans to release its production on December 25, 2020. The far-off launch date may be a result of the leading actor’s busy schedule. Downey Jr. just finished shooting the last Avengers film and Jude Law is about to wrap up filming for  Captain Marvel. Released in 2010, Sherlock Holmes is the story of the legendary detective of the same name, accompanied by his sidekick Dr. Watson; the duo relentlessly pursues criminals of all kinds. Holmes’s weapons are: a keen sense of observation and deduction, erudition, and curiosity. Morocco will welcome two other Hollywood productions this year. Keanu Reeves’s famous John Wick saga is revving up for round three in the kingdom. The Canadian actor is set to shoot in the North African country, following filming which began in Japan and Montreal April 25. Additionally, American actor, singer, and filmmaker Johnny Depp will soon fly to the kingdom with British actors Robert Pattinson and Mark Rylance to shoot Waiting for the Barbarians, produced by Colombian filmmaker Ciro Guerra. “We hope to start shooting at the end of the year in Morocco. It will be my first film outside of Colombia and in English,” said the director in a statement to AFP.

By Chase Lacy Rabat – The Gulf states are in the midst of combating terrorism, however they are fixated on regional geopolitical maneuvering with their sworn rival, Iran.  Namely, they are attempting to subvert Iran and its proxies: the Hezbollah network, Syria’s Assad regime, Yemen’s Houthi rebels, and Shiite militias.  Kobi Michael of Tel Aviv University says even though Saudi Arabia drew up a 2002 peace initiative calling for Israel to cede all occupied territories, they are now willing to push the Palestinians to accept Kushner’s peace plan. Though Saudi Arabia is one of the primary financiers of the Palestinian Authority, their patience and willingness to deal with Palestine is growing increasingly thin. Israeli-Gulf normalization is mutually desirable. For open ties with the Gulf, Israel needs to agree to a plan for Palestine. The Gulf states, attentive to their citizens’ concerns about Palestine, for the same reason want a formalized peace agreement.  Khalil Sheheen, a political analyst in Ramallah, told Al Jazeera he believes the “reordering” of regional threats will come at the expense of Palestinians. For Arab states “the issue of normalization is no longer controversial.” “But it is important to realize that the thawing of relations between Arab countries and Israel is not connected to bilateralness.” Instead it is a result of maintaining “hegemonic arrangements” and protecting their regimes. Tension with Iran has caused Saudi Arabia to warm to Israel. In 2017 the Israeli Foreign Ministry instructed its embassies, in cables that were later leaked, to lobby their host countries’ governments in support of Saudi Arabia over the Hariri debacle, in which Saudi Arabia was accused of having undue influence over Lebanon. The cables stressed Iran and Hezbollah’s role in “regional subversion.” In an interview with Al Jazeera, Menachem Klein of Bar Ilan University said he thought the cable was meant to go public. “Netanyahu’s aim was to make clear to the Saudis that we can help.”    Last November, Ayoub Kara, Israel’s Communications Minister, invited Saudi Arabia’s Grand Mufti Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh to visit Israel. Shortly after the invitation, Gadi Eizenkot, Israel’s chief of staff, said that “Israel is prepared to share intelligence with Saudi Arabia on Iran.” Last year former Saudi chief of intelligence Prince Turki bin Faisal al-Saud, debated Efraim Halevy, formerly of Israel’s Mossad, about strategies for dealing with Iranian “provocations.” This March, Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS), met US presidential advisor Jared Kushner on a US tour to discuss the Arab role in Middle East peace. On the tour, MBS did not seek to publicly raise the issue of Palestine and Jerusalem. However, in an interview with the Atlantic he was asked about the rights of Israel to a nation state. He answered, “I believe that each people, anywhere, has a right to live in their peaceful nation. I believe the Palestinians and the Israelis have the right to have their own land.” But nothing was as shocking as MBS’s incendiary statements at a March 27 closed-door meeting with several right-wing Jewish organizations, such as AIPAC, Stand Up for Israel (ADL), and the Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA).  Officials from all three organizations have donated millions to illegal Israeli settlement building, and lobbying against the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement. BDS seeks to pressure Israel economically to provide equal rights and right of return to Palestinians.  According to several Israeli and US diplomats with knowledge of the meeting and a cable sent by the Israeli consulate, MBS said, “It is about time the Palestinians take the proposals and agree to come to the negotiations table or shut up and stop complaining.” He continued, “In the last several decades the Palestinian leadership has missed one opportunity and the other and rejected all the peace proposals it was given.” MBS further criticized Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, and clarified that Palestine was not a priority for Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia, however, continues to support Palestine in rhetoric. In an opening statement April 15 at the Arab League Summit, Saudi’s King Salman announced the summit would be called the “Jerusalem Summit.” Hanna Issa of the Islamic Christian Commission in Support of the Holy Sites said President Mahmoud Abbas had personally requested King Salman change the name to show Arab unity with Palestinians.  During the summit, King Salman announced large donation packages worth USD 150 million for the Islamic endowment in Jerusalem and USD 50 Million for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine (UNRWA). The summit issued a communique affirming the Arab league’s refusal to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and that East Jerusalem is to remain the capital of Palestine. Khaleel Assali of news website Akhbar al-Balad, said, “Jerusalem has become a word that everyone uses to show patriotism. We have heard so much of these words in the past and also millions have been committed in previous summits for Jerusalem, but we have not seen on the ground any changes as a result of these so-called donations.” However, the Gulf states purportedly offered a deal to Israel in 2017 with only a poor overture to Palestinians. The deal entailed that their states would end the prohibition of overflight rights for Israeli aircraft, establish direct telecommunication links, and ease trade restrictions. Israel, in exchange, would be required to stop constructing settlements in “certain areas” of the West Bank and allow more trade to enter Gaza. The deal mentioned no right of return or the complete cessation of construction within settlement blocs. Israeli officials have made multiple clandestine trips to Gulf countries, notably the UAE. Israel’s energy minister, Yuval Steinitz, made a trip to Abu Dhabi and secured an office at the International Renewable Energy Agency, seen by some as a de facto Israeli embassy.  On Army Radio, Steinitz has said, “We have ties that are indeed partly covert with many Muslim and Arab countries.” Steinitz noted Gulf states have particular interest in Israel’s surveillance technologies.  In 2014, the UAE signed a USD 100 million deal with a company called Verint Systems. The US-based company, which primarily conducts operations out of Israel, was to track data on the UAE’s telecom networks. Israeli company NSO Group Technologies has also sold surveillance software to the UAE. In another example, Shmuel Bar, the Israeli founder of a company, IntuView, that mines data to detect terrorist threats, was contacted by a Saudi official via Skype in 2015. The official said Saudi Arabia was interested in the company’s technology, but Bar would have to create an offshore company to obscure IntuView’s Israeli roots. Bar fulfilled the Saudi’s request, and IntuView began surveillance to root out jihadis in Saudi Arabia. Later, he claimed, the work expanded to include surveillance on public opinions of the Saudi royal family. Bar said he often meets with Saudis and officials from other Gulf states at conferences and private meetings. The only countries that Israel deems unacceptable to do business with are Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria. “The Arab boycott,” said Bar, “doesn’t exist.” When Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, was hacked in 2012, Israeli companies resolved the situation. According to Erel Margalit, a member of the Knesset, some Israeli companies are involved with Arab states on an “ongoing” basis. These companies simply operate through offshore companies when needed. The extent of this activity is apparent: an Israeli entrepreneur, Mati Kochavi, completed a USD 6 billion job to install security infrastructure (cameras, sensors, and license plate readers) in the UAE. Kochavi’s company, AGT International, used Israeli engineers, many of whom originate from its intelligence services. Kochavi himself managed the company from Switzerland and the US, however the day-to-day operations were conducted by another one of his companies, Logic Industries. Israeli businesses operating clandestinely, but under the state’s approval in the Gulf, focus on desalination, infrastructure protection, cyber-security, and intelligence. Elbit Systems, Israel’s largest private defense contractor, operates a subsidiary in New Hampshire which often welcomes customers from Kuwait, Qatar, or Saudi Arabia. Questions in the media about Elbit’s operations arose when an American contractor, Christopher Cramer, who worked for Kollsman Inc, a subsidiary of Elbit Systems, was found dead outside a hotel in northwest Saudi Arabia on January 15, 2015. Cramer was in Saudi Arabia to work on the thermal optical lenses for their missile systems. Cramer’s own Facebook post said that he was there to upgrade TOW missile launch systems and supervise live-fire demonstrations. The Saudi police report ruled his death a suicide, claiming he leapt from his third story room balcony. However, according to the autopsy of forensic pathologist Michael Badan, Cramer had been acutely beaten before falling from the balcony. Another example of these deals came when Israeli newspaper Maariv revealed in February 2018 that Israeli companies, Aeronautics and Albeit, have been supplying arms to the UAE, alongside drones to Egypt and Libya. As long as the Gulf states seek to strengthen relations with Israel, sign contracts for technology purchases, and hold backdoor discussions with Israel or groups that fund its occupation of Palestine, then it is clear that they do not intend to stand by their brothers in the long run. This is the second in a 5-part opinion series evaluating the conduct of MENA region states in upholding their commitments to Palestine. Read the first part about Egypt here. Part 3 will investigate the nature of Lebanon and Jordan’s relationship with Israel.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has officially commented on the Netherlands’ remarks, which criticized the heavy sentences given to Moroccan activists involved in the Hirak Rif movement. The minister confirmed to Moroccan newspaper Al Massae that the Dutch ambassador to Morocco was summoned after Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Stef Blok made his remarks in a parliamentary session in the Netherlands in answer to a Dutch MP’s question about the Moroccan court’s decision to sentence Moroccan activists to up to 20 years in prison. Blok then warned Moroccan-Dutch activists to be careful when visiting Morocco, emphasizing that once in Morocco, police consider bi-nationals as Moroccans only. “Moroccan-Dutch activists traveling this summer in the region must be careful,” Blok said. “I have made it clear that the Rif’s Hirak is a strictly internal affair and is by no means an object of diplomatic discussion,” said Bourita. He added that Morocco respects the decisions of Dutch courts, and therefore, “they must respect ours.” Bourita described the sentences handed down by the Moroccan courts as “indisputable, especially since they are verdicts of first instance and are not final and we do not allow foreign parliaments to deal with our internal affairs.” Morocco also opposed Dutch comments on the Hirak movement in April. Blok remarked in a press briefing after his April meeting with Bourita that the Moroccan government “had not been effective in responding to the grievances of the people who took to the streets.” Bourita contested Blok’s argument, stating, “[The situation in the Rif] is not a diplomatic question, and cannot be subject to a diplomatic discussion; it is an internal affair, and under no circumstances can it be dealt with through discussions or interaction with foreign states.” Spain refused to comment negatively on the issue of Hirak and the sentences pronounced by the court when Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs Josep Borell said that this issue is an internal problem. “This is an internal issue handled by Moroccan justice, pending the appeal since the process is not over yet,” he said. The decision of the court received condemnation from politicians and NGOs, who urged the government to review the sentences and release the activists and journalists. The activists had been detained for protesting against social disparities in Al Hoceima after the death of local fishmonger Mouhcine Fikri in October 2016.

Rabat – The Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Bourita, reiterated Morocco’s firm stance on Western Sahara Monday, emphasizing that the dispute must be resolved within the scope of the UN and not the African Union. Bourita, who represented King Mohammed VI during the June 30-July1 31st African Union Summit for Heads of State in Nouakchott, said that the “resolution of the Sahara conflict is in New York and not in Addis Ababa.”  In a press briefing held on the sidelines of the summit, Bourita stressed that there is only one body that has the rights to help solve the 4-decade-long conflict: the UN. “And it is also the only one recognized by the African Union,” added Bourita. Throughout the years of the ongoing conflict, the Algerian-backed Polisario Front has long sought for members of the African Union to intervene in the conflict over Western Sahara. However, Chairperson of the AU Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat broke away from previous rhetoric on the conflict, expressing full support for the UN-led political process to bring it to an end. The chairperson, who took the AU office in July 2017, presented the AU’s recent report that the pan-African organization will withhold any decision that is not compatible with the political process initiated followed the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1754 in April 2007.  The report defined the role of the AU in the conflict, emphasizing that the African organization is to “support and to accompany the UN efforts,” and the UN Security Council is the only body that has the legitimate power to monitor the region and commit the parties of the conflict to negotiation terms. The document further expressed its satisfaction with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and his Personal Envoy Horst Köhler, recalling the round of discussions held with the parties to the conflict. The report also stressed that all parties, without any exception, showed interest in being involved in new rounds of negotiations.

Rabat- Two days after arriving in Morocco, German vlogger Susi Cruz experienced sexual harassment. Cruz’s harasser has been arrested after she shared a video online on July 1 to recount her experience. In the video posted on her YouTube channel “Van Life,” Cruz, who is known for videos of her travels in her van, tearfully spoke of the stressful experience. “When I walk the street for five minutes, just one street, and ten different people approach me, and make noises as if I was a dog.” Cruz said that she could not be herself while in Morocco’s Chefchaouen,  known as the blue pearl. Even though she wore a conservative outfit of pants and a loose long-sleeved shirt, the harassing did not cease. Moreover, she talked about a guy who was friendly and tried to cheer her up by inviting her to his shop, only to harass her for hours while in her van.  It got creepier when the guy did not want to leave the van and told Cruz that he wanted to be her boyfriend.  The man also asked her for money. Cruz was horrified and tried to reach for her wallet to give him money, but she could not find it: “My wallet was stolen, I have no driving license, no money and no credit card,” Cruz said.  Luckily, the man left Cruz’s van for a smoke and Cruz managed to lock the doors and drive for Spain. After arriving in Spain, Cruz made a video discussing the incident in Chefchaouen, saying she was glad she was back in Spain because while in Morocco, the way men looked at her made her feel uncomfortable despite her flexible nature: “They made me feel so weak; I felt so powerless.” Cruz also wrote, in the description of her video, that despite all, there were good things she enjoyed in the North African kingdom, and many women were nice to her: “Please don’t get influenced by the things I say, because it’s only my perspective and I don’t want you to generalize moroccans or anything like that. there were also many good things which I will post in the next video.I just wanted to share this asap if any solo travelers decide to go there.” After the video went viral on social media, Moroccan authorities arrested Cruz’s harasser, who featured in the clips. In her Monday Instagram story, Cruz said: “The police found that guy because of the video. He was arrested because of harassment, possession of drugs and illegally working as a tour guide.” Sexual harassment remains a serious issue in Morocco. Despite several anti-harassment campaigns and Morocco’s new law against violence, sexual harassment, and gender-based discrimination, women still get openly harassed in public. According to the law, those accused of such crimes will receive jail time from one to six months, as well as a fine ranging from MAD 2,000 to 10,000.

Rabat – A “national front” has been created by the workers’ rights advocacy group Democratic Labor Conference (CDT) to “salvage” Samir, Morocco’s only national oil refinery. The Democratic Labor Conference made the announcement on the sidelines of a June 24 meeting on the Samir question, including especially workers’ rights and families’ welfare in the Mohammedia area, near Casablanca, where the refinery is located. Samir, which suffered major losses during the 2014-2015 oil crisis, has been closed since August 2015. Following the closure, a court ruling liquidated the company in March 2016, but the oil refinery has since failed to attract buyers, with investors considering the company to be too expensive and “below expectations.” The 24 June meeting urged stakeholders and authorities to ensure the survival of Morocco’s sole oil refining company. Calling Samir a national treasure, participants called for a combination of “national forces” to form a “national front” with the primary objective of saving Samir from disappearing. The meeting did not, however, present any indication as to how the “salvaging mission” would be carried out. Another meeting, to be held on July 14, is expected to deliver on the action plan of the “national front.” In a press release issued after the June 24 meeting, CDT called on “all national bodies, associations, progressive and democratic militants and stakeholders” to join the front’s efforts. Amid the escalating crisis and financial uncertainty that followed the closure of the oil refinery, thousands of locals and workers in the Mohammedia area organized demonstrations to express concern about their future, asking for a resumption of activities. According to CDT, the prospective “national front” is a way of supporting and amplifying the voice and concerns of the Mohammedia-based local front that has suffered greatly as a result of the company’s closure.

Rabat – Nasser Bourita, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that Morocco’s autonomy plan for the Sahara region is part of the country’s ongoing efforts to build a democratic and modern society based on the rule of law; individual, collective, and economic freedoms; and social development. In an address read on behalf of the Permanent Representative of Morocco to the UN Omar Hilale, Bourita stressed that Morocco’s initiative was established within the framework of international legality “to guarantee all the collective and individual rights as decided by international instruments, in particular those relating to human rights, natural resources, and the self-determination principle.” “The autonomy plan presented by Morocco has been developed  to guarantee all Sahrawis outside and inside, in their pluralistic, tribal, and intergenerational composition, their full place and role, without discrimination or exclusivity.” The autonomy plan presented by Morocco provides for the establishment of an order of far-reaching constitutional and political principles, which will allow the inhabitants of the Sahara to democratically manage their affairs through legislative, executive, and judicial bodies with exclusive competences, he explained.  Bourita further emphasized that the Saharan regions will have the necessary financial resources for their development in all fields, while participating actively in the economic, social, and cultural life of Morocco. Bourita pointed out that the city of Dakhla “is an exemplary illustration of the efforts made by the Kingdom of Morocco and its vision for the development of the southern provinces.” “Like all other Saharan cities, Dakhla has experienced in recent years a profound transformation and substantial progress at all levels that has made it today a flagship and exemplary city for the Kingdom of Morocco at the international level.” The minister recalled that a new development plan for the southern provinces has been created, stating that a budget of more than MAD 77 billion has been allocated for various projects in the economic and industrial fields, agriculture, marine fisheries, tourism, promotion of Hassani culture, health services, education, technology, and infrastructure. The objective of Morocco is to allow the Sahara to play its historical role as a hub for trade between Morocco and Africa and also with the countries of the north, the minister said.  He also noted that the Sahara will be established as a reference geostrategic space, for peace, stability, and shared prosperity for the entire Euro-African region as well as for the rest of the Sahel-Saharan region. “The opportunities offered by the advanced regionalization and development efforts led by Morocco will make the Sahara region an integrated economic hub, and will help to promote the success of the autonomy plan proposed by the Kingdom of Morocco for the settlement of this artificial dispute,” the minister added. Bourita’s address was given on the occasion of the opening of the International Academic Conference “Models of Territorial Self-Government: Common Points and differences,” held July 2-3 in Dakhla.

Rabat – They were Belgium’s savers. In the Belgium-Japan game Monday, July 2, Moroccan-Belgian players Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli have reversed the trend by bringing Belgium into the quarterfinals of the World Cup.  What a game! Considered one of the World Cup’s favorite teams, Belgium was shaken by Japan for sixty minutes. Samurai Blue, as Japan’s team is known, was clearly leading the game, scoring a double in the second half of the match.  Close to elimination, Belgium’s Red Devils were quick to respond to their opponent. In the 69th minute, Jan Vertonghen opened the Belgians’ scoring on a particularly lucky move. Trying to score a long-distance with his head, the defender found an unlikely angle to clobber Japanese goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima. With new momentum, the Belgian football players were unstoppable. Marouane Fellaini, who entered the field in the 65th minute, made an equalizer goal in the 74th minute.  Nacer Chadli, also of Moroccan origin, made the game’s final goal in the 94th minute, a spectacular ending that allows Belgium to move on in the competition. “When I go to the field, I try to make a difference, to bring something more. I tried today, I brought it. I’m happy for the group,” said Marouane Fellaini.  Before joining the Belgian selection, Marouane Fellaini chose to play for Morocco. Unfortunately, the coach of the national team of Morocco, Fathi Jamal at the time, considered Fellaini’s profile as not corresponding with the national team of Morocco.  As for Moroccan-Belgian winger Nacer Chadli, he played one friendly game with Morocco against Ireland in 2010, before switching to represent Belgium.  To qualify for the semifinals, Belgium will have to beat Brazil in the quarterfinals, Friday, July 6 at the Kazan Arena. The winner of that game will have to take on either France Uruguay.

Rabat- MITC-Technopark, Morocco’s largest capital fund devoted to information technology, has launched Maroc Numeric Fund II, an initiative to fund information technology-related start-ups and “other innovative projects.” With a fund of MAD 200 million, the initiative, which is a follow-up to Maroc Numeric Fund I, will promote technological advances in the North African country by providing greater financial and technical assistance to technology-related start-ups. Speaking to the press on the sidelines of Innov Invest Day, a digital entrepreneurship meeting held in Casablanca on Friday, June 29, Dounia Boumehdi, MITC’s general director, said: “We do not only support innovation in technology. We approach innovation in its broadest sense, including business mode, services, and [other types of] products. The most important is something that is in rupture [with traditional ideas].” The initiative also envisions consolidating Morocco’s place in the digitized global market. “We have the support and the full confidence of our partners,” Boumehdi said. She added that the success of their previous project has spurred the interest of other investors ready to accompany their actions and projects. In addition to traditional partners, such Morocco’s Caisse Centrale de garantie (CCG ) and MITC, new investors, including BCP bank, BMCE bank, and Attijariwafa Bank are now also involved with Maroc Funds II. According to Boumehdi, Maroc Numeric Fund II will ensure sufficient funds and support for worthwhile innovative ideas and projects in a wide range of fields. Boumehdi also said that the second phase of Maroc Numeric coincides with the final stage of Maroc Numeric I. Launched in 2010, Maroc Numeric I had a budget of MAD 100 million with an exclusive focus on funding information technology start-ups. “We finalized the initial project in 2016 and all submitted ideas were funded,” Boumehdi declared, satisfied. She noted that, with a bigger project and more inclusive outlook, Maroc Numeric Fund II is looking forward to financing “some interesting ideas” in 2018 and 2019.

Rabat – Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairperson of the African Union (AU) Commission, has unveiled the pan-African organization’s latest report on Western Sahara, saying that the AU should “prioritize” the UN-led peace negotiations. Mahamat, charged since July 2017 with drafting the body’s report on Western Sahara, presented the document Sunday, July 1, at the 31st AU Summit for heads of state in Nouakchott, Mauritania. The document, making a case for the prominence of the UN peacekeeping efforts in the disputed territories of Western Sahara, noted that the AU will henceforth refrain from considering a continental agenda outside of the framework of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). While Mahamat’s report highlighted that African policymakers should have an important say in Africa-related affairs and crises, it maintained that the ultimate peacekeeping mandate in Western Sahara should be the sole responsibility of the UN. “AU’s role will be that of supporting and accompanying UN efforts,” the much-awaited report said, adding that the UN Security Council is the only body with the legitimate mandate to oversee the region and commit involved parties to negotiation terms.  It added, “The UN Secretary General’s personal envoy has initiated discussions with concerned parties, all of which have expressed their desire to negotiate.” In line with the AU’s objective of pushing towards a “fair, sustainable, and mutually acceptable political solution,” the document noted that “the AU Conference of Heads of States and Chiefs of Governments will lend effective support to the UN-led peace process based on the relevant proposals of the UN Security Council.” Morocco’s position? While Mahamat’s report may be interpreted as an important nod to Morocco’s position, the AU Commission’s chairperson is adamant that the report comes solely in the spirit of showing and respecting “the required coherence” with the UN peace process.  The report, however, added that Moroccan authorities have ceaselessly reminded African governments over the years of the risks of the AU’s quest for a “parallel agenda.”  Morocco’s traditional position has been that any AU-led actions that do not support UN efforts would be counterproductive as they “would not lead to a mutually acceptable political solution.” Most importantly, perhaps, Mahamat’s report exhorted Algeria and Mauritania to be an integral part of the UN peace process in the Sahara dossier, dubbing the two nations as “important stakeholders” in the decades-long stalemate.  Algeria, a known supporter of the Polisario Front, the insurgent group claiming independence for Western Sahara, has traditionally declined responsibility in the conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front, preferring to refer to itself as an “observer state.” Mahamat’s report, however, declares that “[any] efforts towards peace and stability in the Sahara question are likely to fail without an “effective Algerian implication [in the negotiations].”

Rabat – The national carrier Royal Air Maroc (RAM) issued a statement on Monday, saying that its AT 788 flight to Casablanca from Paris experienced a “disruption” and delay on June 29 due to the “aggressive and threatening behavior” of one passenger toward a flight attendant on the previous flight.  In its statement, which was received by Morocco World News, RAM said that en route to Paris, a passenger had “physically and verbally assaulted” the flight attendant before attempting to access the cockpit. In response, the flight captain applied the “alert procedure” for this type of situation in order to ensure the safety of passengers and the airplane crew. The flight landed at the Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport on time and the passengers were evacuated under the supervision of the authorities, RAM added. The flight captain, two witnesses and the flight attendants have all filed complaints against the passenger to the French authorities. The incident resulted in 1 hour and 55 minute delay of the AT789 return flight. Denouncing the alleged behavior of the passenger, RAM said that “the safety of passengers and aircrew is a non-negotiable priority abroad all flights of Royal Air Maroc.” The statement added that the “company wishes to recall that its services remain uncompromising vis-a-vis these inadmissible acts.”

By – Chase Lacy Rabat – Reports have surfaced that Jordanian-backed talks are underway between the Russian-backed Syria regime forces and the rebel factions in Syria’s southern province of Deraa.  According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a number of towns, including Bosra al-Sham near the provincial capital Deraa, are currently engaged in talks to cede the towns to the Assad regime forces, which will be a major blow to the rebel forces reeling from the massive government offensive.  The Russians involved in the negotiations want a full surrender of the rebel forces, and the rebels want Jordan to guarantee Deraa province’s 800,000 residents. The deal includes the rebel factions handing over their armored vehicles and heavy and medium weapons but keeping their light arms.  Regime forces will be allowed to reenter the towns, raise the Syrian flag over the government buildings, and resume their operations.  Rebel negotiating committees seriously mistrust the regime and their Russian backers, with airstrikes and shellings still in force. Since Saturday, there has been heavy fighting and bombardment in the area of Tafas, northwest of Deraa, and fighting in the areas between Bosra al-Sham and Deraa.  Adnan Masalmeh, a coordinator for the opposition committee said, “The Russian insistence on attempting to impose conditions, their unreadiness to stop the air strikes during negotiations, all this gives us more reason for lack of trust and justified fear.”  The regime launched an offensive on June 19 to capture the rebel-held southern provinces of Deraa, Quneitra, and Sweida. The region is part of the deescalation zone agreed to by Russia, Jordan, and the US in July 2017. The SOHR has reported that at least 123 regime forces, 84 rebel fighters, and 132 civilians have been killed since the offensive began on June 19. The UN Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has reported that at least 160,000 have been displaced, many fleeing to the closed Jordanian and Israeli borders.   There are three major actors in the southern region. The regime controls approximately 58 percent of the territory, the rebel factions 35.4 percent, and an ISIS-linked group (Jaysh Khaled Ibn Al-Waleed) 6.6 percent.  The south is among the last rebel strongholds after the enclaves around Damascus and Homs fell earlier this year. If Deraa falls, Idlib in the northwest will remain the last rebel stronghold.

By Chase Lacy Rabat- Moroccan entrepreneur Adnan Ouassini has announced that Secure Technologies Group (STG) will install a phone assembly plant in Morocco to be operational 2019-2020 and establish an STG Telecom Moroccan subsidiary.  The company, specializing in telecommunications, home automations, robotics and high-tech accessories, was founded by the Tangier-born Adnan Ouassini in 2008 in California’s Silicon valley through his other company Technology Capital Invest (TCI).  He announced the move to Matin-Eco that “Morocco is in full industrial development, illustrated today by major projects in the automotive and and aerospace sectors, in particular. The telephone assembly plant project is part of STG’s desire to support this dynamic as a real locomotive for the telecom sector, which still has great potential in Morocco.” He said that MAD 150 million would be designated for the project’s development for 2018-2019. STG will establish a network of 12 physical stores, the first of which will come to Tangier August 2019.  Ouassini said production would be for the domestic and international markets, particular for the rest of Africa, and that he is seeking to improve Moroccan access to new technologies with an affordable variety of high quality products.  He claimed that the the plant would directly create 250 jobs and indirectly 300 jobs.  The company is partnered with RMA for a breakage insurance service. The company has agreed to a partnership with BMCE Bank of Africa for a 12-month credit offer for smartphone acquisition. Orange will operate as the distribution partner, and the Jumia platform will be used for its digital marketing.

Rabat (MAP) – A control commission has closed a secret workshop manufacturing banned plastic bags in Douar Oulad Ben Omar, Oulad Ziane, Berrechid province.  This action comes in accordance with the law prohibiting the manufacture, import, export, marketing, and use of plastic bags, says the Ministry of Industry, Investment, Trade and Digital Economy.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) arrested four suspects with alleged ties to the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) in Casablanca, Nador, Tangier, and Tiznit on Monday, July 2. The Ministry of Interior issued a statement on Monday, announcing the arrest of four individuals between the ages of 19 and 24, who were active in four Moroccan cities. The statement added that investigations conducted by law enforcement noted that the suspects were acquiring skills in explosives manufacturing to commit terrorist acts. The statement further explained that the suspects also support the “destructive agenda of Daesh [ISIS] and the propaganda for this terrorist organization.” The arrests also enabled security forces to seize various weapons, electronic items, manuscripts, and documents that “praised ISIS’ extremist ideology.” According to the same statement, one of the suspects “had close links with one of the individuals arrested following the dismantling of a terrorist cell” May 8 in Morocco and Spain. The suspects were placed in custody and will be brought to justice at the end of investigations under the supervision of the competent prosecutor’s office. Throughout the first half of this year, BCIJ has carried out several operations dismantling terrorist cells and arresting suspects with alleged links to ISIS. The latest operation took place on May 14 and resulted in the arrest of four suspects with alleged ties with Daesh in Casablanca, Fez, Kenitra, and Driouch. The suspects were aged 20-27. Also in May, Morocco’s BCIJ and Spanish authorities arrested a five-member terror cell in North Morocco and Spain. In March, BCIJ dismantled another terror cell in the cities of Oued Zem, near Khouribga, and Tangier. Investigations revealed that the members were planning to murder one of their own after doubting his loyalty to the terrorist organization. On February 21, the BCIJ dismantled a terror cell made up of six extremist supporters of ISIS in Tangier, including one member of the Polisario Front.

Rabat- The U.S. Department of State has released the 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report, which says that Morocco “does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking” despite the government’s efforts and suggested steps forward to solve the issue. The Moroccan government has convicted slightly more traffickers this year than the previous year, by carrying out more investigations. However, according to the report, the government did not fund specialized protection services exclusively for the victims of human trafficking. The survey emphasizes that undocumented migrants in Morocco are more vulnerable to human trafficking, adding that the government did not report screening for these trafficking victims who may face the risk of being re-trafficked. The government reported investigating 34 trafficking cases in 2017, whereas in 2016 it reported investigating only 11 cases involving eight sub-Saharan migrants linked to trafficking networks. The government also reported in 2016, the arrest of two Moroccans under article 475 and 486 of the penal code for sexual abuse, who were engaged in sexual exploitation. On the other hand, the report pointed out that the government did not report the status of certain cases, such as Saudi Arabian nationals involved in child sex trafficking, and some 122 cases of trafficking and migrant smuggling networks dismantled in 2016.  In addition, a ring of 66 smugglers and their 12 accomplices, involved in 33 trafficking cases, were disbanded in 2017. The report has provided recommendations for Morocco regarding anti-trafficking measures, suggesting that the country should train judicial and law enforcement authorities, increase anti-trafficking investigations, and fund NGOs specialized in fighting all forms of trafficking. The report added that the country should also impose strict sentences against traffickers and identify human trafficking victims so that they are not punished for the crimes they are subjected to. The report concludes: “Moroccan men, women, and children are exploited in forced labor and sex trafficking, primarily in Europe and the Middle East.” According to the 2016 Global Slavery Index, 45.8 million people worldwide are victims of slavery. Morocco ranked at number 18 out of the 167 listed countries with the most cases of modern slavery, including human-trafficking. Modern slavery involves the act of “one person possessing or controlling a person in such as a away as to significantly deprive that person of their individual liberty,”says the survey.

Rabat – Algerian Minister of Youth and Sports Mohamed Hattab said that his country is “ready to study a possible joint bid” with Morocco and Tunisia to organize the 2030 World Cup. Three weeks after Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup was defeated by the North American United 2026 bid, Algeria has voiced interest in a joint bid to co-host the 2030 World Cup with its neighbours: Morocco and Tunisia. “With the sports infrastructure that was built, Algeria is ready to study a possible joint bid with Morocco and Tunisia for the organization of the World Cup,” the minister told Algerian press on Sunday. He recalled that Algeria will host the African Youth Games (JAJ) in the coming days, as well as the Mediterranean Games in 2021. Expressing the Maghreb’s determination to host biggest sporting events, the Algerian official said that he believes “we have the means to organize major international meetings.” On June 13, both Algeria and Tunisia voted for Morocco’s World Cup bid to host the tournament in 2026. Morocco, however, did not receive enough votes to beat United 2026, and thus lost its chance to host. After the vote, Morocco expressed its readiness to bid for the 2030 World Cup.

Minister of Youth and Sports Rachid Talbi Alami announced on June 14 that Morocco will spare no efforts to bid again to win the hosting rights of the 2030 FIFA World Cup. Talbi added that Morocco will continue the infrastructure projects for the 2026 bid as planned, suggesting that the construction and innovation plans will be financed and completed as explained in the Morocco 2026 project.  “All Moroccans are ready to mobilize for the success” of the prospective Morocco 2030 project, he added.

By Mustafa Salma Oueld Sidi Mouloud Rabat – On the occasion of his first visit to the region, will the envoy of the international community ask why Sahrawi refugees are denied the right of return? Collective asylum is considered to be an escape from an armed conflict or circumstantial issues due to ethnic, sectarian, or political conflicts. People often return to their homes or homelands after the threat to their life is removed. Is there still a threat to the Sahrawi families living in the camps on the Algerian soil after 25 years of ceasefire? According to the Polisario Front and Algeria’s theory, the presence of the Moroccan administration in the Sahara threatens the lives of the Sahrawis. They try at every opportunity to incite the Moroccan Sahrawis to plot disturbances in the Saharan cities to confirm their theory. But reality proves the opposite. According to the census of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in the Sahara, which was taken after the cease-fire, the majority of Sahrawis live in the Sahara regions. And thousands returned from the camps to Morocco after the census. The Moroccan administration did not penalize or favor them over the rest of the population. It positively favored the returnees by offering them cash grants, housing and employment to facilitate their integration into society. There are Sahrawis who go on visits from Morocco to the camps in support of the Polisario Front, to meet with its military and security leadership. Then ceremonies are held to honor them before they return to Morocco. However, Morocco does not prevent them from returning back or punish them when they return, except for one case 10 years ago when the individuals were released after just a few months in detention. On the other hand, Polisario’s laws prohibit the inhabitants of the Sahrawi camps from returning to their homeland, and describe the act of return to the homeland, which is a universal and human right, as a crime of treason punishable by more than 10 years imprisonment. Algeria has been involved in the crime of preventing the return of the Sahrawis due to its security control over the borders of the camps. Algeria has arrested many of them during their attempts to flee the camps, and handed them to the Polisario, where many of them spend long years in prison and others have been killed or their fate remains unknown to this day. History shows that the Polisario is the only movement in the world that has never called for the return of its refugees to their land. This raises questions about their true intentions towards the Sahrawis. It also confirms that, in addition to the fact that the Sahrawi refugees are trying to get to the offices of the UNHCR to claim their legal status as refugees, the Polisario is exploiting them, like people who use civilians as human shields. The Polisario’s insistence on keeping the Sahrawis as permanent refugees, despite the end of the circumstances which caused them to be displaced (the armed conflict), demonstrates that the Front intends to keep them hostage to protect the interests of its leaders, including making profits by marketing the misery and suffering of the refugees in the camps. Moreover, these refugees are used by the Front and Algeria to threaten the stability of the region. They are the firewood that the Polisario uses as a threat at every occasion whenever they have a narrow margin of maneuver. They are Algeria’s winning card in its intended conflict against Morocco, an internal means of pressure to continue the meeting of its heterogeneous ruling elites, and a justification for its presence and its international blackmail. The international community should not remain idle in the face of the human tragedy that the Sahrawis have been living in for decades because: – There is no justification for the Sahrawis to remain dispersed; – The Moroccan defensive wall is not the cause of dispersal as the Polisario claims; – Morocco does not prevent them from returning to their land; – It has not been proved that Morocco confiscated Sahrawi property or punished the returnees despite their carrying weapons against Morocco; – The Polisario and Algeria are the ones which prevent and criminalize the return of the Sahrawis to their land and their communication between each other; The international community should help the Sahrawis to return to their homeland and restore their normal lives by putting pressure on the Polisario Front to lift its hand off the Sahrawi civilians and enabling the UNHCR to protect and help them in self-determination in a free and independent manner. Mustafa Oueld Sidi Mouloud is the former chief of the Polisario Police.

Rabat- The UN Secretary General’s Personal Envoy for the Sahara, Horst Köhler, has said he was satisfied with his first visit to the southern provinces of the Kingdom of Morocco, noting that the visit allowed him to “deepen his understanding of the case.” “I am satisfied with this visit during which I met many people and visited different places,” said Köhler in a statement Sunday to the state-owned press Maghreb Arab News (MAP), at his departure from Hassan I Airport in Laayoune at the end of his visit. He indicated that the various meetings he held were fruitful. Köhler also welcomed the progress and development in the region, particularly in the economic and social spheres. He said the final settlement of the Western Sahara question will lead to more investment in the region and the creation of job opportunities, especially for young people. The personal envoy also emphasized his willingness to work towards a mutually agreed solution. During his visit to the southern provinces of the Kingdom, Köhler held a series of meetings with elected officials, sheikhs, notables of Sahrawi tribes, and civil society actors. The meetings were held in Laayoune, Smara and Dakhla, where members reaffirmed their commitment to the autonomy initiative as the only solution for the settlement of the Moroccan Sahara issue. These talks were also an opportunity to stress the need to put pressure on Algeria to authorize a census of inhabitants at the Tindouf camps. Köhler also inquired about development efforts in different sectors in the region, as well as projects registered as part of the southern provinces development model. The personal envoy visited the regional human rights commissions’ headquarters in Laayoune and Dakhla. He also took note of the progress made in the region with regard to the promotion human rights in the wake of reforms Morocco initiated. Köhler’s visit to Morocco is part of his second regional tour which has already taken him to Algeria and Mauritania. This regional tour of Köhler comes after the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2414 on April 27, 2018, by which it reaffirmed the pre-eminence of the Moroccan autonomy initiative. He advocated that realism and a spirit of compromise are essential to progress towards a political, realistic, pragmatic, and sustainable solution to the regional dispute over the Moroccan Sahara, by explicitly asking neighboring countries, and therefore Algeria, “to make an important contribution to the process and to engage more strongly to progress towards political solution.”

By Dana Leger Rabat – The International Conference on the Question of Jerusalem in Rabat concluded Thursday evening, June 28, after two days of discussions from Palestinian, Israeli, and international experts as well as youth from East Jerusalem. Representative of Palestine, Ambassador Riyad Mansour, expressed his gratitude to the Kingdom of Morocco for its hospitality, noting, “His majesty [King Mohammed VI] set the right course for this conference,” on Tuesday with his opening letter. “What we need is peace and to diffuse the situation. We do not need a massive rupture on religious ground in Jerusalem because that will be catastrophic for all of us.”  “This is the year we have to double our efforts.”  The conference opened Wednesday, June 27, with a statement from UN Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs Miroslav Jen?a on Israeli settlements: “Ongoing settlement construction and expansion in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem is a major obstacle to peace. It is illegal under UN resolutions and international law and must be halted and reversed.” In the first plenary panel, experts had harsh words for Israeli and US policy. Abdallah Siam, Deputy Governor for Jerusalem, argued that Israeli policies aim to push Palestinians out of Jerusalem. He referred to policies based on principles such as strengthening the Jewish character of the city, the growth of Israeli settlements, and the occupation of Palestinian lands. In the same panel, Lara Friedman, representative from the Foundation for Middle East Peace, spoke about the effects of the move of the US embassy to West Jerusalem from Tel-Aviv. According to her, this action seems to have been intended to end the question of Jerusalem unilaterally – albeit unsuccessfully – and that such a move diminished the chances of the US acting as a sponsor of the Middle East peace process.  However, she added, “I’ve never seen so many people focusing on Jerusalem… the unintended consequence for Trump’s move is that the world is paying attention.” Daniel Seidemann, from Terrestrial Jerusalem, compared the Israeli occupation to a disease spreading throughout the body and stated that, “under Israeli occupation Palestinian lives don’t matter very much and often they don’t matter at all.” He added that the current US administration did not understand the realities on the ground, and that solving the question of Jerusalem requires a valid Palestinian State. “That is the essence of occupation – not being able to control your own life.” Amneh Badran of Al-Quds University, in accordance with Siam, stated that Israeli policies aimed at pushing Palestinians out of Jerusalem are an effort to change the city’s demographics through land-grabbing by military force and occupational laws. Urging for resistance, she added, “Supporting people on the ground is the most important. If we don’t have something done to change the balance of power on the ground, the Palestinian presence in this city is threatened. We need to insure that Jerusalemites remain in Jerusalem.”  Badran also called for investment in key sectors such as education, health, and youth programs as part of a partnership between international donors, governmental and non-governmental actors in order to enable Palestinians to remain in Jerusalem. In the second plenary panel, Ziad Abuzayyad, former minister for Jerusalem Affairs, reviewed a number of related UN resolutions, and found that the “United States of America transferred its embassy to Jerusalem in violation of all of the international resolutions,” and “the Israeli claim to sovereignty over Jerusalem has no basis in UN General Assembly Resolution 181.” He also questioned the term “Israeli-Palestinian conflict” saying it should be removed from the general vocabulary and replaced with “Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands.” He asserted, “It’s not a conflict. It’s an occupation.” Moshe Amirav of Hebrew University insisted that Jerusalem is a city for everyone, and that he hopes the conflict can be resolved to return Jerusalem to the City of Peace – as it is named in the Bible.  In the third plenary, Shoroq Nammari, one of the youth from East Jerusalem who works for Palestinian Vision, talked about the struggle of residency and citizenship for Palestinians. She expressed the fears of Palestinians in Jerusalem that their residency can be revoked at any time for unprecedented reasons, declaring that “those who do not express their loyalty to the occupation should not be punished.” “We will continue to resist until we establish a Palestinian state and our rights to self determination have been attained,” she added.  Ali Ghaith, a freelance journalist, spoke of the poor educational systems in place for Palestinian youth in Jerusalem. He explained that the cheapest and most well-equipped schools are the Israeli schools. Many Palestinian families can only afford to send their children to Israeli schools, where the aim of the “Israeli curriculum is to erase the Palestinian nationalism from the minds of young people.” Sami Mshasha, speaking on behalf of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNWRA), also spoke of the occupiers’ attempts to “Israelize” the minds of Palestinian young people.  In the fourth and final plenary, Mohamed Salem Cherkaoui, of Rabat’s Bayt Mal al-Quds Al-Sharif, gave a brief history of Moroccan-Palestinian relations which began over 800 years ago. “Moroccans have thereby become the trusted neighbors of the Jerusalemites and Palestinians and these links have been upheld over time.” A representative from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ufuk Ulutas, noted that the situation is not being helped by the US. “The US has chosen to be part of the problem instead of part of the solution.” He added, “Any deal that is short of making East Jerusalem the capital of Palestine cannot and will not work.” Roberto Valent of the UNDP said the situation could not continue as it is now and urged for more efforts on the ground. “We cannot ask populations to remain in positions that require humanitarian assistance.” At the conclusion of the conference, Fouad Akhrif Mofa, speaking as a representative of Morocco, stated, “The success of this conference was a result of the prominence and knowledge of the expertise from various nations.”

By Anna Schaeffer Rabat – In Rabat, advocates continue to call for the end of healthcare access discrimination. A seventh iteration of the “nuit blanche” (white night) for cinema and human rights took place June 30-July 1, espousing the theme “The Right to Health.” Championing the cause for health as a universal and fundamental human right for citizens and immigrants alike, speakers stressed the necessity for social integration in public policy and healthcare reform.  For immigrants, access to care is essential, and advocates heavily reinforced the gravity of obstacles to healthcare and their consequences. Moroccan citizens, too, deserve equitable access to guaranteed quality care. The 2011 constitution clearly outlines “equal access” to healthcare, as well as social protection and medical coverage, as an inclusive and ubiquitous right for Moroccans. Speakers highlighted the cleft separating promises in the constitution and present-day healthcare: “There is a gap between the abundance of texts and the reality of the health system as it is lived by the citizen.” This year’s White Night for cinema and human rights, organized by the Association of Mediterranean Encounters on Cinema and Human Rights (ARMCDH), gathered members of the public on the esplanade of the National Library of the Kingdom of Morocco for its free outdoor film screening Saturday night. On Sunday, experts and prominent social actors convened for a roundtable discussion.  A variety of health-related topics experienced the spotlight during the weekend, from justiciability of healthcare to awareness and advocacy for individual rights. Article 25 of the International Declaration of Human Rights (IHRD) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights played important roles as foundational texts. Each White Night emphasizes a critical issue at the heart of public debate. Themes of past years include “The Arab Spring” (2012), “Women’s Rights” (2013), “Justice” (2014), “Migration” (2015), “Children’s Rights” (2016), and “The Right to Education” (2017).  Central to the mission of the White Night for cinema and human rights is the value of public engagement as Morocco moves forward, socially and legislatively, in its relationship with human rights.

Rabat – The development of Africa, the empowerment of African youth and the fight against corruption: these are the pinpoint ideas that King Mohammed VI emphasized during his recent statement to the 31st African Union Heads of State Summit, which opened Sunday in Nouakchott. Represented at the summit by Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, King Mohammed VI emphasized in his speech that efforts should be doubled to end corruption, the biggest obstacle to economic and social progress. The monarch acknowledged that the issue of corruption is a universal phenomenon, which exists in the “countries of the south as well as in those of the north,” adding that it may have serious effects on the Sustainable Development Goals “agreed by the international community.” Fight against corruption requires collaboration The sovereign said that the fight against corruption can be applied through “coordination of experience and the pooling of expertise.” The King also warned that this phenomenon  should “under no circumstances become a new form of dominance and pressure,” adding that “the well-being of our peoples hinges on prevention and on fostering a sense of responsibility in all actors in our societies.” The King also recalled Morocco’s efforts to curb corruption, emphasizing that the North African country has experienced the effects of corruption and is determined to apply all efforts to “overcome this scourge.” He also recalled Morocco’s ratification of the United Nations Convention against Corruption in 2007, an action that has proven fruitful for Morocco. The King said that the county had developed its “institutional and legal arsenal, thus aligning its legislation with international standard,” to curb the issue. He also recalled Morocco’s adoption of the National Strategy against Corruption in 2015 and the National Anti-Corruption Commission, which has been tasked with implementing the strategy. The enactment of the strategy and commission aims to ensure transparency in the country and reinforce the confidence of citizens and the international community in Moroccan institutions. “Having become a constitutional body, the National Authority for Probity and the Prevention and Combat of Corruption has recently seen its powers extended and its mission as a watchdog enhanced,” said the monarch. Corruption, not just a moral or ethical issue In his speech, the King said that corruption also has an economic cost, adding that this issue “puts a strain on the purchasing power of citizens, especially the poorest segments of society.” He added that the phenomenon also “perverts” the principles of democracy and “undermines the rule of law.” Addressing the attendees of the 31st Summit, the King said that corruption “affects the quality of life and promotes organized crime, insecurity and terrorism.” “In the relentless fight against corruption, some African countries—and their number is quite significant—are outperforming others, including some among the most developed nations. These are models which incite us to take the same path,” said the King. The sovereign concluded his statement by saluting the efforts of Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who was designated “Africa Anti-Corruption Champion” at the 30th AU Summit. “I know how determined he is and also how capable he is of convincing and uniting people in order to create the necessary momentum to root out corrupt practices at all levels,” said the King.

By Anna Schaeffer Rabat – Reactions towards the substantial sentences of Hirak Al Hoceima activists continue to spill from Morocco’s newswriters and parliamentarians alike. Last Tuesday, June 26, after nearly a year of consideration, Morocco’s judiciary delivered harsh sentences to 54 prosecuted activists. The long-deliberated sentences vary from 1 to 20 years in prison but collectively have been met with formidable backlash from NGOs and human rights organizations across the globe. As Morocco reels from the result, a movement to push for amnesty has gained traction. News outlet Akhbar Al Yaoum notes that the consensual statement of government’s majority parties, while expressing solidarity with those sentenced, balances that sentiment with careful avoidance of undermining the judiciary; essentially, the system sheds crocodile tears.  Additionally, the newspaper addressed the government’s inconsistent behavior in addressing protests from city to city: “They tolerated demonstrations in Casablanca, while they dispersed and arrested protesters in northern cities.”  The daily Al Massae reported today on a significant proposal developed by the Federation of the Democratic Left (FGD) party in response to the harsh verdicts. The suggested law advocates “a general amnesty for all persons detained within the framework of social movements of protest, which Morocco has known during the period from 28 October 2016 to 28 June 2018.” Not all public figures share this sentiment, however. President of the Prosecutor General Mohamed Abdennabaoui analyzed the activists’ sentences in an interview with newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia. Abdennabaoui held fast to the principle that the Criminal Chamber of Casablanca judges simply applied the law, and it is not his place to express support or disapproval for the independently-decided sentences. He did, nonetheless, reinforce the independence of the judiciary in Morocco with a strong statement that the age of “telephoned” sentences is gone: “It is not the judge who chooses the punishment, it’s the law.”

Rabat – The Dutch government has warned Moroccan-Dutch nationals to be alert when in Morocco after Morocco’s court decision to sentence several Moroccan activists to 20 years in prison. In a parliamentary meeting after the court decision, Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister Stef Blok asked Moroccan-Dutch activists to be careful when visiting Morocco, emphasizing that once in Morocco, police consider bi-nationals as Moroccans only. “Moroccan-Dutch activists traveling this summer in the region must be careful,” Blok said. The remarks made by Dutch officials caused Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Ministry to summon the country’s ambassador to Morocco, Désirée Bonis. Sources from the Moroccan ministry considered Blok’s remarks “unacceptable.” An anonymous source told Moroccan-based news outlets that Blok’s comments are “incomprehensible,” emphasizing that the statement is not compatible with the “bilateral partnership” between the two countries. The source also emphasized that Morocco rejects any “interference” in its domestic affairs. Morocco has refused Dutch comments on the Hirak Rif issue in the past. In April, Blok said in a press briefing during his meeting with Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita that the Moroccan government and its apparatus “had not been effective in responding to the grievances of the people who took to the streets.” Blok’s comments did not go unnoticed. In response, the Moroccan minister stated, “[The situation in the Rif] is not a diplomatic question, and cannot be subject to a diplomatic discussion; it is an internal affair, and under no circumstances can it be dealt with through discussions or interaction with foreign states.”  Bourita further explained that the country has a “transparent legal system that ensures equity and equality before the law.” The sentences given to Hirak Rif activists continue to receive harsh criticism from citizens, activists, international NGOs, and journalists. On Tuesday night, the Casablanca Court of Appeals pronounced verdicts against 54 activists. Sentences ranged from 1 to 20 years. The list of the defendants includes more than six journalists who were covering the social movement on the ground. In October 2016, the Hirak movement erupted in Al Hoceima province after the death of local fishmonger Mouhcine Fikri, who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while retrieving confiscated goods.

Rabat – FIFA has presented very positive figures on the use of the video assistant referee (VAR) at the second referee media briefing of the 2018 World Cup.   The speakers, Chairman of the FIFA Referees’ Committee Pierluigi Collina, FIFA’s Director of Refereeing Massimo Busacca, and VAR Refereeing Project Leader Roberto Rosetti, defended FIFA referees at the briefing on Friday, June 29, after analyzing refereeing matters over the 48-match group stage.  Collina said that the decisions taken by the referees without the VAR were 95% correct in 335 analyzed incidents and were 99.3% correct with the use of VAR. They asserted this percentage is “very, very close” to perfection. According to FIFA’s figures, VAR analyzed 335 incidents, including all goals, an average of 6.9 incidents analyzed per match.  There were 17 official video assistance appeals to change a decision, leading to 14 changed decisions and 3 confirmed decisions, after examining VAR. When asked how these figures were calculated, since video refereeing does not eliminate the subjectivity of refereeing interpretation, Collina replied, “We are here to analyze the work of the referees. These figures reflect our opinion which is relevant because it is our job. We think that 0.7% of decisions could have been taken a little better. “ Rosetti stressed that VAR does not decide cases, it only “recommends an on-field review.” The referee is the only one who can make decisions. “This is the difference between interpretation, subjective decisions and factual decisions. For all interpretations, we want the referee at the center of the decision-making.”  FIFA provided the following statistics on the group stage games:  A prior media briefing on refereeing at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia was held at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium on June 12. The media pressed FIFA officials on the readiness of the referees, assistant referees, and VAR.

Rabat – Morocco’s political parties that make up the ruling government coalition have reacted to Casablanca court’s decision to jail 54 Moroccan activists on Tuesday, June 26.  In a meeting held in Rabat on Saturday, the leaders of the major parties, including the Justice and Development Party’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, discussed the heavy sentences given to Hirak Rif activists earlier last week. After the meeting, the leaders issued a statement in which they expressed respect for “the independence of the judiciary” in Morocco. The coalition also insisted on the fair conditions of the activists’ trial, adding that the proceedings lasted about nine months, and the defense was allowed to present its views in accordance with the law. The statement said that all Moroccans are equal before the law and emphasized that the court’s decision is not “final” as the defendants have the right to appeal the sentences. The appeal, according to the statement, “gives hope to the accused and their families to review these sentences.” The statement also discussed “Al Hoceima, Manarat Al Mutawasit,” the development program launched by King Mohammed VI in 2015 for the benefit of the Al Hoceima province. The coalition said that they reacted “positively to the just demands expressed by the inhabitants of the region.” The government also promised to implement the royal directives to complete the project within the prescribed time. In 2017, King Mohammed VI sacked several ministers and officials for their dysfunction,and for their delayed implementation of the projects, which caused an uproar in the province. Al Hoceima witnessed tens of protests since 2016 after the death of local fishmonger Mouhcine Fikri, who was crushed to death by a garbage truck. The government promised that “the relevant departments and institutions have taken the necessary steps, which has resulted in the completion of many workshops and making significant progress for the rest.” On Tuesday, June 26, Casablanca’s court of appeal sentenced 54 activists and journalists for their involvement in “unauthorized protests” in the Al Hoceima protests. Four leaders of the protests, including Nasser Zefzafi received 20 years in prison, while some journalists received up to 5 years for covering the Hirak movement. The sentences received backlash nationwide, with celebrities, NGOs and journalists urging the “immediate” release of the activists decrying the social disparities in the region.

Rabat- The President of the Prosecutor General’s Office, Mohammed Abdennabaoui, has said that those who criticize the sentences given to the Hirak Rif activists should reconsider their views.  In interviews with radio channel and news site Med Radio, Abdennabaoui refused to comment on the sentences deemed “heavy” by prominent Moroccan citizens. He said that no one should have a say in the sentences because “the court already made its assessments, and has the mechanics by which it makes these assessments.” Abdennabaoui stressed that the decision was reasonable and built on proven facts. He added, “When the court says that the judgement was based on the decision of the public prosecution and that the public prosecution’s decision was correct, why would one keep blaming the public prosecution?” Arguments about a case should only be considered acceptable before the court rules its judgement, he said. “Arguments about a legal judgement should not take place in the streets but inside the court.” Abdennabaoui pointed out that the 20-year sentences delivered to four activists should not be seen as “heavy” when similar crimes would have warranted the capital punishment: “The court did not rule such judgment, however ruled a less severe punishment.” He concluded that “it is not the judge who chooses the punishment, it’s the law.” Prosecuting lawyer of the bar of Casablanca Abdelkebir Tabih has said that the trial of the activists was fair as well. On the other hand, the French Foreign Affairs Ministry criticized the verdict, emphasizing that the French government “is committed to respect public freedoms.” On Tuesday, June 26, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals sentenced Hirak leaders Nasser Zefzafi and Nabil Ahemjik, as well as activists Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid, to 20 years in prison. Zakaria Adehchour, Mohamed Haki, and Mohamed Bouhenouch received 15 years in jail, whereas Mohamed Jelloul, Karim Amghar, Salah Lackham, Omar Bouharass, Bilal Ahaddad, Jamal Bouhaddou, and Achraf Yakhloufi were sentenced to 10 years; other activists 1 to 5 years. Hirak activists were held for over a year, awaiting trial and verdict.
The court’s decision resulted in nationwide controversy and protests calling for the release of the individuals. Demonstrations took place on Wednesday in the capital of the Rif region, Nador; near the Parliament in Rabat; and on Boulevard El Oumame Al Moutahida in Casablanca. Meknes saw a protest on Friday.

Rabat- MPs Omar Balafrej and Mustapha Chennaoui of the Federation of the Democratic Left (FGD) party have introduced a draft law relating to a general amnesty for Hirak Al Hoceima activists in Parliament.  The proposal, tabled Friday, is based on Article 71 of the Moroccan Constitution, which stipulates that a general amnesty can be requested by Parliament.  On June 26, 54 activists in the Hirak Rif movement were given prison sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years for their involvement in the demonstrations that shook Al Hoceima province from 2016-2017. In accordance with his habit of keeping his followers updated with most of his Parliament activities, Balafrej published the draft law on his Facebook account. “We have submitted this proposal since it is part of our responsibilities to ask for a general amnesty relating to all social movements of the past two years,” said Balafrej. In Article 1 of the draft law, the FGD demands “the issue of a general amnesty for all acts related to protests that occurred in Morocco from October 28, 2016 to June 28, 2018”. The two MPs also called on the state to “compensate all the parties affected by these events,” according to Article 5. “All pronounced sentences shall be repealed and amnesty is considered an acquittal,” says Article 6. Along the same lines, a petition was launched on June 27 on Avaaz.org under the name “Petition to ask the Parliament to issue a law for a general amnesty for Hirak Al Rif’s detainees,” with a profile photo and a hashtag in Arabic meaning “Just arrest us all.” The petition reached more than 6,800 signatures so far and has been shared more than 4,700 times through Facebook, Twitter, and email. “In accordance with the Dahir n° 1-16-107 framing the right of petition, we, Moroccan citizens, demand from the Moroccan Parliament a general amnesty law for citizens condemned in the lawsuits of Hirak Al Rif, in accordance with the provisions of the Article 71 of the Constitution,” says the petition. Balafrej responded to the Avaaz petition, saying to H24info that he was “happy that citizens are asking MPs to make an effort, so we as Parliamentarians have done it. Now, we call on citizens to vote next time because many people who sign such petitions do not vote. In order to move forward, it is essential that citizens assume their responsibility by choosing Parliamentarians who can pass brave laws.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI addressed the 31st Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union (AU), which opened Sunday in Nouakchott. “Your Excellencies, Heads of State and Government, Your Excellency, the Chairperson of the AU Commission, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Today, to be African is to live in a land that is, in many areas, a breeding ground for expertise and talent – one that will make it possible to move resolutely forward and accelerate the pace of progress through a rational use of our resources. In this respect, the establishment of the African Continental Free Trade Area – AfCFTA – provides an exceptional framework through which to boost our trade relations. It paves the way for the anchoring of our economic development in an integrated space by enabling over a billion consumers to hone Africa’s competitive edge.  The institutional and financial reform process boldly started by my brother, His Excellency President Paul Kagame, will put our continent on the path towards significant, lasting and irreversible change.  This endeavour reflects real awareness, which tells us the time has come to build efficient institutions equipped with the best possible governance mechanisms. These institutions are the tools we need to reverse the spiral of poverty and ensure Africa’s emergence, every step of the way. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, We all know this: the current dynamic cannot really conceal an unpleasant reality. Far too many obstacles and difficulties are still undermining efforts that will lead to the emergence of Africa. One of the major hurdles is endemic corruption – a scourge that is eating away at our societies and that our Summit has rightly made its main theme.  Corruption is not just a moral or ethical issue. It has an economic cost as well. It puts a strain on the purchasing power of citizens, especially the poorest segments of society. In some sectors of activity, it represents 10% of the cost of production.  Corruption perverts the tenets of democracy and undermines the rule of law. It affects the quality of life and promotes organized crime, insecurity and terrorism. Everywhere we can see positive signs and sustained efforts to curb this scourge. The measures taken are bearing fruit: notable progress is palpable.  In the relentless fight against corruption, some African countries – and their number is quite significant – are outperforming others, including some among the most developed nations. These are models which incite us to take the same path.  The institutional reforms undertaken within the African Union will also contribute to the emergence of an anti-corruption culture. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  The Kingdom of Morocco has realized the devastating effects of corruption and has decided to spare no effort to overcome this scourge.  After ratifying the United Nations Convention against Corruption in 2007, the Kingdom of Morocco developed its institutional and legal arsenal, thus aligning its legislation with international standards.  To streamline and channel efforts properly, in 2015 the Kingdom of Morocco adopted a National Strategy against Corruption and set up the National Anti-Corruption Commission, which is tasked with implementing the strategy.  Spanning a 10-year period, the strategy aims to reverse the trend in a palpable, irreversible way by 2025, bolster citizens’ trust, promote integrity, improve the business environment and enhance the Kingdom’s international standing.  Having become a constitutional body, the National Authority for probity and the prevention and combat of corruption has recently seen its powers extended and its mission as a watchdog enhanced. In accordance with the new legislation, it will strengthen the multidimensional action carried out concomitantly in this field by the government, the judiciary and the said authority. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  The Africa of today is different from the Africa of yesterday.  The fight against this scourge requires the coordination of experiences and the pooling of expertise, building on a common vision shared by all stakeholders. Under no circumstances should this drive become a new form of dominance and pressure. The Africa of enclaves and trading posts is no more.  Corruption is not specific to Africa. Corruption is not a typically African scourge. It is a universal phenomenon. It exists in the countries of the South as well as in those of the North and it may well have an adverse impact on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals agreed by the international community.  I am delighted there is collective awareness and clear determination in this regard. They will make it possible to stem the phenomenon. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  Corruption is not inevitable in Africa. The fight against this scourge should be made a priority because corruption is the biggest obstacle to economic and social advancement and to the development of our young people.  The well-being of our peoples hinges on prevention and on fostering a sense of responsibility in all actors in our societies.  This major project requires sincere political commitment: it is possible to tackle corruption through sustained efforts on the part of government authorities and through the necessary civic engagement.  In order to stay the course in this fight and to make sure the current institutional reforms are successful, regular consultation will be necessary. This is the course of action to which everyone will subscribe and which will give our organization the authority it needs.  To this end, we must match words with deeds at each one of our meetings. I am sure His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari will leave his mark on the upcoming phase. I know how determined he is and also how capable he is of convincing and uniting people in order to create the necessary momentum to root out corrupt practices at all levels. By winning this battle, we will shape the Africa we want to bequeath to our children: a prosperous, solidarity-based Africa that is at peace with itself.
