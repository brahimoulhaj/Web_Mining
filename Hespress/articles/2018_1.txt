Rabat – Morocco’s introduction of a more flexible exchange rate system remains a sovereign decision regional and international institutions, Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, pointed out on Tuesday in Marrakech. Speaking at a regional conference held under the theme “Opportunity for All: Promoting Growth, Jobs, and Inclusiveness in the Arab World,” El Othmani asserted that the decision is not dictated by any party. “Morocco made its choice with the involvement of all national institutions concerned with this question, following a 10-year consultation,” he said. He also underlined the important role played by financial institutions, such as the IMF, at the regional and the international levels, adding that “the government is ready to study, build upon, and perhaps even adopt any successful experience.” He also highlighted Morocco’s economic reforms, calling on the participants of this conference to address major challenges, including youth unemployment, social justice, and economic reforms. The conference, organized by the IMF, the AMF, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social development and the government of Morocco, brings together high-level policymakers, corporate executives, academics, youth, media, and civil society representatives from countries in the Arab World and beyond to exchange experiences, lessons, and ideas on job creation through the utilization of new sources and sectors of growth. Key topics at the conference include: how to scale-up opportunities for women and youth by promoting entrepreneurship and innovation; embracing transparency and technology to unlock the region’s potential; and designing government policies to enable higher and more inclusive growth.

Rabat – Morocco and the European Union signed Wednesday in Brussels a document reinforcing their bonds on the basis of the agricultural agreement signed between the two parties. Underscoring the importance of the document, Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that, “the signing of this document is part of the strengthening partnership between Morocco and the EU” under the farm agreement between the two parties. According to Bourita, the document is an “important step in a process that will continue in the coming weeks to strengthen this important pillar of the relationship between Morocco and the European Union. The signing ceremony took place in the presence of Aziz Akhannouch, Minister of Agriculture and Ahmed Reda Chami, Morocco’s Ambassador to the EU. The partnership linking the two parties is underpinned by numerous economic and political agreements. The partnership around agriculture was reinforced by the launch of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) in 2003. Additionally, the European Union is Morocco’s leading trade partner, according to the EU. “In 2012 the EU imported goods from Morocco worth just over EUR 9 billion and exported EUR 7 billion worth to Morocco,” added the same source. In 2016, the EU imported more than EUR 3 billion worth of agricultural products from Morocco. EU data also indicated that 61 percent of all Moroccan exports go to the EU, and 52 percent of all Morocco’s imports come from the EU. Data also showed that Morocco’s trade with the EU is rapidly growing across several important non-agricultural sectors.

Rabat – Princess Lalla Meryem, chairperson of the National Observatory for Children Rights (ONDE), led the children’s vaccination operation and ceremony to present findings from the operation’s 30-year history in Marrakech on Wednesday. Dr. Khalid Lahlou, director of population at the health ministry, provided Lalla Meryem with the ministry’s results from 30 years of action under the national and regional children’s immunization program. Dr. Mohamed Benazzouz, an official with the national immunization program, also provided the princess with an analysis of the national vaccination schedule and program aims. Regional Health Director Khalid Zenjari presented Her Royal Highness with a regional breakdown of vaccination data. Afterwards, Lalla Meryem supervised the children’s vaccination operation and vaccinated a newborn against hepatitis B. Morocco is celebrating 30 years of implementing the national immunization program under the slogan “30 Years in Serving Children Vaccination Right.” Since the national immunization program was institutionalized in 1987, huge progress has been made in the health sector thanks to vaccines, especially against poliomyelitis and diphtheria; no cases of either disease have been reported since 1987 and 1991, respectively. In 2002, Morocco was certified by WHO/EMRO after eradicating neonatal tetanus under the WHO definition; meningitis cases have decreased by more than 85% since the introduction of the Haemophilus Influenza Type B vaccine in 2007. Immunization also contributed to reducing infant and child mortality, which has decreased by 95% for tetanus, 84% for measles, and 86% for whooping cough in children aged under a year.

Rabat – Appreciation of Morocco’s collection of intangible cultural heritage is steadily growing. The country is home to an impressive 16,000 historic sites, Minister of Culture and Cooperation, Mohamed Laaraj, said Tuesday in Rabat. Morocco’s cultural heritage is spread across all regions of the Kingdom, said the minister. Recently, eight new sites located in the cities of Oujda, Tangier, Youssoufia and Nador have been listed as national historic monument sites that are part of the UNESCO World Heritage List. The minister said that his department has been conducting several studies and surveys in order to better identify and promote the country’s cultural heritage. Through careful restoration of these historical sites, and by setting up several cultural partnerships with local associations, the ministry is planning to make these archaeological sites more open to public viewing. More than 20 annual festivals are organized across different regions of the Kingdom, with the aim of incrinching the cultural scene of Morocco. With the support of civil society organizations, these numerous cultural events and historic sites will likely encourage even more national and international tourism.

Rabat – Having arrived in Morocco on Monday, Tunisian Prime Minister Youssef Chahed during the high-level economic conference in Marrakech, pledged measures on promoting jobs and improving financial performances in Tunisia and the entire Arab world. Speaking at the conference on Tuesday dubbed “Opportunities for all: promoting growth, jobs and inclusiveness in the Arab world,” Chahed said that Arab economies have failed to tackle the issue of unemployment, especially among young people. According to Chahed, “quantitative growth are no longer effective. Citizens must feel developments in their daily lives.” The statements said by the Tunisian prime minister coincided with the social unrest in Tunisia over tax increases and other government policies in the country. Acknowledging recent difficulties in the country,  Chahed said that despite these difficulties, the Tunisian economy has been very successful, owed to the successful democratic transition. Chahed discussed the reforms undertaken by the Tunisian government to improve the business climate in the country, emphasizing that reducing unemployment in Tunisia might take time. Chahed stressed that development is a goal that can only be achieved in a healthy climate based on dialogue. The conference, which was opened on Monday in Marrakech, is aimed at addressing the challenges regarding global growth policies and to explore measures to expand the reforms to create more job opportunities for young people and women. The conference was also marked by the attendance of Saad Eddine El Othmani, Morocco’s Head of government and Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of International Monetary Fund (IMF). In a statement published in IMF official website, Lagarde said that she held talks with Chahed about the current unrest in Tunisia and “ Tunisia and the government’s efforts to improve the economy.” “We understand the frustration of the Tunisian people who have not yet felt the full economic benefits of their country’s political transformation. This process is difficult and takes time. Reforms are key for people to reach the point where they begin to see unemployment drop and growth pick up,” said Lagarde. Saad Eddine El Othmani, Morocco’s Head of Government said on Tuesday in Marrakech that Arab countries face great challenges., including the needs and expectations it generates especially among young people and women. According to El Othmani, the issue urges Arab countries to set up social and economic policies that meet the expectations of the population, particularly in the areas of education, health, social security and employment. El Othmani’s statements were reported by Maghreb Arab Press. El Othmani said that the problem of employment is a challenge for the countries of the region, adding that this issue “might worsen of the next few years as would social and territorial qualitative disparities which hamper economic growth and social cohesion in these countries.”

By Amaan Afzal Rabat –  The Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM) initiative was put into motion by the African Union Chairperson and Rwandan president, Paul Kagame on Sunday.  Supported by 23 African nations, the SAATM comes 30 years after the proposal of open African skies in the Yamoussoukro Declaration of 1988. As a result, chosen airlines from the 23 nations will be given the green light to operate under the unrestrictive traffic rights presented in the Yamoussoukro Decision (1999) – the evolution of the declaration proposed 11 years prior. The SAATM is the first flagship project for the African Unions Agenda 2063, “a strategic framework for the socio-economic transformation of the continent over the next 50 years”. The initiative is therefore expected to boost the collective African economy and connectivity, as described by the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) Vice President for Africa, Raphael Kuuchi, who attended the 30th annual African Union summit, in Addis Ababa, in support of the announcement: “The SAATM has the potential for remarkable transformation that will build prosperity while connecting the African continent. Every open-air service arrangement has boosted traffic, lifted economies and created jobs. And we expect no less in Africa on the back of the SAATM agreement.” The Single African Air Transport Market will increase the regularity of direct intra-African flights while simultaneously reducing ticket prices, encouraging tourism and free movement of peoples within the continent through added convenience – a goal the AU has long sought-after, as currently only 40% of tourists visiting Africa come from within the mainland. Combined with recent moves by certain AU states in relaxing their visa rules to all arriving Africans, it will provide a hassle-free pan-African travel process, for the continents citizens. An IATA study conducted in 2014 revealed that the liberalization of 12 key African countries air routes could generate a $1.3 billion dollar jump to Africa’s annual GDP, as well as creating over 150,000 jobs for its people. In addition, the initiative will open up trading possibilities, attracting potential new businesses and will improve competitiveness between African airline companies. “By committing to break down these various barriers, we will send a tremendous signal in Africa and beyond that it is no longer business as usual,” said President Kagame at the AU summit. The SAATM seems to be an overwhelmingly positive endeavour, however, according to Raphael Kuuchi, Africa will not reap the rewards until “effective implementation” is carried out by the 23 countries in support of the move and until more of the 32 who have yet to join, do so. Chairperson Paul Kagame spoke on this matter: “Scale is essential. We must create a single continental market, integrate our infrastructure, and infuse our economies with technology,” he continued. “No country or region can manage on its own. We have to be functional, and we have to stay together.” The Rwandan president concluded the annual summit by addressing Africa’s youth: “Elders should be able to enjoy the pleasure of telling you how hard they had it at your age, so you don’t take things for granted, and are inspired to work even harder.” He continued, “too many Africans come of age in the same conditions as their parents and grandparents, and sometimes the hardships endured are even worse. Our job is to make sure that every generation in Africa, enjoys a better life than the previous one.” “We cannot build Africa without you.”

Rabat- At the age of 23, Samia Haimoura successfully set the Moroccan flag at the top of Kilimanjaro, the highest summit in Africa, becoming the youngest Moroccan to do so. The young mountaineer is a fresh graduate from Al Akhawayn University, which made her 7-day journey possible along with her team of porters, cooks, and guides.  “This experience taught me to be grateful for the simplest things,” she said.  “It started with a lot of excitement and it ended with a great sense of accomplishment and self-satisfaction. However, the most important steps, the ones we rarely talk about, are those between the beginning and the end, ” the young climber added.   After successfully climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, a high point of 5.895 meters (19.341 feet), she is now determined to conquer the Mount Elbrus in Europe, Mount Denali in North America, Mount Aconcagua in South America, Mount Vinson in Antarctica and Mount Kosciuszko in Australia. After graduating from college, Samia Haimoura started her internet services company, Securella GmbH, operating in Germany. Her app, Securella, strives to protect women in the fight against sexual harassment.  Haimoura said that her dream is to contribute to creating smarter cities with a higher level of urban security through the power of technology.

By Julie Luecke Rabat – As South Korea bans anonymous crypto-trading and India puts accounts of cryptocurrency investors on hold, the value of cryptocurrency plummets.  Bitcoin, which was being traded for USD 20,000 at its peak in December is now worth less than USD 10,000. A lesser-known cryptocurrency, Longfin, is also down 15% in value. Attractive for many reasons, one of which being their prevalence in advertisements on social media, cryptocurrency is still a developing market. Because there is a certain fragility already associated with this intangible currency, financial advisors are recommending to be extremely careful investing in cryptocurrency at the moment. “It’s no secret that cryptocurrencies are a very volatile market but with countries such as China and India making statement moves and even fining some investments on tax evasion, it is causing the entire industry to re-evaluate,” said Elliott Parkhouse, Senior Financial Planner at Guardian Wealth Management, a financial advising firm based in the United Arab Emirates and working throughout the MENA region. It has been rumored that more and stricter regulations may be implemented at the G20 summit in March. These rules would make the cryptocurrency market much more stable, and would incline financial advisors and investors alike to look more kindly upon the currently dangerous market, though it is unclear what impact the regulations would have on the value of different cryptocurrencies. Until then, though, it is advised that investors stay away from the fickle market. “Cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology definitely have a future in modern society and are extremely useful for the exchange of information and goods, however until the market is regulated they should be approached with caution,” said Mr Parkhouse. While it might be enticing to jump on the bandwagon, especially with the prevalence of cryptocurrency ads on social media and their consistent presence in (both positive and negative) stories on the news, Mr. Parkhouse reminds investors: “I would be worried about investing in a company that just popped up on your Facebook feed. If you decide to buy virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, do your research and use a legitimate seller.”

Rabat – The Trump administration announced Monday that it was resuming admissions of refugees from 11 unnamed countries — deemed to have a “high-security risk,” — but with added security screening.  However, advocates for migrants and refugees fear that this policy will have little effect. Hans Van de Weerd, a senior official of the International Rescue Committee, said, “This administration disproportionately targets Muslims,” adding that “today’s announcement does not change this for the better.” Also Read: U.S Supreme Court Partially Reinstates Trump Travel Ban Citing “law enforcement sensitivities,” Trump’s administration refused to identify the 11 countries it considers as “high-risk,” although advocates for refugees’ rights believe that they are Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  According to senior administration officials, applicants from these 11 countries will then face new vetting measures to assist the “fight against terrorism.” “It’s critically important that we know who is entering the United States,” said US Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen.  “The measures include additional screening for certain nationals, and a periodic review and update of the refugee high-risk country list and selection criteria.” “These additional security measures will make it harder for bad actors to exploit our refugee program, and they will ensure we take a more risk-based approach to protecting the homeland,” Nielsen added.

The list of “high-risk” countries was last updated under Obama’s administration in 2015. it is compiled from a number of sources, including countries that are the subject of Travel Warnings by the US Department of State and other US Government sources.

Rabat – The Spanish Foreign Minister, Alfonso Dastis, reaffirmed that Morocco has reassured Madrid that all oil exploration operations will be conducted in Morocco’s territorial waters.  The minister’s statements were made on Tuesday in Madrid after he met with Canary Islands President Fernando Clavijo, who has been expressing his concerns over the Moroccan government’s authorization for an Italian energy company to carry out offshore oil and gas exploration.    In an effort to avoid possible tensions between the neighbors, Dastis stressed that he is “in permanent contact” with Moroccan officials in order to avoid any “misunderstandings and surprises,” reported Spanish news outlet Euro Press.    Speaking about Spanish-Moroccan diplomatic ties, Dastis emphasized that all topics relating to Moroccan-Spanish relations are treated in a spirit of, “good neighborliness and common interests.”   In December 2017, Morocco’s National Bureau of Hydrocarbons and Mines signed an agreement with Italy’s ENI for offshore operations near Tarfaya. The agreement raised the concern of some in the Canary Islands due to the close proximity of Moroccan waters to the islands which depend heavily on tourism.

Rabat – French police arrested Tariq Ramadan, a prominent Islamic scholar, on Wednesday after two women filed complaints against him last year, accusing him of rape. Ramadan was taken into police custody by the Paris police as “part of a preliminary inquiry” into the rape and assault allegations,confirmed RTL radio, as reported by the France Agence Presse. The Oxford professor denies the allegations, claiming that they are part of a”campaign of lies launched by [his] adversaries.” For years, many French writers, journalists, and theologians have been skeptical of his influence and have pointed out the flagrant disparities between Ramadan’s speeches in Europe and the Muslim World, accusing him of a double discourse.  Elsewhere, however, Ramadan enjoys admiration from his many followers. His debates have been viewed millions of times on Youtube, very rarely appearing to lose arguments with his opponents. The professor, fluent in French, English, and Arabic, often preaches about a future “Euro-Islam,” building bridges between Islam and the West. He has been a member of various major cultural institutions, including the British Foreign Office and Oxford University where he has been teaching since 2009, and his books have received glowing reviews in international publications like the New York Times. But soon after the rape accusations surfaced, Oxford University issued a statement that “by mutual agreement and with immediate effect,” Ramadan would take a leave of absence from his position as Professor of Contemporary Islamic studies.  Ramadan was accused of rape by author and former Salafi Henda Ayari, who accused him of raping her in 2012 on the sidelines of a congress of the Union of Islamic Organizations of France. Another woman stepped forward shortly thereafter and claimed she was raped by the Swiss scholar in a French hotel in 2009.

Rabat – “Corruption is a plague we must fight,” says Justice Minister Mohamed Aujjar, explaining that his department is working on 61 projects to battle corruption at the legislative and institutional levels. Though Transparency International’s 2016 Corruption Perceptions Index rank the rate of corruption in Morocco below the global average score of 43, the kingdom scored 37 points and was placed 90th out of 176 countries. In Morocco, “traditional politicians fail to tackle corruption, leading people grow cynical,” says the report’s authors. Worst still, according to the Minister of Economy and Finance, corruption not only causes citizen confidence to taper off, but also “blocks the path to better economic performance.” “Corruption is rife in state and economic institutions and the economy. And despite the government’s rhetoric on combating corruption, it has a mixed record on enforcement,” Freedom House states, further highlighting the foul play of power and money in Morocco. Aujjar wants to put an end to this epidemic by “adopting practical steps and approaches,” including the consolidation and restructuring of the departments responsible for financial crime, both in terms of infrastructure and the workforce. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice is also developing anti-corruption training sessions and drafting an amendment to the Penal Code in order to harmonize it with the United Nations Convention on the fight against corruption. Likewise, Aujjar says that his department is developing an electronic application to monitor the criminal record and launching “an alert number” on corruption. These policies also include the modernization of the judicial system, training bodies to  specialize in corruption crimes and analyze legal and judicial data related to corruption. Among these measures, Aujjar mentioned the promotion of transparency and the right to information, the modernization of administrative procedures and the simplification of access to justice. “Building citizen trust in government and public institutions” is one of the main objectives of Aujjar’s policy. In addition, the minister said that his department is studying the National Strategy against Corruption, which strengthens the criminal justice system, in collaboration with the departments of the Interior and Public Service, the Royal Gendarmerie, the General Directorate of National Security, the Customs and Taxes Administration and the Office of the High Commissioner for Water and Forests. Regarding international cooperation, Aujjar said that the ministry works in collaboration with several international bodies, to incorporate their experience in the fight against corruption, including through technical assistance and training of human resources. On an ambitious note, Aujjar claimed that the government has developed a national plan to end all forms of corruption by 2050.

Washington DC – The election of Morocco to head the very powerful Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union (AU) is a significant win for Rabat.  This event is noteworthy for several reasons chief among them the vital role this organ plays in resolving inter-African conflicts. Morocco’s diplomatic push into Africa and its armed force’s major role in peace missions around the continent have finally bear fruits. According the AU’s website, the PSCV is “the standing organ of the AU for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts. It is a key element of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA), which is the umbrella term for the main AU mechanisms for promoting peace, security and stability in Africa.” By forcing Algeria out of the PSC leadership, a position it held since 2013, Morocco deprives its regional “rival” of a platform that has been used to push for anti-Morocco propaganda within the AU. It seems that Bouteflika’s Soviet-era diplomacy cannot keep up with the fast-moving Afro-centered foreign policy agenda led by King Mohammed VI. Algerian Ambassador Smail Chergui who held Commissioner for Peace and Security title for four years was known for his extreme anti-Morocco positions. His departure from this position opens the door for the AU to play a more constructive role in the Western Sahara conflict. In fact, this change at the helm of the PSC will likely pave the way for a return of an African involvement in the UN efforts to resolve this long-simmering territorial dispute between Morocco and Algeria. As Algerian diplomatic presence in Africa and around the world dims, its anti-Morocco goals and policies becomes more vicious. In fact, recent statements by Algerian Prime Minister and his Foreign Minister accusing Morocco of “money laundering and drug trafficking”  have shown that the Bouteflika government spends much efforts chasing Morocco rather than promoting its own nation. Algeria’s diplomatic failure in Libya and its security breakdowns in Mali have exposed its limited reach in the African continent at a time when Morocco have shown a  broad development interests in its relations with the continent. Moroccan banks, telecommunication companies and light industry firms have increased the Kingdom’s commercial presence in Africa, which in turn have led to growing political and diplomatic cooperation between Morocco and other AU members. Furthermore, Algeria’s inhumane campaign of summarily deporting hundreds of African migrants from its territory and “dropping” them on the borders of Mali and Niger has further damaged the reputation of the North African nation within the AU. Mali’s recent recall of its Ambassador in Algiers for consultation is the latest setback of the Bouteflika policy in Africa. In fact, Both Mali and Niger have expressed, on several occasions, their deep displeasure with the mistreatment of their citizens at the hands of Algerian security forces. On the other hand, Morocco has to undertake a campaign to help African immigrants to regulate their status in the country thus protect their rights and help them integrate into Moroccan society. While Morocco’s ascendance to the chairmanship of the PSC and its African focused international relations are key to the long-term strategic positioning of the Kingdom in Africa and a testament to the success of its new diplomatic approach, the competency of its diplomats and the overall foreign policy of the Moroccans  has yet to be thoroughly challenged. Now it is the time to double the efforts and not to run victory laps.

Fez – Without a doubt, technology has permeated every aspect of our daily lives. The leap has been so giant going from smart TV, to smartphones, smart recording contact lenses, tiny spying cameras, nano devices and robots, artificially intelligent human-like beings, and even emotionally intelligent sex dolls! What the near future of AI will unveil would be way more astounding! Whether we like it or not, the age we live in today is by far the most technologically advanced era in human history (unless the advocates of ancient nuclear and space technology come up with strong evidence). Facing the twenty-first century challenges and embracing the radical changes that they impose on our way of life (rather than evading them like an ostrich with its head in the sand) is what can make us immune and in line with the technological evolution of humanity. One of the most ubiquitous technological inventions nowadays is the smartphone; a revolutionary invention allowing connectivity to billions of people around the world and pulling the ‘edges’ and boundaries of the globe closer and closer. Not only that, smartphones can be very effective learning tools if properly integrated in the classroom. Though it is called a phone, and calling is only a very minor function of smartphones. A smartphone is a powerful portable computer that can be a very effective learning device in any classroom. In the developed world, educationalists started theorizing on the usefulness of smartphones in the classroom and measuring their benefits and disadvantages right after the first touch-screen phone appeared in the market. What they found is that the benefits definitely outweigh and outnumber the disadvantages. Here are some of the primary benefits: 1- Smartphones allow connectivity to the Internet for research and referencing. 2- They allow the installation and use of educational applications (dictionaries, flashcards, etc.) 3- Students can snap a picture of the lesson, vocabulary, homework or whatever scribbled on the whiteboard/ blackboard instead of wasting time on copying. 4- Smart phones can encourage collaborative learning. Students can share homework, useful links, dates and schedules with each other via email or text messaging. As for teachers, the use of smartphones is even more important since they allow instant access to a huge amount of information, archives, online resources and video and audio materials that can be used to enrich the lesson. In light of these facts, the decision by the Moroccan Ministry of National and Higher Education to ban the use of phones in the classroom by students and teachers alike is indeed unfathomable if not profoundly embarrassing! We understand that the use of smartphones in the classroom can have some downsides which can be addressed in many ways. But the out-of-the-blue hasty decision to ban smartphones altogether by the ministry, which is supposed to encourage innovation and the integration of untraditional learning methods, is indeed retrogressive. Our classrooms are in dire need of audio-visual materials and technological devices that facilitate learning and bring it to life instead of the conventional talk-and-chalk method which renders the classroom a boring dungeon. As teachers and education practitioners, we are fed up with the unsustainable and volatile personal decisions of ministers who come and go leaving a lot of frustration and despair eating up the hearts of the real knights on the battleground.  Education is not a sector for experimenting with uncalculated and unstudied decisions. Education is the future and destiny of the whole nation.

Rabat – Disguising themselves as “stranded migrants,” Moroccan nationals who fought for ISIS in Libya and are now pleading to be repatriated by their home country after the jihadist group was defeated. This represents a threat to the stability of the country, warns the American think tank, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.  In a report entitled “The Others: Foreign Fighters in Libya,” the think tank notes that, to date, Libya stands as the fourth-largest foreign fighter mobilization in global jihadist history. Based on open sources and governmental figures, between 625 and 1500 Tunisians fought with ISIS in Libya, followed by between 58 and 300 Moroccans and 130 Algerians.  Approximately 1,000 women from Tunisia, Chad, Australia, Belgium, Egypt, Eritrea, France, Kenya, Morocco, Niger, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, and Syria have also fought among the ranks of the terrorist group. Moroccan nationals represent the second largest influx of foreign fighters to Libya, the return of these ideologically brainwashed individuals to their home country signals a cause for alarm, the study concludes. “Returning foreign fighters could bolster already simmering insurgencies, while building up recruitment and homegrown networks in countries without much history of jihadist activism.” Recent warnings by officials in both Morocco and Nigeria show that the Islamic State is still looking for ways to exploit various regional weaknesses. The authors of the report worry that the terrorist group is exploiting migrants stuck in Libya who are in the process of being repatriated to their home countries.  Morocco’s security services, in coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, postponed the return of Moroccan nationals in order to identify these individuals and whether they should be deemed a threat. According to Moroccan counter-terrorism law, returning fighters will be arrested, unless they use forged documents allowing them to re-enter unnoticed.   Abdellah Rami, a specialist on Islamist groups, previously told Morocco World News that these fighters can present a number of threats to Moroccan security, reaffirming the report’s findings. “Some elements can represent a danger if they are not tracked and can manage to get forged documents, blend in with Moroccan in Europe, and enter the country,” he said. Rami explained that these lone wolves might seek to carry out attacks on Moroccan soil.  Another “troubling” possibility, according to Rami, is that some of those Moroccans might be recruited by regimes which are not on good terms with the kingdom and used in a way that serves lobbyist interest. ISIS fighters might also look to establish terrorist networks in Morocco, although this scenario is highly improbable, Rami explained. Regional and international security services, including Morocco’s domestic teams, are on high alert for ISIS’ retreat in the Middle East and are ready for the possibility of the return of the group’s foreign fighters to their native countries. However, while many Salafi Jihadist groups support Al Qaeda in Morocco, ISIS does not enjoy  the same advantage. This situation, coupled with the fact that its elements are under tight security surveillance, makes it difficult for them to grow.

By Amaan Afzal Rabat – UNHCR Special Envoy and movie star Angelina Jolie visited the largest refugee settlement in the Middle East, Za’atari Refugee Camp in Mafraq, Jordan, for the fifth time in an almost seven-year-long civil conflict.  The actress-turned-human rights activist used the visit to call for a peaceful political resolution to the Syrian dispute that respects the human rights and dignity of all Syrians, including those displaced. The camp, situated less than an hour drive from the Syrian border is home to more than 80,000 displaced Syrians – but this is only a fraction of the 5.48 million who fled their land for the prospect of a peaceful life. During her stay, Angelina met with father-of-six Abu Suhaib, who spoke of his exile from the bedlam and bloodshed of Syria’s Dara province in 2013 and of his dream for his family: UNHCR Special Envoy Angelina Jolie in @ZaatariCamp, Jordan today: No negotiated peace without human rights and dignity for the Syrian people. Full statement: https://t.co/TEAhotNUBp pic.twitter.com/zLWSiFXilw — UN Refugee Agency (@Refugees) January 28, 2018  “All I want is to live with them somewhere they can study, become engineers or doctors, and serve the country that takes them with all honour and loyalty. From everything we see, it’s difficult to hope that Syria will go back to the way it was before.” The Special Envoy did not go alone, instead accompanied by her two daughters, ages 13 and 11, who had the opportunity to interact with young Syrian girls at a UN-run, in-camp community centre: “My daughters Zahara and Shiloh asked to come with me today,” said the Special Envoy. “They’ve spent time today speaking and playing with children their own age who have been forced from their homes, whose family members have been killed or have disappeared, and who are struggling with trauma and illness, but who at the end of the day are just children with the same hopes and rights as children in any nation.” The young Syrian girls spoke of education as “their greatest source of hope for the future” and as a result are all members of an after-school learning initiative.  Jolie spoke of overburdened host countries such as Jordan being testament to the global lack of solidarity with refugees. Last year, the UNHCR was 50 percent funded in its mission to aid refugees and are only seven percent funded this year at a no-less critical point in the crisis. Having exhausted all of their savings over the arduous seven-year struggle, most Syrian refugees now survive on less than 3 USD per day, dropping below the poverty line.   “UNCHR does not have the funds to provide in full even the most basic necessities for survival for many families,” said Jolie. This harsh truth has left scores of Syrians with insufficient food and inadequate shelter to protect them through the winter time. Correspondingly, many girls are unshielded from marriage at a young age, for the purpose of financial stability. Despite the clear benefits of humanitarian aid, Jolie recognizes that it is merely the treatment and not the final cure for the crisis.  “No one wants to get off aid more than a Syrian family,” she said. “A viable political settlement is the only way to create the conditions for Syrians to be able to return to their homes, to end the human suffering and the strain on host countries.” Given the countless human rights violations endured by the people of Syria over the last seven years, the UNHCR Special Envoy made the following statement to a news conference in Za’atari Camp: “We should never forget that the war began with demands by Syrians for greater human rights. Peace in their country has to be built on that. It cannot be built on impunity for the targeting of civilians by all sides of the conflict, the bombing of schools and hospitals, barrel bombs, torture, chemical weapons and rape used as a weapon of war.” “So that is my message to the international community today: yes, of course, please do more to help meet the needs of desperate Syrian families and the countries hosting them. But above all please provide the leadership and strength needed to negotiate a principled end to this senseless war – without sacrificing the dignity and human rights of Syrian families. That is non-negotiable.”

By Mohamed Amine Rhaz Rabat – In an interview with beIN Sport, Moroccan international footballer Hachim Mastour discussed his return to AC Milano and his wish to participate in the 2018 World Cup.  “I was overwhelmingly happy to return to Milano, as it is the club where I grew up and learnt a lot,” said Mastour. “I have good relations with the players, especially with the ones I knew beforehand, and they gave me a lot of good advice.” In the same interview, the midfielder discussed his experience playing against the legendary Brazilian player Neymar: ”It was an unforgettable day… I remember when I saw him, I was very happy,” he said. “I was shy at first, but after that, we kicked the ball a little and it was a fascinating experience.” Mastour explained that they “have the same sponsor, and he is the one who organized this challenge.It was amazing.” The 19-year-old stated that he followed his heart and family in deciding to play for Morocco’s national team.  Mastour highlighted his playing experience for Morocco. “I chose to play for Morocco at the age of 16, and it was a great honor for me.”  “I hope to play with them again in the World Cup,” he added.  Mastour thinks that Morocco’s current grouping is difficult, but believes the Moroccan national team can qualify to the second round. “There are excellent players who can display incredible performance,” he said. In addition, Mastour keeps in touch with other players on the national team, “I always talk with Benatia and Omar El Kaddouri, and I consider them unique players.”

Rabat – The Moroccan government has announced that it will not renew its IMF Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL). The deal, signed in 2011, will end in July 2018. According to the IMF, the PLL “provides financing to meet actual or potential balance of payment needs of countries with sound policies, and is intended to…help resolve crises under wide-ranging situations.” Morocco appealed to IMF’s financial and structural support in 2011, when, in the feverish and uncertain political situation marked by the Arab Spring, the country sought to maintain investor trust , particularly that of FDI (Foreign Direct Investment). According to La Tribune Afrique, Morocco, feels confident enough to decline IMF’s offer to extend the PLL deal, in part due to the new exchange rate initiated by regime on January 15.  It should be noted that although Morocco contracted the USD 3.47 billion included in the PLL in 2011, renewing it twice in order to readily face any eventual economic crisis or market shock, the government reports that it actually never used the allowance.  On Sunday, 21 January, IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde arrived in Morocco, where she was due to chair a conference on IMF economic policies in the MENA region. Lagarde, it was reported, came to Morocco hoping to address alleged frustrations brought on by IMF policies in the region andfind common ground with MENA government representatives. The two-day conference was titled “Opportunities for All: Growth, Employment and Inclusion in the Arab World,” with the aim of assessing IMF policyand deriving new pathways for MENA growth. Speaking to the press on the sidelines of the Marrakech conference, Moroccan Finance Minister Mohamed Boussaid explained that the efficiency and the effectiveness with which the country’s current exchange rate regime is implemented are such that the liquidity and precautionary line is no longer needed. “There is no need to renew it [PLL]. The macroeconomic situation and the present indicators are satisfactory,” Boussaid said, adding, however, that “this does not mean that our good relationship with the IMF should not continue.” For his part, the governor of Morocco’s Central Bank reiterated the government’s stance on the PLL, underlining that Morocco’s economy is now moving toward a more “flexible line” for “stronger economies,” rather than the “liquidity line” intended for economies in crisis or transition. He added that Morocco’s objective is to maintain eligibility for the IMF’s Flexible Credit Line (FCL), conceived for countries with strong policy frameworks and well-performing economies; this credit line was designed for crisis mitigation or prevention. As for the IMF delegates, they saluted Morocco’s handling of the PLL. They also praised Morocco’s current exchange rate regime. Jihad Azour, the IMF director for the MENA region, reported, “It is a reform that is doing well. It allows Morocco to attract investors and fully play its financial role in the MENA region.”

Rabat – The intense and fixated focus on Morocco’s bid, particularly by the United States’ giant media cooperation’s, suggest a hidden agenda, an uneasiness, in the highest instances of the decision-making process, with an “unwelcome” ‘late bidder’, a serious challenger to the North American bid from which FIFA was happily expecting high financial returns. So, with things getting noisier as we await FIFA’s final decision this summer in June, it comes as a great surprise that the organization, which claims integrity and impartiality throughout the whole bidding process, is rather fixating, in quite a biased way, all its instructions and warnings on Morocco alone. FIFA appears to be behaving towards Morocco like an angry parent who, although she does not overtly say it, clearly suggests in her gestures, temper, and mood swings, the child that she prefers. And Morocco’s bid does not appear to be that preferred child. Morocco’s 2026 bid is getting all the wrath of the angry parent, while the North American children are left unattended to, a suggestion that they can behave themselves without being told so. And so, as Morocco’s 2026 bid meets with the wrath of the United States’ media juggernauts (The New York Times and The Associated Press have made their calling to scrutinize the potentials of Morocco’s 2026 bid), FIFA, too, rather than act in the professional spirit of impartiality, appears to be picking sides. This is at least what FIFA’s letter to football federations appeared to suggest. Last Friday, in a letter that she addressed to the 211 federations of football nations, FIFA’s Secretary General Fatma Samoura reportedly “warned” all the national federations against any tendency to accept bribery and kindred offers from either of the two contenders. Ms. Samoura’s letter allegedly warned federations against accepting any support “which may unduly affect the integrity of the bidding procedure.” “All members of the FIFA councils and delegates of the FIFA Congress should take their personal short-listing or selection decision on the basis of their own assessment of the merits of the bid” she wrote in the said letter, adding that: “Therefore, all officials are requested to refrain from expressing publicly their personal opinion about the merits of one or more bids during the bidding procedure.” Given the massive public support that Morocco has been getting from CAF officials, including the organization’s president, and many national federation presidents across the continent, it is enough to see in these “warnings” a desire, however veiled, to dissuade African federations from showing public support for the kingdom’s bid. Even The New York Times, an outlet that published, late last year, a rather derogatory report about Morocco’s potentials for organizing the tournament in 2026, acknowledged this time , though reluctantly, FIFA’s bias. “The six-page document… appears to take aim at Morocco which is challenging a joint North American bid”, outlet wrote in a recent report on FIFA’s “Warnings”, while adding, as the reporter cited a person said to be directly involved in the discussions, that “FIFA reminded Morocco specifically about its bidding rules.” Morocco, as it happens, is being singled out as the only contender susceptible to “misbehavior”. Playing an unneeded corruption card? FIFA may be taking precautions against possible corruption or vote-buying. But should that mean singling out one of the contenders as the only side that could bribe? The corruption allegations that tarnished previous World Cup bids are no secret to football fans. Over the last decades, almost all bidding procedures were mired in corruption and vote-trading. It was that reputation of corruption that led FIFA to change the bidding regulations. Now, for the 2026 edition, instead of a restricted circle of FIFA officials, all 211 football nations will have a defining voice in choosing the winning bid. So, given the current rules, FIFA may not have welcomed the fact that many of the concerned African delegates have manifested public support for Morocco. Or, rather, is FIFA, with the reported claim that a North American win would yield more financial benefits, leaning towards a North American 2026 World Cup? That, no one can tell—at least for now. But singling out one party and making it bear the brunt of a past tradition—Morocco was, after all, acting Roman in Rome—is a sure cause for alarm. The scramble for organizing the World Cup is perhaps the most exciting moment for football federations, especially when they are bidding to host the game’s ultimate tournament. Sadly, it can also be an occasion for defamation campaigns, corruption, and show of force— a concert of public dissuasion in which, more often than not, those with giant media and powerful lobbies almost always prevail. In a recent interview, as The Associated Press tried to reproach Morocco for “corruption” in its past bids, Hicham Al Amrani, chief executive of the 2026 bid, said: “We do not have anything to do with the past as Morocco. Do not make comment on past bids for which we were not part of.” But El Amrani’s statement has clearly not been heard.

Rabat – African Football Confederation (CAF) first vice president Kwesi Nyantakyi has lauded Morocco’s administration and hospitality during the African Nations’ Championship (CHAN). The vice president said that CAF Executive Committee commended “the excellent organization of 2018 CHAN.” In an interview with Moroccan newspaper Assabah, Nyantakyi said that Morocco has “honored Africa,” showing the world its ability to orchestrate such an event, maximize its infrastructure, and demonstrate its hospitality.  According to Nyantakyi, the success of 2018 CHAN is a proof that Morocco can organize major football events, referring to 2026 World Cup. This is, he added, “the project of an entire continent.”  The vice president echoed remarks made by CAF President Ahmad Ahmad, who told Assabah that “Morocco is capable of organizing the 2026 World Cup. Ahmad has also expressed his satisfaction with the well-organized competition, which is currently taking place in Morocco. According to Ahmad, the members of the CAF organizing committee, members of the executive bureau, football teams, and referees have unanimously praised Morocco’s excellent organization and preparedness, from the quality of the football stadia and arbitration procedures to the quality of local infrastructure and hotels.

Rabat – Suffering from a shortage of manpower, The Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français (SNCF) recruited about 2,000 “inept” Moroccans as contract workers in the 70s.   Fifty years later, 800 of them spoke out against the injustices they endured and sued the SNCF for more than EUR 600 million. In 1963 France and the newly independent Kingdom of Morocco signed an agreement allowing France to recruit about 2,000 Moroccans to work in the French railway system. They signed their contracts at the National Office of Immigration in Casablanca, and then “four days of boat and train,” they arrived at the station of Austerlitz in Paris, according to Agence France Presse (AFP). “It was an unforgettable journey with nine other Moroccans” says Abdelghani Azhari, a Moroccan employee for the SNCF who found himself in Achères, in the suburbs of Paris. “The work was  hard in the winter but when it’s hot it’s even worse,” Aziz had told AFP in 2015. Young and strong and foreign, the workers were on duty whenever French employees refused to work. “We worked during Christmas and other holidays,” said Abdel, who left his village in the Atlas to work for the SNCF. “We worked like sheep,” another worker explained. “I bowed my head because I had a family to feed.” One worker said that he worked in the trails as a watchdog, a switcher, a miner and a greaser, exactly the same as the French employees. Employees from both nationalities were equal in all ways except that for the SNCF, “Jack” was worth more than “Ahmed.” “We did the same job but we did not have the same benefits as our French colleagues for retirement, health insurance or paid leave,” says a worker, who was neutralized by the French Government but  he was “much too old” to get the “status” as a French worker. He told AFP that he has been denied several times from passing internal examinations. To date, he still wonders why he was heldin the same position while his French colleagues could work for better jobs within the SNCF. Around their fifties, most of the Moroccan railway workers felt “worn out,” reports AFP. “I could not take it anymore. From head to toe, my body had had enough,” Aziz said. He informed the SNCF and left in 2010. He explained to AFP that the SNCF offered him a bonus of EUR 16,000, only to face a “big shock” later, finding out that the amount of his basic pension did not surpass EUR 1,000. After many referrals and more than ten years of hearings, 848 Moroccan employees sued the SNCF in September 2015. The company appealed. Now, with tired, worn faces and wrinkles boring deeply into their skin, about 800 of the Moroccan railway workers hope to be compensated on Wednesday for the injustices they suffered at the hands of the SNCF. They are suing forEUR 628 million, or EUR 700,000 per applicant, as compensation for the various prejudices they endured in their training, career and even retirement. According to the SNCF, these figures are “exorbitant.” During the review of their file in May 2017, a former worker explained that “we are here to defend our honor” because “the SNCF took advantage of us.” Meanwhile, the SNCF expressed its “deepest respect” to its former Moroccan workers but denied to have “treated them any differently from its French workers.” “The workers have hope that they’ll win,” their lawyer, Clélie Lesquen-Jonas told the AFP, adding that “the atmosphere is feverish” because “they have been waiting for this moment for years.”

Rabat – Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, believes that the transition to a flexible exchange rate system of dirham currency is “a very promising” action. Having arrived in Marrakech on January 29 to attend an economic conference, Lagarde said that the “international markets and foreign investors will appreciate this decision taken by the Moroccan government.”  Lagarde also praised the creation of free zones in two major Moroccan cities: Tangier and Casablanca As reason for her praise, she cited the more than 85,000 job opportunities from local suppliers created as a result of this free zone. Lagarde added that “the taxation policies should be made in such a way as to foster development in this region. During the conference, Lagarde also discussed the unemployment challenges in the MENA region, noting that nearly 25 million young people currently seek employment.  As a result, economic growth is always welcome. According to Lagarde, the main challenge for the region is responding to the expectations of young people by giving them hope for the future. improvement of business climate would be a step in the right direction she said.  During the conference, Lagarde emphasized three areas Morocco should prioritize: the creation of a strong private sector, wealth acquisition and job opportunities. “The public financial situation of the region’s countries cannot create employment, hence the need for the private sector is needed.” At the conference, Lagarde called on the attendees to support excluded groups –  youth, women and refugees – and to adopt a public-private partnership to achieve the aforementioned development. The managing director has also pledged support to Morocco in efforts to achieve inclusive growth, according to Bloomberg.

Rabat – Ahmad Ahmad, the President of the African Football Confederation (CAF) believes that the smooth proceedings of the African Nations’ Championship prove that Morocco is capable of organizing the 2026 World Cup. In an interview with Moroccan newspaper Assabah, Ahmad expressed his satisfaction over the well-organized competition, which is currently taking place with the Moroccan national football team. According to Ahmad, the members of the CAF organizing committee and members of the executive bureau, football teams,  and referees have unanimously praised Morocco’s excellent organization and preparedness, from the quality of the football stadia and arbitration procedures to the quality of local infrastructure and hotels.  According to the CAF president, the smooth running of CHAN in Morocco is a proof that Morocco has all it needs to organize the 2026 World Cup. “But it is up to the people who follow the competition and especially media… [to]judge the organization and then  echo it to the world.” Ahmad added that “for me, Morocco has shown its citizen and African public that it is capable of organizing a major competition “ At CHAN’s inauguration ceremony, the CAF top official reflected, “We did not believe that we were in an African country, owing to the level of infrastructure.” “The 2018 CHAN marks a turning point in the history of the competition, and the example of Morocco will serve as a model for the future organizing countries,” he added. Morocco submitted its candidacy to host the tournament on August 11, 2017. Ahmed claimed, “Morocco has all the assets to organize a major world event, and it would be an honor for all of Africa if Morocco wins the right to host the 2026 World Cup.” 
Morocco will also compete at the 21st World Cup tournament that will take place this summer in Russia,  this summer,.In November 2017, Morocco beat Ivory Coast in order to qualify, making it the first World Cup in twenty years that the Moroccan team will attend. Qatar will be the host country of the 22nd edition of the World Cup in 2022.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita has expressed his satisfaction over the outcome of the 30th Summit of the African Union (AU), which drew to a close on Monday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Only a year after its historic return to its African institutional family, Morocco has managed to participate in several meetings and activities by the pan-African bloc. Bourita told the press at the end of the summit that Morocco has several reasons to be satisfied, highlighting the presentation of King Mohammed VI’s report on the issue of migration and the country’s appointment to the AU’s Peace and Security Council. Migration is a major issue across the continent. Bourita described migration as a “fundamental question for Africa” and “a crucial issue for the relation[ship] between the continent and its partners.”  King Mohammed VI unveiled a draft of the African Agenda on Migration on Monday, emphasizing that migration is a natural phenomenon and that “[migration] is part of the solution, not of the problem.”  The monarch also called on the AU members to “adopt a positive stance on the issue of migration by highlighting the humanistic rationale of shared responsibility and solidarity.” Speaking about the King’s report, Bourita said that the document was detailed in according to a pragmatic and realistic approach. “An approach that dispels misunderstandings, rectifies stereotypes and presents the realities of migration in the African continent.” Bourita also cited Morocco’s election to AU’s Peace and Security Council as another notable event, adding that Morocco managed able to get 70 percent of votes by AU member countries, “despite attempts by opponents of the Kingdom to counter this candidacy.” Concluding his press conference, Bourita added that “Morocco will make a constructive contribution to the work carried out by this AU central body.”

Rabat- Just a few days after Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal was released from detention, Saudi authorities on Tuesday released all remaining detainees from the luxury Ritz-CarltonRitz-Carlton Hotel, a Saudi official said on Tuesday.  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) had ordered the arrest and detention of about 200 Saudi dignitaries and top officials for more than three months. “There are no longer any detainees left at the Ritz-Carlton,” an anonymous Saudi official told Reuters. The kingdom’s attorney general, Saud Al-Mojeb, said in a statement that 56 individuals remain in custody due to “other pending criminal cases, in order to continue the investigations process, and in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations.” In late November, Saudi Arabia’s strongman crown prince ordered the arrests as part of anti-corruption crackdown, claiming that over USD 100 billion had been lost to embezzlement and corruption in the past decades. The massive and unprecedented purge came hours after a Saudi royal decree announced the formation of an anti-corruption commission headed by the crown prince who promptly ordered a high-profile cabinet reshuffle. To date, the complete list of former detainees is still unknown but is said to comprise at least 11 princes, including 62-year-old Bin Talal, who faced accusations of money laundering, corruption and extortion. The majority of those detained were released after negotiating their exit for very large sums of money. Bin Talal’s sum, though, is believed to be one of the largest sought by the Saudi authorities; reportedly at least $6 billion in exchange for his freedom, according to the Wall Street Journal. Some of the detainees are believed to have been moved from the Ritz to a prison after “refusing to admit wrongdoing and reach financial settlements with the authorities.” The attorney general has indicated that the estimated value of settlements currently stands at more than $106 billion. Al-Mojeb said the settlements reached include seizure of real estate assets, commercial entities, securities and cash. As the detainees have been moved from the five-star Ritz-Carlton Hotel, the latter is expected to reopen to the public in February. According to its website, the hotel is taking bookings again beginning 14 February.

Rabat – The African Union‘s 30th Summit of Heads of State and Government held in Addis Ababa last weekend saw Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame assume the AU presidency for 2018, taking over the post from Guinea’s Alpha Condé. Like Condé, Kagame is expected to oversee structural and institutional reforms within the AU, an organization that is playing an increasingly vital role on the continent. Delegates present at the summit congratulated Mr. Condé for “duly serving the continent”. President Kagame delivered an acceptance speech in which he unveiled reforms and policy priorities that will drive the organization during his one-year tenure.  Key reforms Kagame is pushing include the fight against corruption, Africa’s Immigration Agenda, AU’s financial autonomy and, finally, the launching of a continental Free Trade Area. “Today we launch the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM). We are nearly ready to launch the continental Free Trade Area, and greater freedom of movement is achievable in 2018”, Kagame said in his speech. Later thanking his predecessor Alpha Condé for his “impeccable service to the continent,” Kagame reminded his fellow leaders and heads of state that Africa’s challenges require quick actions as “we’re running out of time.” “Africa’s defining challenge is to create a pathway to prosperity for our people, especially young people. Elsewhere this has been achieved through industrialization. But the growth trajectory that transformed Asia is no longer a viable option for Africa. We waited too long to act,” Kagame said. To materialize Africa’s 2018 ambitions, Kagame discussed a self-financing system for AU’s budgets and the mobilization of Africa’s inner potentials. However, he underlined the imperative of a shared commitment to unity. “Africa has assets and strengths to build on, starting with this organization and its tangible commitment to unity. This is an advantage which no other region of the world possesses in such abundance. Unity must be our starting point as we work to re-define Africa’s plans and ambitions,” Kagame added. Africa, Kagame concluded, must defy the narrative that describes it as a “burden” and realize prosperity and sustainable economic development. Andwhile acknowledging that solving Africa’s numerous problems will not be an easy task, Kagame stated that it need not take decades to complete. “We have helped perpetuate the narrative that Africa is a burden. This way of thinking has been around for decades. Fixing it won’t take a year, but it need not take twenty years either,” AU’s new president concluded.

Rabat – The Chairperson of the AU Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, has assured African Union member nations that the organization’s official position on the Western Sahara conflict, which was decided in July 2017 at the 29th AU Summit, is “still valid.” Mahamat made his remarks concerning the AU decision, later dubbed “653”, on the Western Sahara question at the conclusion yesterday of the 30th Summit of the African Heads of State and Government held in Addis Ababa. The 653 decision “is still valid and continues to serve as the reference,” said Mahamat. The decision made at the 29th AU summit calls on AU members to support UN efforts aimed at reaching a mutually acceptable solution to end the four-decade-long conflict over the Western Sahara. The AU summit also commended the appointment last year of Horst Kohler as the Personal Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General for Western Sahara. The statement does not refer to any role or involvement on the part of the AU in these efforts, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The decision “also makes no reference to any outdated plan, obsolete formula of solution or instrumentalized principle,” added Mahamat. This resolution “confirms the leadership of the United Nations to resolve this issue,” said the minister. Elected in January 2017 as the chairman of the AU commission, Mahamat is following a balanced approach in addressing the Western Sahara issue, contrary to that of the former chairperson of the AU Commission, South Africa’s Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. In a message to the 27th AU Summit held in July 2016 in Rwanda, King Mohammed VI has formally announced Morocco’s intent to reintegrate into the AU. While Morocco submitted a formal request to rejoin the AU after a 33-year absence, Zuma did not deliver Morocco’s request to other AU nations and no tangible progress was made throughout the last four months of 2016. Subsequently, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation denounced the actions carried out by the former AU Commission chairperson, stating that Zuma was trying to thwart Morocco’s request to regain its natural and legitimate position within its pan-African institutional family. Several countries, including South Africa and Algeria, failed in their attempts to block Morocco from rejoining the organization in an attempt to force Morocco to recognize the self-proclaimed Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR).

Rabat – Newly appointed Moroccan Minister of Education Said Amzazi decided to announce a national ban on mobile phones in classrooms, for both students teachers. Amzazi urged inspectors, directors of regional academies, training centers, schools, inspectors and teachers to “permanently ban students and school officials from using mobile phones in classrooms,” according to a ministerial note issued on January 25th. This policy aims to “better the conditions of learning for students and ensure a favorable climate in which teachers can perform their duties,” reads the note. However, Moroccan educators l may require more than a phone ban in classrooms to reach favorable conditions. The National Union of Education and the Democratic Confederation of Labor (CDT)  have called for a 24-hour national strike and have organized sit-ins in front of the provincial ministerial institutions on February 14th. This decision was made to denounce the vile situation of the public education, the rise in school registration fees that systematically seek to eliminate free education, and a standstill of dialogue with the government.

Rabat – In what might be good news for Moroccan women who are interested in holding the position of public notary official (adoul), Morocco’s Minister of Justice, Mohammed Aujjar, announced on Monday the launch of an admissions competition for both women and men. The admission tests are set to be scheduled for next week. After King Mohammed VI voiced his decision to authorize Moroccan women to hold the position of public notary, the Ministry of Justice announced that it is creating up to 800 jobs for Moroccan men and women wishing to become public notary officials. The announcement was made by Aujjar during a House of Representatives parliamentary session held yesterday, January 30. According to Aujjar, the reform process underway in the legal and judicial fields is of particular importance, adding that the Justice Reform Charter called for the modernization of the justice system and the opening of this particular profession to women. This reform, according to the minister, is in line with the constitutional principle established in Article 19, as well as Morocco’s international commitments to expand employment opportunities for women in the country. The ministry, in partnership with the National Order of Public Notary Officials, recently launched the project to reform regulations on the training and admissions for the adoul position, said Aujjar. The new created positions will meet the expectations of public notary officials and justice system officials, as well as to integrate this important profession into the changing socio-economic environment. The unprecedented decision by the King on January 22 to open the adoul position to women candidates was an acknowledgment of the skills and capabilities of women throughout the kingdom.

Morocco’s 2020 goals to increase the contribution of renewable energies to the production of electricity to 42 percent–52 percent by 2030–are on track. “At the end of 2017, we are at 34 percent capacity produced from renewable sources,” said Bakkoury at the end of one working session presided over by King Mohammed VI at the Royal Palace in Casablanca.

By Tamba Francois Koundouno Rabat – In an attempt to soothe the outcry generated by his “shithole” statement, Trump addressed a letter last Thursday to African leaders, who were meeting in Addis Ababa to discuss the continent’s priorities for 2018. According to the Associated Press, Trump stated that he “profoundly respects the people of Africa.” Trump’s “shithole” comments, made during a policy meeting on immigration earlier this month, shocked and dismayed many people in Africa, especially African leaders. The AU Commission president commented at the AU Summit last week that the continent was “frankly alarmed” by Trump’s comments. At a World Economic Forum last Friday in Davos, Trump met with Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, who recently replaced Guinea’s Alpha Condé as the acting chairperson of the African Union. Kagame said that they had “good discussions” on economy and trade-related issues, further commenting that “AU is looking forward to working with the United States.” Trump, for his part, called the meeting “an honor” and Kagame “a friend.” Trump stressed a partnership that “safeguards legal immigration,” adding that the U.S. wants to work with Africa towards “free, fair, and reciprocal trade.” It is reported that Trump’s letter extended his “deepest compliments” to African counterparts, adding that he respects their mutual friendship and shared values with Africa and its people. The letter also mentioned that “US troops are fighting side by side” with African soldiers against terrorism and extremism in the continent, adding that his commitment to the partnership with Africa is “firm.” Trump’s letter concluded that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will make “an extended visit” to Africa in March 2018. However, the letter did not reveal details about Tillerson’s predicted visit.

Rabat – The world’s biggest carmaker, Volkswagen, is facing backlash after the New York Times reported on January 25, 2018 that a US institute commissioned by the German auto firm carried out diesel fume inhalation tests on humans and monkeys in 2014.  During this test, aimed to prove that diesel vehicles equipped with the latest technology were cleaner than older models, Volkswagen reportedly forced ten monkeys to inhale diesel exhaust fumes while being locked in airtight chambers and watching cartoons for distraction.  The German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported on Monday that tests on the effects of inhaling toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) were also carried out on some 25 healthy human beings. The World Health Organisation points out that nitrogen oxides exposure “can increase symptoms of bronchitis and asthma, lead to respiratory infections and reduced lung function and growth.”  The studies were conducted by an organisation known as the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector (EUGT) as part of an experiment financed by Volkswagen alongside fellow German auto sector stalwarts Daimler and BMW. Following these revelations, Volkswagen released a statement that “explicitly distances itself clearly from all forms of animal abuse,” apologizing for the “misconduct and the lack of judgment of individuals.”  “We’re convinced the scientific methods chosen then were wrong. It would have been better to do without such a study in the first place,” Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW, said in a statement. The Volkswagen’s supervisory board says it will conduct a full investigation, describing the experiments as “utterly incomprehensible.” The sale of diesel cars in Europe and United States has been in steady decline, as several studies showed that even the newest diesel-engine cars produce pollution far above what is legally permitted.  One study carried out by Transport &amp; Environment, a Brussels-based lobby for sustainable transport, has found that “a typical diesel car emits 42.65 tonnes of carbon dioxide over its lifecycle, or 3.65 tonnes more than a petrol car.”  In 2015, the US Environmental Protection Agency issued a notice of violation to Volkswagen, after discovering that the company installed misleading gauges to make car engines appear less polluting than they actually were.

Rabat – On Monday January 29, Morocco’s King Mohammed VI addressed a message to the 30th African Union (AU) Summit, introducing a draft of the African Agenda on Migration. The King’s statement was read aloud by Moroccan head of government Saad Eddine El Othmani.  In his message, the King expressed his warm gratitude over being appointed as the Leader of the African Union on the Question of Migration during the 28th AU Summit last year, which also marked the return of Morocco to the AU for the first time in over 30 years. “I feel honored by this expression of esteem on the part of my brothers and sisters,” said the King. The sovereign message also recalled the blueprint for a common African vision that he had already presented to Guinean president Alpha Conde. King Mohammed VI said that “today, I am submitting to you a document introducing the African Agenda on Migration,” adding that this document was “drawn up using an inclusive and participatory approach.” Describing the draft African Agenda, he said that “it is [a] flexible, scalable and legally non-binding document. More than anything else, it should serve to inspire our future action” with regards to migration.” The King added that the document consists ideas and proposals “shared by official institutions, civil society organizations and researchers from Africa.” The sovereign called on the AU member countries to enhance their efforts in order to understand the migration phenomenon “properly.” “I think the time has come to deconstruct, one by one, the myths associated with migration.” The King said that there is no massive influx of African migrants” since the latter account for only 3.4 percent of the world population,” noting that “African migration is essentially intra-African” as 4 out of 5 migrants remain in Africa. King Mohammed VI said that migration should be considered a “natural phenomenon” and should be celebrated. It is “part of the solution, not of the problem. We should adopt a positive stance on the issue of migration by highlighting the humanistic rationale of shared responsibility and solidarity.” To manage migration issues, the King proposes to create an African Migration Observatory, “whose terms of reference would be the triad ‘Understand, Anticipate, Act.’” The mission of the Observatory will be the exchange of information between African countries to promote management of migration flows. King Mohammed VI also suggests that the AU set up a Special Envoy for Migration to coordinate AU migration policies. In his message, the Moroccan king also referred to the worrying migration-related tragedies. The King said that “since 2015, more than 6,200 African migrants have lost their lives in the Mediterranean.” “How many more migration-related tragedies do we still have to witness before our societies change the way they perceive migration. The King concluded his message by calling on Africa to “address migration in a spirit of unremitting solidarity.”

Rabat – The three most coveted accolades of the 60th annual Grammy Awards were bestowed upon Bruno Mars for his double platinum album and record of the year, ‘24k Magic’. The album included song of the year winner, ‘That’s What I Like’. Bruno also pulled a perfect 6-for-6 record by taking home top prizes for his other three nominations including best R&amp;B song, album and performance of the year. Meanwhile, Jay Z, who led in Grammy nominations with eight, left the Boston Garden empty-handed, tying the record for the largest Grammy shutout, second only to Paul McCartney’s 0-9 run over 50 years ago. Bruno Mars won Album of the Year over tough competition, including Childish Gambino’s ‘Awaken, My Love’, Jay-Z’s ‘4:44’ and Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Damn’; all favorites in the esteemed category. The list also included Lorde’s ‘Melodrama’, the only female nominee of the year for this particular prestigious award. Kendrick was the only artist on the list to still see extensive success despite the Mars sweep, mainly in the rap categories, but also winning best music video with ‘Humble’ for a total of 5 Grammys.  The much sought after new artist award was given to Cara who was among a strong group of nominees including SZA who was up for five total Grammys, one greater than Cara. Ed Sheeran did not attend the ceremony, however he won both categories for which he was nominated, best pop vocal album and best pop solo performance. Chris Stapleton, meanwhile, swept all of the country categories. The Grammys proved once again to be a platform for political and social statements from the get-go, as Kendrick opened the ceremony with an aggressively styled, crowd-invigorating song medley, with back up from U2 and brief intermissions featuring comedian Dave Chapelle (who would later win his first ever Grammy) complimenting Kendrick’s black struggle-oriented lyricism with the following: “I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America.” The trend continued as the social focus shifted to victims of sexual abuse with Kesha’s powerful, soul-drawn, comeback performance of her Grammy-nominated ballad ‘Praying’, introduced by Janelle Monáe who urged the music industry to play their part in helping to eliminate the problem: “Just as we have the power to shape culture, we also have the power to undo the culture that does not do us well.” Many of the event’s attendees walked the red carpet with white roses in honor of the innumerable victims of sexual abuse, allegedly including Kesha herself, at the hands of music producer Dr. Luke.  Political statements, too, were not lacking in last night’s ceremony, with Hilary Clinton making a surprise appearance on television host James Corden’s video segment, taking a light jab at the US President alongside celebrities such as John Legend, DJ Khaled and Cardi B, by reading the following extract from Michael Wolff’s bestselling book, ‘Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House’: “He had a long-time fear of being poisoned,” she said as she read the book’s passage. “One reason why he liked to eat at McDonald’s. No one knew he was coming and the food was safely pre-made.” Expressions on serious policy matters were also made, such as the highlight moment when singer Camila Cabello referenced the recent “Dreamers” situation that helped spark the 3-day US government shutdown. “I’m a proud Cuban-Mexican immigrant, born in eastern Havana, standing in front of you on the Grammy stage in New York City, and all I know is, just like dreams, these kids can’t be forgotten and are worth fighting for,” she said in her introduction to U2’s politically-fuelled performance.

Rabat – According to a recent report by the Associated Press, Morocco will refrain from using Trump’s unfavorable global reputation as leverage during the kingdom’s ongoing campaign to host the 2026 World Cup. The report cites an interview with Hicham El Amrani, Morocco’s 2026 bid chief executive, who, commenting on the potential asset that Trump could be to Morocco’s bid, allegedly told the Associated Press that Morocco would focus on its bid and “leave it up to voters to decide what they think,” adding “I won’t make comments about the leadership here and there.” “We don’t want to win the right to host because of someone else, but because of our clear advantages… we will stay away from [Trump] because it is not proper to comment”, the outlet further quoted Mr. El Amrani. While the Associated Press pointed to the financial benefit that could double for FIFA if North America were to host the 2026 World Cup edition, El Amrani reportedly pointed to the numerous advantages of hosting the cup in Morocco, such as the “sweet spot in Time zones” and the “more comfortable and shorter travelling time” to match venues which, El Amrani added, “will allow for better quality of play.” “Contrary to what we can hear about potential revenue,” El Mani also said, commenting on the supposed financial asset of the North American contenders, “Morocco has a fantastic offer from that perspective.” Until the final deliberations (this time, all 211 football nations will vote), it is clear that Morocco’s bid, as it comes with pan-African support, is a serious challenge to the North-American triumvirate. In an article published in August of last year, The New York Times was already describing Morocco’s bid as “a last minute Challenger,” and “a potential complication to the United States-led campaign that appeared to be coasting to victory unopposed.” Just a bit of patience for football fans, and time will tell.

Rabat – After several decades of extremely dry weather, residents in southern regions of Morocco finally woke up this morning to an unusual snowfall that currently impacted Ouarzazate, Taroudant and even Zagora, which has not experienced snowfall for fifty years. Several photos and videos have been posted on social media depicting the cities covered with a huge layer of snow. Despite the freezing cold temperatures, many residents went outside to enjoy the unexpected snowfall.  El Houcine Yoabd, in charge of communication at the National Meteorology, told the media outlet le 360, that it has snowed in these regions due to a mass of air coming from Northern Europe.  “We are under the influence of a very low pressure of altitude, with very cold temperatures that can reach 0 or even 1 degree,” Yoabd said.  He also added that these drops in temperature accompanied by rainfall and snowfall in several parts of Morocco are expected to continue until next Thursday. New weather alert released by the National Directorate of Meteorology on Monday forecasts temperatures ranging between -04 and 1°C and maximum of 5 to 9 °C in Ouarzazate.   These heavy snowfalls made travel absolutely impossible as the roads were blocked. There will be also delays in air traffic. A video posted on social media shows a man from Tinzouline, a town 15 kilometres from Zagora expressing his joy over the snowing atmosphere.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI sent a message on Monday to the 30th Summit of the African Union (AU) held in Addis Ababa, with the participation of Morocco. In his message, the King expressed his pride over Morocco’s contribution to the African Union. After a 33-year absence, Morocco rejoined the union in January of 2017. Although the King was not physically present at the AU meeting, his message was read aloud by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, who continues to represent the monarch at the ongoing summit. After greeting AU leaders, the King reflected on the first anniversary of Morocco’s return to the African Union. “A year ago, the Kingdom of Morocco regained its natural place within its African institutional family.” The King has also expressed his pride in Morocco’s recent contributions to the AU, stating, “my country has been pleased to contribute to the actions undertaken, the projects launched, and the meetings held under the aegis of our organization.” King Mohammed VI also reaffirmed Morocco’s commitment to the development and prosperity of Africa. “Morocco will continue to endorse the lofty causes of the continent and will work untiringly towards the promotion of peace, stability and development in the continent.” In his message, subsequently  reprinted in its entirety by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the King also lauded the leadership shown by other African leaders, specifically noting Guinean president Alpha Conde “during his term of office at the head of our organization.”  “Thanks to his farsightedness and his firm convictions, he has managed to give good visibility to African joint action,” said the King as he was praising the Pan-African commitment shown by Conde. The King has also expressed his support for Rwandan president Paul Kagame, the new AU President for 2018.  “There is no doubt in my mind that under the leadership of our brother, President Paul Kagame, the new AU President for 2018, the great efforts to reform our organization will be maintained, and Africa’s voice will be heard in the international arena. I wish to assure him of the Kingdom of Morocco’s full support,” read the King’s message.

Addis Ababa – King Mohammed VI addressed a message on Monday to the 30th African Union Summit, held in Addis Ababa. Here follows the full text of the Royal message that was read out by head of government, Saad Eddine El Othmani. “Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, A year ago, the Kingdom of Morocco regained its natural place within its African institutional family. Since then, my country has been pleased to contribute to the actions undertaken, the projects launched and the meetings held under the aegis of our organization. Morocco will continue to endorse the lofty causes of the Continent and will work untiringly towards the promotion of peace, stability and development in the Continent. I should like to take this opportunity to praise the Pan-African commitment shown by President Alpha Condé during his term of office at the head of our organization. Thanks to his far-sightedness and his firm convictions, he has managed to give good visibility to African joint action. There is no doubt in my mind that under the leadership of our Brother, President Paul Kagame, the new AU President for 2018, the great efforts to reform our organization will be maintained, and Africa’s voice will be heard in the international arena. I wish to assure him of the Kingdom of Morocco’s full support. I should also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the AU Commission, for his tireless efforts to inject new dynamism into the work of our organization. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, At the 28th AU Summit, you graciously appointed me Leader of the African Union on the Question of Migration. I feel honored by this expression of esteem on the part of my Brothers and Sisters. In July 2017, I submitted a blueprint for a common African vision on migration, through the Preliminary Note presented to my Brother, President Alpha Condé. Today, I am submitting to you a document introducing the “African Agenda on Migration”. It was drawn up using an inclusive, participatory approach: It is the outcome of the regular consultation I had with many Heads of State on the occasion of various meetings and contacts. It enjoys broad ownership thanks, notably, to the convening of two important meetings: the Regional Meeting of 2 November 2017, at Skhirat, which brought together more than 120 decision-makers, representatives of international organizations, researchers and members of civil society, and the Ministerial Conference, held in Rabat on 9 January 2018, which was attended by approximately twenty ministers, representing the continent’s five sub-regions, the AU Commission and the Regional Economic Communities. The document therefore includes the ideas, proposals and thoughts shared by official institutions, civil society organizations and researchers from Africa. It is a flexible, scalable and legally non-binding document. More than anything else, it should serve to inspire our future action regarding this question. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, As you can see, the African Agenda on Migration is based on the idea that we need to know the full range of dimensions involved in the migration phenomenon in order to understand it properly. In this regard, I think the time has come to deconstruct, one by one, the myths associated with migration: 1. There is no massive influx of migrants, since the latter account for only 3.4 per cent of the world population. 2. African migration is essentially intra-African. Worldwide, migration accounts for less than 14 per cent of the population. As far as Africa is concerned, 4 out of 5 African migrants remain in the Continent. 3. Migration does not impoverish host countries since 85% of migrants’ incomes remain in those countries. 4. Migration is a natural phenomenon which is part of the solution, not of the problem. We should adopt a positive stance on the issue of migration by highlighting the humanistic rationale of shared responsibility and solidarity. I am sure you will agree with me, dear Brothers and Sisters, that when one sees migration for what it really is, shedding the myths that convey a shockingly distorted image of the phenomenon, one realizes that this is a global issue – one that is crucial for our continent. It deserves a fresh, Africa-centered approach combining realism, tolerance and a commitment to make reason prevail over fear. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, As regards migration management, the African Agenda on Migration proposes an approach based on national policies, sub-regional coordination, a continental vision and international partnership. This presupposes a paradigm shift, an introspective and positive redefinition of migration as well as genuine political will on the part of States, which all have a vested interest in making sure migration is safe, legal and orderly, seeing to it that human rights are respected. This Agenda should seek to make migration a lever for co-development, a pillar of South-South Cooperation and an instrument of solidarity. To this end, it is suggested that we: Set up an African Migration Observatory whose terms of reference would be the triad Understand, Anticipate, Act. Its mission would be to develop observation and the exchange of information between African countries in order to promote controlled management of migration flows. My country proposes that this Observatory be based in Morocco. Create a post of AU Special Envoy for Migration, who would be tasked with coordinating AU policies in this area. The African Agenda on Migration can inform the process of developing the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. Morocco, which will be hosting the Intergovernmental Conference, that is to adopt the Global Compact, and the Global Forum for Migration and Development, in December 2018, pledges to make these multilateral meetings a platform for Africa. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Since 2015, more than 6,200 African migrants have lost their lives in the Mediterranean. To ensure that the deaths of women, children and men in Lampedusa and that the infamous practices in Libya will not remain without consequences, we are, indeed, duty-bound to act! How many more migration-related tragedies do we still have to witness before our societies change the way they perceive migration? More than ever, our continent needs to address migration in a spirit of unremitting solidarity. Our collective wisdom will be our main asset as we seek to implement the African Agenda on Migration. Unity is the key to success; inter-African cooperation is the pathway to it. Thank you. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.”

Rabat – Guinean President Alpha Condé expressed his satisfaction over Morocco’s contribution to the African Union on Sunday at the AU Headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. On Sunday, Conde paid a vibrant tribute to Morocco for its eminent contribution to the African unity. Recalling late King Mohammed V and his faithfulness to the African continent, Condé told reporters at the end of the first day of the 30th AU Summit, “We are all aware of the role that late King Mohammed V had played in promoting the African continent, and the late sovereign’s support of liberation movement.” In his remarks, Condé mentioned the significance of the 1961 Casablanca Conference. Condé emphasized that the Casablanca conference resulted in the establishment of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1963, later replaced by the African Union (AU) in 2002. Speaking about Morocco’s return to the African Union, Condé said, “ I am very pleased that during my term, Morocco was able to join the AU unanimously.” “Morocco has returned to its African institutional family to unite and federate the energies of Africans.” Condé also discussed Morocco’s role in migration issues, stating that the country has received more than 100,000 African students and regularized migrants from many countries across the continent. “Morocco is a good model that other states ought to follow,” according to Conde. The Guinean president pointed out that the 30th AU Summit will be marked by a presentation by Moroccan officials, representing the King. The presentation will feature Morocco’s vision and roadmap for immigration, with an expected endorsement from the pan-African bloc. Many African leaders have echoed Condé’s remarks on Morocco’s return, including Tanzanian Foreign Minister Augustine Mahiga, who said on Friday, January 26, that “Morocco’s contribution to the AU is of great importance. George Weah, Liberia’s newly-appointed president has also lauded Morocco’s return to the African Union, emphasizing that this unification reinforces African unity.

Rabat- Following an investigation that exposed Chinese espionage on the African Union (AU) headquarters in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, the Chinese Ambassador to the AU, Kuang Weili, called the report “sensational” and “absurd.” The investigation, which was conducted by French newspaper “Le Monde Afrique,” claimed that over the last five years, the AU servers were all connected to others located in Shanghai. The organization’s technical staff later discovered that between midnight and 2 a.m., computer servers were reaching a peak in data transfer activity. Every night, the secrets of the AU were being stored more than 8,000 km away by what was thought to be a diplomatic ally of Africa. China’s ambassador to the AU, said during the 30th African Union summit which currently takes place in Addis Ababa, that the report is a “sensational story, but also completely false and nonsense,” According to the Chinese diplomat, the said article will “damage the image of the newspaper,” but not the relationship between China and Africa. He also questioned the timing of the report, as it was released one day before African leaders kick-off their annual summit at the AU headquarters. The $200 million complex was built by China and donated to African Union in 2012. According to Le Monde Afrique, the computer systems were fully equipped by the Chinese, allowing them to open an undocumented portal that gives Chinese administrators access to the AU’s computing system. This “backdoor” is an intentional fault put into code to allow hackers and intelligence agencies to gain illicit access to information. “Following this discovery, we have taken some steps to strengthen our cybersecurity,” a AU official told Le Monde. Another official believes that, “they are not alone.” In fact, the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British intelligence agencies (GCHQ) have had their share of surveillance on the AU building, according to documents which were gathered by Le Monde, in collaboration with The Intercept. After the Chinese alleged scheme was exposed, the AU acquired its own servers and declined China’s offer to configure them. The AU encrypts all electronic communications and, from now on, the highest officials of the institution have foreign telephone lines and more secure communication applications. They have also taken stricter security measures: cybersecurity experts inspected the building’s rooms and disposed of microphones placed under the desks and in walls by the Chinese workers.

Rabat – On Sunday in Agadir, King Mohammed VI chaired the presentation ceremony of the 2014-2020 Industrial Acceleration Plan for the Souss-Massa region. The multi-year project, which continues the regional implementation of the national industrial strategy, forms part of the monarch’s vision that encourages balanced, sustainable and inclusive territorial development projects.  King Mohammed VI’s vision is aimed at making the region an economic development magnet capable of creating greater employment opportunities for all citizens, promoting its natural wealth and supporting its many productive sectors. A core priority is inclusive growth for the region’s diverse population. In a statement read before the King, Minister of Industry and Trade, Moulay Hafid Elalamy, said that the industrial sector “adopts a regionalized approach, in line with the royal instructions, in order to identify the productive activities closer to citizens, to capitalize on the potential of all our regions and to reach a new level of emergence.” According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the industrial plan is part of the nation’s core development strategy carried out under the leadership of the King, who has been encouraging regional development that focuses on each region’s specific needs, assets and priorities. The regional plan also aims to create productive social and cultural activities to serve the interests of citizens. Through this envisioned project, the region of Souss-Massa will be a platform for the further development of agricultural products that are designed for both domestic consumption and for export, especially to nations on the African continent. A strengthened partnership between the Ministries of Agriculture and Industry has been established through joint support programs involving the Industrial Development Fund, the Agricultural Development Fund and the provision of agropole, added MAP. The shipbuilding infrastructure sector will invest MAD 5 billion at the national level, while the chemistry sector will benefit from support that promotes the development of organic and green chemistry. To fulfill these commitments, the Souss-Massa region’s private sector will invest MAD 500 million to invest in these industrial projects. King Mohammed VI’s visit to Agadir was also marked by a signing ceremony of eight agreements and a protocol intended to promote the industrial plan of the region. The first agreements concern the implementation and development of the automotive, leather, naval, chemistry, plastics, building materials and offshoring ecosystems in the Souss-Massa Region. The second agreement signed before the King promotes the training needs of employment and human resources of the industrial development strategy for the region by 2020. Other agreements signed before King Mohammed VI on Sunday include:  An agreement to set up a Cité de l’Innovation in the Souss-Massa region. An agreement for the development, promotion, marketing and management of the Souss-Massa free zone. An agreement for the implementation of the region-wide development strategy of agro-food industries for the Souss-Massa region. An agreement for the financing of the Agribusiness Development Program. An agreement for the establishment of a Technopark in the Souss Massa region. An agreement to support the establishment of a private fund for the development of investment in the Souss-Massa region. A protocol for the realization of 11 industrial investments in the sectors of building materials, plastics, paper and cardboard industries, as well as offshoring.

Rabat- Hundreds of customers rushed to Intermarché outlets across France on Thursday, causing near riots as they snatched as many tubs of Nutella as possible, in response to dramatic discounts applied to the famous hazelnut spread. On Thursday, January 25, the Intermarché store chain dropped prices of 950 g-jars of Nutella by 70 percent, bringing its price to EUR 1.41. The chain did not anticipate, however, that France’s favorite chocolate spread would lead to pushing, fighting, and general disarray at some outlets. Enormous queues formed in front of the gates of many Intermarché supermarkets before they opened; after 15 minutes, shoppers cleared the shelves.  “It’s crazy, it seems to be the first day of sales,” an employee of Intermarché Haguenau told AFP.   In one store, a staff member told local media that he was “punched in the eye while trying to separate warring customers.”  “They are like animals. One woman’s hair was pulled. An elderly lady was hit on the head with a box. Another had a bloody hand,” one customer said.  “People were piling in, they knocked everything over and broke stuff. It was an orgy… we were on the point of calling the police,” another staff member said.  Local media outlets reported that police had to intervene in one of the Intermarché branches located in the north of the country to put an end to a fight.  Nutella’s Italian manufacturer, Ferrero, said in a statement that it “deplored” the violence but kept itself distant from the supermarket promotion.  “We wish to clarify that this promotion was decided unilaterally by the Intermarché brand,” the statement reads. The supermarket chain recently issued another statement, in which Intermarché apologized for the “disagreeable events customers suffered.” Vous connaissiez les émeutes des débuts de soldes ? InterMarché vous présente les promos #Nutella. Incroyablement triste.. https://t.co/egjrt7Ybho — Julien Muller (@Julien__Mlr) January 25, 2018

Rabat – According to BMI Research, Morocco’s fiscal deficit will continue to narrow in the years ahead, but at a slower pace than in previous years.  In its latest economic analysis report, BMI — a member of the Fitch Group that provides macroeconomic, industry and financial market analysis — expects Morocco’s fiscal deficit “to continue to narrow in 2018, though the pace of consolidation will likely be more gradual than seen in recent years.”  According to the research firm, Morocco’s economic growth will boost the country’s tax take through a series of new tax exemptions and elevated capital spending to ensure gradual fiscal consolidation. The study points out that the government’s budget plans for 2018 focus primarily on new tax exemptions rather than revenue-raising measures, which will lead to a deceleration of total revenue growth and will limit tax revenue growth.  The authors of the BMI report remain optimistic, however, regarding revenues that are “set to continue expanding over 2018, though more gradually than in recent years.” They forecast a “robust economic growth” with a real GDP growth of 3.8 percent in 2018. In fact, following 2016 reforms that broadened the tax base and modernized tax administration, tax revenue grew by an estimated 4.3 percent in 2017.  Even though Morocco’s spending growth will remain “relatively robust,” BMI researchers expect continued restraint in recurrent spending, with a slow reduction in the size of the public sector workforce and efforts to limit wage growth through revised salary and promotion policies.  “Although the government looks poised to restrain the growth of recurrent expenditures, capital spending will remain elevated, in line with the government’s focus on improving infrastructure.” reads the study.   The report shows, however, that recurrent spending cuts will be counterbalanced with significant capital spending growth, predicting an increase of 8 percent compared to 2017, bringing it up to 25.8 percent of total expenditure, which is a “relatively high figure by historical standards.”  The report states that three initiatives undertaken by Morocco will consume the majority of the funds, namely the Green Morocco project — which aims to reduce the impact of droughts by providing innovative technology to small-scale farmers — the national energy strategy and regional development projects, including increased phosphate mining and expanding highway systems.  Thus, the firm concludes that “this elevated capital spending, coupled with the tax exemptions on the revenue side of the budget suggests the fiscal deficit will narrow only to a limited degree.”   “This underpins our forecast for the fiscal deficit to come in at 3.3% of GDP in 2018. While representing an improvement on the estimated 3.5% shortfall recorded in 2017, this is still 0.3 percentage points larger than the government’s own target of 3.0%,” indicates the study.

Rabat – On Saturday, Italian authorities rescued 800 migrants from the Mediterranean sea, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The migrants were aboard five boats, including two dinghies. The Italian coast guards have also recovered two bodies. According to Independent.ie, seven children were transferred to a nearby hospital in Sfax, Tunisia in order to receive necessary emergency medical care. The majority of the rescued migrants are believed to be from sub-Saharan Africa and are fleeing civil unrest. In 2016, nearly 171,000 asylum seekers arrived in Italy via boats and rafts, according to statistics from the UNHCR. In recent years, several hundred thousand migrants have traveled to Libya in order to reach Europe via the Mediterranean, including numerous Moroccans who dreamt of crossing to Europe but remain trapped in dire conditions in detention centers across Libya. In December 2017, several videos taken by detained Moroccans were widely shared on social media, revealing the horrific conditions they faced in Libyan prisons. The trapped migrants cried for help and urged the Moroccan government to take immediate action to bring them back home.Hundreds were eventually repatriated in December following the efforts and intervention by King Mohammad VI.

Rabat- The Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance announced on Saturday that Moroccan authorities have approved the import of Russia’s beef products.  “The Kingdom of Morocco will open its market to Russian beef and beef products, which will help increase the volume of trade between the two countries,” read an official statement.  The approval came after a Moroccan delegation of the National Office for the Sanitary Safety of Food Products (ONSSA) visited Russian meat companies “to ensure compliance with veterinary and sanitary standards in Morocco.” “The volume of bilateral trade should be in line with the potential of both countries and their strong economic relations,” added the statement.  The competent authorities of both countries “will soon adopt veterinary certificates to accompany meat deliveries in Morocco.”  The two parties also signed a veterinary certification for deliveries of fish, as well as vegetable and beekeeping productions, to Morocco.

Thirty countries supported Morocco’s bid to return to the African Union last year, while nine countries stood against the bid, including Algeria. Many African leaders welcomed Morocco’s return after 33-year of absence. In April 2017, Alpha Conde, President of the Republic of Guinea said that “Morocco’s return to the AU will make a remarkable contribution to this exhilarating undertaking of solidarity among the African peoples.” Conde’s remarks on Morocco’s return are echoed by many African leaders, including Tanzanian Foreign Minister Augustine Mahiga, who said on Friday, January 26, that “Morocco’s contribution to the AU is of great importance,” when recalling King Mohammed VI’s “historical” speech at the 28th AU Summit in January 2017.

By Tamba Francois Koundounou Rabat – The Spanish military establishment has recently issued a serious “security warning” in Defensa, a Spanish news agency specialized in covering security and army-related topics. According to Defensa, there are signs of strategic rapprochement between the USA and Morocco, adding that, as a result, a recent military deal between the USA and Saudi Arabia might have been concluded, with the Saudi kingdom’s promising to finance the acquisition of four electronic surveillance and military reconnaissance aircrafts for Morocco’s Royal Air Forces. “The Moroccan Air Forces could receive up to four aircrafts adapted for Israeli electronic surveillance tasks thanks to an agreement between the United States and Saudi Arabia that would finance this acquisition”, wrote José Navarro, the Defensa journalist who authored the said article. “While the four aircrafts would be American, specifically Gulfstream G550 (Gulfstream Aerospace, a subsidiary of General Dynamics), the aircrafts would ship Systems of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance of Israeli origin”, the article further reported. These aircrafts bespeak a strong military and strategic rapprochement between Morocco and the United States, as they will upgrade and modernize the current level of the Moroccan Royal Air Forces’ surveillance, interception, monitoring, and interference machinery, the article suggested. Algeria allegedly acquired, in 2016, three aircrafts of similar functions; however, it has been reported that given the upgraded specificities of the new types, the aircrafts Morocco is about to acquire are, reportedly, of far greater capabilities.

Rabat – The French company ACOME’s automotive products and systems division opened its new industrial plant in the Tangier Free Zone business park Jan. 24. The site will produce automobile cables, reported the state news agency Maghreb Arab Press.  ACOME, or the Cooperative Association of Workers in Electrical Equipment is a manufacturer of cables, fiber optics and synthetic tubes for telecommunication and infrastructure networks, buildings and the automotive industry. The new plant, which required an investment of 19 million euros, covers more than 18,000 square meters, and is expected to provide 130 new jobs.  ACOME CEO Jacques De Heere said that 75 percent of the factory’s output will go to export and that the Moroccan automotive industry will now be producing about 25 percent of the automotive cables consumed in Europe.  “The plant will ultimately have the capacity to deliver 1.5 million vehicles, not only in Morocco but also beyond its borders,” he said.

Rabat – If Morocco is awarded the tournament it will require a mobilization of citizens, significant government resources, and corporate sponsorships on a level not seen in Morocco — and a heavy dose of Moroccan hospitality. A vote and decision will be made on June 13 during the FIFA Congress. But Morocco has held major international events before: the 2016 COP22 climate conference in Marrakech and the now-underway African Nations Championship (CHAN). Should Morocco be selected, here are some facts, trivia, challenges and aspirations for the kingdom as it prepares for 2026: 1. A lot of teams, a lot of people.   FIFA has announced that, for the 2026 tournament, 48 teams will earn the right to play, up from 32 for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. 16 groups, three teams each. This makes for several hundred more players and team personnel, dozens of more media representatives, and, likely, several thousand more fans. The 2010 World Cup in South Africa attracted a reported total attendance of nearly 3.2 million for 64 matches. An estimated 309,000 foreigners came to that tournament, modestly below expectations. 2. A Casa-Rabat Metroplex?   Casablanca and Rabat are about 50 miles apart, the same distance as Boston and Providence, Rhode Island. As both metro areas grow and expand, hosting the 2026 World Cup would provide a unique opportunity (and challenge) for Morocco’s urban planners to show off a bold vision of urban sustainability in a very population-dense region. If both the Casa and Rabat-Sale core metro areas maintain a population growth rate of about .006 percent, nearly 300,000 new residents will live in the potential metroplex by 2026. 3. Destination Tangier. Morocco’s northern hub of economic development would likely be a principal gateway for an enormous influx of World Cup fans. The harbor redevelopment will be finished, allowing more fast-jet boats from Spain and cruise ships to dock. An airport that is a gateway to Morocco for numerous discount carriers like Ryan Air would see a large increase in arrivals. Tanger-Med, the region’s cargo port facility is already equipped with a passenger terminal and rail and bus connections to Tangier city itself. The city’s amenities will need to handle tens of thousands of soccer fans coming and going each week over the course of the month-long tournament. 4. Stadiums.   Depending on the duration of the tournament and the number of matches played each day Morocco would need to utilize nine, ten, perhaps eleven stadiums. Tangier, Rabat, Casablanca, Agadir, Marrakech and Fes are home to facilities that are either new, have been refurbished or soon will be. Oujda, Tetouan and Al Hoceima are sites with planned stadiums. It’s entirely likely another stadium beyond these would need to be built; if so, planners could decide to construct a flagship sports stadium near Casa or Rabat allowing Morocco to bid on a future summer Olympics. Or not. Morocco’s experience hosting the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup and numerous CAF matches demonstrates the passion for soccer among the country’s political and business leadership. Corporate sponsors willing to make a significant investment are crucial to help allay the costs of building stadiums and infrastructure improvements. In preparation for the 2022 World Cup tournament, Qatar is spending somewhere between nine and ten billion dollars on seven new stadiums and infrastructure improvements. Russia’s original bid for the 2018 tournament proposed up to 16 stadiums, later decreased to 14 and then to the current 12. The challenge for 2026: 48 teams. 5. Airports! Morocco is fortunate to have numerous modern airports that serve geographically diverse areas. Marrakech, Tangier, Rabat, Casablanca’s Mohammad V, Marrakech, and Agadir. Add the newly opened Fes Saiss airport terminal, and the nation is in good shape to get people in and out of the kingdom. The national airport authority recently reported that 20.3 million passengers utilized one of its airports in 2017. Get ready for more wide-body jets that will require more ground services. That new high-speed LGV train is going to prove its worth. 6. Real-time drama. To casual soccer fans, 0-0 draws are frustratingly boring. Introducing penalty shoot-outs, now part of World Cup Final play, at the end of overtime draws are great for televised drama and in-stadium excitement. More than one billion people watched the 2014 final between Germany and Argentina. Time is slightly on Morocco’s side. Well, the clock anyway. If the US/MEX/CAN bid won, it would mean many games being played while it was midnight or later throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East. 7. Airbnb? In the run-up to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, in response to foreign and domestic traveler complaints about price gouging among some hotels, the nation’s tourism minister vowed an investigation. For 2026, Moroccan authorities will likely have to calibrate long-standing tourism regulations and practices to meet the needs of the sharing economy, from an influx of discount air carriers and private yachts to couch surfing in residential homes. 8. Creating jobs. Quantifying the number of short-term jobs created by a specific short-duration event is fairly straightforward, especially construction jobs. Cape Town’s Green Point Stadium, built for the 2010 World Cup, utilized about 2,300 on-site workers, and several hundred short-term sub-contractor workers. Providing construction jobs for the rural and urban unemployed would lead to a noticeable short-term bounce in the Moroccan economy. 9. How much is a ticket? Ticket prices for World Cup tournaments fluctuate wildly based on seating location, early or knock-out round play, host county national or overseas visitor, multi-game package or single-game ticket. Russia 2018 utilizes a two-stage ticket buying process; the first stage was reserved for those wanting venue-specific tickets or those wanting to see specific teams during the tournament. A single-game group match ticket will cost about $90, much lower, though, for Russian nationals: $24. Brazil 2014 offered discounts to Brazilian students, the elderly and low income ($15); the most expensive seat for the finals match was $990. Morocco 2026, too, would likely have a large number of discounted tickets available for citizens. 10. The intangibles of Morocco.  From the incredible diversity of landscape and people to the kingdom’s reputation for world-class hospitality to the wholehearted embrace of tolerance, Morocco’s bid will benefit from many things that can be measured, and many that cannot. Good luck, Morocco. June 13 approaches. The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not represent any institution or entity.  © Morocco World News.

Rabat – A bomb attack on a police station in Colombia killed five policemen while more than 40 others were injured on Saturday, January 27. The bombing took place as police officers were gathered to receive morning assignments outside the station in Barranquilla, a city and municipality located in northern Colombia. International media reported that the attack was in vengeance for a police crackdown on drug smuggling and criminal cartel activity in the city. According to British news outlet BBC, police are offering a reward of 50 million pesos for information that may help identify any suspects. The city’s police have already arrested a 31-year suspect. According to the Colombian daily newspaper El Tiempo, the detained suspect was arrested near the police station in possession of radio equipment and floor plans of the building. Authorities believe that the explosive device was planted in the station earlier and then remotely detonated. The majority of the injured officers are in stable condition, but several others are listed in serious condition. Colombia’s President Juan Manuel Santos described the attack as “cowardly”, adding that authorities would be tireless in their investigation until they have arrested everyone who was involved.

Rabat – Three Egyptian football clubs, including Al Ahly and Zamalek, are keen to sign Morocco’s newest football star, Ayoub El Kaabi, reported Moroccan newspaper Assabah. The 24-year old has been delivering world-class performances while playing with the Moroccan national team during the 2018 African Nations Championship (CHAN), which is currently underway in Morocco. The footballer has scored six goals during the tournament. El Kaabi, who is currently playing with Renaissance Sportive de Berkan (RSB), previously played with Raja of Casablanca during the 2016-17 season. El Kaabi made his first international debut for Morocco last week against Mauritania, scoring 2 goals during his first match in the 2018 CHAN. He also shined in Morocco’s second match with a magical hat-trick against Guinea on January 17. CHAN 2018 provides an opportunity for footballers to prove their skills and capabilities in the hopes of attracting international offers. Recently, Saudi Arabia’s top-ranked Al Hilal football club recently raided Wydad of Casablanca, enticing its star footballer, Achraf Bencharki, to Saudi Arabia with a lucrative USD 9 million deal. Bencharki’s transfer might be bad news for Wydad of Casablanca, but the player will still compete with the Moroccan team during the remainder of CHAN 2018, according to Assabah. Both Bencharki and El Kaabi are significant players for the Moroccan national team. Sports observers expect both players to make the roster of the Atlas Lions team, managed by Herve Renard, for the upcoming 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. It is unsure whether El Kaabi would accept any potential deals. Do you think lucrative offers would help El Kaabi further his professional career?

Rabat – Twelve camels have been disqualified from an annual camel beauty contest in Saudi Arabia. The reason? They were found to have Botox injections to make their features look more attractive. According to United Arab Emirates newspaper The National, Saudi media reported that a veterinarian was caught giving camels plastic surgery, including Botox injections – for shapely humps, pouty lips, as well as smaller ears – to make the camels appear more delicate. Some 30,000 camels were brought to the 2018 King Abdulaziz Camel Festival, the largest camel pageant in the Gulf, which takes place in Al Dhana, near Riyadh, and runs in January.  Ali Al Mazrouei, the son of a top Emirati breeder, told the newspaper that some breeders “cheat” and use Botox for “the lips, the nose, the upper lips, the lower lips and even the jaw,” to enhance the camels’ features.  “It makes the head more inflated so when the camel comes it’s like, ‘Oh look at how big that head is. It has big lips, a big nose.’” “The people who are just in the camel competition to make it more valuable, they are cheating everyone. A fine should be applied. In camel racing, whoever is using drugs is fined about 50,000 Dirhams in Abu Dhabi. Fines are not yet applied to beauty camels,” Al Mazrouei added. Meanwhile, the Festival’s organizers set a number of regulations against rules violators. “In case of fraud to change the natural form of participating camels, the participant shall be excluded immediately, with the offender being deprived of participation in this session and at least next five sessions of the Festival, based on the report of the Special Committee.”  Possible legal penalties against transgressors are also included in accordance with the kingdom’s Animal Welfare Act.  A total of USD 57 million is awarded to winners of the contests and camel races, with more than USD 31.8 million reserved for pageantry alone.

By Tamba Francois Koundounou Rabat- Britain’s Minister of State for the Middle East and North Africa, Alistair Burt, expressed his country’s desire to strengthen bilateral ties with Morocco yesterday during his visit to the Kingdom. In a press release from his meeting with Moroccan State Secretary Mounia Boucetta  at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Alistair Burt spoke positively of the “fruitful meeting” and historical ties between Britain and Morocco, saying that “Although historical, relations between his country and Morocco are oriented towards the future,” especially in the current Brexit climate. Mr. Burt said that Britain is well-disposed to Morocco for which it has “great esteem.” This visit, he also said, is part of Britain’s interest in maintaining and strengthening relations with its friend states, of which Morocco. “In our exchanges, we shared our visions and ambitions regarding tourism, commerce, agriculture, sport, and culture,” Burt said, underlining that the two countries are jointly prepared to face security threats, which he explained require “active cooperation.” As far as the Western Sahara question is concerned, Mr. Burt praised Morocco’s “genuine and serious efforts” in finding a sustainable and feasible political solution; he also renewed his support for the UN mission charged with finding a solution to “the problem.” During Burt’s two-day working visit, he met with several of his Moroccan counterparts, such as Aziz Akhannouch, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Rural Development, and Mohamed Sajid, Minister of Tourism, Air-Transport, Handcrafts, and the Social Economy, in the spirit of extending his country’s willingness to consolidate bilateral ties with Morocco,

Rabat – The UN Personal Envoy’s invitations to the relevant parties to resume negotiations over the Western Sahara conflict, came at the right time, professor of international relations Tajeddine El Houssaini said.  Moroccan analysts and political observers differ in their opinions about the invitations that the United Nations Personal Envoy, Horst Kohler, sent to Morocco and the Polisario on January 23. For El Houssaini, Kohler’s invitations come at the right time for many reasons. In an interview with Al Ghad Tv, the Moroccan analyst said that the UN Secretary-General typically prepares a report on the Western Sahara situation in March, which is later submitted to UN Security Council in April. El Houssaini said that the UNSG Personal Envoy “was supposed to submit a paper  to the Security Council on the situation after his appointment.” Since October 2017, Kohler visited Morocco several times. Recently, he met with King Mohammed VI with  Algerian officials and representatives of the Polisario Front at the camps of Tindouf.” Speaking about Kohler’s strategy, El Houssaini recalled Kohler’s ten-day tour to Europe and Africa. In an effort to end the four-decade-long conflict over Western Sahara conflict, Kohler held talks with EU officials in Brussels and AU leaders in Addis Ababa to discuss the issue. The Moroccan political expert emphasized that this as an opportunity for EU and AU leaders to propose solutions to help the UN to find a lasting and mutually acceptable solution the conflict. Regarding the launch of negotiations, the analyst said that “this new approach is in line with the recent Security Council resolution, which called on the parties to resume negotiations on the basis of a dialogue” between all  the parties involved, including Mauritania and Algeria. While El Houssaini seems positive about Kohler’s invitations to resume negotiations, Moroccan political analyst Reda El Fellah sees Morocco’s potential participation as a “political error.” For El Fellah, Morocco should not get involved in these negotiations, especially after “the provocative actions and military maneuvers carried out by the Polisario Front with the recent support of Algeria near Guerguerat.” El Fallah believes that these illegal armed operations by the separatist front near the buffer zone reflect the unwillingness of Polisario to reach a just and mutually acceptable solution, adding that the launch of negotiations is irrelevant. He added that Morocco’s involvement would give the impression that Morocco knuckles under the separatist group’s recent provocations at the level of the international community. The political analyst added that if Morocco sits at the same table with the separatist front, which has been claiming independent statehood, it would be a “diplomatic and political error, because it will give the separatist group the legitimacy they cannot afford and will enrich their hope to get regional and international support.” El Fellah, who is also a university professor in Agadir, told Morocco World News that “the process of negotiations could not be successful without a powerful meditation, adding,“The UN mediation alone is not enough, knowing the lack of real pressure on the Polisario and Algeria to look for compromise and [a] win-win agreement.”

Rabat – The Saudi young man Khalid al-Shaeri, who had been dubbed the world’s heaviest man, has now successfully lost more than 500 kilograms of weight following an intensive hospital fitness routine for a period of four years, reported Alarabiya. The 26-year-old weighed nearly 610 kilograms at his heaviest and had not left his bed for three years before he was taken by medical aircraft to King Fahd Medical City in Riyadh to undergo treatment at the request of the late King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia in 2013. About 30 medical staff members and civil defence workers joined forces to lift the young man with a special fork-lift truck ordered from the United States and flew him to the capital. After one year of intensive treatment, Al-Shaeri lost more than 320 kilograms. Aa’ed Al-Qahtani, head of the medical team supervising Shaeri’s treatment, told Sayidaty magazine that “Shaeri’s health is continuing to improve at a steady rate.” “He has improved heart and lung function, reduced inflammation, and improved muscle strength, including the ability to move his feet. A massive custom-made wheelchair was built to help Shaari become more mobile and aid his physical therapy,” al-Qahtani said.  Al-Shaeri, whose weight has now fallen to 66 kilograms, is undergoing cosmetic surgery to remove the adenoids left over by obesity for 10 years. According to a 2013 U.N. report, people in the Gulf are among the fattest in the world. Kuwait fared the worst among Gulf states, with 42.8 percent of its adult population considered severely overweight. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are not far behind, with 35.2 percent and 33.1 percent respectively.

Rabat – The Nigerian minister of sports and youth, Solomon Dalung, expressed Thursday his full support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid.  “It is a support for Morocco, but also for Africa, which has only organized the World Cup once in nearly 100 years,” the minister said to Maghreb Arab Press. Dalung highlighted the support as “beneficial” for the two African countries that are striving to show a positive image to the world and consolidate their leadership in football. He pointed out that Morocco is “renowned for its stability, hospitality and prosperity” The Nigerian minister emphasized that Morocco and Nigeria need to develop cooperation in all areas, notably sports and youth. “We believe in the potential of Morocco and Africa in all sectors, we believe that football can be a way to facilitate cooperation and consolidate the development of partnership relations,” Dalung said. Nigeria is not the first country to announce its support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. Three weeks ago, the president of the Confederation of African Football, Ahmad Ahmad, announced his support for Morocco’s World Cup bid for the second time. In a press conference held in Casablanca on Jan. 13, Ahmad said “There is no room for discussions. As CAF president, it is an obligation for me to support Morocco’s bid.”  The first time was three days after Morocco’s candidacy submission, Ahmad called on heads of football confederations in Africa to show support for Morocco’s bid. The CAF president said that it is a must for Africans to show “clear” and “massive” support for Morocco as it is determined to become the second African country to host the football event. Fouzi Lekjaa, president of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation, confirmed in a press conference held in Casablanca on Tuesday that Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup represents the African continent as a whole.

Rabat – In 2012, the Chinese government “graciously offered” African States a gift and constructed the African Union’s headquarters in Addis Ababa.  The act of soft diplomacy proved to be a rather self-serving maneuver to spy on the activities and discussions being conducted by leaders of the exclusive continental group. In Addis Ababa, ministers and heads of states meet twice a year to discuss major continental issues. While strict security measures give the impression that that building is closely monitored and secured, an unseen security threat was present from 2012 until 2017. The threat was from none other than those who built the headquarters: the Chinese. An investigation conducted by “Le Monde Afrique” exposed Chinese espionage efforts. According to the report, for five years, between midnight and 2 a.m., computer servers were reaching a peak in data transfer activity. A computer scientist noticed the oddity of the situation. The organization’s technical staff later discovered that the AU servers were all connected to servers located in Shanghai. Every night, the secrets of the AU were being stored more than 8,000 km away by what was thought to be a diplomatic ally of Africa. The glass tower $200 million complex was gifted to the African Union in 2012. The computer systems were fully equipped by the Chinese, allowing them to open an undocumented portal that gives Chinese administrators access to the AU’s computing system. This “backdoor” is an intentional fault put into code to allow hackers and intelligence agencies to gain illicit access to information. “Following this discovery, we have taken some steps to strengthen our cybersecurity,” a AU official told Le Monde. But at least, “The Chinese have nothing to listen to. They have never colonized us. They have supported the struggles of independence on the continent and help us economically today,” an AU official told Le Monde anonymously. Another official believes that, “They are not alone.” In fact, the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British intelligence agencies (GCHQ) have had their share of surveillance on the AU building, according to documents which were extracted by Le Monde, in collaboration with The Intercept. After the Chinese effort was exposed, the AU acquired its own servers and declined China’s offer to configure them. The AU encrypts all electronic communications and, from now on, the highest officials of the institution have foreign telephone lines and more secure communication applications. They have also taken more strict security measures: cybersecurity experts inspected the building’s rooms and disposed of microphones placed under the desks and in walls by the Chinese workers.

Rabat – Morocco’s Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, is expected to fly to Addis Ababa on Saturday afternoon to represent King Mohammed VI at the 30th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the African Union (AU). The news of the prime minister’s trip was reported by Elaph on Thursday, January 25. The summit of Africa’s leaders is scheduled to begin at AU headquarters in Addis Ababa tomorrow, January 28.  El Othmani will be join Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Nasser Bourita, who is representing Morocco at the 32nd Ordinary session of the African Union’s executive council that opened on Thursday, January 25. Migration issues likely will take center stage at the summit.  In 2017, King Mohammed VI was appointed as the AU’s lead on issues of migration. Moroccan officials are expected to give a detailed presentation of the union’s priorities and solutions for the issue that are based on the efforts undertaken by the King during 2017. The presentation will likely call for a comprehensive African agenda to deal with the issue that affects countries across the entire continent. King Mohammed VI has called on member nations to double their efforts to tackle the problem. Last year, the King outlined to Guinean President Alfa Conde, at the opening of the 29th AU summit, concrete steps for moving forward on the issue. The strategy document was transmitted by Prince Moulay Rachid who represented the King at the previous summit.  The summit will also be marked by AU leadership transfer from Guinea’s Alpha Condé, incumbent President of the African Union, to Rwanda’s Paul Kagame who will preside over the continental organization for the coming year. The AU summit will also be marked by the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Guterres will meet on Saturday with Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union Commission. The UN’s top official will also hold a number of bilateral meetings with several heads of state and government before attending the Opening Ceremony of the 30th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union on Sunday where he will deliver a statement, according to the UNSG spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric. The Secretary-General will also participate in a high-level outreach event entitled “Renewed Partnership to End Hunger in Africa by 2025 – Five Years Later”. He will also deliver remarks at a meeting of the AU Peace and Security Council.  Yesterday, Morocco was selected by AU members to represent the North Africa region on the council.

Rabat – After more than two months of detention in Riyadh’s luxurious Ritz-Carlton hotel, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal was released on Saturday according to a family source cited by Reuters. “He has arrived home,” one source in Prince Alwaleed’s family told Reuters. The 62-year-old Bin Talal was taken into custody in late November along with 200 dignitaries and top officials, over allegations of money laundering, corruption and extortion. The massive, unprecedented purge came hours after a Saudi royal decree announced the formation of an anti-corruption commission headed by the Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who promptly ordered a high-profile cabinet reshuffle, claiming that over USD 100 billion had been lost to embezzlement and corruption in the past decades. The news of Prince Bin Talal’s arrest made headlines worldwide, sending shock waves both through the Arabic speaking world and international major financial circles. The billionaire is not only renowned for his progressivist ideologies, but also for his impressive wealth. With a fortune of USD 18 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index, Bin Talal controls the Kingdom Holding investment firm, and owns major stakes in News Corp, Citigroup, Twitter and many other international corporations. The prince also owns many satellite television networks watched across the Arab world. The shares in Kingdom Holding, an international investment company of which 95 percent is owned by Bin Talal, fell by 9.9 percent the day after the crackdown. In late December, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Saudi authorities had ordered Prince Al Waleed bin Talal to pay at least USD 6 billion in exchange for his freedom. According to Bin Talal’s lawyer Salah Al-Hejailan, who used to work with him, the Saudi prince was “struggling to persuade the government to take a stake within his company, Kingdom Holding, which has a market value of nearly USD 9 billion, in exchange for freedom and to remain in control of his firms.” A senior Saudi official told the daily that Prince Alwaleed’s release had come about after “a financial settlement was reached with the attorney general,” adding the prince returned home at 11.00 A.M., without providing further details on the terms.

Rabat – Mohammed V mosque will be reconstructed as part of  Al Hoceima’s “Manarat Al Mutawassit” development projects, according to a statement issued by Al Hoceima’s provincial prefecture. Earlier this week, Moroccan news outlets reported that the reconstruction of the mosque started on January 24. The statement said, “To respond to information reported by the press about the launch of the reconstruction and extension of the Mohammed V mosque in the city of Al Hoceima, the reconstruction and extension of this mosque is included in Manarat Al Mutawassit project launched on October 17, 2017.” The statement, which was reported by Maghreb Arab Press, added that the mosque project is being implemented under the auspices of the Ministry of Islamic Affairs. The mosque was placed on the list of the planned projects for Al Hoceima after several laboratories carried out a technical examination. The examination revealed that the building “constitutes a danger for the safety of worshippers” who perform daily prayers at the same mosque. The statement added that “in order to ensure the safety of the worshipers, local authorities, in collaboration with the provincial delegation of Islamic Affairs, have provisionally arranged a room next to the mosque, where worshipers can perform their prayers.”

Rabat – Moroccan authorities announced “their categorical rejection of the false allegations” in the Human Rights Watch (HRW) 2017 Report on Thursday. Following the release of HRW’s annual report on the situation of human rights in Morocco and the world in 2017, made public on January 18, 2018, Moroccan authorities express their utter rejection of false allegations and accusations contained in the report. The false allegation of primary concern deals with the trial of the individuals prosecuted in connection with events in Al Hoceima. In its report, HRW states,“There are spaces to express dissent in Morocco, but when it comes to sustained and mass protest, the police and the judiciary tend to shut down protests and neutralize activists in short order.” “If Morocco is to set itself apart from the region’s downward trend on rights, it needs to release all Rif protesters detained or convicted for nonviolent assembly or speech,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. Moroccan authorities consider these allegations baseless. “What confirms the unsubstantiated nature of HRW’s allegations is that the case is still before the court, which has not yet made a ruling,” says one statement by the Inter-ministerial Delegation for Human Rights. Concerning the alleged murder of 11 members of the security forces by 24 Sahrawis, HRW recalled that the court sentenced nearly all of the defendants to jail sentences ranging from 20 years to life, similar to the sentences that the military court handed them in 2013.” The verdict asserted, “The court relied on the original police statements from 2010, which the defendants rejected as false.” The Moroccan authorities affirm that the criminal chamber of Rabat’s Appeals Court granted the defendants a fair trial, as proven by trial observations from the National Human Rights Council (CNDH),which acts as an independent national institution accredited with status “A” by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions. “The allegations made by the NGO are nothing more than a reiteration of the claims of the enemies of Morocco’s territorial integrity,” says the authorities. Responding to HRW’s  claims of the “systematic prohibition” of gatherings in the southern provinces of the Kingdom, the public authorities claim that “This allegation is not based on realistic data, since the management of non-peaceful or unauthorized gatherings is done in accordance with the laws and the international commitments of Morocco in the field of human rights.” The authorities then went on to list “a number of peaceful demonstrations and rallies organized in all the Kingdom’s provinces,” which totaled 11,752 gatherings in 2016, including 755 in the southern provinces. While categorically rejecting the allegations and stances that “aim to underestimate national efforts in the field of human rights and the guarantees of a fair trial ensured by the independent judiciary,”  the authorities state that human rights in Morocco continue to improve and “advances can only be praised by a fair organization.”

Rabat – Arthur Wagner, a leading member of far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party known for its anti-Muslim rhetoric, recently resigned his leading post within the party after deciding to become a Muslim, a party spokesperson confirmed. Wagner, who has been a member of the party since 2015, left the AFD on January 11. It was later revealed that he converted to Islam. The 48-year-old refused to comment on his decision, telling the daily newspaper Tagesspiegel that his resignation and conversion were his “private business,” adding that no one in AfD had attempted to pressure him into resigning. “I only learned about Wagner’s conversion in a telephone conversation with him a few days later,” Andreas Kalbitz, AfD’s state chairman told CNN. “I was very surprised, he has been very active in the Christian wing of the party,” Kalbitz added. The AfD became Germany’s third largest party in parliament after last September’s general election. According to the AFD’s member , Warner was heavily involved in campaigning for the party whose slogans included, “Islam does not belong in Germany” and warnings against what it calls the “Islamisation” of the country. After being a leading a party that has contested the presence of Muslims in Germany so strongly, the news of Warner’s conversion to Islam sparked derision and mockery on social media: Creeping Sharia picks up speed as politician from Germany’s islamophobic AfD converts to Islamhttps://t.co/Wz0Nwobtuw — Emily Dische-Becker (@Emilydische) January 23, 2018  I really don’t understand Nazis. https://t.co/NMQ8sE3jOP — Mark Berry ??

Rabat – A delegation of the Polisario Front, led by the separatist group leader, Ibrahim Ghali, held a meeting on Thursday in Berlin, Germany with Horst Kohler, the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations for Western Sahara. The news was announced by Moroccan news outlet Le360, which quoted an unidentified source from Germany. The meeting came only a few days after Kohler addressed invitations to the relevant parties to the Western Sahara conflict to separate talks to be held in Germany in January and February, the daily press briefing issued by Stephane Dujarric, the spokesman for the United Nations Secretary-General on Tuesday 23 said. The Moroccan government, according to a source quoted by Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum, seems “reluctant” to meet with Polisario. Many Moroccan political observers believe that this is not the “appropriate time” for such an invitation. Reda El Fallah told Morocco World News on January 24 that “the process of negotiations could not be successful without a powerful meditation. “The UN mediation alone is not enough knowing the lack of real pressure on Polisario and Algeria to look for compromise and [a] win-win agreement,” he added. The political analyst added that if Morocco sits at the same table with the separatist front, which has been claiming independent statehood, it would be a “diplomatic and political error, because it will give the separatist group the legitimacy they cannot afford and will enrich their hope to get regional and international support.” The Moroccan government has not made any statement about whether it would accept Kohler’s invitations for negotiations with the front. Kohler has also sent invitations to Mauritania and Algeria, which has been supported the front and its claim for independence. Algeria has been also providing the separatist group with military equipment, which were used in live ammunition near the Guerguerat buffer zone. Polisario has been breaking a ceasefire agreement signed with Morocco in 1991 as part of the peace process to end the four-decade-long conflict. The separatist front has been carrying out illegal armed maneuvers and threatening the future of peace talks regarding the conflict. “The provocative actions and military maneuvers carried out by the Polisario front with the recent support of Algeria near Guerguerat confirms the lack of the willingness to reach a just and mutually acceptable solution,” El Fellah added. The political analyst told MWN that Morocco cannot accept Kohler’s invitation to negotiate with Polisario at this time. “At the level of the international community, this [move] would give the impression that Morocco knuckles under the Separatist group’s recent maneuvers in Guergarate.” Mustapha Salma Oueld Sidi Mouloud, a Polisario Front dissident and a former police chief in the Tindouf camps said in a Facebook post earlier this week that Polisario’s strategy in Guerguerat is a losing battle. The Polisario dissident said that the front can never dare engage in open war in the buffer zone.  “Any military action carried out by Polisario in those areas is totally a suicide,” a truth that Polisario, Morocco and MINURSO are “fully aware of,” he said.

By Tamba Francois Koundouno Rabat – In January last year, Morocco joined the African Union after three decades of absence. “It is so good to be back home, after having been away for too long”. Such were the words of King Mohamed VI as he spoke to his African counterparts on the “historic day” that marked Morocco’s readmission to the continental body. And one year later, it seems that it is indeed “good to be back home.” Morocco, in effect, just one year after its readmission, was elected, earlier today, to North Africa’s seat in AU’s Peace and Security Council. Morocco will take over Algeria’s place in AU’ Peace and Security Council, as the latter, which held North Africa’s seat in the organ from 2016-2018, chose not to run for the renewal of a mandate that ends this month. Speaking to the press after this election to one of “AU’s most strategic organs”, Nasser Bourita said that Morocco’s election is a vibrant testimony to the trust that African leaders have in their Moroccan counterpart, a result, he added, “of the king’s commitment to solidarity” in the continent. In what was his first public reaction to the election, Bourita stressed that “this important election” evinces the expanding credibility that the kingdom has secured in the continent. That credibility, Bourita said, is the culmination of “King Mohamed VI’s genuine and constructive implication” in vital policy concerns for Africa. The election is, Bourita further explained, “an acknowledgement of Morocco’s unfailing reliability in humanitarian and peace-keeping actions in Africa.” “Morocco is one of the rare countries to have participated in many peace-keeping operations”, Bourita said, upbeat, while adding that Morocco will use its two-year mandate to ensure stability and security across the continent. Bourita spoke of some “opposing forces” that had tried to block Morocco’s accession to the seat, stressing that winning this “strategic seat” will allow Morocco to “impede all manipulations and instrumentalizing strategies” that “some parties” have been deploying for the past years. This win has a particular significance considering Morocco’s very recent return to the Panafrican organization, Bourita also said, underlining that, as the king Mohamed said while joining the AU, “Morocco is not joining to divide, but to share and contribute.” It is this “royal orientation” towards peace and cooperation that will be the driving force of Moroccan diplomacy in AU’s Peace and Security Council, Bourita concluded. Meanwhile, some specialists and concerned actors have saluted Morocco’s presence in the Panafrican organization, calling the kingdom “a positive force”. Adama Gaye, a renowned Senegalese journalist, scholar and political commentator, said that Morocco’s presence in Africa’s strategic affairs can prove fruitful in meeting the continent’s economic and security concerns.

Rabat – Morocco’s return to the African Union has proved to be fruitful. On Friday, Tanzanian Foreign Minister Augustine Mahiga said that Morocco is establishing itself as a key player in several strategic fields related to development, peace and security. “Morocco’s contribution to the AU is of great importance,” said Mahiga. Mahiga voiced his statement on the sidelines of the 32nd ordinary session of the AU’s executive council which is currently taking place at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Recalling King Mohammed VI “historical” speech delivered during the 28th AU Summit in January 2017, Mahiga said the country’s return to the AU was supported by the vast majority of the members of the Pan African organization. The Tanzanian official said that, “the royal speech was very encouraging. It is a forward-looking speech that has defined Morocco’s expectations among its African family.” Mahiga expressed his satisfaction of Morocco’s vision regarding the issue of immigration in Africa. “The African family has placed their trust in the King by asking the sovereign to take charge of this very important issue,” he said. Mahiga described Morocco’s contribution towards the issue of immigration in the continent as, “very constructive,” since immigration is one of the issues that is the subject of critical diplomatic discussions within Africa, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). “We are impressed by Morocco’s openness,” said the Tanzanian diplomat. Speaking at the AU’s Peace &amp; Security Council, Mahiga believes that Morocco can play an eminent role as a new member of the AU Peace &amp; Security Council, which he described as, “one of the most important organs of the Pan-African Organization.” “A Moroccan seat on the Council will offer the country a better opportunity to reinforce its valuable contribution to the areas of peace and security in Africa.” In his remarks, Mahiga lauded Morocco’s role in peacekeeping issues within Africa dating back to the creation of the Organization of African Unity. He recalled the deployment of Moroccan soldiers as peacekeepers in Congo during the 1960s. This is a “very constructive” role that Morocco plays in the UN, he said. He was confident that Morocco’s solidarity with the AU will always be appreciated. He emphasized that Morocco has always responded voluntarily and without hesitation to the calls of solidarity with its African brothers. Bilateral Relations Between Tanzania and Morocco Mahiga discussed Moroccan-Tanzania bilateral relations. The official said that that the historic visit paid by the King to Tanzania in 2016 had opened wide new perspectives for Moroccan-Tanzanian cooperation in new sectors with promising opportunities. The King signed 21 bilateral agreements with the Tanzanian president. The agreements were intended to encourage greater economic relations between the two countries.

Rabat – Facing recurring criticism from international human rights organizations on the condition of human rights in the county, the Government spokesperson responded yesterday saying that the Government, “does not neglect or deny the presence of certain weaknesses” and continues to remedy these shortcomings. “Morocco’s willingness is firm in handling responsibly and vigorously the issue of human rights,” said Mustapha El Khalfi during a Rabat press briefing on Thursday following the Government’s cabinet meeting. Against claims that the government is turning a blind eye to human rights, El Khalfi said that, “on the contrary, the Kingdom’s approach is based on the responsible handling of this issue.”  He explained that Morocco has adopted a national plan of action for the promotion of human rights to correct anomalies and deficiencies within the government’s human rights policy. Progress is being made, he said. The National Human Rights Council (CNDH) established, for the first time, a national mechanism for the prevention of torture, reinforcing the Kingdom’s long-standing policy in this area. Meanwhile, extensive work is underway in partnership with civil society institutions working in this field, as well as at the level of the Justice Ministry and the State Secretariat for Human Rights, in order to promote respect for human rights and put into practice the national plan of action. The plan, first adopted in 2008, includes more than 400 measures which represent the country’s framework for strengthening human rights across the nation, he concluded. On January 25, the Government categorically denied allegations made in a 2017 Human Rights Watch report that revealed several alleged reversals in the condition of human rights and civil liberties in Morocco.

Rabat – Morocco’s shift from the association with the Middle East towards embracing its African identity is evidenced in yet another step: the third annual gathering in Fez, which included the celebration of the “Afrique Central” Music. The theme of the gathering is “Africa for Africans”, and it explores Morocco’s role as a bridge between countries, continents, politics and culture. The four-day event is organized by local Moroccans in partnership with other organizations, such as the Cervantes Institute, and explores an assortment of artistic expressions ranging from photography and music to Sufism, contemporary African art, and linguistic exchange. The shift, however, is also reflected in geopolitical moves. Rejoining the African Union after 33 years of absence, Morocco seeks to integrate itself within the other African countries, and to prevent the domination of Algeria on the Western Sahara issue.  Algeria had used Morocco’s absence to promote its own position, in support of Polisario, which threatened Morocco’s national sovereignty. However, this development means more than a diplomatic maneuver in response to an old adversary. It also represents a move away from Europe’s stagnating markets towards the growing economies in Africa’s southern countries. Morocco is taking the initiative to be seen as an indigenous and involved part of the region, rather than merely an Arab state that happened to be physically located in Africa. Indeed, Morocco’s policies, starting with its Constitution, emphasize its diverse and multicultural identity. In pursuit of the new policy, King Mohammed VI went on a tour of African countries through December, January and February of 2017. He engaged more closely with other African leaders, including the President of Nigeria, launching strategic partnerships on a variety of business fronts. Morocco remains a staunch Western ally; her closer union to Africa is an important opportunity for the United States to build bridges to the continent that for decades have been closely associated with development aid, diseases, wars, and corruption than with entrepreneurship, trade, and culture Renaissance. Indeed, the overwhelming focus on the Western Sahara issue in the US media’s coverage of Morocco’s return to the African Union illustrates just how much of the bigger picture the Western media is missing in its failure to ask basic questions and its engagement in shallow, predictable copy-cat analysis.  And the bigger picture is this: Morocco is looking to become a leader in Africa. It already plays that role with developing the world’s largest solar power plant. Likewise, in his effort to modernize the country, the king has taken on corruption in a transparent constitutional move, that leaves no lingering questions. He first launched an audit in a probe of unfulfilled promises related to the development the Northern Moroccan city of Al Hoceima, in response to seven-month-long-protest movements. As a result of the probe, several senior officials were sacked and banned from holding public office. That is an important signal to send to the country, and likewise follows a concerted movement to disassociate the country from the corrupt image of the Middle East, and towards the growth-oriented hub of African countries. The move towards the embrace of its African identity for Morocco is as symbolic as it is pragmatic.  Hoping to project its role as a bridge between continents and cultures does not mean completely giving up the remnants of its Arab identity; rather, for Morocco, it means embracing pluralism, while taking on a more complex and subtle role. Taking on an economic lead, exercising soft power, such as retraining imams from all over Africa, in a quintessentially African (Maaliki) tradition of Islam, but through the lens of Moroccan tolerance, providing development aid to other African countries Meanwhile, Morocco is also engaging in joint ventures and projects that will benefit the populations of these countries and not merely their leadership. These are all signs that Morocco is taking on an assertive forward-looking policy that will bring into the league of influencers with a lot to share with the world, and away from the European Union’s bureaucratic nattering. Indeed, this movement provides the United States with much greater opportunities for engagement with Morocco, and through Morocco, with other African countries – on trade, culture, and business opportunities, than ever before. As European Union becomes increasingly less relevant, Morocco, nevertheless, seeks to grow, modernize, and engage in innovative business ventures.  The US is much better suited for that role, with its orientation towards more liberal markets, and pursuit of trade policies that will give increased opportunity to American workers. Strengthening and engaging in additional bilateral treaties with Morocco, engaging in joint ventures on assorted private business projects, and finding a friendly bridge towards investing into entrepreneurial ventures in other African countries is the sort of visionary foreign policy that would bring the United States to a position of international greatness in a positive and welcome manner, in more than just rhetoric. Politically, too, Morocco has more to offer in its growing role as an African, rather than Middle Eastern countries. This new dimension to its identity allows Morocco to maintain a staunchly independent political position. By remaining outside the fray of assorted Middle Eastern conflicts and disputes, Morocco can play a positive role in two ways: First, by exercising a subtle moderating influence against the proxy conflicts in Africa. Most recently, these conflicts have played out through religion: Iran and Saudi Arabia have tried to use soft power through mosques and religious organizations to recruit adherents; Iran has been winning the influence game. However, Morocco’s rise to prominence in Africa, can provide a more moderate alternative to Wahhabism and Iran’s support for violent Shi’a groups throughout Western Africa.  The second issue is the Gulf Crisis, which now has made its way into Africa, threatening regional stability even up to the point of the potential war between Egypt and Sudan. Morocco’s neutrality in the standoff between Qatar and Saudi Arabia and UAE has proved prescient – and much easier to maintain as an African, rather than a Middle Eastern country, which would have been forced to choose loyalties.  Indeed, Morocco has the legitimacy and solid relations with all involved states to play a credible moderator in this crisis, while maintaining distance from its immediate effects. Having this neutral, regionally accepted, moderator as an ally is a very positive development for the United States, which has been caught between the rock and the hard place while off-guard.  Morocco’s own geopolitical interests come into play. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and UAE have all been supportive of Algeria over the Western Sahara issue; Al Jazeera has been critical of Sisi, which is likewise beneficial to Morocco while the tensions remain in place.  At the same time, maintaining relations with Qatar may help Morocco talk the Emir out of the position of brinksmanship, which he has adopted in response to the Saudi-UAE blockade and ultimatum.  The US has not been significantly involved in the Western Sahara issue under Trump; economic relations with Morocco are far more important to the administration than diplomatic entanglements in other countries’ long-standing conflicts. Staying out of that conflict and developing closer business, security, and cultural relations with Morocco is the best thing the administration can do.  Morocco’s potential role in deescalating the Gulf Crisis can only help in the growth of these relations. The United States houses an important naval base with Qatar; it has engaged in extensive joined training. US has also concluded important arms deals with both Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Some have postulated that at least in part, the escalation of the Gulf Crisis has been over historic regional rivalries, and the wish to see the US move its base to UAE from Qatar. Whether that disingenuous position is truly behind the somewhat deceptive presentation of the conflict to President Trump at the outset is hard to tell; what is true, however, is that Qatar has not yet agreed to any of the demands made by its Gulf neighbors, but some of those demands are of direct interests to the United States. Whether or not Qatar and the Saudis will ever come to an agreement over Al Jazeera is impossible to predict at the current juncture; Morocco can also play a positive role in helping to reach an understanding over the other demands made by the Gulf States, and which could ultimately serve the region well by strengthening the relationships inside the GCC against the common regional threats, such as sectarian violence and terrorist infiltration.  King Mohammed VI has been at the forefront of the battle against extremist inside Morocco; the Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, has been an ideological threat, solidly behind the revolutionary Islamist influences which Morocco seeks to eradicate from Africa through more moderate education of imams. That is precisely the issue that can bring Morocco and Egypt together; Sisi views Muslim Brotherhood as an existential threat and has designated it a terrorist organization, as did some of the other states. They have also encouraged the US to designate it as such. However, under the US law, Muslim Brotherhood, though indeed an ideological threat, would not be considered a terrorist organization because it has not been directly linked to any violence or terrorist attacks. Rather, it has been a funder/sponsor of various extremist regional groups, and many terrorists have been influenced by the Brotherhood’s education. Playing whack-a-mole with terrorist designations may bring the US closer to African countries and Middle Eastern state, but will not ultimately solve the problem. Rather, countering its ideological influence with positive alternatives, and cutting off funding that goes towards its proxies should be top priorities for all involved. The United States is in a sensitive position; Muslim Brotherhood-influenced groups are a potential threat to its troops in Qatar; furthermore, terrorist groups financed by the Muslim Brotherhood are a threat all over the Middle East, as well as in Africa. The US does not wish to limit its trade and relations with countries in the region; relocating its base would be a significant inconvenience. Nor does the US wish to be seen as having been played by the Saudis and UAE. Avoiding the deterioration of relations with Qatar is important to US geopolitical interests; no less, so, however, is maintaining solid relations with the Saudis/UAE block in the face of common threats, as well as business and trade opportunities. For that reason, having the Gulf Crisis go on indefinitely or escalate to the point where the US has to make painful choices is quite undesirable. Morocco’s position of having the credibility to help reach some reasonable compromise with respect to grave security considerations, while, as an African country, not being pushed around by either side may be that diplomatic solution to this ongoing and distracting headache. With the US focus now being on Iran and eradication of ISIS, the last thing it needs is to contend with fragmentation among its Middle Eastern allies; the crisis, actually plays right into the hands of Iran and terrorist groups, which are taking advantage of the division to sow further chaos, recruit allies, and distract the governments from its own direct threats to regional stability. Rather than continuing to maintain outward neutrality on the Gulf Crisis, the United States should work with Morocco to achieve a mutually beneficial solution through diplomacy and pragmatic, result-oriented step-by-step deescalation.

Rabat – The 32nd  ordinary session of AU’s Executive Council that opened yesterday in Addis-Ababa elected Morocco, earlier today, to AU’s Peace and Security Council. Morocco, which was North Africa’s sole candidate (Algeria, currently occupying the seat, had announced, earlier this month, that it would not run for renewal), was elected with 39 voices  in favor and 16 abstentions, more than the 3/2 needed to secure the regional seat in AU’s Peace and Security Council. The Peace and Security Council is AU’s body in charge of promoting “peace, security, and stability in Africa.” Today’s election grants Morocco a two-year mandate (2018-2020), which is renewable should the Kingdom decide to run again in 2020.

By François Koundouno Rabat – The president of the African Union commission launched, o, Thursday 25, the organization’s executive council. In his opening speech, Moussa Faki Mahamat stressed Africa’s financial independence, Paul Kagame’s (the new president of the AU) reforms, and the fight against corruption. These, Mahamat said, are Africa’s top priorities in 2018.  Still angry with Trump Opening the ceremony in Nelson Mandela Conference hall at the AU’s headquarters in Addis-Ababa, Mahamat said that “Africa has still not digested “Donald Trump’s utterly shocking, disdainful, hateful and exclusive statements.” Trump’s “shithole” declaration, together with his decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital show, according to Mahamat, that “multilateralism is facing a dire crisis”. “Africa must stand united; she must push towards more integration, peace, and prosperity” so that it can become “proud” and “earn the respect of the world”, Mahamat added. Corruption is a major impediment to Africa’s dream of sustainable growth and prosperity, Mahamat said. And so, to ensure a step forward in 2018, Africa must declare “a global war against corruption.” With the Rwandan president Paul Kagame as the new president of the African Union, the summit declared thee major axes as Africa’s top priorities in 2018, of which the launching of a free-trade zone. Moussa Mahamat talked about finalizing the 2016 project of a common AU market which will guarantee freedom of movement in the organization’s 55 member states. It is still unsettling that AU’s budget is in majority financed by foreign aid. In 2017, external contribution to the AU’s budget was 74%. The goal, Mahamat said, is to reduce such an “unbearable financial dependency” by reducing it to 59% in 2018.   Today’s opening was also marked by the election of the new members of AU’s Peace and Security Council. Discussions will also touch upon the coordination of African efforts for a more United African stance in international or multilateral organizations.

Rabat – The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) announced Portugal’s World Cup non-tournament “friendlies” are set to be played in Switzerland. The first match is scheduled on March 23 at Zurich’s Letzigrund Stadium, where they will face the Egyptian national football team. Three days later, on March 26, Portugal will face the Netherlands’ team at the Stadium of Geneva. Egypt is scheduled to play another friendly scrimmage with Bulgaria after its match against Portugal, on March 27. “Portugal plays Latin football, but it does not accurately mirror the style of South Americans,” said Hassan al Mestikawi of the independent Cairo-based newspaper, Al-Shorouk. “Bulgaria, on the other hand, is close to how the Russians play in terms of tactics.” “But what the Egyptians need the most is to play football superpowers like Germany or Brazil. The results could be painful for the Egyptians but playing them would shatter the wall of fear Egyptians have when playing big teams,” al Mestikawi added.

Rabat – The British gas company SDX Energy announced a new gas discovery in the Gharb basin Tuesday, three weeks after abandoning the ELQ-1 well located in its permit in Kenitra. The well, ONZ-7, is the fourth discovered by the company and one of five wells drilled as part of its nine-well campaign in Morocco. “The well was drilled to a depth of 1,167 meters and found a porosity of 35.3 percent, exceeding the initial forecasts of the company,” Paul Welch, CEO of SDX Energy, said in an official statement. According to the company, the well will be tested before being connected to the existing infrastructure. An update on the results of the tests will be announced in early February. SDX is an international oil and gas exploration, production and development company, headquartered in London with a principal focus on North Africa. The exploration company entered the Moroccan market in January after acquiring Circle Oil’s shares in Morocco for $30 million. The British company is now endowed with an eight-year permit to drill for gas in the Gharb basin. In addition, the company successfully renewed their permits for the Gueddari North-West, Gueddari South, Sidi Al Harati South-West, and Ksiri Center sites. These permits will expire in 2019, 2020, 2023 and 2023 respectively. In total, SDX Energy obtained licenses for seven drilling sites from the National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines. The latter holds 25 percent of working interests of SDX Energy’s activity in Morocco.

Slovenia is planning to recognize Palestine as an independent state in the upcoming months, Slovenian Foreign Minister Karl Erjavec announced on Tuesday.  According to the Slovenian Press Agency (STA), Erjavec said “Slovenia will pursue recognizing the Palestinian state on its own,” expecting that the National Assembly will discuss the recognition at a plenary in March or April.  Erjavec declared there was consensus between European Union (EU) member states, claiming that “everybody backs” Slovenia’s proposed move to recognize the Palestinian state.  Speaking on the local Slovenian channel POP TV, Erjavec said that the Central European country will begin taking the necessary steps once the Slovenian Parliament gives the proposal a “green light.” “By recognizing it, [Slovenia] would strengthen Palestine’s negotiation in the Middle East peace process. We have an independent foreign policy, we do not need any other state to cover our back,” Erjavec said. Last month, Slovenian Parliament Speaker Milan Brglez told Palestinian Ambassador Salah Abdel-Shafi that Slovenia’s recognition of a Palestinian state was “not in doubt but only a matter of the right timing.”  After Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Malta, and Cyprus recognized the Palestinian state, other European countries, such as Luxembourg, Ireland, and Belgium, are reportedly considering following Sweden’s example.  The moves follow US President Donald Trump’s December speech in which he formally declared Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital, adding that he also ordered his aides to start the process of moving the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  Following the decision, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared  the United States “no longer an honest mediator in the peace process” adding that “Palestinians will not accept any plan put from the United States.” The Palestinian leadership also called for the support of the international community.

Rabat – After Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid committee revealed its official logo at a press conference on Tuesday, the much-awaited logo has sparked mockery and criticism on social media, as many Moroccan Twitter and Facebook users took to their accounts to express their disappointment. For its campaign to host the 23rd FIFA World Cup in 2026, Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) hired on January 12 VERO Communications as “the lead international communications and strategy agency to work on the bid’s aspects of international media and social media communications,” including the controversial logo. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the logo that carries the slogan of “Bidding Nations, reflects the country’s national unity and plural identity.” However, the issue of the official logo inspired strong reactions from Moroccans who qualified it as a “visual catastrophe,” lacking creativity and professionalism. “It looks so unprofessional, I wouldn’t spend a single dollar on such a low quality logo! It’s rubbish and it doesn’t make any sense to me! A great nation with a centuries-old culture was represented by a green pentagram with a few red leaves around it? Seriously! I’m really upset at the organizers! I mean even a little kid in the 5th grade can do better,” online user Morad Caspertinie commented to MWN. “I could have done a better logo at home and on my computer. This is an important matter, and I don’t think hiring amateurs is a wise thing to do. International marketing firms are highly recommended. Not a good start, as far as I am concerned,” another user, Zachary M. Lahlou, expressed to MWN online. Some criticized the logo’s apparent lack of political vision. Anouar Aq commented to MWN online: “They should have put Africa behind the green star with … transparent lines for the rest of the globe. It would have ensured the voices of all African federations in an implicit reflection of solidarity! The globe in the background would have shown that Morocco is open to the world in response to Trump’s anti-immigration laws and racist statements. The logo is lacking a political dimension whereas it is the argument that would favor Morocco’s candidacy in opposition to that of the North Americans.” Others went so far as to question Morocco’s ability to host such a major event while it lacks the capacity to meet international, social, and urban standards. “We have no roads, no hotels, no stadia. Where are they gonna lodge all the fans, players, staff, reporters, security, VIPs? Instead of thinking about the World Cup we should focus on bettering the life in Morocco,” Adam Kad expressed to MWN. “The streets are dirty, the roads are in horrible shape with dangerous potholes everywhere. The World Cup is a bad investment, look at what happened in Brazil….oh and finally who cares about the logo, we will never host the World Cup. We can’t.” After the uproar caused by Morocco’s 2026 World Cup Bid logo, many young Moroccans,  motivated by their patriotism, unleashed their creations and suggested new logo designs that were highly welcomed by social media users. “Logos by young Moroccans look better than the official one that cost thousands of millions of Dirhams,” commented Said Alaoui to MWN.

Rabat – Mounia Boucetta, the Secretary of State to Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, said on Tuesday in Paris that Morocco considers the use of chemical weapons to be a violation of not only the Chemical Weapons Convention but also the Security Council’s decisions and international law.  Boucetta represented Morocco at the conference to launch the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons  initiative, and the Secretary of State restated that Morocco “strongly condemns the use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, and under any circumstances.”   Boucetta also drew attention to the emergence of new threats, notably non-state actors and terrorist groups, that are likely to constitute a “real danger” to both regional security and international peace.   She further called on the international community to work together to handle the aforementioned  threats.  Regarding the initiative, Boucetta recalled the principle and the parameters that should guide the partners’ approach, namely the “primacy of international law, the preservation of the architecture of the non-proliferation regime, the complementarity of the partnership with existing mechanisms, the strengthening of the initiative’s openness and transparency.” The Secretary of State also stressed the need for “capacity building,” especially for African countries. This, she added, should be the partnership’s primary objective: “to ensure the consolidation and sustainability of the regime of non-proliferation of chemical weapons.” Morocco signed the convention prohibiting the production, sale, and use of Chemical Weapons on January 13, 1993 and actively contributed to the process that led to the adoption of the convention. In June 2017, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has elected Morocco to be the coordinator for its African state members.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita, is to fly to Addis-Ababa to attend the 32nd ordinary session of the African Union’s executive council, a meeting that assembles the foreign ministries of the African Union’s member states. “Nasser Bourita will fly to Addis-Ababa this afternoon, immediately after attending the council of government and a meeting in Cairo with Britain’s delegate minister of foreign affairs,” a government official indicated, adding that a Moroccan delegation is already present at the summit in Addis-Ababa. During a summit that will last for two day, the executive council will examine the rapports of the PRC,  the work of the president of AU Commission from January to December 2017, and the rapports of the delegated committees of the executive council. The summit will set the agenda for the 30th ordinary session of heads of states and governments which will start on January, 27th. The summit’s most important event will be the election of 10 member states to the AU’s Peace and Security Council. The summit will also be marked by a leadership transfer from Guinea’s Alpha Condé, incumbent president of the African Union, to Rwanda’s Paul Kagame who will preside over the continental organization for one year. Fighting against corruption and attaining financial independence will be the two major themes of the 30th summit of AU’s heads of states and governments.

Rabat – Soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal’s leading hotel chain, Pestana, will open a new hotel in Marrakech in 2019, according to Pestana Hotel Group Chief Development Officer Jose Roquette. The much anticipated announcement was made Wednesday in Lisbon. Ronaldo’s Perstana CR7, located at M Avenue in the center of Marrakech, will feature 168 rooms and will have two restaurants, a fitness center, a business center, a pool and a spa. “We are delighted to be a part of this project. Marrakech is a successful and increasingly sophisticated destination, the perfect environment for the implementation of Lifestyle and Boutique hotel brands,” Roquette said. Ronaldo wants to open hotels in new markets across Asia and the Middle East, where he is very popular. Pestana’s CEO told Reuters in December that the hotel chain is also seeking to expand its presence in Spain and the United States. Two CR7 hotels are now open, one in Ronaldo’s hometown in the Madeira Islands, and another in Lisbon. Two more will open in Madrid and New York City in the future. The soccer player’s decision to open a hotel in Marrakech is not arbitrary or random. He is a frequent visitor to the city that he once named, “The City of Joy.”

By Tamba François Koundouno Rabat – Morocco’s appointing of Mouhcine Jazouli as minister in charge of African Affairs is an important message to the Kingdom’s African peers. By creating a ministry fully dedicated to African affairs, king Mohammed VI is moving beyond the mere symbolism of South-South relations. It also shows that Morocco-Africa is no longer a tiny part of a bigger agenda; it is part and parcel, the backbone in fact, of Morocco’s new foreign policy guidelines. When the king announced the prospects of a ministry delegated to African Affairs late last year, he said that the appointed minster would be responsible for “African affairs, and especially investments.” Morocco is asserting a growing presence in Sub-Saharan Africa; the kingdom wants to reclaim its historical significance in the continent, Le Point reported yesterday in article that discussed the strategic significance of the new ministry. The King wants to showcase, the article noted, that like in the 1960s and early 1970s, when Morocco was an indispensable actor in the political affairs of the continent, a financial and strategic support to liberation movements like the ANC in South Africa and the MPLA of Agostino Neto in Angola, king Mohammed VI the article explains, is building a foreign policy machine where Sub-Saharan Africa is the priority in terms of exchange and policy co-operations. Morocco’s African agenda is no longer a secret; in fact, it has so often been reported on, talked about, commented upon (either by Moroccans or Sub-Saharan), lauded (by specialists or simple observers) so that eventually, it may run the risk of becoming part of the furniture. But such a conclusion would fail to take into account something of prime importance: A paradigm shift is happening in Morocco’s foreign policy. In a piece published earlier this month in the Guardian, Jason Burke, the Guardian’s Africa Correspondent, wrote that the motto for Africa 2018 should be “Africa is diverging”. This, the author rightly explains, is due to the fact that Sub-Saharan Africa is not a monolith. It is an era of striking diversities, be it politically or socially. “Africa heads in different directions—politically and economically”, he argued. This presence of such confounding narratives can downplay the efforts of anyone who focuses on a global vision of the region. But the fact is that Mohcine Jazouli, the Moroccan minister now in charge of African Affairs, is familiar with the political climate of sub-Saharan Africa. And so, his expertise in dealing with numerous African governments and start-ups for the past decade and his strategic acumen will be an asset for the ministry he will be leading. Jazouli, 49, is founder and chief of Valyans Consulting, a commercial and financial juggernaut solidly implanted in Africa. Between 2011 and 2014, he worked on various strategic projects, including those with Ivorian and Gabonese governments. And so, with his business-centered visions, his profile that defies that of the traditional technocrat fixated on slow and generally frustrating administrative proceedings, it goes without saying that Jazouli will bring a new breath to Morocco-African relations. Jazouli may not have been the first name that would come to mind when the king announced that a ministry delegated to African affairs would be created. But his profile—the strategic powerhouse that Valyans Consulting became under his leadership, and his already existing and numerous strategic ties in Sub-Saharan Africa—give signals of a possible success story within the boundaries of the new ministry. It may sound like a truism, a “pious fiction”, or sentimental magnification of an elusive narrative. But the fact of the matter remains that Sub-Saharan Africa, given the economic imperatives of our globalized planet, is no longer a locale to ignore. Plus, in this “age of phenomenal complexity and interlocking changes,” we are witnessing a world that no longer looks to Europe for inspiration. With the West losing its glamour, Morocco can lead the dance in Africa. Will it? How will it proceed? Is the kingdom going to impose its will on its Sub-Saharan peers, or rather cooperate with them? These should be the real questions, and also the challenges of the teams in charge of implementing Morocco’s Africa Agenda. But as of now, prospects are rather rosy, promising. Today, more than 1000 Moroccan businesses are operating in Sub-Saharan Africa, investing around $2.2 billion; the King’s recent numerous tours around the continent culminated in more than 600 treaties with his counterparts, with focus on commercial exchanges and policy co-ordinations on sustaining security and peace in the continent. With Nasser Bourrita’s shift towards a dynamic foreign policy and Jazouli’s established reputation in strategic planning, all that is left now is the delivery of bold, clear, and consistent policies. And so, should Morocco uphold the genuineness of its Sub-Saharan African venture, which entails involving all relevant stakeholders (governments and businesses), the creation of a ministry of African affairs will turn out to be the beginning of an auspicious saga.

By Amaan Afzal Rabat – The Top 50 in Innovation Rankings were released Monday, a list by Bloomberg comparing different countries’ innovative strides for the year.  This marks the sixth year since these yearly rankings have been compiled and the first time the USA has dropped below the top 10, sliding two places to 11th. USA experienced this decline due to a combination of factors including a decrease in new science and engineering graduates in the work force, causing them to plummet eight positions in the postsecondary education-efficiency category.  ‘There are seven equally weighted brackets by which the rankings are determined, such as ‘manufacturing value-added’ where the USA also saw a drop. As a result, their improvements in the productivity sector proved too small to score them a top ten spot. Their replacement on the prestigious list is France, that jumped two spots from the US’s current position passing Israel at tenth who sported the best Research and Development score. “I see no evidence to suggest that this trend will not continue,” said the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation situated in Washington D.C, Robert Atkinson, who continued, providing his justification “Other nations have responded with smart, well-funded innovation policies like better R&amp;D tax incentives, more government funding for research, more funding for technology commercialization initiatives.” Where home to Silicon Valley failed Singapore thrived, topping the tertiary education-efficiency list, propelling them to third position ahead of European powerhouses Germany, Switzerland and Finland. Professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, Yeo Kiat Seng stated that “Singapore has always placed strong focus on educating her populace, especially in [Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics] disciplines” and combined with their “steadfast commitment to funding R&amp;D and innovation” ensued this year’s success. South Korea continues to top the rankings for the fifth consecutive year, with Sweden following close behind. Their consistent triumphs can be partly attributed to Samsung Electronics, who possess the second most U.S. patents of any firm, boosting their ‘patent activity’ rating, and who created a partner and supplier economic environment in the nation, through their innovations ranging from smartphones to semiconductors. Last years rankings demonstrated more drastic changes in positions, such as the 14-spot drop endured by Russia, a direct result of sanctions placed due to their military intervention in Ukraine and the ensuing energy-price plummet. The largest losses of the year were suffered by both Ukraine and New Zealand, falling four ranks, while Russia made up minimally by moving from 26th to 25th. Italy and Turkey are the most innovatively improved, each promoted by four ranks. Morocco was static this year, once again taking 50th place on the list while South Africa and Iran re-entered the top 50 just ahead of the Western Kingdom. Morocco’s future success in innovation perhaps lies in the words of Prinn Panitchpakdi, the head of a brokerage and investment group in Thailand, who fell one position in the rankings to 45th: “One common trait of the U.S., Korea and China is that people accept failure as part of the process. Innovation lags in countries where the culture emphasizes risk avoidance and where R&amp;D is seen purely as an expense, not an investment.”

Rabat – Casablanca is once again suffering  from insufficiency in blood stocks, said the National Blood Transfusion and Hematology Center today, calling for citizens to donate  their blood. The Center said that the  situation in Casablanca is chronic, as the blood supply will not exceed 3 to 4 days. Further to Casablanca,  the center’s findings indicate that despite the increase of  the number of blood donors (297,700) in 2015, the country is still in shortage of blood donation, as 2016 recorded a number of 310,680 donors, which represents 0.95 percent  of the total population. This  ratio remains below the recommendations  of the World Health Organization, which requires at least 1 percent of the population to donate blood. The country is in a critical position, where the challenge is to raise the number of regular blood donors to ensure a safe ratio of blood, according to the same source. Blood donation has to be regular, since platelets last only for five days and red cells last for 42 days, stressed the official. The center said that men can donate blood once each two months, while women can do so once every three months with no significant health effects. If Moroccans rolled their sleeves and  volunteered twice during the past year, the total number of donors would have  moved to more than 600,000, and secured the World Health Organization’s’ recommendations.

Rabat – In Morocco, it’s common for people to have fend off verbal sexual harassment and unwanted physical sexual advances. And now, apparently, animals must do it too. In a small village in the outskirts of Essaouira, a British tourist trying to have sexual intercourse with a dog was severely injured after the animal bit the man’s penis in self-defense. On January 19, the 36-year-old man, while visiting Sidi Kaouki village near Essaouira, tried to forcibly molest a stray dog. Blinded by his lust, the British man approached the animal with his pants down to his ankles when the animal suddenly attacked him, biting his member. According to H24info, the British zoophile took out a knife and slaughtered the animal, before leaving his house covered in blood. The man was later discovered passed out on a road by villagers. They called the Royal Gendarmerie who then transferred him to the nearest hospital. After running blood tests and a psychological evaluation, the doctors at Mohammed V hospital in Essaouira said that the man was in fact under the influence of drugs, and that his case required observation and treatment in a psychiatric hospital. Luckily for him, physicians even managed to save his penis. Unfortunately, the same could not be said for the poor animal.

Rabat – Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita, reiterated on Wednesday evening in Rabat, Morocco’s “full” support to Belgium’s candidacy as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. The presence of Belgium at the Security Council “will bring a lot of experience, lucidity and wisdom to the work of the Council in a very important international context”, Bourita pointed out at a press briefing in Rabat following talks with Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Didier Reynders. The minister praised the “exceptional” relations between Morocco and Belgium, adding that these ties are marked by “historical depth, human dimension, good economic cooperation and convergence of views on the main political issues.” “Our talks were an opportunity to discuss the means to improve cooperation mechanisms at the level of regular political consultations and the High Partnership Committee”, he said. “The good political entente should also be reflected at the economic level”, he went on, noting that Belgium is today the eleventh international partner of Morocco and its seventh partner in Europe and that actions planned during this year will further strengthen this dimension. Commenting Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, Bourita said that “Morocco has always considered Belgium as a reliable partner in the European Union”, noting that Belgium is “a partner who has often had constructive stances regarding the interests and challenges of Morocco within the EU.” Bourita also stressed the importance of the Euro-African dimension, while advocating for a triangular relationship through a stronger dialogue “to go together to Africa.” For his part, Reydners said he was “delighted” by Morocco’s support to Belgium’s candidacy as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. “This is an opportunity for us to play a linking role and to propose solutions to problems, conflicts or difficult situations”, he said. Reydners started on Wednesday a two-day working visit to Morocco, with the aim of developing cooperation and relations between the two kingdoms.

Brussels – Morocco is among Belgium’s most important partners, Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Didier Reynders said, noting that the two countries have a lot to gain from sustained and effective cooperation in several fields. Reynders, who will start a working visit to Morocco this Wednesday, said, in an interview with MAP, that the relations between the two kingdoms are excellent. The Belgian official, who underlined the human dimension of bilateral relations given the importance of the community of Moroccan origin in Belgium, said that intense relations are maintained at all levels through regular political visits and exchanges between economic operators. In this year, a Belgian economic mission will visit Morocco and “the Year of Morocco” will be organized by the French Community of Belgium through several cultural events, he announced. Regarding trade, the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister stressed that Morocco and Belgium are important partners in this sector, with Belgium being Morocco’s 8th largest supplier and its 9th largest customer. Reynders emphasized that “Morocco’s location as a gateway to Africa, further strengthened by its rapprochement with ECOWAS, is of interest to Belgian companies”, adding that Belgian companies are already involved in the development of Moroccan port cities, while other prospects are available including in the areas of renewable energy, wastewater treatment and the medical sector. The Belgian official called for supporting economic partnerships between Moroccan and Belgian groups, as well as triangular cooperation with other African partners. Morocco and Belgium enjoy good relations in several areas, including justice, security, fight against terrorism and migration, he said, noting that good cooperation between Moroccan and Belgian police and intelligence services is necessary to address common security challenges. The two countries “also share a common desire to promote peace and stability, especially on the African continent, he said. Belgium welcomes the momentum given by HM the King to Morocco’s African policy, he said, adding that Morocco’s return to the African Union is a “key moment for the organization and the continent.” The Belgian minister also lauded the “leadership” of HM King Mohammed VI regarding the migration issue. Commenting the Moroccan religious model, Reynders said that “the way Islam is lived and taught in Morocco has a definite impact in our country given the large proportion of citizens of Moroccan origin in Belgium.” “Moroccan Islam is therefore a source of interest for us”, he pointed out, while expressing his willingness to learn more about Morocco’s experience in de-radicalization during his visit to Morocco.

The MoU was signed by minister of Economy and Finance, Mohamed Boussaid, and EBRD vice-president, Pierre Heilbronn. The project is part of the commitments made by the ministry of Economy and Finance for the climate at the COP22, under the roadmap for the alignment of the Moroccan financial sector with sustainable development, said Boussaid. This Memorandum, which reflects a new approach of cooperation with donors, is expected to support the mobilization of new private resources and their orientation in favor of SMEs and VSEs projects of green economy, he said. Since 2013, the European Bank has granted more than 1.5 billion Euros in loans to Morocco, which is one of the founding countries of EBRD, Boussaid said, adding that the loans were intended specifically for private sector financing.

Rabat – After the UN Personal Envoy to the Western Sahara Horst Kohler sent invitations to the Polisario and Morocco calling for “bilateral discussions,” Moroccan political analyst Reda El Fellah cautioned that the exchange comes at an “inconvenient time, and Morocco should deal with it very cautiously.” “The provocative actions and military maneuvers carried out by the Polisario front with the recent support of Algeria near Guerguerat confirms the lack of the willingness to reach a just and mutually acceptable solution,” El Fellah stated. He  added that the launch of negotiations is irrelevant. Slamming the Polisario and their separatist ideologies, El Fellah said that “What is most important is that the separatist front needs to be rational and should annul its demand for complete independence from its agenda.” For El Fellah, Morocco cannot accept Kohler’s invitation to negotiate with Polisario at this time. “At the level of the international community, this [move] would give the impression that Morocco knuckles under the Separatist group’s recent maneuvers in Gurgarate.” The political analyst added that if Morocco sits at the same table with the separatist front, which has been claiming independent statehood, it would be a “diplomatic and political error, because it will give the separatist group the legitimacy they cannot afford and will enrich their hope to get regional and international support.” El Fellah, who is also a university professor in Agadir, told MWN that “the process of negotiations could not be successful without a powerful meditation, adding,“The UN mediation alone is not enough knowing the lack of real pressure on Polisario and Algeria to look for compromise and [a] win-win agreement.” On Tuesday, the spokesman for the United Nations Secretary-General, Stephane Dujarric, confirmed that UNSG Personal Envoy Horst Kohler sent invitations to Morocco and Polisario to hold “bilateral discussions” regarding the Western Sahara conflict. The Moroccan government has not issued any statement about whether it would attend the negotiations.

Rabat – Fouzi Lekjaa, president of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) confirmed on Tuesday that the nation’s candidacy to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup represents the African continent as a whole. Speaking at candidacy announcement in Casablanca, which was chaired by Morocco’s bid committee for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Lekjaa referred to the Confederation of African Football’s full support for Morocco’s candidacy. Lekjaa also discussed FIFA’s new voting system, which is now based on the votes of all members of the FIFA, as a point in favor of Morocco. Lekjaa pointed out that through this new system, 211 national football federations have the right to vote. In order to host the tournament, Morocco will need 104 votes. 221 national federations at a congress in Moscow will decide in who is eligible to host the 23rd FIFA World Cup in 2026. Morocco will have a rival in the joint bid submitted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. Lekjaa emphasized that the chance of hosting the FIFA World Cup is an opportunity to enhance Morocco’s achievements in the sports field. Lekjaa concluded that July 13, the date when FIFA will announce the 2026 World Cup host country, will mark a decisive turning point in the history of Moroccan football.

Rabat – On Tuesday, the United Nations officially confirmed that the UNSG Personal Envoy, Horst Kohler, sent invitations to the parties involved in the Western Sahara conflict in hopes of opening another round of negotiations and “bilateral discussions” in Berlin. The confirmation was announced in a daily press briefing issued on Tuesday by Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres “We confirm that the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General on Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, intends to hold bilateral discussions with the parties and neighbouring countries this January and February.” No specific date was proposed for the meeting in the press briefing. Kohler has invited to Mauritania and Algeria to the table, two countries that have been supporting the front and its ideologies. “[Kohler] has addressed invitations to the Moroccan Foreign Minister, Nasser Bourita, the Secretary-General of the Frente Polisario, Brahim Ghali, as well as the Algerian and Mauritania’s Ministers of Foreign Affairs.” Earlier this week, Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum reported that the separatist front requested a meeting with Kohler at the camps of Tindouf on January 24 and 26. However, Kohler instead hopes to gather all the involved parties in Germany. Morocco and the Polisario last met in January 2008 in New York, when a series of talks, dubbed “the Manhasset negotiations,” occurred. Akhbar Al Yaoum added that, while the idea of direct negotiations is welcomed by the separatist group, Morocco seems “reluctant” to meet with the same front that has been carrying provocative actions in the Guerguerat buffer zone since December 2017. The UN invitations came just a few days after Polisario’s most recent provocative actions in the buffer zone. Both Morocco and the UN expressed their condemnation over the illegal armed actions by Polisario, emphasizing that such actions would undermine peace negotiations between the parties. Earlier this month, Kohler held talks with African Union Commission chairperson Mussa Faki Mahamat and Rwanda’s President, Paul Kagame about the Western Sahara conflict. Kohler aims to devise a new vision and strategies to end the conflict. To this ends, Kohler hopes to provide the African Union with the opportunity to propose solutions that could help resolve the conflict permanently.

Rabat – As Morocco’s compensation regime continues to equally benefit the rich and the poor, Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, pointed out that the Government is working on “a reform of the compensation fund” to ensure “equitable distribution of available resources.” Reform measures that develop will likely be the result of a process that emphasizes progressive reform and the protection of subsidies for those citizens most at risk. For El Othmani, lessening the burden on the government’s budget, though, is inevitable, as he said during an intervention in the Parliament on January 23. The Head of Government pointed out that the compensation fund represents a significant source of government spending and a principal cause of government debt. In 2017, an estimated MAD 12 billion was spent on the fund, while nearly MAD 200 billion was spent on the fund between 2011 and 2015. The government is “determined” to continue “phasing out subsidies on butane gas, sugar and flour,” he said, adding that this will be offset by increased funding for social development policies and programs that support vulnerable populations. El Othmani acknowledged dysfunctions in the compensation system, saying that it benefits the rich more than it does vulnerable Moroccans. Concerning butane gas subsidies, which are often the most contentious of all subsidies, Minister of General Affairs and Governance, Lahcen Daoudi, said that “many of those who are currently receiving support from the compensation fund do not want subsidies to be abolished, as some of them consume 100 bottles of gas per day for water extraction.” “Currently, there is be no increase and there will be none soon,” said Daoudi, indicating that this decision is taken in consideration of the “poor and vulnerable categories.” “The government wants to reserve its grants only to those who need them, as it is working to define the eligible population who should benefit from social assistance,” El Othmani concluded.

Rabat – Al Hoceima’s Court of Appeals handed down jail sentences increased by up to two years in prison against 13 Hirak protesters standing accused of participating in “unauthorized demonstrations,” said Spanish news agency EFE. EFE reported that most of these activists were sentenced in the Court of First Instance. The new jail terms range from six to 18 months. The court of appeals accused the detained activists of “assaulting law enforcement officers and for the alleged use of violence against public forces, and incitement of other people to commit crimes.” The court has also reduced one activist’s  sentence from two years to one year and a half. On January 16, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals sentenced seventeen protesters to prison terms ranging from 10 months to 3 years after their involvement in “unauthorized demonstration and disobedience.” Approximately 400 Hirak activists were arrested in a crackdown on protests held in Al Hoceima province between 2016 and 2017, following the death of Mouhcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck. The incident resulted in many protests in Al Hoceima and the surrounding areas. Chanting social slogans, the protesters decryied social disparities in the region. To respond to the Rif demonstrations, King Mohammed VI tasked Driss Jettou, First President of the Court of Auditors to present him with a report regarding the royal development projects delayed in Al Hoceima. Last October, King Mohammed VI fired four ministers, including Mohamed Hassad, former Minister of Education, El Houssaine El Ouardi, former Minister of Health, and Mohammed Nabil Benabdellah. The positions of the fired ministers were left vacant until January 22, when the King finally appointed new officials. Jettou’s report, commissioned by the King on October 2, clearly traced these serious dysfunctions to the tenure of the previous government led by Abdelilah Benkirane. “At the level of implementation of the programmed projects, there has been a significant delay in the launching of projects, and the vast majority of them have not been launched at all, with the absence of concrete initiatives by some of the actors involved in their actual launch,” read the statement of the Royal Cabinet.

Rabat – One man writhes on the ground as molten plastic is dripped over his back: this is a scene from a graphic new YouTube video that surfaced on Saturday, January 20.  However, scenes such as this are not unique. In late 2017, several videos featuring similarly gruesome footage surfaced on social media, all showing African migrants being tortured by their allegedly Libyan captors.  Social media users and human rights organizations broke their silences to denounce the incidents against migrants. Amnesty International took to its Twitter on January 10 to say, “torture, detention, exploitation and rape are daily horrors for many refugees and migrants in Libya.” Denouncing Europe’s migration police, Amnesty added, “but instead of ending these abuses, Europe is helping Libya to trap people in hell.” Morocco World News cannot share the videos due to their graphic content. International media has been reporting that the Libyan government has denied complicity in slavery and human trafficking. Torture, detention, exploitation and rape are daily horrors for many refugees and migrants in #Libya. But instead of ending these abuses, Europe is helping Libya to trap people in hell. Take action now: https://t.co/ixyn5aivG3 pic.twitter.com/z9mzbYBMwK — Amnesty Ireland (@AmnestyIreland) January 19, 2018  In a blistering rebuke, Amnesty International called European governments “complicit in horrific abuse of refugees and migrants.”   This report was subsequently referenced in a tweet by British parliamentarian Diane James: EU Govts are knowingly complicit in the torture &amp; abuse of tens of thousands of refugees &amp; migrants detained by Libyan immigration authorities in appalling conditions said Amnesty International in a report published in the wake of global outrage over the sale of migrants in Libya Another Twitter user claimed that Libya’s coast guard knows about the torture, abuse, and smuggling of migrants. What’s worse is #Libya‘s coast guard is itself complicit in the torture, abuse and smuggling of #migrants. https://t.co/IJU5E0Q1Ts — Emad Badi (@emad_badi) January 18, 2018  The torture of an african migrants in libya…

A statement by the ministry, quoted by Xinhua News Agency, said that “”we confirm that instructions have been issued by the Presidential Council to permanently investigate any indecent acts against the dignity of African migrants.” Earlier today, Libya’s law enforcement arrested a gang accused of kidnapping and abusing Sudanese migrants near the northern city of Sirte, reported Modern Ghana. According to the source, the gang consists of “five Libyans and one Palestinian.” Sirte Security and Protection Force said that the gang has abused eight migrants. Hundreds of migrants, including Moroccans, who dreamt of crossing to Europe through Libya, remain trapped in dire conditions in detention centers across Libya. In December 2017, several videos filmed by detained Moroccans were widely shared on social media, revealing the horrific conditions they faced in Libyan prisons. The trapped migrants cried for help and urged the Moroccan government to take immediate action to bring them back home. In response, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs took urgent measures to repatriate its citizens from Libya. In December, 235 Moroccan migrants detained in Libya were repatriated to their homeland, the first of several operations carried out by the Moroccan government before the end of 2017.

They reflect a sense of loyalty to a shared history and illustrate our firm belief that ours is a common destiny”.

By Amal Ben Hadda Tangier – Why does respecting religion mean taking away rights from women? Religion should protect the dignity of everyone and aim to create equality and justice amongst everyone through the spreading of love and tolerance.  However, gender inequality is a common theme within religious communities. Looking closely at religious texts, misogyny can be found throughout the three different monotheist beliefs. Orthodox Jewish women for example, are not allowed to read from the Torah, even though this rule does not exist in the Torah itself. Christian women are asked to be submissive to their husbands according to the New Testament. Women are considered deficient in mind and religion by the Islamic oral tradition. The makers of such rules have been men. Women have been excluded from making religious laws throughout history. As a result, there are many misconceptions about the status of women. As a Muslim woman, I have taken a few examples from the Quran that might have been interpreted differently if women were involved in interpreting them. Muslim men have been allowed to marry up to four women whether the wives accept it or not. This rule allowing polygamy was interpreted from the following verse in the Quran: 4:3  If you fear you cannot act fairly towards the orphans-then marry the women you like-two, or three, or four. But if you fear you will not be fair, then one, or what you already have. That makes it more likely that you avoid bias. As mentioned at the beginning of this verse and also as stated in the previous one (4:2), the context in the Quran of this supposed polygamy is about orphans’ funds management. Even if this is clearly readable, the polygamy has been concluded and then allowed to Muslims men outside of its original context. In the Quran, the ‘right hand’ means a promise or a commitment that should be observed and respected. When the word possession is added to the ‘right hand’, then the exegeses completely changes the meaning from being a promise or a commitment to meaning a female slave or captive. This interpretation puts women in danger because it gives permission to men to capture women in war and to rape them. However, the expression of “right hands possession” is mentioned in the Quran for both men and women. It should be interpreted as possessing a promise or commitment. The meaning of female slave is inappropriate, and the verses mentioning the “right hands possession” serve as a reminder to respect engagements especially in social contexts such as marriage or orphans’ care. 4:11 Allah commands you, with respect to your children, that the male shall inherit the equivalent of the share of two females. If there be more than two females, then they should receive two-thirds of what he’” leaves; but if there is only one female, she is entitled to one-half… “… the male shall inherit the equivalent of the share of two females ….” This famous extract is mostly interpreted as meaning that women should get the half of their brothers’ parts. However, this extract of the verse is mentioned in the case where there are two female inheritors and not as a general rule as per the exegeses. The following text in the same verse continues with, ‘if there are women more than two females,’ and then ‘but if there is only one female’. This verse explains the different options of sharing inheritance depending on the difference of how many women are in the family. In the Quran, it asks women to be dressed decently. The way of clothing changes from one country to another depending on the local traditions and values in that place. What could be acceptable as a decent dress in one place could be unacceptable in another place. Respecting the local values of different countries is the way to avoid problems over appearance. However, some Muslims believe that the more a woman is covered, the more spiritual value she has. The veil has become the symbol of the Muslim woman’s ‘righteousness and piousness.’ However, the word veil (Hijab) as mentioned in the Quran has a completely different meaning which doesn’t make reference to the woman’s clothing or hair covering but to a kind of a barrier or obstacle. This judgment based on the appearance has generated a systematic identification of Muslim women by some oriental dresses like Khimar, Chador, Niqab and Burka. These are just some of the examples amongst many that degrade the status of women in the name of religion. From this perspective, critics against religious interference in women’s rights are justifiable. It is essential to review and reform Islamic law in accordance with the original message of the Quran. In order to ensure that the religion is correctly being interpreted, it is essential that women are involved with religious interpretations. It is much more likely that a more balanced and equal interpretation of the Quran will be made if both men and women are involved. Women’s contribution in religious jurisprudence is not a query but a condition to avoid unfair male dominance and to protect women’s rights. Believers, both men and women, are supposed to act in accordance with the Religion of God, not with a religion made by men.

Rabat – Yesterday in Casablanca, the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF) held a press conference that marked the official announcement of Morocco’s candidacy for holding the 2026 World Cup. The world cup is football’s most fabulous and celebrated worldwide event, and the Moroccan football federation grasped yesterday’s opportune moment to name Samuel Eto’o as ambassador for the kingdom’s bid. The Cameroonian Samuel Eto’o is no news to football fans in Africa and across the globe. Eto’o is a living legend of world football who, in his prime time, electrified stadiums in Africa and around the world. During the press conference, the president of Morocco’s football deciding body revealed that Eto’o will be one of the numerous ambassadors of the kingdom’s world cup bid. The former Barcelona and Inter Milan star is said to be a fervent supporter of Morocco’s candidacy. Despite the social media uproar that followed the official launching of Morocco’s logo yesterday, many experts and football fans are confident about the robustness of the kingdom’s bid. Part of the reasons, they argue, is that this time the kingdom has the support of a whole continent. Following the contentious Morocco 2026 logo that Moroccans on social media have disparaged, describing it as “a visual catastrophe” or “an amateurish quick-fix”, the nomination of Samuel Eto’o as ambassador of the kingdom’s bid may, after all, be a morale boost for those who, be they in Morocco or in other parts of the continent, are unflinching in their hope of another African World Cup after South Africa 2010. In his speech at yesterday’s press conference, Moulay Hafid Elalamy, president of the committee in charge of organizing Morocco’s bid, saluted Morocco 2026 as a “dynamic African candidacy” that opens itself to the world, and celebrates football and its twin-values of respect and tolerance. “Organizing the 2026 World cup”, he said, “will reinforce the social, economic, and environmental development of Morocco and the continent of which it is a member.”

By Charifa Zemouri Amsterdam – There is limited to no data on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) estimates in the MENA region. However, several studies have attempted to estimate the numbers. The lack of data could be due to the limited access to STI services, stigma, national laws, cultural and religious factors. Funding for extensive STI screening programs from the governments of the MENA-countries would need political commitment and acknowledgment of men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSW) and extramarital sex with the absence of penalty or imprisonment. This is, however, not possible in most of these countries, where prostitution and homosexuality are  criminal offences, or where HIV positivity results in imprisonment, like in the United Arab Emirates. Therefore, a focus should be set on the MENA region for alternative STI surveillance. Most regions in the world have witnessed a decline in the number of new HIV infections while the number in the MENA region has rapidly increased, regardless of the consistently increasing HIV-generated data in the region (Karamouzian 2016). The MENA region contributes only to 1% of the global HIV literature, which is low by academic standards. The same applies to STIs. Data is limited for key populations in this area. In the MENA-region, the HIV epidemic and STIs are driven by risky sexual behavior and drug use. Drug users, MSM, FSW and their partners are the main affected populations. Prevalence rates are unavailable in several high-income countries like Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, as well as low-income countries such as Syria, Sudan and Iraq. Three countries in the region have a relatively stable and functioning HIV and STI surveillance system: Iran, Djibouti and Morocco. Egypt, Lebanon and Tunisia are the only countries that have conducted surveillance surveys in FSW, MSM and drug injection users. The lack of surveillance and STI data in the MENA region is due to criminalization of MSM and FSW. These populations never reach the data charts, or when they are screened and tested, they are subject to information bias. The problem regarding STIs is also present in the general population. A study conducted in seafarers in northern Morocco showed that the knowledge about transmission and prevention of STIs and HIV was satisfactory. However, many misconceptions still persist and stigmatization and discrimination is very high. Furthermore, the study population showed high-risk sexual behavior. 26.3% admitted to having sex with FSW, while 60% had unprotected sex with them. Less than half of men have never used a condom, and only 15% uses them regularly. In this study population, only 10% admitted to having been tested for HIV. Information and awareness regarding safe sex practices and testing should be the prime importance to control the STI and HIV problem in the region. When a population is not screened, no numbers are reported. Therefore, the prevalence estimates remain low. STI testing should be made available without consequences for the attending man or woman, regardless of their marital, sexually commercial or sexual orientation status.

Rabat – Morocco’s 2026 World Cup Bid Committee on Tuesday officially launched its campaign in Casablanca to host the 23rd FIFA World Cup in 2026. Speaking at a press conference at the inauguration of the campaign, the chairman of the committee unveiled Morocco’s strategy for the World Cup bid campaign. Elalamy said that the Moroccan filing “will be of big importance.” Referring to Morocco’s unsuccessful bids, the Minister of Trade and Investment said that “this is another Morocco, not that of the 2010 bid […] FIFA knows that when we launch [infrastructure] projects, we deliver.” “What are Morocco’s strengths? Our strengths are the stability of our country, which is good for both investment and football,” said Elalamy. Shedding light on Morocco’s passion for football, the minister said that “Moroccans are fans of football, our fans are known, and our infrastructure meets the international standards.” Elalamy also highlighted Morocco’s geographical location. “Morocco’s geographical position is exceptional. It is only 14 km away from Europe. The time zone is perfect for gathering a large majority of spectators.” “We will not have to wake up at 3 a.m. to watch a soccer game.” Elalamy has also referred to Morocco’s Hospitality as an established institution. “A FIFA World Cup in Morocco will deliver commercial success and leave a long-lasting legacy, and if we win the honor of hosting we believe the winners will be football, the young people of our nation, Africa, and the world,” he said. The conference was also marked by the participation of the President of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation, Fouzi Lekjaa, and Minister of Youth and Sports, Rachid Talbi Alami. For his part, Lekjaa said “we have assembled a committed and experienced team to bring our vision to life. This is an important moment as we begin to showcase our bid to Morocco, the international community, and FIFA’s National Associations.” The Minister of Youth and Sports said “Morocco has made rapid progress since 2003 in terms of sports, infrastructure, hotels, airports, motorways and public transportation networks.” He said that Morocco’s government is fully supporting the Moroccan bid to host the tournament. The bid for Alami, is “an opportunity to galvanize efforts and look to provide new momentum to the national economy.” Alami, who was quoted by Maghreb Arab Press, said “Morocco can mobilize funds to host the World Cup without affecting the budget balance.” “Morocco is ready to welcome and grant visas to all supporters wishing to attend the World Cup and is committed to supporting companies that seek to set up businesses in the Kingdom.”

Rabat – Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, said during a televised interview on January 22 that “opening borders with neighboring countries is not on the Algerian agenda.” Invited to participate in “L’invité de la rédaction” on Algerian national radio, Messahel was asked by the moderator whether Algerian borders would be opened to promote trade with neighboring countries. Messahel indicated that “the problem does not arise in terms of opening or not opening the borders. There are security priorities; borders are porous and large, and they need to be monitored.” However, according to Messahel, this does not mean that “the Algerian-Moroccan border will remain closed. But if the border is opened, we want regional integration,” he said. He concluded by saying that in order to open borders with neighboring countries, “we must have a concrete strategy.” Algeria’s border with Morocco was closed in 1994 following new Moroccan visa requirements for Algerian visitors in reaction to a Marrakech terrorist attack perpetrated by a group of Algerians. Algerian Foreign Affairs Minister and former high ranking UN mediator, Lakhdar Brahimi, repeatedly expressed a desire to see Morocco and Algeria open their borders in favor of economic exchange. He wants the two countries to “leave the Sahara issue aside in an effort to build a communal economy based on exchange within the context of improving the dynamics the Maghreb region.”

Rabat – Moroccan cleric, Sheikh Abderahman Sekkach, has stirred up debate once again after claiming that women who have extramarital sex would inevitably have “uterus cancer.” “Sex out of wedlock causes uterus cancers,” Essekach said Jan. 19 on the Moroccan private radio channel Chada FM. The cleric argued that during her first sexual intercourse, the woman’s vagina inscribes the “code” of her husband’s sperm. Therefore, in case of extramarital relationships, this “code” would not be recognized, and the wife would inevitably contract a uterus cancer. To support his arguments, Sekkach declared that this “extraordinary discovery” was made by “Western scientists.” According to Sekkach, “Western scientists” have shown that the “idda,” the “mourning” period that a Muslim woman must observe after the death of her spouse or after a divorce before contracting a new marriage, corresponds to the time required for the vagina to erase the “code” of the former husband. “What Western scientists have just discovered, the prophet already knew about it 14 centuries ago. He knew that the uterus needed these 4 months and 10 days to change the sperm code. How did he [know], if it is not the divine miracle?” he said. The cleric’s comments sparked arguments on social media. Moroccan sociologist and feminist activist Soumaya Naamane Guessous expressed her outrage in a long post published on her Facebook page in which she insisted on the “danger” of such remarks. “These broadcasts are an insult to Moroccans intelligence and to their dignity. I am ashamed! They are dangerous because they dull listeners who number in the thousands and even millions,” she wrote. “Is it normal in 21st-century Morocco … to allow this kind of idiocy? Is it acceptable for radio station managers to give the antenna to such ignorant [people] to inform and guide our people. Do these officials listen to these programs, as some of them are progressive?” Guesous continued. In 2016, the Moroccan High Authority of Audiovisual Communication “severely punished” Chada FM officials after Sekkach claimed that women “have no right to leave their homes, nor the right to work,” and that women’s main place remains at home. “When a woman enjoys food, clothes, a house and a husband, she must stay at home. Otherwise, she becomes a sinner before God. These sentences are not of my own invention, they are directly taken from the holy Qur’an,” Sekkach added. Following these comments, the HACA issued a press release stating that Chada FM’s guest and broadcasters violated Articles 3 and 8 of Law 77.03 related to audiovisual communication, which state that Moroccan audiovisual communication is free, and the exercise of this freedom must be “applied with respect and human dignity … audiovisual communication operators must promote a culture of gender equality and combat all forms of discrimination, especially those that degrade the image of the woman.”

Rabat – Moroccan inflation is on the rise as the consumer price index increased by 0.7 percent in 2017, according to the latest figures of Morocco’s High Commission for Planning.  In its latest report on Morocco’s consumer price index (CPI) for 2017, the HCP noted a deterioration in the financial situation of households and a rather mixed perception of its future evolution.

This resulted in a 0.3 percent increase of the underlying inflation index.  Between November and December, vegetable prices rose by 5.4 percent, followed by meat prices by 1.3 percent and oil and butter prices by 0.5 percent. These increased were offset however with a decline of 2.4 percent in fruit prices, and 0.4 percent in coffee, tea and cocoa prices.

Rabat – Ally Coulibaly, Côte d’Ivoire‘s minister of African Integration and Ivorians Abroad, said on Thursday in Rabat that his country shares Morocco’s vision for managing migration. “We have a convergence of views regarding the issue of migration and we share the same vision for solutions that should be brought to manage this phenomenon,” Coulibaly told the press after a meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita. The two nations’ presidents agreed that it is only through “cooperation between the countries of departure, transit, and destination [that it will be possible]… to find solutions to this key issue,” the Ivorian minister said. .“The strengthening of this bilateral partnership requires the continuation of permanent dialogue between Côte d’Ivoire and Morocco,” he continued. Morocco has long advocated for initiatives aiming at achieving a paradigm shift on migration in Africa. The country wants to approach the issue through dialogue and humanism to maximize benefits. Morocco’ “leading role in driving for positive change” in migration policy is endorsed and supported by the International Organization for Migration, which shares its 56 years of expertise with governmental and non-governmental actors to integrate migrations into key sectors, such as health and education. In 2013, King Mohammed VI held a meeting with then Minister of Interior Mhand El Anssar and some human rights stakeholders to adopt Morocco’s migration and asylum policy and begin creating and implementing asylum procedures for foreign residents in the kingdom. The decision was regarded as a turning point in Morocco’s view towards human rights for undocumented residents, mainly sub-Saharan migrants, originally from countries including Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Senegal, Nigeria and Guinea.

Rabat – In Morocco, minimum wages are significantly lower than the survival baseline, or what could be described as a living wage, a report by Oxfam International released on Monday. Some of the world’s richest gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos to attend the report’s presentation. Initial findings indicate that more than half of respondents consider it is difficult or impossible to increase their incomes, despite working hard. While presenting the survey, Oxfam representatives shared information about the current high levels of wealth concentration and low social mobility. In Morocco, the richest 10 percent of Moroccans have a standard of living 12 times higher than the poorest 10 percent, a gap that has not decreased since the 1990s. At the present, three wealthy Moroccan billionaires alone hold S4.5 billion. Per year, their wealth is equivalent of the income of 375,000 poorest Moroccans during the same period. Fifteen percent of Moroccan respondents identified the government as responsible for reducing the wealth gap between rich and poor, Oxfam reported. “The reality of inequalities in Morocco is well pronounced and calls for ambitious measures. It is now up to the government and the various institutions of the country to tackle the root of the scourge of inequality, creating an economic system that benefits all, not only a few privileged,” said Abdeljalil Laroussi, spokesman for Oxfam in Morocco. Earlier this month,  Nizar Baraka, president of the Social Economic and Environmental Council (CESE) stated that it is impossible to reach a per capita income of S1,000 per month by 2030. In 2017 alone, 82 percent of global wealth went to the 1 percent of the world’s richest individuals; their collective wealth increase of S762 billion is enough money to end “global extreme poverty seven times over,” reported Oxfam.In a world where 50 percent of the world poorest have seen no increase in wealth during the last year, a new individual reaches billionaire status every two days.  For Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of Oxfam International: “The billionaire boom is not a sign of a thriving economy but a symptom of a failing economic system. The people who make our clothes, assemble our phones and grow our food are being exploited to ensure a steady supply of cheap goods, and swell the profits of corporations and billionaire investors.”

Rabat – The Algerian National Centre of Research in Social and Cultural Anthropology (CNRPAH), has just announced that experts from Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia are currently considering a “common” proposal to add the world-famous couscous to UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage List.    “The issue of the ranking of couscous as universal heritage is a project common to the Maghreb countries,” Slimane Hachi, director of the center, told the Algerian state press agency APS on Monday.  “The project is underway and experts from these countries will be meeting soon,” he added, without providing further details. According to Ouiza Gallèze, a researcher at the center, this ranking would shed light on both the “ancestral nature of this dish, which is several thousand years old, and on its transculturality, since it belongs to several peoples,” adding that the dish has  “remained authentic without being fixed.”  She also pointed out that its eventual classification as  humanity’s cultural heritage, “must integrate at least the Maghreb countries,” as part of “a recognition and a way to strengthen the solid links between the peoples.”  “Just like any other cultural element, couscous could be a means of bringing people together,” the cultural heritage specialist said.  The exact etymology of the word “couscous” is contested. It is often assumed that ”couscous” is derived from the classical Arabic word” couscous” (pronounced in English as /kuskus/) and from the Amazigh word “kseksu,” that designates both the durum wheat semolina and the traditional dish of which it is the main ingredient.  However, some think that the word “couscous” could be derived from the classical Arabic word “kaskash” (to pound small), by means crushing and grinding. Also, the word “couscous could be derived from (ftat), referring to the breakful of nourishment that the bird gives to its fledglings.  Theories also differ on the exact origin of the couscous grain itself.Some claim that couscous originated in Ethiopia and was brought to the Maghreb in the seventh century A.D. by conquering Arab armies. However, other archaeological evidence dating back to the ninth century traces couscous’ origin to North Africa itself. Even though couscous’ fame has greatly exceeded the Maghreb’s borders, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia each claim to be the original cradle of this special dish, based on durum wheat semolina prepared with olive oil and accompanied with vegetables, spices, meat, or fish. In ancient Morocco, couscous was the regular dinner for nearly all Moroccans, but as time went by, people started to usually prepare it every Friday.

Rabat – Moroccan DJ Khalil Belkas, widely known by his stage name “DJ Van,” performed in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, on Saturday night. He performed a dazzling show in front of a large audience whose attention he captivated with his beats. In a statement to Maroc Arabe Presse, the DJ expressed his pride to perform for an Ethiopian audience and introduce them to his 2013 album,  “Moroccan Touch.” Since Morocco’s return to the African Union (AU) last January, the country has been looking to build coalitions and increase its political influence on the continent. However, DJ Van’s performance in the city of the AU’s headquarters may also demonstrate part of Morocco’s desire to expand its cultural influence, too. “It is a national duty… It is a mission I gave myself to broadcast Moroccan music on a global scale” he says. The Moroccan artist, producer, and composer is known for his signature mixture of Moroccan folk music and modern electro. This blend of different types of music results in an unexpected piece of art, appreciated by all generations. The artist started his journey as a DJ during high school, his talent and dedication have led him years later to become the producer behind hits such as “Enty” by Saad Lamjarrad, “L’Ghoul” by Muslim, and “#Woman” featuring TYRANE. In 2014, the artist was nominated for an MTV Music Award for his collaboration with Saad Lamjarrad on “Enty.” “I’m happy, we are all happy and proud because we put Moroccan music on MTV. It was all a dream before; now, it’s [all] happening,” said DJ Van in his interview with Al Arabiya News.

Rabat – A number of high school girls won the DigiGirlz Program awards yesterday evening in Rabat. Yesterday’s ceremony was the culmination of a national campaign initiated late last year. The contest aims at reducing men’s dominance over technological innovations, and is the exclusive preserve of girls working on digital projects. The program envisions a more diverse and inclusive corporate world. 160 contestants aged 15-18 initially took part in the DigiGirlz Morocco in the preliminary campaigns in Kenitra, Tiznit, and Errachidia. But only 46 made it to yesterday’s final in Rabat. The ceremony marked the participation of the American Emily Reid (founder of Education at Girls who Code) as special guest. During the award ceremony, contestants were given five minutes to explain their projects as well as their significance for daily life in their respective communities. As the competition focused this year on “Education”, Safaa Ouchen, the project’s coordinator in Morocco, told the press that “The girls worked on applications about the problems confronting Morocco’s educational system”, adding that “they proposed innovative solutions to tackle those education-related problems.” The first award went to two girls from Omar Al Khayam high school in Rabat. Their project, Centrip, is a mobile application that allows a rational management of a travel-budget around Africa. A group of girls from Kenitra won the second prize with Fun Learning, an application that eases the process of reviewing class materials. As for the third prize, it went to girls from Tata; they created Akka, an application that allows the youth of their town to locate and apply for jobs that suit their skills and interests. The prizes amounted to $1000, $700, and $400, respectively. Breaking the glass ceiling After the ceremony, Safaa Oucheen expressed her heartfelt satisfaction with Morocco DigiGirlz. For her, the program is essential because it allows “more female visibility and influence” in a field “generally dominated by men”. She went on, in a very pleased mood, to explain that “Morocco DigiGirlz seeks to vulgarize technological knowledge and encourage female competence. We are promoting scientific education to Moroccan girls, the spirit of entrepreneurship, and gender equality.”

Rabat – A large number (by thousands) of medical certificates are issued on daily basis for employees, be they working in the private or public sector. This, according to many, explains why many offices are almost always empty. According to Al Massae, the Moroccan government is planning to issue a decree that will stop, or at least considerably reduce, this uncontrolled and detrimental proliferation of medical certificates. The government considers such practices as an important reason for low output and poor quality of work in many sectors. The government is therefore said to be planning harsh measures against the routine absenteeism of public employees. From now on, AL Massae added, absences from work will be either due to serious and strongly convincing reasons, or be duly punished by the disciplinary commission that the new bill will introduce. The commission will oversee the strict respect and implementation of relevant disciplinary measures. The outlet cited the example of the ministry of national education which, in just six months, registered a shocking figure of 54,000 sick leaves, many of which were suspected to be obtained through fake medical certificates. According to official statistics, a whopping number of these fake certificates is generally issued by private hospitals. This, Al Massaeexplained, is the case because norms for issuing medical certificates are stricter and more respected in public hospitals, especially since a related circular by former minister of health, Houcine Louardi. It is hoped that such measures by the government will stop unjustified work leaves and eradicate the now fashionable excuse of “malade imaginaire” (those who fake illness).

Rabat – If you’re unfamiliar with the concept of cryptocurrency, you could be forgiven for thinking that this market is solely dominated by the globally renowned Bitcoin. In fact, this is just one of many digital currencies that are emerging on the back of Blockchain technology, with many finding niches in the form of various applications and locations across the globe. Take the Habibi Coin, for example, which is essentially a Middle Eastern iteration of Bitcoin and one that has popularized cryptocurrency within the region. In this post, we’ll review the Habibi Coin, its reason for existing and ask what’s next for its future. What is the Habibi Coin, and Why Does it Exist? In simple terms, the Habibi Coin was established by Dubai-based entrepreneur Com Mirza as a Middle Eastern alternative to Bitcoin, and one that had the capacity to introduce Blockchain to the region. In this respect, the burgeoning cryptocurrency has played a key role in Middle Eastern finance, as it has transcended the market by complying with Shariah Law and enabling Muslims to leverage this technology freely. After all, Islam and Shariah doctrines set out clear lending rules that make it difficult for Muslims to charge interest in exchange for borrowing money, so cultivating a specialist version of Bitcoin represented the best possible way to negate this. In terms of initial applications, the Habibi Coin has been utilized to negate the payment of interests and some of the inherent risks associated with buying property. In simple terms, this new digital currency allows Muslim users to adhere to their faith while also investing in real estate and similar financial assets classes, serving as a decentralized payment system that eliminates fees and the deployment of costly middlemen. A Burgeoning Market, but What’s Next for the Habibi Coin? The ultimate goal of the brains behind the Habibi Coin is to create the largest, Shariah-compliant digital tokens in the world, and it’s arguably well on the way to achieving this lofty ambition. As if to reaffirm this, its creator is planning to launch a $100 million ICO (Initial Coin Offering), which will enable innovators to carve out new applications for the Habibi Coin in Muslim communities across the globe. Apparently, $3 million has already been raised to achieve this goal, so this is definitely a space to watch in the future. Beyond this, Habibi Coin is also helping to establish Dubai as a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market, as the city looks to capitalize on the uncertainly engulfing fin-tech leaders in London and Europe. Now emerging as the focal point for Blockchain advancement and innovation, Dubai is seeking sustained investment from potential partners and thriving on the back of the early-stage success of the little-known Habibi Coin.

Rabat – Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called on the European Union to recognize the Palestinian state during his official visit to Brussels, Belgium. In Brussels, the Palestinian President met with EU foreign ministers and Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. According to Reuters, Mogherini urged officials engaged in negotiations regarding Donald Trump’s Jerusalem decision to act “wisely.”  Speaking of the Palestinian President, Mogherini said, “I want to reassure President Abbas of the firm commitment of the EU to the two-state solution with Jerusalem as the shared capital of the two states.” Many global officials and Arab leaders, including Abbas, believe that Trump’s move has made future peace talks between Palestine and Israel “impossible.” After hearing of Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital during a visit to Paris, Abbas announced on December 22 that Palestine will no longer accept “any plan” for peace proposed by the United States. “The United States are no longer an honest mediator in the peace process. We will not accept any plan put from the United States,” Abbas said at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. His statement came just hours after 128 members of the United Nations General Assembly adopted by an overwhelming majority a resolution that rejects Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. France, having previously condemned Washington’s decision on Jerusalem, also voted in favor of the resolution. Prior to the vote, which took place in December, Trump had threatened to cut aid to UN members who would vote against his decision. On January 17, the US administration voiced its willingness to cut more than half of the financial aid that the US normally provides to the United Nations agency helping Palestinian refugees, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the US State Department said on Tuesday that the Trump administration will provide only USD 60 million to thUNRWA. She added that the country will withhold another 65 million USD “for future consideration,” reported American news outlet the New York Times. Nauert went on to explain that the US’ move is aimed at encouraging other countries to increase their funding for the UN agency. Nauert also insisted that this latest move by the administration was not linked to the threats voiced by Donald Trump after the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to condemn his recent decision to recognize Jerusalem as its capital and to relocate the US embassy.

An unprecedented decision in Morocco, the King issued a royal decree on January 22, allowing women to exercise several duties as notary officials, including documenting marriages.

Rabat – Nearly two years after its release, the first animated movie about iconic Islamic figure Bilal Ibn Rabah, “Bilal: A New Breed of Hero,” will be available in United States theaters on February 2.   The story takes place in Mecca, the city where Islam flourished 1400 years ago. It is based on the true story of Bilal Ibn Rabah, a freed slave of Ethiopian origin, who converted to Islam and became one of the most trusted and loyal companions of the prophet Muhammad.   Chosen by the prophet himself to be the first muezzin — the person who leads the call to prayer — as he was known for his beautiful and far-reaching voice.  The animated movie is the first feature film released by Dubai-based production company Barajoun Entertainment. Barajoun’s founder, Ayman Jamal, also wrote and directed the film. He said he wrote it to inspire a new generation of kids based on real historical heroes from his culture.  “I asked my 5-year-old son what he wanted to be when he grew up. He said Superman. I love Superman, but I wish he’d said something possible, and I wanted to create this. To inspire kids with a real human superhero that they can aspire to,” Jamal said.  “Superman is the reason I did this. I had to save my kid,” Jamal added.  According to Jamal, the project was in development for eight years and required a team of 11 researchers to ensure the film was historically accurate. It also employed about 250 animation professionals — some of whom have previous credits such as Shrek, Life of Pi, Star Wars and The Avengers — who helped bringing the movie to life. The film, only now set for official distribution in the United States, initially premiered on Dec. 9, 2015 at the 12th Annual International Dubai Film Festival and was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the 2016 Asia Pacific Screen Awards.  “We hope this movie has provided a role model that will transcend time,” Jamal said.  A number of people have taken to Twitter to express their excitement for the much-awaited film.  Today as we honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, let us remember that one courageous person can make a difference in this world. He reminds us that our voice makes us powerful and we can make a difference.

Rabat – America’s heartland is still the heart of the country. A character in the classic American 1930s novel, The Grapes of Wrath, observed the simple but profound power of place: “Fella gets use’ to a place, it’s hard to go. Fella gets use’ to a way of thinkin’ it’s hard to leave.” Candidates for the presidency begin their political campaigns every four years in two small rural states: Iowa and New Hampshire. Even in the new economy that emphasizes urban centers and professional services, small towns and remote mid-size cities matter, too. Even more so in Morocco: the attachment by people to the land – real land with greenery, trees, farms and oases – is profound and, in many ways, spiritual. About 40 percent of Moroccans live in remote villages, small towns or small cities. In a recent post, a Washington Post writer and data analyst described a blunt fact about job opportunities and location: “There remains a disconnect between where job seekers are sitting and where the help-wanted signs are out.” The US unemployment rate is 4.1 percent, the lowest in 17 years. But many of those new economy jobs are found in large, medium, and small metropolitan areas or their immediate peripheries. The American rural job market is four percent smaller now than it was before the Great Recession (2007-09). That represents hundreds of thousands of jobs gone forever. Many outlying rural cities and towns have rebounded utilizing new economic opportunities, local ingenuity, technology and funding from various sources. But many towns that were once dependent on a single manufacturing or mining industry do not have the same bounty of opportunities in the post-industrial economy. Additionally, big box retailers like Walmart and Sears have closed hundreds of rural stores in the last two years as shoppers turn to online retail options. A slightly inverse situation can be seen in Morocco, rural unemployment may be modestly lower than urban unemployment (especially among young people under 30), but work in agriculture is seasonal and irregular, especially with erratic rainfall patterns. Underemployment in Morocco’s rural regions is very high – 12 percent or higher. The deaths of two young men in Jerada, a mining town in east central Morocco whose economic fortunes have declined significantly over two decades, represents a harsh reality about rural life. It’s also an indicator of the power of place, of home. The two brothers drowned while mining for coal in an ad hoc mine late last year. Morocco’s total economic wealth has doubled in less than twenty years, and there are new business and investment hubs being planned for the big cities. We are entering the era of the city, but small towns still matter. Discovering new value in rural towns means discovering new work opportunities for rural workers; filling in the holes of seasonal employment. It should be a key strategy for Morocco, and rural America. Can we save small towns and rural cities? It seems critically important that political and community leaders try. And it matters for the national economy: Agriculture, the bedrock (and often unappreciated) sector, accounts for nearly 40 percent of the jobs in the kingdom. It’s a fact – and a rural asset – that won’t change much in the short and medium term. Aziz Akhannouch, Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, noted a new opportunity for Jerada several weeks ago: agriculture. Tangible and, with adequate irrigation, sustainable. “Agriculture sector could be a lever for development in the province,” he said. He promised MAD 28 million in aid to the area’s municipalities. As the kingdom moves forward on comprehensive decentralization, the ability and necessity for regional and commune leaders to actively envision the future of their jurisdictions is crucial, from land rent reform to promoting tourism to technology-based work-at-home options. Often, there is no single solution to rural decline in a given town. In the US, rural development associations often must gather together a myriad of funding sources to create new economic opportunities. Often that support is seed money for one or two years to develop an idea and get it off the ground. Following protests in Jerada after the deaths of the two brothers, the Wali of the region recently announced concrete steps to support Jerada’s economic well-being: adding capacity and jobs at the Jerada power station, hiring and training preferences for local young adults, more subcontracting transportation jobs for locals, and making it easier (and safer) for the remaining miners to work by performing new seismic land surveys. Local solutions with local leadership. And patience. In my former Peace Corps site near Errachidia, a Frenchman bought a couple acres near the town center in 2013. Off the beaten path, and with not much money, he toiled with the help of a few local laborers to build a campground (auberge). Five years later, it’s now part of the circuit for many desert rallies headed toward Merzouga, three hours away. He uses nearly a dozen locals to run the campground, tend the garden, plan excursions, landscape and cook meals for the growing number of travelers who visit the area. Seed money, local talent, location, and luck. Rural America and rural Morocco both overcome adversity because of factors that are difficult for economists to measure. Optimism and emotional durability are two of them. Sustainable development can include the value of people staying in place, reimagining economic and social life in a physical place. Not massive transfers of government aid to reconstruct a bygone era, but strategic investments that harness local resilience. For many people, the attachment to land, to family, to past traditions is more important than the amenities of urban living and the prestige of office jobs. Not everyone is looking to ride the high-speed train to work. Urban advocate and scholar Richard Florida said, “Ideas are the currency of the new economy.” It’s as true in the village and small town as it is in the city. he views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not represent any institution or entity.  © Morocco World News.

Rabat – Unequal distribution of wealth and insufficient regional social equity make it highly unlikely that Morocco will achieve a per capita income of USD 1,000 per month by 2030, said Nizar Baraka, president of the Social Economic and Environmental Council (CESE). While the overall wealth of Morocco more than doubled between 1999 and 2013, from 5.904 billion dirhams to 12.833 billion, representing an average annual increase of 5 percent, the country will inescapably experience more financial social disputes. Generally, this is because of the worrying number of the unemployed, of whom no less than 1.7 million have never attended school. Nationally, unemployment rates increased from 9.1 to 9.3 percent, and grew from 13.4 to 14 percent in urban areas in early 2017, according to the figures published by the High Commission for Planning (HCP). Unemployment is projected to worsen in 2018, as the national economy will slow down by 2.6 percent during the first three months of the year; the remaining 9 months largely dependent on rainfall, says the HCP. Beyond unemployment, the average Moroccan spends barely two minutes reading per day, which considerably reduces creativity and innovative skills, making it very challenging to find employment outside of the traditional job market, according to the same source.  Rich Morocco, Poor Morocco “At the regional level, Morocco suffers poor distribution of wealth and poor social equity,” he said.  Nizar Baraka cited the variable prices of gas containers as a pertinent example of the socio-economic disparities in Morocco. “Gas containers, sold at MAD 43 dirhams in urban areas, can cost up to MAD 70 in rural Morocco, reaching up to MAD 100 when weather circumstances worsen, and this is but one example.” In 2016, 49.96 percent of rural residents told representatives from the HCP  that they live in extreme poverty. This regional gap is likely “to destroy” citizen confidence in elected officials and in the political system, said the former Minister for General Affairs during the Abbas El Fassi government. Though a previous report by the Arab Investment and Credit Guarantee Corporation (SAGIC) shows that from  2003 to 2016 Morocco received 888 new projects, creating 241,772 jobs in 698 companies. According to Baraka, the fruits of these investments have not been distributed equally. This is due to dysfunctions in the management of investments, both foreign and domestic, “which would take more than 15 years to be overcame,” Baraka indicates. Even if the country deploys effective policies to reduce disparities and unemployment, “Morocco will certainly not make an economic leap by 2030.” “It is impossible,”  he says, to achieve a per capita income of USD 1,000 per month in the next fifteen years. “We must not delude ourselves.”

By Sana El Ouazi Rabat – In 2017, Moroccan air traffic increased significantly, with an 11.63 percent rise in the number of passengers who passed through Moroccan airports, the National Office of Airports (ONDA) announced Monday. “2017 set a new record for the Kingdom’s airports, which welcomed 20,357,866 passengers, a sharp rise of around 11.63 percent”, said the ONDA, noting that this double-digit rise “has not been reached since the year 2010.” For the first time, the Mohammed V airport exceeded its yearly average of nine  million travelers, registering 9,357,427 passengers and marking an increase of 8.60 percentage points over 2016. The growth was sharper in Tangiers at 26.11 percent, Fez at 24.93 percent, Agadir at 15.74 percent and Marrakesh at 11.96 percent, says the ONDA. Domestic traffic also recorded a gain of 11.23 percent, with 2,133,287 million passengers in 2017, exceeding the average 2 million. According to the ONDA’s annual statistics, air freight experienced growth of 18.95 percent during 2017, recording an increase of 81,408.03 tons compared to 68,436.24 tons in 2016. The increase in flights was equivalent to the increase of tourists in 2017. The number of tourists who visited Morocco in 2017 was up 10 percent from 2016, according to the Ministry of Tourism. This increase meant a total of 64.4 billion dirham for the Moroccan economy by the end of November 2017, which was a 6.6 percent increase compared to the same period of 2016. There was a steady rise in the number of tourists coming to Morocco from Europe, but the most notable and encouraging increase in tourist numbers came from what can be described as new and emerging markets for Morocco. The number of tourists from China last year saw a staggering increase of 173 percent. Tourists from Brazil increased by 57 percent, and tourism rates from the United States, South Korea, and Japan all increased by 30 percent. More complete year-end statistics are expected.

Rabat – Morocco is expected to play a friendly game against Argentina in Casablanca’s stadium in May, an opportunity that Moroccan fans of Argentina’s key footballer Leo Messi will enjoy. According to Moroccan newspaper Ahdath Al Maghribia, Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) is working intensively to work out a date for a friendly match between the Atlas Lions and Argentina. The match will be part of Morocco’s training sessions in preparation for the 2018 World Cup, which will kick off June 15. The training sessions will allow Morocco’s national football team coach Herve Renard to identify the strengths and weaknesses of his squad. The sessions are also aimed at helping Moroccan footballers improve their performances. FRMF is currently holding talks with Argentina’s football federation to make the game official, added to an unidentified source quoted by newspaper. The Moroccan squad is also set to play friendly matches against Serbia and Uzbekistan. The friendly game against Serbia is scheduled for March 23 in London, while the match against Uzbekistan is set to be played in Casablanca on March 27. Before the tournament’s final draw on December 1 in Moscow, Moroccan daily newspaper Assabah reported that Morocco’s Renard wanted his team to play against European and Latin American squads to evaluate the Lions’ abilities. Earlier this year, speculation spread in international media that the Moroccan team would play two friendlies against Scotland and Argentina. Fouzi Lekjaa, president of FRMF, said in an interview with Moroccan sports channel Arriyadia that the Moroccan squad will face Argentina in a friendly in Agadir. FRMF was also wishing for a friendly against the Belgian national football team, but the Belgian football federation denied its request. In December, Youssef Hijoub, a Moroccan FIFA agent, said that the Belgian team declined FRMF’s invitation due to security concerns. Speaking in a TV program featured by French news channel France24, Hijoub said that the Belgian authorities refused friendly matches against countries of North Africa, including Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria in order to avoid all security threats.

Rabat – According to Moody’s, the dirham risks “no major currency disruptions or depreciation pressure” following the launch of the flexible exchange rate regime.  In its latest analysis report, the United States-based rating agency echoed the reassurances of Bank Al Maghrib and Morocco’s Ministry of Finance. The gradual liberalization of the dirham is expected to improve Morocco’s foreign exchange reserves and its competitiveness, according to Moody’s. In a note published Monday, the rating agency’s analysis presented a favorable outlook of Morocco’s new exchange rate regime. Moody’s explained that Morocco’s current account deficit, which rests at about 4 to 5 percent, in combination with its significant foreign exchange buffer that amounts to six months of import cover, is sufficient to sustain the first phase of the liberalization reform with no risk of devaluation. Morocco’s access to the $3.5 billion granted by the International Monetary Fund under the Precautionary Liquidity Line agreement approved in July 2016 “provides an additional backstop in case of unforeseen balance-of-payment disruptions, which is not our expectation,” added the agency. According to Moody’s, Morocco is far from following Egypt’s example, as the kingdom’s relative price stability and average inflation rate of 1.2 percent between 2010 to 2015 “has ensured a broad alignment of the nominal and the real effective exchange rates with no indication of significant trend deviations between them.” In contrast, Egypt’s inflation rate reached over 34 percent in July 2017. Although Egypt’s devaluation has subsequently restored the country’s external competitiveness and prompted restoration of its foreign-exchange buffer to 2010 levels, “we [Moody’s] do not anticipate similar adjustment pressures in Morocco.” As for future forecasts, Moody’s wrote that Morocco’s trade diversification strategy toward Africa and other emerging markets “could weigh on its relative cost competitiveness under a rigid peg to the euro and dollar basket, versus a scenario where the nominal exchange rate absorbs any shifts in relative labor or production costs more flexibly.” “To the extent that the foreign-exchange liberalisation strategy is accompanied by easing capital controls that we expect once the stability of the more flexible exchange rate regime has been tested, it could also encourage higher direct investment inflows in the domestic economy,” explained the agency.

Rabat – After a long week of arduous negotiations, Wydad of Casablanca has caved in and decided to sell its striker Achraf Bencherki to Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia for $9 million. The Saudi club announced the news to its fans on its Twitter account couple of hours ago. #??_????_????? ???#?????? pic.twitter.com/vOfQ8ylXqR — ???? ?????? ??????? (@Alhilal_FC) January 22, 2018  After a long week of arduous negotiations, Wydad of Casablanca has caved in and decided to sell its striker Achraf Bencherki for $9 million. According to the agreement signed between the two teams, Wydad of Casablanca will receive $5 million, Maghreb of Fez, the team where the players grew up, will receive $1.25 million and the player will receive $3 million. Last week, Al Hilal made a first offer of $3 million, which the Moroccan team turned down. “WAC received an offer from Saudi club, Al-Hilal, as mentioned in the attached statement. Chairperson of Wydad, Saeed Al-Nasseri, decided to keep Achraf Bencherki as a player for Wydad.” Bencherki’s transfer to the Saudi club made headlines in the past two weeks and created a heated debate between those who support his move and those who advise him to turn down the Saudi offer. Many new sources reported that Morocco’s head coach Hervé Renard, was not supportive of the striker’s transfer to Al Hilal. The talented footballer rose to prominence in recent months, especially after his performance with Wydad of Casablanca in the African Champions League. Bencherki played a key role in helping his team win the continental title by scoring five goals in the tournament.

Rabat – In efforts to promote direct negotiations over the Western Sahara conflict, the United Nations Secretary-General Envoy Horst Kohler has invited the two parties to “separate meetings” scheduled for January 24 and 26 in Berlin, Germany. Akhbar Al Yaoum reported on Monday that Kohler aspires to open a new round of negotiations to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara conflict through the talks to be held in Berlin. Moroccan news outlet Le360, quoting an unidentified source, said that the meetings will be “separate.” It has been 10 years now since Morocco and the separatist group held talks. The last meeting of the two parties dates back to January 2008 in New York, where a series of talks, dubbed “the Manhasset negotiations,” were held between the Moroccan government and representatives of Polisario. The previous series of talks were aimed at reaching a mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara conflict. According to Akhbar Al Yaoum, Kohler was expected to meet with Polisario’s leader, Ibrahim Ghali, and his representatives at the camps of Tindouf on January 24 and 26. However, according to Moroccan and international press, Kohler wants the meeting to be held in his homeland, Germany. The idea of direct negotiations was welcomed by the separatist front, while Morocco seems “reluctant” to meet with Polisario, an unidentified source told Akhbar Al Yaoum. In recent months, the front has been conducting a series of illegal maneuvers near the Guerguerat buffer zone, moves denounced by Morocco, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, and MINURSO. Kohler promises a new vision that might help to end the conflict between Morocco and Polisario. Earlier this month, the envoy for the Western Sahara met with African officials in order to promote collaborations with African leaders to reach a mutually acceptable solution to the territorial dispute. Kohler held talks with African Union Commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, about the conflict between Morocco and the Algeria-backed Polisario. Kohler aims, through this strategy, to provide the African Union with an opportunity to propose solutions that would help to put an end to the conflict. It remains to be seen will be amenable to the new approach adopted by the UNSG personal envoy and whether it will accept any involvement of the AU in the UN-led political process.

Rabat – Latest figures of Europe’s border agency, known as Frontex, have shown that nearly 22,900 migrants from Morocco and Algeria reached the Spanish coast in 2017 compared to 10,231 in 2016. According to Frontex data, almost 40 percent of the migrants were nationals of Algeria and Morocco, whose numbers have been on the rise since the middle of 2017. The remaining migrants came from Western Africa, mainly from Guinea, Gambia, and Ivory Coast.  “The flows arriving from Maghreb countries to Spain are very likely to increase this year,” said Fabrice Leggeri, the director of Frontex, adding that the flows were boosted by the use of fast boats capable of transporting large numbers of migrants. Leggeri also pointed out that unrest in Morocco’s northern Rif region, together with the improvement of Spain’s economic situation have played a role in the increased arrival of illegal migrants to the Iberian peninsula, but sub-Saharan Africans are also crossing the border.  The situation in the Rif region of Morocco created an opportunity for more departures from its western coast in the second half of the year. Without jumping to conclusions, Leggeri speculated that the intense deployment of Moroccan police to the Rif region over the past months has resulted in a decrease in the number of Moroccan security forces controlling the Spanish border, which allowed migrants to cross the border more easily. Amid the unrest in the Rif region, many NGOs have noted a remarkable increase in illegal migration attempts from the Moroccan coast to Spain.   Spain’s interior minister, Juan Ignacio Zoido, has also confirmed the “massive” arrival of Moroccans to the Iberian coast.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – This weekend, a combination of Spanish professionals and civilians rescued 70 people at sea, adrift in the stretch of the Mediterranean between Morocco and Spain.  Saturday afternoon, a local NGO alerted Salvamento Marítimo, a Spain-based search-and-rescue operation, that a rubber dinghy had set sail from Bouyafar, a douar in the Moroccan province of Nador. However, it was a local fisherman who located the dinghy shipwrecked off the coast of the Spanish island of Alborán.  — SALVAMENTO MARÍTIMO (@salvamentogob) January 20, 2018  Salvamento Marítimo reported via Twitter that, of the 37 migrants embarked aboard the dinghy, one had drowned and four others were airlifted to hospitals on the mainland city of Almería.  The second dinghy was located 38 miles south of Almería by another Salvamento Marítimo vessel. 34 people were brought to safety, arriving at the port of Almería late Saturday night. These incidents are far from isolated: just last week, 150 migrants, in similarly precarious boats and in equally inclement weather, were rescued by the Spanish coast guard.  Salvamento Marítimo announced Monday that their operations had rescued 18,937 migrants crossing the Mediterranean in 2017, marking a 182 percent increase since 2016.

Rabat – On January 18, a group of tourists allegedly defaced the wall of an old mosque in the rural commune of Arbaa Ait Ahmed near Tiznit, in the south of Morocco. According to the local news website Tiznit37, the tourists, who spent nearly a week in the resort of “Boutbouqalt”, desecrated the mosque by tagging offensive insults and drawings on its walls, including the drawing of a matchstick man urinating next to the word “peace”. The same source reported that the tourists organized noisy parties late into the night, but the resort’s distance from the village prevented it from becoming a problem. According to the aforementioned source, the local people “have no problem with foreigners, regardless of their culture or origins, and are aware of the principles of freedom and openness, since it does not affect the freedom of others.” However, the tourists did not reciprocate the villagers’ cultural respect. During an activity organized on Wednesday at Dar Talib, a student center,, the tourists publicly drank alcohol, smoked, and played cards nearby. After this incident became viral on social media, residents of Arbaa Ait Ahmed, who consider the desecration of the mosque  an act of “savagery,” demanded that the authorities intervene to protect holy places from such acts. The police opened an investigation and have reportedly interviewed the tourists involved in the vandalism.

Marrakech – The German insurance group Allianz  is encouraging young Moroccan innovators to connect with local and global partners. Its new socio-economic program, “Global Explorer,” brings togetheryoung innovators, associative actors, and entrepreneurs operating mainly in new technologies and sustainable energies. On January 13, Allianz presented “Global Explorer” at a conference titled  “Humanities and Technologies: Building the Future of Morocco.” The program gave young participants the opportunity to share their experiences through workshops that explore how technologies, entrepreneurship, and local initiatives can improve the lives of Moroccans and pave the way for a sustainable way of life in Morocco. The program included a videography workshop for students from Cadi Ayyad University, during which they designed one-minute video to illustrate how technology can support local artisans and strengthen human relationships. One of the participants,  Atmane Ahdach, used the opportunity to showcase how E-commerce can have alternative uses: “Instead of using technology just for fun, it can be used in other positive ways. For instance, in this video, the son is in conflict with his father, who owns a business. The son ought to find a solution to restore his relationship with his father and help promote his business. Thanks to using technology, the son finds the solution: using E-commerce to promote the business.” The Allianz Global Explorer program consists of a series of local and global partnerships aimed at generating content to enable curious minds from around the world to explore, connect, and discuss how disruptive technologies can also serve humanity. The group, which has been in Morocco for one year, wants to digitize its services in order to make the procedures easier for all customers, particularly those in Morocco. “Allianz is committed to improving and optimizing its customer experience through a value proposition that combines traditional channels (agents and brokers), but at the same time an online offering to simplify our procedures,” explained Jan-Marc Paihol, the head of Allianz sales networks for the daily newspaper, Le Matin.

Rabat – After a Nanterre court ordered in early December the closure of a Halal grocery store accused by a local housing authority of “community trading” and non compliance of its lease, many of the store’s regular customers gathered on Saturday at the store to condemn the court’s decision, reported the French Newspaper Le Parisien.  The housing authority had claimed in court that the contract stipulates that the shop must act as a “general food store.”
 “Where do we go if it closes? It’s convenient, we find what we need and it’s cheaper than elsewhere,” said Nadia, a protester who is living in the neighborhood for 40 years. “There are plenty of products that can not be found elsewhere, and there is something else [more] than halal. For alcohol, just go to the shops next door (…) If we must continue to demonstrate, we will do it,” she added.
 Souleymane Yalcin, who owns the Good Price mini-market franchise in Colombes, categorically denied the accusations and the ruling that he was not catering to the demands of his customers in the area. Following the court’s ruling, he decided to appeal the expulsion on Monday.
 “We do not close a store that serves the population,” Yalcine said.
 The case dates back to August 2016, when the office of low-income housing rental (HLM) in Colombes, chaired by the mayor of the city, Nicole Goueta, initiated the lawsuit against the Good Price mini-market for breaching its lease. The landlord pointed out that it was impossible to find bottles of wine or pork on the shelves, even though the lease had been granted for a “general food business.” The office then argued that the commercial space had been rented for “general food activity” and that the store was not serving all members of the local community if there was no alcohol or pork products available.
 The Court of Nanterre, which ruled in favor of the HLM agency, said that a halal grocery store is not a “general food store” and thus doesn’t meet “the needs of all residents of the neighborhood.” This decision is a victory for the mayor, who tried for two years to convince the store manager to diversify his business. From the point of view of the town hall, Good Price, while open, served as a “community grocery store, which corresponds to a religious practice.” “It is a public facility, which depends on the municipal office of HLM, so it was a service given to the population. As a mayor and secular person, I must enforce secularism in the neighborhood,” said Mayor Goueta. The grocery store’s owner argued that alcohol and pork are not essential goods for a supermarket and should not be taken into account. In addition to the termination of the lease and the eviction of the tenants, the manager will also have to pay EUR 4,000 to the lessor for legal costs.

Rabat – Moulay Hafid Elalamy, the chairman of Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid committee, is expected to hold a press conference on Tuesday in Casablanca to unveil key components of Morocco’s bid. The presentation tomorrow will come four months before the June 13 final vote by FIFA’s Congress as to who will host the 2026 World Cup. Elalamy’s press conference tomorrow will be his first media appearance as the manager of the Moroccan 2026 bid committee. The minister is expected to give an hour-long preview of Morocco’s bid, knowing it was just finalized today according to Morocco World News sources. Morocco will be competing against a joint bid by Canada, Mexico and the United States. According to sources close to the case, Morocco’s bid for the 2026 World Cup was developed and refined over the past few months.  “The 300-pages draft was only delivered few days ago,” a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity told Morocco World News. This delay come in contrast to previous years, when “Morocco had its strategy ready at least one year ahead of the event, like in 2010,” added the source.  Morocco thus find itself in a delicate situation.  One thing that might play in favor of Morocco’s bid however, is President Donald Trump. A survey conducted by the The Gallup Organization reveals a dramatic drop in the confidence of US leadership. The American company’s survey of respondents from 134 countries, shows that only 30 percent of respondents worldwide approve of US leadership, a drop of 18 percent from the previous year under President Barack Obama. While this study does not directly affect the organizational capabilities of the United States or the quality of their hosting abilities, it still raises the concern of the president of the American Football Federation, Sunil Gulati.  The official expressed his concerns at a coaching convention in the United States last Thursday.  “It’s not just our stadiums, our hotels and all that. it’s about America’s perceptions, and it’s a tough time in the world. So there are only some things we can control … We have to go out and convince what will eventually be 104 voters to vote for us,” he told British newspaper the Guardian.

Rabat – Several Moroccan nationals were injured this Monday morning when a stampede broke out at the Barrio Chino crossing point in the Spanish enclave of Melilla. The incident happened at about 7:30 a.m., reported Spanish news outlet  Eco Diario, while Morocco’s Association of Human Rights (AMDH) told French News Agency AFP that 11 people were wounded on the Moroccan side. While Moroccan and Spanish media reported that the stampede caused the death of a man who was “severely injured” during the incident, Morocco’s Maghreb Arab Press said that no death cases were recorded. “Contrary to what has been reported, no death was recorded following the incident,” Nador’s local authorities pointed out. Spanish media reported that three were injured on the Spanish side, one of whom is in a “very serious condition.” Authorities in Melilla explained that the crowd rushed Mellila’s entrance from the Moroccan borders “without prior warning.” The police added that the crossing point was closed “pending a return to order and normality at the entrances from Morocco.” This is the second tragedy to take place this week  at a crossing point between the Spanish and Moroccan borders. On January 15, a stampede at Ceuta’s Tarajal II crossing caused the death of two Moroccan women and several injuries. Three reported stampedes happened in 2017. The first incident occurred on March 28, 2017, when a woman tragically lost her life in a stampede, while the second incident dates back to April 24, when a 50-year old woman died under the same circumstances.  The third tragedy took place on August 28, when two Moroccan women died while several others suffered injuries. In June 2017, Spanish authorities made an agreement with the Moroccan government to prevent the so-called “human mules” from crossing the borders through Ceuta’s El Tarajal II crossing in the same day. According to the agreement reached by the two governments, women are allowed to cross the border only on Mondays and Wednesdays, while men will be permitted on  Tuesdays and Thursdays. The decision was taken after Moroccan authorities asked Ceuta’s government to help decrease pedestrian traffic at the border. In the same month, Spanish parliament discussed a suggestion by Podemos Party to improve the working conditions of Ceuta and Melilla’s  human mules. This proposition has not seen a light yet. Thousands of Moroccan women and men cross this border post every week to sell their goods in Morocco and provide for themselves. Often, they carry up to 70 kilos and make several round trips during the day and are sometimes treated inhumanely by Spanish authorities in the crossing points.

Rabat – Participants of the Western Mediterranean Forum on Sunday welcomed Morocco’s proposal to host the 1st ministerial-level meeting of the group dedicated to the region’s youth.  The proposal was announced by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita, who represented Morocco during the forum. Commonly referred to as the 5+5 Dialogue, the January 21 regional gathering was held in Algeria this year and brought together foreign ministers from 10 European, Maghreb and African nations. During the meeting, Bourita underscored the importance of youth empowerment, emphasizing the need to establish a “Regional Agenda” for youth by establishing concrete and innovative projects. The meeting was marked by intense discussions on several issues, including youth and employment, economic and social development, migration, measures to fight terrorism and sustainable development. In terms of inclusive and shared economic and social development, the Moroccan diplomat stressed the need to accelerate the development of the southern portion of the Western Mediterranean region, as there is a notable gap between the North and South of the region in terms of development achievements. “The gap between the two shores is, therefore, real, but the gap within the south shore itself is disappointing,” said Bourita. In order for the countries involved to respond to these development challenges, he reiterated the need for member nations to make a stronger commitment to innovative, inclusive and sustainable approaches to trade development, investment and employment. Bourita has also underlined King Mohammed VI’s social, political and economic priorities. He added that Morocco is involved in a dynamic multi-year process to improve its development model under the leadership of King Mohammed VI. Bourita has also affirmed that the “status quo and protectionism cannot help achieve economic development.” Bourita also pointed out the King’s role in regional migration issues, recalling Morocco’s regularization campaigns launched since 2013 for migrants and refugees. Migration, according to Bourita, will be Morocco’s focus during the 30th AU summit, which will take place this week in Addis Ababa. Created in 1990, the 5+5 Dialogue comprises Morocco, Mauritania, Algeria, France, Italy, Libya, Malta, Portugal, Spain and Tunisia.

Rabat – The Central Criminal Court in Baghdad sentenced a German national woman of Moroccan origin to death by hanging for joining the jihadist group Daesh in Syria and Iraq. The Judge and spokesman of the court, Abdel Settar Bayraqdar, said in a statement that the German national, who was captured by Iraqi forces during the battle in the northern city Mosul last year, was convicted for providing “logistical support and assistance to the terrorist organization in committing crimes.” “She confessed during interrogations that she traveled from Germany to Syria and then joined Daesh in Iraq with her two daughters who then married members of the terrorist organization,” Birqdar said, declining to identify her by name. This is the first time that the Iraqi justice system condemned to death a foreign woman for joining the militant group. The same court, in late September, sentenced to death (by hanging) a Russian man who confessed participating in “terrorist operations” in Mosul since 2015. After a nine-month of counteroffensive, Iraqi forces succeeded in driving Daesh out of all the urban centers of Iraq in late 2017. The Iraqi authorities have never officially indicated the number of foreign detainees it holds. However, it is believed that Iraq is now holding more than 1300 foreign women and children following the operation in Mosul. They include nationals from 14 countries, many of whom will be tried in the Iraqi capital Baghdad. In July, the German justice ministry announced that a 16-year-old German girl, named Linda W., who had joined Daesh had also been arrested in Mosul. After being interviewed by German press, the teenager appeared to show regret for joining the group. “I just want to get away from here, i just want to get away from the war, from the many weapons, from the noise,” she said. “I just want to go home to my family,” Linda added.

Rabat – Morocco will not accept any attack against the Holy Places of Islam and the other Gulf and Arab States, said Mounia Boucetta, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Sunday in Jeddah. During the emergency meeting of foreign ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Boucetta reiterated Morocco’s condemnation of the repeated attacks targeting Saudi Arabia by militias, “which staged a coup against legitimacy in Yemen in flagrant violation of all the UN and the OIC charters and resolutions.” READ ALSO: Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh Killed by Houthis as Alliance Disintegrates For Boucetta, “Morocco supports Saudi Arabia in all the measures it would take in accordance with international legitimacy against these repeated attacks targeting its sovereignty and security.” The Secretary of State stressed the importance of reaching “a peaceful and political solution to the Yemeni crisis on the basis of the Gulf Initiative and the outcomes of Yemen’s Comprehensive National Dialogue Conference.” Boucetta also reiterated Morocco’s solidarity with Saudi Arabia and “the brotherly Gulf and Arab countries in defending their security and territories.” READ ALSO: UN Calls Saudi Arabia Blockade on Yemen ‘Catastrophic,’ Houthis Threaten Gulf Coalition Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al Jubeir said that the attacks of the Houthi militias on Saudi Arabia are “a flagrant violation of the charter of the OIC.” The official added that these militias fired about 300 ballistic missiles, including more than 90 missiles targeting areas and cities of the Saudi Kingdom, including Mecca. Al Jubeir said the launch of an Iranian-made ballistic missile on the city of Riyadh is “in violation of the Charter of the OIC and the United Nations, and international resolutions, especially Security Council resolution 2216.” He stressed that the Iranian regime “continues to provide Houthi militias with weapons to attack the kingdom.” READ ALSO: Houthi Rebels Hand Corpse of Yassine Bahti to Morocco OIC Secretary-General, Yousef Al Othaimeen, called for firm action to address violations by Houthi militias of the rights of the Yemeni people and their attacks against Saudi Arabia and navigation in the Red Sea.

Rabat – Fouzi Lekjaa, President of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) has broken his silence after Saudi Arabia’s Al Hilal raids on Wydad of Casablanca for its key forward, Achraf Bencharki. In an interview with Moroccan TV channel Medi 1 TV, Lekjaa said that “ no one is allowed to influence in any way Bencharki who is currently focusing on his mission with the Moroccan national football team.” Bencharki is among the best players in Morocco after spending a successful season with both the Moroccan national football team and his Wydad of Casablanca team. In recent weeks, the Saudi club has been offering important deals to Wydad of Casablanca for Bencharki. On January 15, the club turned down a USD 3 million offer for Bencharki, explaining that the team is interested in keeping the forward. However, Moroccan and Gulf news outlets reported that Wydad agreed to give in its key player to Al Hilal for USD 5 million. Yet, Wydad has not confirmed the news. In his remarks, Lekjaa said that any deal offered to Bencharki or any other player “must be in favor of the Moroccan football and in favor of players.” Lekjaa, therefore, refused the idea of Bencharki’s transfer as Morocco’s national football team coach relies on him in the 2018 World Cup. FRMF chief said that he held talks with Bencharki about this offer, advising him to refuse offers to clubs that may not help him develop his potential. Saudi Arabia’s news outlet Sabq reported earlier this month that Renard advised Bencharki to decline Al-Hilal offer. Bencharki is currently representing Morocco in the ongoing African Nations championship, which is being held in Morocco from January 13 to February 4. Bencharki scored a goal on Saturday for Morocco in the opening match of the tournament against Mauritania.

Rabat – During the first eleven months of 2017, Ouarzazate’s natural beauty and environmental diversity attracted  244,201 tourists up 38 percent from 177,445 visitors during the same period in 2016. According to Maghreb Arab Press, the increase in tourism is part of a larger pattern. The number of non-resident tourists also increased in 2016 from 132,245 to 189,974. The number of arrivals jumped from 45,200 in 2016 to 54,527 in 2017, representing an increase of 20 percent. As a result, overnight stays in the province’s hotels have also increased by 36 percent, amounting to 360,607 during the first eleven months in 2017. The Provincial Council of Tourism (CPT) described tourism as a critical  sector that represents the “locomotive of socio-economic development of the region.” According to CPT statistics, French tourism marked the highest growth, representing 11.95 percent of total arrivals in Ouarzazate. French visitors from January to November reached 29,195, up from 22,220 in 2016. Spanish visitors came in second, with an increase of 52 percent:14,634 in 222,293 in 2017.

The Chinese market was second in the Asian market ,recording ‘spectacular performances’ at 18,827 visitors. CTP believes that the removal of visa requirements for Chinese tourists was “very beneficial for the sector.”

Rabat – Morocco’s real GDP growth is expected to fall to 3.1 percent in 2018, after reaching  4.1 percent in 2017, a year when the agricultural season was “exceptionally good,” according to a report from the African Development Bank.  The bank’s outlook comes to echo that of the government’s forecasts, which expects a growth rate of 3.2 percent, while maintaining the dynamics of non-agricultural value added, which should reach 3.6 percent in 2018. READ ALSO: Growth of Morocco’s Economy to Decrease by 2.8% in 2018 For the ADB, much of Morocco’s growth achieved in 2017 “was driven by the increase in the value added of agriculture, which grew by 16.1 percent in 2017.” “In addition to favorable weather conditions, the excellent performance of the agricultural sector in 2017 is linked to a 52 percent increase in the use of certified seed, 1.66 million quintals compared to 1.09 million in 2016 and good performance of livestock, market gardening, fruit and fishing,” adds the ADB. READ ALSO: Moroccan Economic Growth to Fall to 2.6% in 2018: HCP As for “the evolution of macroeconomic indicators,” the ADB said that in 2017, Morocco continued its policy of fiscal consolidation it launched in 2011, stressing that the budget deficit settled around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2017 against 4.1 percent in 2016, and is projected to reach three percent in 2018. Foreign trade is also expected to improve compared to 2016, according to the bank. This improvement will be due to lower imports and higher production of wheat, in addition to the evolution of exports resulting from “new trades” in the automotive, aerospace, and electronics sectors, among others. READ ALSO: Morocco’s 2017 Economic Growth: GDP on the Rise, Investment in Decline Regarding the current account deficit, it is estimated at four percent of GDP for 2017 against 4.4 percent in 2016. This improvement, explains the ADB, is due to a 32 percent increase of foreign direct investments and a two percent increase of the remittances of Moroccans living abroad compared to 2016.

Rabat – Morocco’s trade balance is increasingly deepening. In 2017, trade deficit increased for the second year in a row. Relatively weak, Moroccan exports, mainly of the phosphate and the automotive industry, failed to offset the surge of the energy bill. According to recent statistics provided by the Foreign Exchange Office, Morocco’s 2017 trade deficit increased by 2.6 percent, reaching MAD 189.8 billion, compared to MAD 185 billion in 2016. While in 2015 trade deficit improved slightly, this year, Moroccan exports barely managed to cover 56.3 percent of exports, despite the increase of automotive and phosphate exports. READ ALSO: Morocco Trade Deficit Rises by 2.9% According to the Exchange Office, imports increased by 6.3 percent in 2017, while exports increased by 9.3 percent. However, in terms of value, imports cost much more at MAD 434.7 billion, compared to a revenue of MAD 245 billion for exports.   The deepening  of the trade deficit is due to a sharp increase in energy imports, which rose 23.7 percent,  reaching MAD 70 billion, as well as  and a significant increase in oil prices.  The automotive industry marked the largest evolution in exports with a 7.1 percent rise to MAD 58.5 billion, driven by the increase of output of Renault’s Tangier’s factory. Phosphate, meanwhile, was marked by a rising curve, ending the year with results reaching MAD 44 billion in terms of export. READ ALSO: Morocco’s Foreign Trade Data Reveal Higher Energy Bill As for financial flows, remittances of Moroccans residing abroad rose by 4.5 percent in 2017, reaching MAD 65.4 billion compared to MAD 62.6 billion in 2016. At the tourism level, receipts rose by 8.4 percent, reaching MAD 69.6 billion at the end of December 2017. Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows followed the same upward trend, amounting to around MAD 21 billion, an increase of 12 percent from 2016. While the Exchange Office did not reveal the countries of origin of imports and those of Moroccan exports, the European Statistical Office (Eurostat) published data which highlighted that Moroccan export increased increases in 14.08 percent and 9.9 percent from January to October 2017.  According to the same data, Spain is Morocco’s first customer, ahead of France, and its first supplier with share of 36.4 percent of all Moroccan imports.

Rabat – Recent rainfall in Morocco has a positive impact on the agricultural prospects of 2018. The national average rainfall totaled 132.7 millimeters through January 16, reducing the deficit to 25 percent as compared to the average per yearly rainfall, revealed the Ministry of Agriculture. At the start of the agricultural season, the deficit was 61 percent. The recent rainfall brought the deficit down to 36 percent. The ministry added that the melting of snow will contribute to the decrease of the defect in Morocco and will replenishment the groundwater. The state plant biomass production is also promising, said the Ministry, adding that there is sufficient production to meet the needs of the national livestock if the maintenance and nutrition prices remain stable. Out of 4.93 million hectares, the planted area represents 4.68 million hectares, only 10 percent of which is irrigated. Of the arable land, 88 percent is planted with grain, 8 percent for fodder, and 4 percent with vegetables. A total of 48,300 hectares is used for sugar crops, distributed between Doukkala (35 percent), Tadla (28 percent), Gharb (27 percent), Loukkos (6 percent), and Moulouya (5 percent). For sugarcane, the planted area amounts to 12,409 hectares. If the rain continues to fall in the upcoming weeks, water available to farmers will continue to grow and will allow the cycle to catch up after the delayed arrival of the rain.

Rabat – Morocco’s minister of foreign affairs, Nasser Bourita, was welcomed by Algerian officials, including the country’s foreign minister Abdelkader Messahel who recently accused Morocco of “laundering drug money via its banks in the continent.” Bourita landed in Algeria on Sunday in order to take part in the Western Mediterranean Forum, commonly known as the 5+5 Dialogue. Pictures released on social media show the Algerian official as he received the Moroccan foreign minister. Accueil des Minustres des Affaires Étrangères du Dialogue des 5+5. Heureux de voir cette conférence enregistrer la participation de tous les Ministres du Dialogue 5+5. pic.twitter.com/X4YOVPK2KA — Abdelkader Messahel (@Messahel_MAE) January 21, 2018  Morocco’s Participation in the 5+5 Dialogue Speaking at the symposium, Bourita said that this forum, which is aimed at engaging in a calm dialogue and developing fruitful cooperation, is confronting various challenges in the areas of security, environment, socio-economic issues, culture and identity. In his remarks, Bourita added that the symposium is set to showcase its relevance as long as it provides “the right framework for lucid dialogue, sincere commitment and concerted action. For Bourita, the Western Mediterranean region can be the “catalyst for shared growth,” Maghreb Arab Press reported. In terms of youth and employment, Bourita said that the symposium can help manage the issue of the youth in its economic, social cultural and human dimensions. The Moroccan diplomat also voiced Morocco’s proposal to host a 5 + 5 Ministerial Conference devoted to the youth. This proposal is aimed that setting up a “regional agenda” for young people Bourita noted the “incredible contrast” between economic integration in the North and South of the Western Mediterranean region, noting that if Northern partners are characterized by a strong economic integration —more than 70 percent — the Southern partners form one of the least integrated regions of the world, less than 5 percent. “The gap between the two shores is, therefore, real, but the gap within the south shore itself is disappointing,” Bourita pointed out, adding that this situation requires a stronger commitment to an innovative, inclusive and sustainable approach to trade development, investment and employment. Bourita added that Morocco is involved in a dynamic process to optimize its development model under the leadership of King Mohammed VI, adding that the North African country believes that status quo and protectionism cannot help create economic development. Morocco’s Migration Policy During the event, Bourita has also underscored Morocco’s 2013 migration policy under the auspices of King Mohammed VI, one of two regularization campaigns for the situations of migrants in Morocco. Bourita said that Morocco has played a leading role in this area at the African level as the King “is the leader in charge of the migration issue within the African Union.” According to Bourita, Morocco will represent its vision for an African Agenda during the 30th AU summit, scheduled to take place January 22 to 29, 2018 in Addis Ababa. He also recalled Morocco’s fruitful migration cooperation with several countries, including Spain and France, noting that Morocco will host the first International Conference on the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in December 2018. Morocco’s Vision to Fight Against Terrorism Bourita said that Morocco’s policy against terrorism, which was adopted by King Mohammed VI, is based on an approach that included the dimensions of security, economic growth, human development and cultural preservation. Morocco has been establishing itself as a leader in the training of imams, both in Europe and Africa, Bourita said.

Rabat – The fake news phenomena is reaching new heights. After allegedly interfering with the 2016 United States presidential election, Facebook is taking new measures to fight this scourge by asking its users to identify “reliable” news sources.  After months of criticism and accusations of helping the propagation of fake news, Facebook is taking what can be considered an umpteenth measure against this 21st-century phenomenon.  According to Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, “There’s too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarization in the world today.” For the founder of Facebook, “social media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don’t specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them.” In this sense, he believes that “it’s important that [Facebook’s] News Feed promotes high quality news that helps build a sense of common ground.” For 2018, Zuckerberg’s major mission is to “make sure that news you see, while less overall, is high quality.” In a Facebook post published on his official page, the CEO said that the company’s product teams will prioritize articles and sources that are “trustworthy, informative, and local.”  The question remains how Facebook will decide what news sources meet these criteria? According to Zuckerberg, the answer to this “hard question” is in the hands of the Facebook community, which will be entrusted to “determine what sources are broadly trusted.” “We will now ask people whether they’re familiar with a news source and, if so, whether they trust that source,” explained the CEO, adding that this update will not change the amount of news published on Facebook.  “It will only shift the balance of news you see towards sources that are determined to be trusted by the community,” added Zuckerberg.  Morocco Versus Fake News  Morocco is also picking up the fight against fake news in the form of a draft law. According to a source quoted by Moroccan news outlet Telquel, “the Ministry of Culture and Communication is currently finalizing a draft law sanctioning the diffusion of fake news.” But for Zakaria Choukrallah, journalist and editor in chief of Telquel.ma, the best way to fight fake news is “not to add a new law.” “The current legislation is sufficient,” he told Morocco World News.  In fact, Morocco’s press law already sanctions the publishing of fake news. “Article 72 of the Press Code sanctions the dissemination of false news that may be detrimental to the State, the public order or the morale of the armed forces, while Articles 106 and 108 punish false news liable to harm individuals,” explains the news website.  Choukrallah believes that the best way to face this scourge is to “teach people how to identify fake news themselves and to become more critical of what they read, hear or see.” In this respect, “everyone, not just reporters, must acquire some basic [journalism] notions.” For Choukrallah, “the answer is critical thinking and analytic reflexes.”  “Ask yourself whether the source of any news is reliable before sharing it. In case of any doubt, don’t,” says the journalist. He added that readers should learn how to differentiate between news and opinions, find additional sources to cross-check, and “read people you don’t necessarily agree with.”  For Choukrallah, “the reporter’s classic bottom-up relationship with the reader is over.” Today, this relationship is “direct and immediate — everyone ought to know some notions of journalism.”

Rabat – Denmark has positioned itself as one of the first countries to support the proposal adopted by the European Commission on Monday, to negotiate a new fisheries protocol with Morocco after the current agreement expires in July. On January 15, the Danish government informed its Parliament that it will accepted the European Commission’s proposal to renegotiate the fisheries agreement with Morocco.  The decision comes as a change of heart for the Danish Executive, known for its sympathy towards the so-called separatist Polisario. Denmark, which until now supported the cause of the Polisario for humanitarian reasons like other Scandinavian countries, has drastically changed its approach to the Sahara issue. READ ALSO: EU Legal Advisor Says Fisheries Agreement with Morocco is “Invalid” In fact, a few months ago, the Danish Foreign Affairs Minister recognized the legality of imports from Western Sahara. For the Danish diplomacy, the people of the Sahara benefit directly from the resources of their region, according to an audit mission carried out by the EU commission in the southern provinces. Admittedly, Morocco can congratulate itself on the position expressed by the Danish Executive. However, when it comes to the management of the Sahara file, the position of the European Union is sometimes oxymoronic.  Except for Paris’ strong support to the autonomy plan, Morocco’s ultimate offer to put an end to a fictitious conflict lasting over 35 years, the positions of other European capitals are still unclear.  Berlin’s case is quite symptomatic of a paradigm shift in that German officials no longer hesitate to display their alignment with separatist agendas. When calling on their companies to withdraw their logs from the Saharan provinces, the German Executive justified this decision by a desire to conform to the “principles of international law.” READ ALSO: Despite Polisario’s Complaints, Negotiations on Morocco EU Fisheries Agreement to Start in Two Weeks Germany’s position on the issue comes to support the aggro carried by separatist political interests that lobby at the level of the European Parliament and whose influence is echoed even in the aisles of the European Court of Justice.  In other words, the Moroccan diplomats, who are fighting hard on the African continent, must in no way let down their guard over the European continent, which many consider as “acquired territory” and thus safe from unpleasant surprises.  However, it is in Europe that Morocco is anchored economically speaking, and Moroccan officials are frequently called upon to put out fires ignited by separatist voices. Morocco’s agricultural agreement with the EU is a good example in this, now followed by the fisheries agreement.  Even if Brussels strives to argue the merits of “good trade” negotiated with Morocco, these two agreements are already quite problematic without the interference of the Sahara issue; some European actors are quick to react against Moroccan interests at the slightest opportunity. In this sense, Morocco’s diplomats should not lower their guard, especially because the parties who support the separatist agenda have a habit of moving without warning.

Rabat – Faced with the public apprehension and alarming forecasts of international organizations regarding the devaluation of the dirham devaluation of the dirham, Moroccan authorities work toward appeasement while assuming the worst: the risk of speculation. For Abdellatif Jouahri, governor of Bank Al Maghrib, JP Morgan‘s predictions of the devaluation of the dirham are not “the word of the Christ.” During a conference held this Thursday in Rabat, Jouahri, with the minister of finance, Mohamed Boussaid, tried to debunk the speculation around the new exchange rate regime reform. On Tuesday, JP Morgan published a note from its “Emerging Markets” research, in which the United States=based bank summarizes Morocco’s new flexible exchange rate reform and delivers its forecasts. READ ALSO: JP Morgan Predicts a 7% Depreciation of the Dirham by 2019 This new release, which predicts a 7 percent devaluation of the dirham in the next 12 months, became the subject of a heated debate during Bank Al Maghrib’s press conference Thursday. “JP Morgan is not the word of the Christ,” Jouahri said when questioned on the subject. It appears the governor of Bank Al Maghrib can no longer tolerate speculation against the dirham, whether from Moroccan commercial banks or an international monetary institution. Indeed, the botched launch of the reform last April is still an open wound in the mind of the official. The speculation of Moroccan commercial banks against the dirham, advancing a possible devaluation, led to a rush on currency draining over $3 billion from Bank Al Maghrib’s foreign reserves. Although JP Morgan’s report was less negative about the impact of the reform on the Moroccan economy in the medium term, qualifying it as “limited,” the bank added that over the next 12 months, “market prices are in a gradual depreciation path of the dirham against the euro and dollar basket.” READ ALSO: Dirham Up by 0.13% Against Euro The dirham is pegged to the euro-dollar basket, at a rate of 60 and 40 percent, respectively. This remains unchanged since before the recent reform. The only change made is on the fluctuation band, which widened from 0.3 to 2.5 percent. This information was a point of discussion for Jouahri and Boussaid, who explained that this new margin is the limit of movements of the dirham, either in overvaluation or devaluation. “We respect the point of view of these institutions, but [a 7 percent devaluation] is simply impossible,” affirmed Boussaid, adding that the market has been favorable to the dirham until now. READ ALSO: Dirham Exchange Rate Reform: the Clarifications of Jouahri and Boussaid “The market trusts us, and this is visible through the results of the last three days,” Boussaid said. He added that the dirham has maintained its value since the launch of the reform on January 15. However, the assurances of Jouahri and Boussaid, based on the fact that the dirham is still pegged to the euro-dollar basket, are indeed a double-edged sword. The dirham will always be dependent on the fluctuations of the two currencies on the market, and according to JP Morgan’s analysts, these fluctuations are heading in the wrong direction. Jouahri’s anger at JP Morgan’s predictions is quite understandable, taking into account the fiasco of last April. But can these forecasts be called speculation? Maybe JP Morgan’s prediction is not “the word of the christ,” but its forecasts are still based on market movement analysis. READ ALSO: Dirham Liberalization: What Should Moroccans Expect So where does this 7 percent devaluation predicted by JP Morgan come from, knowing that Jouahri and Boussaid insist on a limit of 2.5 percent in the event of a fall for the dirham? By reviewing the fluctuations of the dirham in 2017, “we discover that it has appreciated by 7.6 percent against the dollar, and fell 5.1 percent against the euro,” says Boussaid. At that date, the dirham was still pegged to a fixed exchange rate system. Implicitly, Boussaid has two announcements. The bad news is that the dirham may devalue by more than 2.5 percent. The good news is that it will not be because of the new reform, but due to fluctuations of FX prices. However, beware of speculation. According to Jouahri and Boussaid, the two guardians of the temple, “they will be lethal.”

Rabat – Polisario may not like it, but the front’s repeated provocative actions near Guerguerat buffer zone represent a losing battle. According to Mustapha Salama, a Polisario Front dissident, the separatist group will not dare attempt to provoke a battle around Guerguerat due to “power imbalances” between Morocco and the front. Salama, who was a former police chief in the Tindouf camps, took to his Facebook page to give a brief analysis of the situation in the region after a series of provocative actions carried out by Polisario. “Morocco’s military equipment has moved toward Guerguerat. Before that, Polisario’s militias cut off Nouadhibou’s (second largest city in Mauritania) roads for hours. Polisario exercised live ammunition in the Aguenet region in the south. A constant talk of escalation, provocation and readiness to respond: Can Guerguerat be a scene of an impending war [between Morocco and the front]?” asks the activist.  Since 2011, Salama has regularly criticized Polisario’s provocative actions, describing how the front lost its influence in the conflict since the 1991 ceasefire agreement. In his recent remarks, the Polisario dissident said that the front can never dare engage in open war in the buffer zone. “In order to access Guerguerat, which is located close to the Atlantic coast, Polisario has to enter to the depth of the Moroccan forces for nearly 250 km in a narrow strip extending from the east to the west of Tichla,” a small town and rural commune in Aousserd Province of the Dakhla-Oued Ed-dahab region of Morocco. For Salama, “any military action carried out by Polisario in those areas is totally a suicide,” a truth that Polisario, Morocco and MINURSO are “fully aware of.” The activist said that the western regions of Tichla have not experienced any military engagements since the construction of the Moroccan defense belt, explaining that “if a member of the Moroccan military force crossed the defense belt, this will be a clear ceasefire violation.” He added that Morocco would not take such a step as it would endanger its strategy of diplomatic engagement in managing the four-decade-long conflict. “Morocco is the current winner of the situation,” he added. Salama concluded his analysis by explaining that, “what has happened and will happen is a review of power and messages from the parties to the conflict to gain points for the April report. In the past few months, Polisario has been conducting a series of illegal armed maneuvers in the buffer zone of Guerguerat. These operations were strongly denounced by Morocco and the United Nations, which warned Polisario against undermining peaceful negotiations to end the conflict. Edited by Mark Mahon

Rabat – Morocco once again lands on the underachievers list of Freedom House. Morocco’s freedoms score slipped two points from last year, “due to harsh state responses to major demonstrations throughout the year.”   International NGO Freedom House for Democracy released its latest Civil Liberties Index that ranks civil liberties in countries around the world. The list, which includes the Arab region and the Middle East, indicates a decline in Morocco’s ranking for 2018. Ranking Morocco as a “partially free” country, Freedom House allotted Morocco 39 points out of a total 100 in the index of freedoms, two points down from 2018. The decline in the general index is the result of Morocco’s decrease in the civil liberties survey, which, according to the report, is due to “harsh state responses to major demonstrations throughout the year”. Not surprisingly, with respect to freedom of the press, the NGO ranked Morocco as “non-free.” Freedom House added that it will issue a more detailed report on the freedoms’ status in each country at a later date. The report categorized Tunisia among the “free countries,” scoring 70 points out of 100. Overall, 2017 was not the year for freedoms. According to the NGO, “democracy faced its most serious crisis in decades in 2017.” Seventy-one countries suffered net declines in political rights and civil liberties, with only 35 registering gains. “This marked the 12th consecutive year of decline in global freedom,” according to the foundation. In the MENA region, “authoritarian rule and instability reinforce one another,” according to Freedom House. Tunisia has stood out for its successful transition to democratic rule after hosting the first Arab Spring uprising in 2011. However, 2017 was not a good year for the North African country. For the NGO, “earlier signs of backsliding became far clearer” as municipal elections were once again postponed, leaving unelected councils in place seven years after the revolution. According to the NGO, “figures associated with the old regime increased their influence over the vulnerable political system, for example by securing passage of a new amnesty law despite strong public opposition.” The extension of a two-year-old state of emergency also “signaled the erosion of democratic order in Tunisia,” concluded Freedom House.

Rabat – Spain will hire a total of 10,400 Moroccan seasonal agricultural workers, who will mainly work in strawberry, red fruit and citrus farms in the 2018 agricultural season. The Spanish government announced the news after a meeting held in Madrid on January 18 between representatives of agricultural firms and officials from the General Directorate for Migration, according to Spanish news outlet, Eco Diario. The workers will take part in the strawberry and berry campaign, which will take place in April and June 2018.  The seasonal migrant workers will head back to Morocco after the end of the campaign. Agricultural associations have made requests to the Spanish government to allow them to hire 16,000 seasonal workers, 10,000 of whom will be recruited for the first time. Preselection for the seasonal farming operation will take place from January 29 to February 2. The government said that the priority will be given to seasonal workers who have experience in this field, who are married and committed to returning to Morocco after the operation. More than 5,000 contracts were validated in favor of the Association of Strawberry Producers and Exporters in Huvila, while 3,000  was validated for the Young Farmers’ Association. Citrus growers were provided with 1,000 contracts, while 700 contracts were validated for the Freson de Palos group and the Union of Small Farmers (UPA). A report issued in 2016 by the Spanish Coordinator of Organizations of Farmers and Ranchers (COAG), showed that the Spanish agricultural sector depends on more than 200,000 migrant workers, a large number of whom come from Morocco. There are about 71,587 Moroccan workers in Spain’s agricultural sector, and 59,830 Romanians. Both groups combined account for more than half of the total workers in the sector. The Spanish countryside is home to workers from several parts of the world. Most workers migrated to Spain from Bulgaria, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Ukraine and Pakistan, along with others from sub-Saharan African countries.

Rabat – For the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Morocco is a good student when it comes to economic policies. But when it comes to social ones, the country still has a long way to go to reduce unemployment and social disparities.  In a recent report issued Friday, the IMF lauds Morocco’s launch of the new flexible exchange-rate regime, stating that it “will help further improve Morocco’s external position, enhance the economy’s capacity to absorb shocks, and preserve its external competitiveness.” The new flexible exchange-rate system came into effect Monday, January 15 after years of discussions, and was highly encouraged by the IMF since 1998. READ ALSO: Morocco Should Implement Dirham Liberalization Reform ‘Now’: IMF The Moroccan central bank continues to set the dirham price on the basis of a basket representative of the euro and the dollar, at the rate of 60 and 40 percent, respectively, but with a much greater margin of flexibility. The fluctuation band went from 0.3 to 2.5 percent in each direction.

The IMF had granted Morocco a precautionary credit line of USD 3.6 billion in July 2016, but the Moroccan authorities have so far not used it. This agreement will expire next July. For the international institution, Morocco’s “sound” macroeconomic policies and reform implementation “helped improve the resilience of the economy.” READ ALSO: Morocco Must ‘Accelerate’ its Structural Reforms: IMF In 2017, Morocco’s external imbalances narrowed and international reserves remain at a comfortable level, settling around MAD 250 billion as of January 19. Fiscal developments were also positive, with the budget deficit declining due to strong revenue performance and contained spending.  As growth rebounded in 2017, the IMF expects “to accelerate gradually over the medium term, contingent on improved external conditions and steadfast reform implementation.” The IMF however calls for “raising the potential pace” of this growth and “making it more inclusive.” For the international body, new measures to develop education, governance and market reforms will be need in order to “reduce persistently high levels of unemployment, especially among young people, increase women’s participation in the labor force and reduce regional disparities.”

The dish, deep-rooted in the Moroccan culture, also holds cultural significance and symbolizes hospitality, sharing, and collectiveness. Morocco has also another couscous variant, made with caramelized onions and raisins, called “Tfaya.”

Rabat – As January 2018 marks the 75th anniversary of the Anfa Conference in Casablanca, scholars from the United States, Morocco, and Britain were joined by the granddaughter of former US President Franklin Roosevelt for a discussion and reflection on the historic event that marked a turning point in WWII and on Morocco’s subsequent independence. Moderated by the British ambassador to Morocco, Thomas Reilly, the forum was held in Rabat’s National Library. The event, hosted by the United Kingdom and United States embassies in Morocco, brought together dozens of history zealots interested in the pivotal events of January 1943. The panelists included Allen Packwood, director of archives of former British Prime Minister Churchill, historian Meredith Hindley, author of “Destination Casablanca: Exile, Espionage, and the Battle for North Africa in Thomas Reilly,” and Moroccan historian, Hassan Ourid. Further to its international impact on the course of WWII, the 1943 conference set the grounds for relations between the United States and Morocco for many years after. On January 22, Roosevelt, hosted a banquet for Sultan Muhammad V. The American president was reportedly eager to meet the sultan, Mohammad V. “This action implicitly recognized the Sultan’s sovereignty over Morocco. The head of the French protectorate had not been invited to the dinner, further stressing the US position in terms of Morocco’s independence,” said Ourid. During the dinner, the president spoke highly of  Morocco’s natural wealth and the possibility of development, and on efforts to raise health and education levels,” says a US Embassy document from the era. The same document states that Roosevelt, who was unhappy about the French occupation of Morocco, said “the Sultan should not allow other countries to exploit Morocco’s natural resources.” The two leaders also talked of increasing US-Moroccan trade and economic cooperation, said Ourid. For his part, the Sultan told US General George Patton, commander of the I Armored Corps, that “your President is a very great man and a great friend of myself and of my people.” during a car ride that they shared. The context behind the determining event that shaped modern human history took place at the end of November 1942, when President Roosevelt proposed to Churchill a meeting between the Allied leaders to discuss their next move in fighting the war. “Churchill suggested that they meet in Iceland in January. Roosevelt, in turn, said he preferred a secure place south of Algiers or in or near Khartoum, as he doesn’t like mosquitoes,” recalled Hindley. The ideal place for the conference proved to be Casablanca, as both the United States and Britain already had troops in North Africa thanks to the success of Operation Torch in late 1942. Location was important, and Morocco was one of the most important places in the world then, said Hindley. “Churchill had in fact been to Morocco, Marrakech  in the winter on 1936. He wrote that ‘Marrakesh is simply the nicest place on Earth to spend an afternoon’,” said Packwood. From January 14 to 24, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Anglo-American officials met in Casablanca, along with Henri Giraud and Charles de Gaulle, leaders of opposing French resistance groups. Stalin, preoccupied by battles in Eastern Europe, declined to join, said Hindley. On the last day of the conference, the press was invited to cover the historic Allied declaration to win the war and their unwavering determination to defeat Nazi Germany. Upon their arrival, the journalists were in shock to see Roosevelt and Churchill together. “Despite what the world had thought, my Grandfather and Churchill were good friends. They had so many traits in common. They both enjoyed drinking and were fond of Morocco,” said Roosevelt’s granddaughter. “Upon the end of the conference, Churchill sent a letter to my Grandfather, telling him that “he is happy to exist in the same decade as him,” she said. Nevertheless, the press received news that surprised them more than seeing Roosevelt and Churchill in the same place. During the press conference, Roosevelt intuitively said that the Allies would only accept the “unconditional surrender,” of Germany, Italy and Japan to end the war. “Against what’s commonly known that other later conferences were the driving forces to win WWII, the Anfa Conference is in fact the most important one,” said Packwood, explaining that “Britain, the US and France had wanted to implement different tactics to win the war, but if weren’t for Casablanca’s conference, they would have never came together to set a common goal.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has received on Saturday a letter from US President Donald Trump. In the letter, Trump responded to the message that he received from the King regarding the “US Administration decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.” In his letter, Trump voiced “his gratitude for the leadership of King at the League of the Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Trump has also affirmed that he also shares “the importance of the city of Jerusalem for the followers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.” “Jerusalem is and must remain a place where Jews pray at the Western Wall, where Christians walk the Stations of the Cross and where Muslims worship at Al-Aqsa Mosque,” said Trump. Trump has also expressed his determination to “reach a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.” For the peace process, Trump has also reaffirmed his support for “ a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides.” The US President added that the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem are part of final status negotiations.” Trump’s letter, which was reported by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), said that the US does not take a position on boundaries or borders. On December 5, 2017, a day before Trump’s announcement, King Mohammed VI sent a message to Trump expressing his “deep concern” over his willingness to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. In his message, the King wrote that the decision has drawn his “deep personal concern and the great concern of the Arab and Muslim States and peoples.” “The city of Al-Quds must remain a land of cohabitation and a symbol of coexistence and tolerance for all,” said King Mohammed VI. “The city is not only important for the parties of the conflict, but also for believers in the three Abrahamic religions, due to its unique religious characteristics, its ancient identity, and its great political symbolism.” “The city of Al-Quds must remain a land of cohabitation and a symbol of coexistence and tolerance for all,” said King Mohammed VI. “The city is not only important for the parties of the conflict, but also for believers in the three Abrahamic religions, due to its unique religious characteristics, its ancient identity, and its great political symbolism.”

Rabat – 2016 and 2017 marked rollercoaster years in Morocco after several social controversies erupted in the country, including events in Al Hoceima, the Essaouira food stampede, and Jerada’s tragedy. Despite these crises, Driss El Yazami, Chairman of the National Human Rights Council (CNDH) believes that Morocco has made significant progress in terms of human and civil rights. During a conference-debate organized by the Moroccan Embassy in Brussels last, El Yazami examined the evolution of Moroccan human and civil rights following  the 2011 constitutional reforms,  During the symposium, titled “Constitution and Human Rights: Where Are We Morocco?” El Yazami described accomplishments of the 2011 constitution as a “manifesto of fundamental rights and freedoms.”. For El Yazami, the evolution of human rights in Morocco is a process that saw a turning point in the 90s with the government changeover and corresponding emphasis placed on human rights and women. The president of CNDH added that the transitional justice exemplified by the Equity and Reconciliation Commission, strengthened this process. “These steps made it possible for Morocco to turn the page on past violations,” said El Yazami. Several media outlets and international organizations, including the US-based NGO, Human Rights Watch, have issued reports that question human rights in North African countries, especially in light of the lAl  Hoceima demonstrations. Moroccan officials and the CNDH have denounced these human and civil rights allegations  El Yazami pointed to family code reforms and the recognition of Amazigh as an official language as constitutional indicators of the nation’s progress in gender equality and cultural and linguistic plurality. El Yazami also reaffirmed the CNDH’s commitment as an independent public institution to support the evolution of universal rights and their consecration in Morocco. “Our role is to underscore what is not working and make recommendations to make it work,” stated El Yazami. Morocco’s Ambassador in Belgium, Mohammed Ameur, explained that this meeting is part of an embassy conference series dedicated to sharing Morocco’s past achievements and future vision with international officials. Journalist and novelist Nadia Dala chaired the conference, which was also attended by Belgian politicians and officials, as well as the Moroccan Ambassador to the EU, Ahmed Reda Chami.

Rabat – Sunil Gulati, President of US Soccer Federation has expressed concerns over the US 2026 World Cup bid. For Gulati, international political issues surrounding US President Donald Trump may affect the three-nation North American bid. Gulati described the bid as a “tough battle” for the three countries, according to to the US-based sports TV channel, ESPN . The United States is involved in a joint bid with Mexico and Canada to claim eligibility to host the 2026 World Cup. The three-nation North American bid has one rival: Morocco. The federation president is certain that the US-Canada-Mexico bid has all that it needs to make the voters support their bid. “We have to go out and convince what eventually will be 104 voters to vote for us,” Gulati said. He added that the North American three-nation bid seeks a “few extra votes to break the one-vote swing. But this won’t be easy.” Speaking about his concerns, Gulati mentioned recent US political controversies, such as the American embassy relocation to Jerusalem and Trump’s withdrawal from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.as potential roadblocks to the bid. “This is not only about our stadiums and our hotels and all that. It’s about perceptions of America and it’s a difficult time in the world,” Gulati said. He added that there are few things that is beyond his control. “We can’t control what happens at the 38th parallel in Korea, we can’t control what happens with embassies in Tel Aviv and we can’t control what happens with climate change accords. We do the best we can. We have the support of Washington.” Gulati will retire his presidency of the US Soccer Federation next month, after having served as its chairman for 12 years. Howeve, Gulati will remain the chairman of the committee board of directors for the three-nation bid. In December, Gulati said that the North American bidders are expecting Morocco to “campaign hard” in order to host the 2026 World Cup. “We expect Morocco to put forward a very good bid […], we expect them to campaign hard,” he said. Earlier this month, President of Morocco’s Football Federation Fouzi Lekjaa said that Morocco is ready to face the North American bid to host the 2026 World Cup. The bid will be based on a vote by all members of the FIFA. Lekjaa added that this could be in Morocco’s favor, “unlike previous times when only the Executive Committee had the last word on the matter.” Lekjaa said that 104 votes for Morocco would be enough for the country to host the 2026 world tournament.  In June 2018, 221 national federations will gather at a congress in Moscow to finalize eligibility decisions for the 23rd FIFA World Cup host site. The candidates’ files should meet FIFA’s technical terms, including infrastructural and commercial criteria. Candidates will have to submit their complete candidacy files and proposals by March 16. Morocco submitted its candidacy to host the tournament on August 11, 2017.  Ahmad Ahmad, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) president, highly endorsed his nation’s bid

Rabat – 2018 might be the comeback year of MENA’s economy, according to BMI Research, which predicts a recovery of the region’s GDP growth. For the firm, Morocco, “a long-term growth outperformer,” is evolving into a manufacturing and exporting hub between Europe and Africa.  In its latest economic analysis report, BMI, a research firm that provides macroeconomic, industry and financial market analysis, delivers its economic outlook for the MENA in 2018.  According to the firm, the recovery of oil prices, as well as stabilising output in oil-exporting economies will boost real GDP growth in the MENA region, while “the positive impact of structural reforms will boost growth in several major oil importers.” READ ALSO: Morocco to Surpass Egypt as North Africa’s Largest Automotive Market However, BMI is still apprehensive of the political unrest in the region, stating that it “risks weighting on investor sentiment,” limiting the acceleration of growth. “Oil exporters will benefit from robust gains in prices,” reveals BMI, due to the favorable forecasts of Brent oil prices, expected to increase from USD 54.8 per barrel in 2017, to USD 65.0 per barrel in 2018, explains the firm. READ ALSO: Morocco Will Continue to Increase Public Investment and Decrease Deficit As for oil-importing countries, the firm believes that “progress on structural reforms and overall improving political stability will drive economic activity.” BMI hols a “more favourable outlook” for economies with reform-minded governments, “such as Egypt and Morocco.”  While the firm forecast real GDP growth to slow to 3.8 percent in Morocco in 2018, down from 4.3 percent in 2017, “the economy will remain one of our long-term growth outperformers, a view which is underpinned by relative political stability and a favourable business environment, enabling the country’s transformation towards a manufacturing and exporting hub between Europe and Africa.” Despite this optimistic outlook for the region overall, BMI “do not expect a dramatic acceleration in economic activity.” The firm forecasts real GDP growth of 3 percent for the MENA region in 2018, up from an estimated 2.6 percent in 2017.  For BMI, lower oil prices will continue to weigh on the pace of growth in oil-exporting economies, especially as diversification plans take time to yield results. READ ALSO: From Oil Crisis to Rampant Inflation: How Poor Management Led Algeria to Near Bankruptcy In this sense, BMI presents Algeria as an example, stating that “gains in oil prices won’t be sufficient to result in accelerating GDP growth.” According to the firm, “the Algerian government was slow to react to the slump in oil prices since 2014, which resulted in surging budget deficits in recent years.” “This has forced the government to ramp up fiscal consolidation measures in the second half of 2017, and we believe that it will continue to take a toll on consumer spending in 2018.” On the oil side, BMI believes that Algeria has limited capacity to increase production given maturing fields and insufficient investment in exploration; therefore reducing incentives to reduce compliance with the OPEC-stipulated cuts. “As such, we forecast growth to slow in 2018,” concludes the report.

Rabat – The Minister Delegate in Charge of Water is looking to develop projects in Morocco’s southern provinces. On Tuesday, Charafat Afilal said that the water administration is firmly committed to pursuing the realization of diverse projects intended to mobilize water resources in the Sakia-El Hamra-Oued Eddahab area. The official voiced her announcement during her visit to Laayoun on Tuesday, January 16. The Minster Delegate checked on development projects launched by King Mohammed VI on the sidelines of the 40 anniversary of the Green March. The structural projects seek to accompany the flow of the rapid development in the southern provinces. “In light of the growth that the region will experience over the next few years, due to the high level of interest King Mohammed VI has in the Saharan provinces, the State Secretariat for Water, as part of its commitment to support the colossal development efforts of the region, will continue the realization of various development projects related to increasing the supply of typical water sources, as well as the use of seawater and the treatment and reuse of wastewater, said Afilal. 
The official chairs the board meeting of the Sakia-El Hamra-Oued Eddahab Watershed Agency, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Charafat said that the State Secretariat will soon launch the construction of four hill dams in the provinces of Laayoune, Smara, and Tarfaya with a total capacity of 1.7 million cubic meters. The official said that these dams are the Lamhajib, Sidi Ahmed Rguibi, Kssat and Labouira dams, in addition to the Foum El Oued artificial water supply project. Charafat added that these important hydro projects will mobilize additional resources to ensure that drinking water and livestock watering requirements, as well as groundwater replenishment are all kept to high standards. The Minister Delegate is also launching precautionary measures to protect the southern provinces from flooding. The water department, in collaboration with the Water Basin Agency and all the relative departments, are pursuing the implementation of these protection projects against flooding.  Charafat also said that construction will begin soon to rebuild the Sakia El Hama dam, which was affected by flooding caused by heavy rainfall experienced by the region in late 2016. These projects, according to Charafat, are in addition to other projects dedicated to the region, including seawater desalination plants to supply the cities of Laayoune and Tarfaya with drinking water.

Rabat – Aziz Rabbah, the Minister of Energy, Mines and Sustainable Development, said during an interview with the Spanish news agency EFE, that the Moroccan government has opened an investigation after it was reported that a 165-million-year-old Moroccan dinosaur tail fossil was auctioned off to a wealthy businessman on Tuesday, January 16 in Mexico. Rabbah said that a specialized committee of the Ministry of Energy, Minerals and Sustainable Development and the Ministry of Culture has been set up to investigate the origin of the fossil as well as the circumstances which brought it to Mexico. The Mexican businessman, who asked not to be named, purchased the fossil for his collection for an undisclosed sum. However, according to the auction’s organizer, Morton’s Auction House, the 180-kilogram and 4-meter long tail was sold at a reserve price of $95,805 (approximately MAD 887,000). Morton’s added that any amount above the reserve price would have been donated to the BBVA Bancomer Foundation to help fund the reconstruction of some 5,000 damaged schools, destroyed or damaged after the powerful earthquake that hit Mexico on September 19. Reuters revealed that the fossil remains are from a Sauropode, a 17-meters long 22-ton herbivore. The long-tailed dinosaur — of the species Atlasaurus — once roamed the Atlas Mountains in Morocco 165 million years ago. The report also points out that Moroccan paleontologists took 300 hours to clean the gigantic remains of the reptile before Utah scientists reassembled them. The auction of this rare fossil raises questions, once again, about Morocco’s ability to protect its geological heritage, which is still vulnerable to many trafficking and smuggling efforts within and outside of Morocco. According to the Spanish news outlet, La Republica, last year the auction house at the Drouot Hotel in Paris put for sale the skeleton of a marine dinosaur originally discovered in Morocco after it was illegally transported out of Morocco in 2011. This comes in addition to the auction of some fossils and rare antiquities on the Internet. Last year, an Irish jeweler named George Cornell posted on Facebook photos of fossil remains from a 100-million-year-old Spinosaurus, including a small piece of the dinosaur’s jaw. The remains had been discovered in the region of Comcom in the south of Morocco.

Rabat – To solve the debate on inheritance in Morocco, historian and intellectual, Abdallah Laroui believes that establishing wills should be mandatory. He made the comments during a speech at the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at Mohammed V University in Rabat on 19 January. The question of inheritance in Morocco is a socio-economic problem that could be approached “from the point of view of utility and interest,” he said, as quoted by Telquel. For him, the question on gender equality in inheritance could be solved by requiring all Moroccans to write their own individual will. “The inheritance can take the form of a declaration by citizens, as part of their properties subjected to taxes,” says Laroui. Arbaoui indicates that inheritance cannot be discussed from a religious perspective. “The state must address this issue from an objective point of view,” said the Moroccan philosopher. However, an overwhelming majority of Moroccans — eighty-seven percent — oppose gender equality when it comes to inheritance, according to the results of a national survey by the High Commission for Planning. In 2015, the Moroccan Council of Human Rights (CNDH) called on the government to establish equality between men and women in inheritance in accordance with the 2011 constitution. The current majority party in parliament, Party of Justice and Development (PJD), responded to the issue stating its unequivocal rejection of any debate regarding equality of men and women in inheritance.

Rabat – Head of government Saad Eddine El Othmani chaired, on Friday in Rabat, the installation ceremony of the National Commission for Public Procurement (CNCP), an autonomous body of a technical nature. The mission of this Commission will be to oversee public procurement, control public spending and guarantee the principles of transparency and parity in the development and execution of contracts between competitors, while improving the handling of complaints. The importance of CNCP is linked to public procurement’s remarkable development, driven by the record volume of public investments of the state, local authorities and public companies and institutions that has increased from 160 billion dirhams in 2011 to 195 billion dirhams in 2018, equivalent to 17.4% of GDP. While serving as an instrument of moralization of public life, this mechanism is also a tool for consolidating confidence and credibility with economic operators, domestic and foreign investors, by offering them real guarantees to protect the companies from all types of excesses or injustice. The CNCP is considered as a voluntarist and independent instrument in its missions of prevention, supervision, intervention and consultation to raise the level of competitiveness and quality in the field of public procurement.

Rabat – After Riyadh lifted the ban on women’s driving four months ago, Saber Jelassi, the president of the National Commission for Driving School (ONECT) announced on Tuesday that Tunisian female instructors are being sought after in Saudi Arabia to teach local women to drive. In a statement to the Tunisian radio Mosaique FM, Jelassi cautioned Saudis against certain companies and individuals that could offer suspicious and fraudulent contracts. Saudi woman will still have to wait six months before they will legally be able to climb behind the wheel, as the measure will only come into effect in June 2018. The ban, which has been in place for decades, had become the source of much national and international controversy. Saudi women have protested it for years and many had taken to the streets and even been imprisoned for defying what they call a sexist policy. The Royal Decree was issued in September 2017 lifting the ban on women’s driving in the Saudi kingdom. Three months later, it was confirmed that women will be able to drive motorbikes, vans, and trucks eventually. The move is part Vision 2030, a vast reform program masterminded by the Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. Vision 2030 is advancing sweeping social and economic reforms which are generally welcomed both at home and abroad. However, the Crown Prince’s actions have also been met with derision in some ultra-conservative circles. The lifting of the ban, like all the reforms being made by the Crown Prince, has not been met with universal support in KSA. Sheikh Saad Al Hijiri sparked outrage when he said that women should not be allowed to drive because their brains were smaller than men’s.

Rabat – Spanish rescuers discovered seven bodies on Monday near Spain’s Canary Islands, 130 kilometers from Morocco. Five bodies were discovered in an inflatable raft while two others were found in open water near Bastian beach on the island Lanzarote. According to Reuters, three of the victims were “probably minors.” However, 20 men were successfully rescued after managing to swim to the coast, where they were treated for hypothermia. The exact circumstances of the deaths are not known, although the police cited drowning or hypothermia as likely causes of death. According to the Iberian newspaper La Vangardia, all the occupants of the boat were North African.

This is far from an isolated event. Just two week ago, 154 sub-Saharan migrants were rescued off the Andalusian coast. Bad weather currently battering Morocco has not deterred migrants who have continued — and will continue — to set sail.

Rabat – Rising insecurities about the economic outlook for 2018 have eroded the confidence of Moroccan households, according to the High Commission for Planning (HCP) in a report published January 18.  The annual index survey on household confidence shows that 24 percent of households are pessimistic about their living standards over the next twelve months. 40 percent anticipate that their financial conditions will remain the same, while nearly 36 percent are optimistic about the coming year. In terms of employment status and opportunities, household confidence is alarmingly low.

While 30 percent against 11 percent of households expect an improvement in their financial situation over the next year, only 28 percent of households believe that they can save money after paying necessary living costs. Over the next twelve months, 80 percent of Moroccans think that food prices are going to continue to rise; just 5 percent believe that prices will fall. A Look Back to 2017 A year ago, 35.4 percent of households reported a decline in their standard of living, 33.0 percent maintained the same level and 31.6 percent said that their situation had improved. At the conclusion of 2017, nearly 30 percent of households reported being in debt or having to use savings to cover their expenses. Only 5.4 percent of Moroccans said that they could save portions of their income, while the overwhelming majority, 64.8 percent, said that they could barely make ends meet last year. As to food prices, nearly 89 percent of households reported spending more in the last twelve months. Only 4 percent felt that prices had decreased. In 2017, Moroccan households indicated a perceived improvement in the quality of administrative services (61.6 percent) against 16.6 percent who believe that quality has diminished further. Additionally, 51 percent of households believe that the human rights situation in Morocco has improved while nearly 15 percent believe that it has worsened. The HCP survey also indicated that 22.5 percent of households believed there was an improvement in the quality of public education services, while 45.4 percent thought that they had deteriorated. As to public health services, fewer than 14 percent of households believe that health benefits and services have improved; 59 percent say they have deteriorated.

Rabat – Abdelhamid Addou, CEO and chairman of Morocco’s state-owned flag carrier, Royal Air Maroc (RAM), said that the company is pledging a new impetus to expand its fleets within two years.   Addou explained that the company has finalized its strategy in collaboration with relevant ministries and airport authorities, according to the Moroccan business news outlet L’Economiste.  The strategy, according to RAM’s chief, will be officially unveiled after slight modifications. Addou explained that the new growth plan is “a development strategy to give a new impetus to the company.” For Addou, an expanded fleet is one of the pillars that would allow RAM “to have several additional aircraft“ to address RAM’s long-haul capabilities along with improving and “enriching the customer service experience.”  To expand its fleet, RAM recently ordered eight aircraft, including four Boeing 787 Dreamliners. The company will receive its Dreamliner aircraft by March 2019. The other four aircraft on order are the 737 Max. The latest generation of the popular 737 aircraft will be received by June 2019.  RAM wants also to “substantially increase the size of the company.” By doubling its fleet and passenger capacity in coming years, it intends to become “a leading airline with the Casablanca hub as the continent’s first gateway.”  To accomplish needed business and regulatory reforms, the company needs to bring “policy levers into play” to support its financial needs, according to RAM’s chairman. He added that this strategy could potentially include an increase in capital investment by the state. Addou believes that “the [current] indebtedness will not affect the company’s financing capacity.”  Addou emphasized that RAM’s financial aggregates are generally positive. “Between the end of 2015 and the end of 2017, RAM earned more than MAD 2.5 billion in revenues.”  “We went from MAD 13 to MAD 15.5 billion of turnover at the end of 2017, he said.“ RAM gained 3 points in filling factor from a 68 percent passenger load rate to 71 percent.  For Addou, Royal Air Maroc is the leading regional flag carrier, owing to the opening of a number of new service routes (Washington, Montreal, Rio, Sao Paulo, Naples, Manchester, Oporto), as well as the revision of programs by reducing stopover times and waiting times at the airlines hub, Casablanca’s Mohammad V International Airport (CMN).  To improve RAM’s customer service experience, the company plans to be the sole carrier utilizing CMN’s Terminal 1 in the coming years, pending approval.

Rabat – The Swiss Global Influence Research Center has recently published the list of the 112 most influential figures in the Arabic-speaking world, six of whom are Moroccan. “Although Islam continues to play a prominent role in Arab debates, public intellectuals can exert influence far beyond theological discourses. This is shown by this year’s ranking of Thought Leaders in the Arab world,” the report points out. The first Moroccan on the list is Sheikh Saïd Al Kamali (48th), a Moroccan scholar specialized in Islamic history, hadiths, and fiqh. He is followed by the philosopher Taha Abderrahmane (66th), whose works have focused on logic, the philosophy of language, and the philosophy of morality. He is considered one of the leading intellectuals and thinkers in the Arab-Islamic world. The list also includes André Azoulay (71st), senior advisor to King Mohammed VI, as is the Youtubeur and news technologies enthusiast, Amine Raghib (74th). The Toplist Arabic 2018 also includes the politician affiliated with the Justice and Development Party (PJD), Abu Zaid Al Idrissi (93th), and finally, the leader of Hirak Rif, Nasser Zefzafi (107th) who is also a potential candidate for the Sakharov Prize of 2018, granted by the European Parliament for Freedom of Thought. Global Influence defines a thought leader as a “living person who works primarily as a thinker, and is known and influential beyond the borders of their discipline.” “Anyone who affects people’s thoughts must leave traces in their communications. And for those communications that are publicly available, it’s possible to measure how central certain people are,” the Swiss center explains. To identify the world’s most influential people, the center chose a method that consists of Coolhunting software supplied by the technology company, Galaxyadvisors. “This software not only measures whoever ‘shouts the loudest’ (i.e. has the most likes or followers), but can also calculate the strength of the relationships between the relevant people. The so-called betweenness centrality measures the control a node has over the flows of a network,” Global Influence said.

Rabat – The Moroccan Agency for Nuclear and Radiological Safety and Security (AMSSNUR) and the Spanish Nuclear Safety Council (CSN) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on nuclear power on Monday in the Moroccan capital. Through this agreement, the two regulatory authorities will exchange information on issues related to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Morocco and Spain are seeking to share experiences and lessons learned from nuclear accidents; improve safety and security; and ensure communication in case of a nuclear or radiological crisis, says a statement from the AMSSNUR.

By Mohamed Amine Rhaz Rabat – An Italian judge ejected a Moroccan trainee lawyer from the courtroom for wearing a hijab on Wednesday. The Moroccan trainee lawyer, Asmae Belfakir, was visiting the regional Administrative Court of Emilia-Romagna (TAR), based in Bologna, to attend a session in the court, reported Italian news outlet,  Italian insider. The 25-year-old was asked by the judge either to remove the veil or leave the courtroom. Belfakir, the legal representative of Bologna’s Islamic community, chose the latter. “I am upset… It has never happened to me. I have assisted at tens of hearings, even here at the TAR and nobody has ever asked me to take off the veil,” said Belfkir.   The Judge, Giancarlo Mozzarelli, said that he acted “with respect to our culture and our traditions.” Belfakir highlighted this  point afterwards: “he spoke of culture, not even of the law.” She recalled that she had attended a hearing with the same judge on December 5, 2017 “and he didn’t say anything to me.” The Organization of Young Italian Lawyers opposed the judge’s action, saying that it is against constitutional principles and expressed solidarity with Belfkir. Yassine Lafram, the Muslim community coordinator of Bologna, noted that there are no laws prohibiting the headscarf in courtrooms, adding that the judge adopted an “arbitrary position.” The judge in the case declined to comment. Belkafir, the trainee who was ejected, has a degree in law from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, with a thesis on women’s bodies and Islamic law. She was chosen as a trainee by the legal office of the Emilian University.

Rabat – Only few months after Algeria’s Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel accused Morocco of “laundering drug money via its banks in the continent,” the head of the Algerian government went once again into a similar rant against Morocco.  Speaking at the ordinary session of the National Democratic Rally (RND) on Thursday, Algeria’s Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia accused Morocco, without naming it, of “drowning Algeria with hashish and cocaine.” “It is an attack against the Algerian people and an attempt to poison the Algerian youth as well as Algeria’s development (…) and it is an ingratitude for the future of Maghrebins,” Ouyahia said. On October 20, Messahel accused Morocco of “laundering drug money in Sub-Saharan Africa,” during a discussion hosted by the Forum of Algerian Business Leaders (FCE). The Algerian official claimed that Morocco had been “laundering cannabis money” through banks in the continent, adding that Moroccan banks are being used in laundering the revenues from the sale of hashish. “Everybody knows that,” he said. The head of Algerian diplomacy added that he was told this information by “African heads of state.” The Algerian top diplomat also accused Morocco’s state-owned airline, Royal Air Maroc (RAM), of “carrying something other than passengers,” referring to cannabis. His slur immediatly backfired, when the Moroccan company announced in early December that it would sue him for “defamation” in the Paris District Court. Messahel’s claims prompted also a strong backlash from Moroccan authorities and La Confédération Générale des Entreprises du Maroc (CGEM), Morocco’s business union. After being asked about his National Democratic Party’s stance on Messahel’s allegations, the prime ministers stated that they are “an Algerian political party.” “If our neighbors are angry, well that’s too bad for them, and all the better for us,” said Ouyahia on October 25, during an interview with a state-owned radio station. He also added that he is “100 percent behind the government in everything related to Algeria‘s foreign relations.”

This Thursday after-noon, Governor of Bank Al Maghrib Abdellatif Jouahri, and Minister of Finance Mohamed Boussaid gathered the local press to talk at length on the impact of the new flexible exchange rate reform. A new episode in the Dirham Liberalization chronicles, or as both Boussaid and Jouahri stressed on correcting, the Dirham “Flexibilization” reform. During the press conference held today January 18 in the headquarters of Bank Al Maghrib, the two officials’ first focus was to set terminologies right. “How can you expect people not to freak out when all they’ve been hearing about on the media is the liberalization of the Dirham?” said Jouahri, reprimanding the conference room full of journalists. “I’ve even been receiving trolling messages on my phone, with random people sending me pictures of drowning Dirhams!” added the Governor, before explaining more seriously that the reform “is not that of a floating exchange rate regime, but a flexibility under the fixed rate regime.” For Jouahri and Boussaid alike, the need to stress one more time that this reform was “sovereign and voluntary,” was essential. “The International Monetary Fund was pushing towards this reform since 1998, and the World Bank since the 1990s,” explained Jouahri. “We’re doing it now because we want to, and we’re ready to,” he said, adding that Morocco sustains all the adequate criteria to go forward with this reform, namely sufficient foreign reserves, low inflation rates and a favorable economic climate, without risking any impact on its economy. “We understand that people have been apprehensive of this reform, but as you’ve all seen, nothing has changed during the last three days,” said Boussaid. The minister explained that since January 15, the date of the launch of the reform and the widening of the fluctuation bands from 0.3 percent to 2.5 percent, the Dirham managed to sustain its prices against the dollar and the euro, with no noticeable devaluation. “What most people don’t know, is that back in 2017, when the dirham was still in its fixed exchange-rate regime, it appreciated by 7.6 percent against the dollar and fell by 5.1 percent against the euro,” added Jouahri. Both officials explained that a more flexible regime does not necessarily mean a devaluation of the dirham, and even in the case of a devaluation, then it wouldn’t necessarily be linked to the reform. “Sometimes, it’s just the market!” said Boussaid. Post- or pre-reform, the dirham will still be linked to the dollar and euro basket at a 40 and 60 percent rate respectively. What changed, is instead of moving 0.3 percent upward or downward, the dirham will be sliding 2.5 percent in both directions. As to how would a devaluation of the dirham concretely impact Morocco’s economy, both officials had the numbers ready. “We expect the reform to result in an additional 0.2 percent in economic growth, and a 0.4 percent in inflation as a worst case scenario.” For purchasing power, Jouahri said that hydrocarbons prices may increase by 1.6 percent, meaning an additional MAD 0.15, depending on dollar and oil prices. This figure is largely less than the one announced by social media, which predicted a 50 percent rise in consumer goods prices. “That is just impossible,” settled Jouahri. “The band is limited at 2.5 percent, which is the maximum rate the Dirham can fall to at this point.”

Rabat – About 30 gay and lesbian Moroccan students have recently applied for gender-based asylum in Spain, joining the ranks of numerous asylum applicants held in the centers enduring “inhuman conditions.” The 30 men and women were placed in reception centers for undocumented immigrants in Melilla, pending the status of their asylum procedures in Spain,  reports Assabah Daily in its January 18 edition. Spanish authorities in Melilla said they have been receiving increasing numbers of asylum applications related to sexual orientation after a high-profile case in 2013 when a gay Moroccan man publicly announced that he is seeking asylum in Spain. However, migrants arriving in the Spanish overseas territories of Melilla and Ceuta seeking gender-based asylum “are exposed to harassment and abuse,” according to Human Rights Watch. “LGBT asylum seekers who fled homophobic harassment and intimidation at home face similar abuse in Ceuta, both at the immigration center and on the street,” said Judith Sunderland, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. During a visit to Ceuta in mid 2017, Human Rights Watch spoke with three gay men, two from Morocco and one from Algeria, kept at the immigration center pending the approval of their asylum applications. They said that they fled their home countries due to “extreme abuse, physical violence by family members, [and] repeated and widespread societal rejection.” Ahmed, a 29-year-old Moroccan, told Human Rights Watch that he fled Morocco only to experience the same kind of discrimination at the hands of other people staying in the migration center. “They tell me if they see me outside [the center] they’ll beat me,” he said. “They come after me, and I run. One time, in November or December, they hit me.” Another person explained, “I came to Ceuta. I didn’t have any other choice but to ask for asylum. But here it’s terrible. I am desperate. Ceuta is just like Morocco. One time I was at the beach, and a man who was a little older than me offered me a joint. I said no. He wanted to have sex, but I said no, and he threw a rock at me and hit me. I went to the police. At first, they didn’t want to take my complaint. They didn’t do anything.”

Rabat – After firmly holding their grounds regarding their decision to keep their youngster, Wydad is now about to give in to the insistence of Al Hilal, a Saudi football club. Al Hilal made its interest known at first with a 3 million dollars offer. But that first bid was categorically turned down by the Casablanca giant. The Saudi side has however come back with a much more appealing bid. They are now proposing 5 millions to land Bencherki in Al Hilal. This, considering the football market in the region, is an offer very hard to sniff at. And with the player himself willing to move to Al Hilal, the situation no longer allows Wydad much room for maneuver. Achraf Bencherki is currently part of the Moroccan squad competing in the CHAN (African Nations Championship). And should this transfer come to fruition, he might not be playing for Morocco in the next stages of the tournament. According to the CAF regulations, only players in their countries’ national leagues are eligible for the CHAN. In Morocco’s match against Guinea yesterday, Bencherki played just 15 minutes. According to some pundits, Coach Jemal Sallami’s decision to sideline Achraf Bencherki may well be because he is cautious about building a tactical system around a player whose future with the squad is uncertain.

By Amaan Afzal Rabat – David and Louise Turpin, parents of 13 children were detained and are being held on a $9 million bail each, after several of their children were discovered shackled to their beds under lock and chain in dark and rancid conditions, in their Riverside County Home in California. They were found after their 17-year-old daughter managed to escape her parents’ captivity and contact the police, who later reported that they initially perceived her as a ten-year-old, a symptom of the suffering she endured. The thirteen children were between the ages of 2 and 29, however police reported that the captives were so emaciated due to malnourishment and dehydration that they did not realize that seven were adults. The parents now face charges including ten counts of child endangerment and nine counts of torture for tormenting and starving their incarcerated sons and daughters. The Turpin children were eventually transported to two different hospitals for examinations and ensuing treatment. The Riverside County and Perris Police Departments described the scene as “shocking”, a sentiment shared by the couples’ neighbours. One of whom, Andrea Valdez, said “And when I hear that I get teary eyed… it’s just so sad… A lot of people have kids just to treat them like that.” This seems to be a precise representation of Louise Turpin who seemingly displayed no remorse when being questioned by law enforcement. One neighbour reported that the mother smirked while being interrogated on what was going on behind closed doors and even spat twice on the floor. Many of the neighbours were stunned at the discovery, one was not even aware that there were kids in the California home, let alone 13 of them. However, others reported signs that they were indeed allowed to leave the house over the last few years, including released photos showing the family on multiple trips, including one to Disneyland. Neighbour Julio Reyes claimed to have seen some of the teenage kids putting up decorations for Christmas: “Never really thought anything of any sort would happen like that.” Conversely some of the Turpin’s neighbours recall a different view of the family. Robert Perkins stated that the family were constructing a nativity scene in their driveway a few years prior that he complimented: “They didn’t say a word.” Kimberly Milligan claims to have seen the children “only a few times” in the two and a half years that she lived across from them. She went on to describe a peculiar run-in with their older children, saying that they were mentally, socially and emotionally “not in their 20’s” which suggests deep-rooted psychological abuse. David and Louise Turpin were characterised as “deeply religious” by the husband’s parents (who claimed they were shocked by the news) and believed that God called on them to have so many children. The couple said they were educated through strict home-schooling which involved memorising lengthy passages from the bible. This method of education seems to have been passed on to David who was listed as the principal of Sandcastle Day School run in their house, with the 6 youngest children enrolled this year. They faced financial difficulty, filing for bankruptcy twice, the first time coming in 2011 despite David’s six figure salary that year. With regards to their marriage, from the outside they seemed like a happy couple, having renewed their vows three times, however, if this gruesome case has taught us anything, it is that things are not always as they seem from the outside.

Rabat – The voice of Palestinian resistance in the occupied West Bank, Ahed Tamimi, and her mother will remain in custody until trial, ruled an Israeli court today. Tamimi, 16, was arrested after a video posted by the Israeli police, showing her defying Israeli soldiers. Both she and her cousin appeared kicking and pushing two armed soldiers from her family’s front yard. In early January, Tamimi received 12 charges, including “assault” and “incitement.” She now faces months in custody before the judge pronounces her sentence. “The gravity of the offences of which she is accused does not allow an alternative to custody,” her judge said. Tamimi’s next hearing is scheduled for January 31, the day of her 17th birthday. “The court said that because she is so dangerous there is no possibility of bail,” her lawyer, Gaby Lasky reportedly told the Guardian. Israel remains the only country in the world that prosecutes children in military courts, the Defense for Children International – Palestine (DCIP) rights group told Al Jazeera. Human rights organizations and the European Union have condemned the arrest of teenager. A day after her arrest, Ahed’s mother, Nariman, was also arrested when she went to visit her daughter at an Israeli police station and requested to be present during the her daughter’s interrogation. Nariman is also charged with “assault” and “incitement” for uploading the video to social media. The Tamimi family started documenting the Israeli occupation in 2009. Ahed Tamimi has shown more strength and resistance than all Arab leaders combined #???_??????? pic.twitter.com/EMhasOAPmn — Fatima (@fatimalmahmoud) December 19, 2017  A skinnier, younger Ahed first attracted global attention in a viral video in 2012, when she was featured shaking her fist at an Israeli soldier, demanding to know why her brother was detained. Since then, she appeared several times on camera, bravely defying Israeli occupation.

Rabat – The Moroccan and Spanish Professionals Fishermen expressed, in a joint communiqué published yesterday, their disagreement with the conclusions of the EU’s General Council, according to Spanish news agency EFE. The Morocco-Spain Association of Professional Fishermen issued this communiqué yesterday as a result of recent statements by the EU Justice Court’s advisor Melchior Wathelet who, talking of Western Sahara stated yesterday that the EU should invalidate its fisheries deal with Morocco because “the deal involves disputed coastal territories.” “Wednesday’s opinion by the European Union Court of Justice’s Advocate General Melchior Wathelet came in response to British-based campaigners who said Britain was wrong to uphold the EU-Morocco fisheries deal”, Reuters reported earlier today. Wathelet also said that “The fisheries exploitation by the EU of the waters adjacent to Western Sahara established and implemented by the contested acts does not respect the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination.” “The fisheries agreement does not contain the legal safeguards necessary for the fisheries exploitation to be for the benefit of the people of Western Sahara,” he added. However, fishermen from Morocco and Spain do not agree with what they see as “a political statement that benefits no one”. They jointly protested against this “ungrounded and politically motivated” decision of the EU Justice Court’s advisor. “This deal guarantees the respect of International law and human rights; and since the opinion of the general council is not binding, we hope that EU Justice Court will adopt a position in support of the deal,” the communiqué also said. “Moroccan and Spanish fishermen are surprised by the political motivations of this advisor”, their communiqué added. They also called on the UE to favor the renewal of the fisheries deal, which will expire later this year, in July. They urged the UE representatives to guarantee and “preserve the atmosphere of friendly and beneficial relations” that have so far characterized the said deal. Omar Akouri and Javier Garat, respective representatives of Morocco and Spain in the joint association of Moroccan and Spanish fishermen, said that they are confident that the UE will adopt a position that sustains the long-standing arrangement of peaceful and mutually profitable relations between the UE and Morocco.

Rabat – The sweeping tale of the emancipation of a Moroccan girl brought to the stage by The Akoun troupe for Culture and Arts in Rabat won the “Sheikh Soltane Ben Mohamed el Kacemi” prize for the best Arab theatrical work of 2017.  “Solo” was announced winner on Tuesday at the closure of the 10th Festival of Arab Theater held from January 10 to 16 in Tunis. Just last month, Solo won the Grand Prize award during the National Theater Festival held in Rabat. Written by Mohamed El Hor and Hajar El Hamidi, Solo was in competition with plays from Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Jordan, Syria and Tunisia. The festival’s 2018 theme was “Towards a new and innovative Arab theater.” Solo represents a theatrical adaptation of Taher Benjelloun’s “The Sacred Night,” telling the story of Zahra, a Moroccan girl forced to live as a boy in order to obtain her father’s inheritance. The story shifts between a painful reality and a dreamlike journey, imbued with spirituality and piety. The protagonists of the play welcomed the prize, saying that it confirms their previous distinctions in several festivals in Morocco but also in other great theatrical events, including the Theatrical Days of Carthage where the piece won a prize for the best male and female performance. The event recorded an influx of nearly twenty-five thousand spectators as well as 250.000 Internet users who have followed the ceremony via the the event’s YouTube channel. In his speech at the closing ceremony, Secretary General of the Arab Theater Committee Ismail Abdallah announced that the next edition of the festival will be held in Egypt.

Rabat – The Court of Second Instance in Fez has postponed the investigative hearing to evaluate the charges of sexual assault of minors levied against 58-year-old Frenchman until Monday, January 22. Asmae Kabba, a social activist following the case closely and who is President of the Moroccan Association Against Violence and Homelessness, an organization that provides support to sexual assault victims, confirmed the postponement to MWN on Wednesday. Kabba said that the investigative hearing had been postponed in the absence of one of the victims. The defendant is in custody of the Police in Fez. The social activist added that the National Observatory for the Rights of the Child chaired by Princess Lalla Meryem will also join the proceedings as a civil party to advocate on behalf of the underage girls. She said that she hopes that the intervention of the princesses’ association will help speed up the process and that the defendant “will get the punishment he deserves.” Hundreds of residents in the Fez medina took to the streets once again on Wednesday to stand in solidarity with the minor girls before the Court where the French tourist previously appeared on charges of rape and sexual assault of two girls aged 11 and 14. Earlier this month, the defendant, who arrived in Morocco approximately 18 months ago and has since been introducing himself to locals in Fez as a “tourist,” was arrested on January 1 in a tailor’s workshop in the Medina after allegedly committing the sexual acts on the two little girls. In a recorded interview posted on social media, the girls claimed that the 58-year-old defendant had been grooming them with money and toys, promising gifts from France. Their identities were concealed in the film as they are filmed from behind. “When I refused to comply with his orders, he threatened me and told me that he would slaughter my family,” said one of the girls in the moving interview. During the first hearing that took place on January 5, the defendant admitted to drugging and raping the two young girls.

Washington D.C. – It looks as if Morocco cannot find its bearing in today’s Washington. While the stories about the Kingdom’s gifts to the Clinton Foundation have left a certain image of a Morocco taking sides in the last presidential election. However, the business nature of the Trump administration leaves the door open to a remake of this diplomatic relationship. For that, a reexamination of Morocco’s government and public relations strategies in Washington is overdue. In fact, an agile Moroccan diplomacy and a “relevant” lobbying firm can easily overcome this small hiccup in an otherwise solid bilateral relationship between the two allies. Despite Mr. Trump’s rhetoric on African nations and his decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, he remains the President of the most influential nation in the world and his government’s positions on matters that Rabat view as crucial stay relevant and significant. Since there is no one dominant issue that controls President Trump’s foreign policy, Rabat has several tools at its disposal to refocus the Moroccan-American relations on common issues that are still important to the Trump team. One of the greatest concerns that is shared between the two nations and fits within the Trump admiration’s “America first” slogan is fighting terrorism. The October 2017 attack in Niger that killed 4 American servicemen and has made big news in the United States is one example of an opening that Moroccan officials could utilize to directly access Trump’s White House by passing the State Department. Currently the U.S. is in dire need of intelligence sources and competent friendly military units who can accompany U.S. special forces during anti-terrorism operations in the great Sahel region. With the decline of Algeria’s diplomatic and intelligence presence in Mali, Morocco, with its considerable economic and political influence in Africa can fill this void and give the U.S. a leg up in the fight against the Islamic State in the Sahel. Morocco’s successful policy in Africa could make the Kingdom a key component to future strategies of an American administration looking to score victories against terrorism and that enjoy immediate glorification. Fighting terrorism is only one of the tools in Morocco’s arsenal of assets to get the attention of the Trump team. Now, it is on the Moroccan diplomats and other officials to rebrand the Kingdom’s presence in Washington and sell their “products”. The rewards could be big. If Rabat succeeds in winning over the blessing of the current administration, Washington could fully endorse Morocco’s local autonomy plan for the Western Sahara. In fact, President Trump could easily recognize the full integration of the Saharan territory into the Kingdom making it an official American positon that would be hard to reverse later. Since the Moroccan officials’ inability to appreciate the fact that lobbying is not the only way to advance an agenda persists as the biggest hurdle for their diplomacy in Washington, it is time for a new approach as the Kingdom tries to regain its balance in Washington. In fact, the unpredictability of the current American administration presents an opportunity for the Moroccan diplomats to advance their interests. It is up to them to grab it and use it while it lasts. The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not represent any institution or entity.  © Morocco World News.

Rabat – A 165 million-years-old Moroccan dinosaur tail fossil will be auctioned in Mexico to raise funds for rebuilding Mexican schools destroyed or damaged after the powerful earthquake that hit the country on September 19. According to Morton’s Auction House, the 180-kilogram and 4-meter long tail will be sold on January 23, at a reserve price of USD 95,805, approximately MAD 887,000. Any amount above the reserve price will be donated to the BBVA Bancomer Foundation to help fund the reconstruction of some 5,000 damaged schools. “Education is an element of enormous importance for the country, an element of social mobility, that is why we support the reconstruction of schools,” Adolfo Albo, from BBVA Bancomer Foundation told Reuters, adding that the foundation hopes the tail would sell for a lot more than the reserve price. The fossil belongs to sauropode of 17 meters and 22 tons of the species Atlasaurus, which once roamed the Atlas Mountains in Morocco 165 million years ago. Reuters points out that Moroccan paleontologists took 300 hours to clean the gigantic remains of the reptile before Utah scientists rebuilt them. Last year, the auction house at the Drouot Hotel in Paris put for sale the skeleton of a marine dinosaur originally discovered in Morocco, which stirred much controversy. According to Spanish news outlet La Republica, the fossils were illegally transported out of Morocco in 2011. The Moroccan Association for the Protection of Geological Heritage requested the repatriation of the fossils of the 66-million-year-old plesiosaur. “We will not stay with our hands crossed… This is about our national heritage. There will be an investigation to find out how this fossil, of a species that only exists in Morocco, was able to leave the country,” said the director of Cultural Heritage in Morocco, Abdelá Alaoui on March 2017. Following a meeting between the Moroccan ambassador to France Chakib Benmoussa and the auction commissioner, Alexandre Giquello, a Drouot representative announced their decision to cancel the sale of the skeleton, which had been priced at EUR 350.000.

Rabat – L’Hospitalité d’Abraham, the French association dedicated to promoting peace through interfaith dialogue, has nominated the Moroccan-French peace activist Latifa Ibn Ziaten for the 2018 Nobel Peace Nobel Peace Prize.  Ziaten, whose 31-year old son Imad was murdered in March 2012 during a series of terrorist shootings in Toulouse and Montauban, has dedicated herself to preventing violent extremism and alleviating the root causes of religious radicalism that can be found in French suburbs and slums with large populations of disaffected young men. In 2012, she founded the Imad Association for Youth and Peace to work with community organizations, youth associations, individual families, as well as with mosques and prisons to spread a message of inter-religious understanding and cultural tolerance.  “Her courage commands respect. The truth of her word impresses. Her humanity touches hearts. At a time when political and religious extremism, particularly terrorism, is threatening our societies, Latifa Ibn Ziaten’s peaceful struggle opens a luminous glow in the darkness of the world,” L’Hospitalité d’Abraham Association declared in it’s submission to the Nobel Committee.  Via Twitter, the social activist herself launched a call to support her candidacy.

In recognition of her work to foster a spirit of tolerance and counter extremism, Ziaten was granted several awards and honors: November 2015, French President Hollande awarded her the Jacques Chirac Foundation prize for her work with the Imad Association. March 2016, Ziaten awarded the International Woman of Courage Award by the U.S. Department of State. March 2017, King Mohammed VI paid tribute to Latifa Ben Ziaten and commended her for the work of the Imad Association for Youth and Peace to promote a culture of peace, tolerance and respect for one another. “We feel a mother’s sorrow at the loss of her son and we realize the place he has in her heart. At the same time, we appreciate her wise and reasonable reaction after this tragic event,” he said. Latifa Ibn Ziaten was born in 1960, in Tetouan in the Moroccan Rif.

By François Koundouno Rabat – The Real Sociedad demonstration on Sunday night was not a mere game. It was a history to make, to remake. Or to undo. Or to write. Or to rewrite—You choose. It was miraculous. But what does miracle mean anyway when the team concerned is Ernesto Varlverde’s Barcelona? “You must have thought again”,  a journalist said to Valverde in the aftermath of the game, as he mentioned those bleak minutes during which Sociedad was leading the game by two-nil. “Exactly. Everyone did”, Valverde answered. Sociedad’s pitch, despite Barcelona’s unrivalled saga of tantalizing football and masterful passes, had remained, for over a decade, a nightmare to Blaugrana, “the worst place”, as Valverde has it. Pep Guardiola, with all the legend he brought to the squad, failed the Sociedad test. For a decade, since 2007, no Barcelona squad had beaten Sociedad at home. And even if Barça went there on Sunday unbeaten, playing Sociedad was still a daunting task, a tormenting doubt: for a decade, the Sociedad test ferociously roared in Barça’s ears like a wounded lion. But when you have a manager like Valverde, you can break curses, maintain your invincibility, and show your opponent the side you have become with the coach you have. Paulinho scored, again; Suarez regained the beastly instinct that had so far been eluding him; and Messi! Messi! He did what he does best, his specialty: score goals that send everyone in raptures, even the opposing side. That night, as on numerous other nights before, the Argentine genius gave Valverde what he needed to maintain the gulf of difference with other La Liga teams. Jorge Sampaoli was right when, leading a desperate Argentina to Quito late last year, he calmly told journalists: “when you have Messi on your team, everything is possible.” When Messi caressed the ball, put it on the ground, and gave it that magical touch of which he alone has the secret, the Sociedad keeper just stood there and, in the disbelief of a thief caught in action, he powerlessly watched the ball go in. There is nothing he could do. Geronimo Rulli, like many other goal keepers, will tell you this: There are times when, confronted with Messi’s magisterial free kicks, all you can do is be clueless, drop your hands, and pretend to be disappointed. Deep down, however, you revel in having Messi score against your side. For, as a football fan (only Messi has that spell of transforming opponents into fans. Well, perhaps Ronaldinho, too), you know that it is not every day that such goals are scored. “No one can stop them”, read Marca’s front-page on Monday morning. You might not—as do I—fully agree with that. What about Bayern? Or PSG; or Manchester City; or Chelsea? Valverde has an answer: “We’re not ruling anyone out.” There you have it—the mentality of a coach approaching every game like a final, like a defining moment of a glory yet to come. Valverde knows that to dream of the top, you must be able to beat the best. But he knows something more: To be competitive, you need to constantly work on the morale of your squad, convince them that they’re the best, get the best out of them—the exciting season that the likes of Paulinho and Sémodo are now having speaks volumes about the manager that Valverde is. But there is more to Varlverde’s style: Even with Messi (arguably the best footballer there is) on your team, you need to attract fresh, youthful talents. So he brought Dembélé and Coutinho in. And when everyone thought he was done, he detected another talent who he thinks can bring more vibrancy and youth to the squad’s defense: Yerry Mina. The Colombian is thought to bring the reinforcement and consistency that Barcelona need in their sometimes flabby defense. Victory tastes delicious—it has that wonderfully spicy taste that no tongue wants to miss. But besides the joy that victory brings to Barcelona fans, for the rest of us who, for some reasons, find ourselves on the side of those not supporting Barcelona, there is something much more beguiling about this Valverde squad: watching them play. “This is hard. It is a terrible blow”, Zidane told the press after last week’s debacle against Villareal. “We did everything but the ball just didn’t go in. There is no explanation”, he added. The following morning, AS dramatized Zidane’s press conference: “No goal, no luck, no explanation”, they wrote. But Zidane was right. How can anyone explain what is ailing his squad? Could anyone anticipate that Zidane’s boys, the same that single-handedly dominated Europe for two years in a row, making teams like Bayern and Juventus look amateurish, would be this desperate and uninspiring? After the humiliating slap that they inflicted upon Varlverde’s clueless, Neymar-less squad in the pre-season, who could dare predict that the numbers and performances would be what they now are? And now, while Zidane can forget about La Liga and focus on the daunting task awaiting him from Paris’ boys in February, Barça fans can rhapsodize about a future sure to be rosy. With Coutinho at his scintillating best (well, he always is), Valverde will surely exploit his master-class midfielder techniques and his otherworldly shooting accuracy. With Messi-Alba becoming an unstoppable duo; with Suarez being, on important occasions, the killer that he was on Sunday night… This squad might equal Guardiola’s record. Or they might not—this year, at least. One thing, however, is certain: Valverde has shown that he is a team builder, the right man for a team in transition. Out of the season that pundits said would be Barcelona’s worst in recent years, he has made one of the deadliest squads. What seemed lousy is now magnificent. “Barcelona are not invincible”, read a Marca headline yesterday night, as Oscar Melendo’s late goal allowed a compact Espanyol to inflict on Messi and co their first defeat of the season. It was a stunning, astounding, “frustrating night all around for Ernesto Valverde’s men”, Marca added. Unbeaten no longer. But still tactically unstoppable. Barcelona dominated the game yesterday night, as Espanyol barely created chances and did what many teams do best when playing against Barcelona: refuse to play, be stubbornly defensive, count on physicality, and, like a student who has not done his homework, pray for the mercy of the gods: Playing against Barcelona is torturous. Espanyol players’ composure after the game said it all: “How did we even resist the thunder of this squad; how did we manage to win?” “We were not lucky. We did what we could and we dominated the game.” We often hear this from managers of losing squads. But that is not Valverde’s style. For Valverde, it is not about being lucky; it is all about being clinical, converting your chances, however few, into goals. “We tried to do what we always do, dominate the game and make them on our turf”, he said after the match. “They defended well and were clinical in that move… Now we have to bounce back… We await them at the Camp Nou”, he added. When the score to come back from is a mere one-nil, and when the second leg is scheduled in their magical Camp Nou, a ground famous for its unbelievable remontada scenes, who can doubt this Barcelona’s ability to bounce back? Maybe Zidane’s predicament is that the gods of football have finally decided to give up on their French genius; they have, in the fickleness and unpredictability that is theirs, chosen their new man: Ernesto Valverde. And Barcelona’s triumph, should they triumph this season, will be Valverde’s.

Rabat – January marks the 75th anniversary of the 1943 Casablanca Conference, a meeting between US President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to plan the defeat of both Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan as well as the subsequent creation of a post-WWII order.  French General Charles de Gaulle, a leader of French forces opposed to Nazi domination of Europe, also attended the eleven-day conference held at the Anfa Hotel. Moroccans may not have participated directly in the conference’s strategic discussions, but the spirit and history of the kingdom made their presence felt. Churchill had a deep affection for Marrakech in particular; he called the imperial city the “Paris of the Sahara.” During the conference, he insisted that Roosevelt accompany him to the city for two days. On January 22, Roosevelt hosted a banquet for Sultan Mohammad V. There are few details (or photos) concerning the dinner, but some accounts note that the American president was eagerly looking forward to meeting the sultan. US General George Patton, commander of the I Armored Corps, made this entry in his diary about a car ride he shared with Mohammad V following the dinner: “I rode with Sultan and Grand Vizier to house of latter. On way Sultan said, ‘Truly your President is a very great man and a great friend of myself and of my people’.”  The population of Casablanca in 1943 was somewhere between 400,000 and 450,000. During the war years, the city was a modest commercial center but a major Atlantic port city. Location meant everything during World War II. Two months prior to the Casablanca Conference, Allied troops conducted Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa in order to expel German troops who were positioned across Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. The Allied landings, including one just north of Casablanca, hastened the departure of pro-Nazi Vichy French troops from Morocco. Holding a strategic war conference at the intersection of southern Europe, North Africa, the Atlantic Coast of Africa, and the Mediterranean Sea demonstrated the importance of Morocco’s geopolitical location and the determination by Churchill and Roosevelt that the defeat of Nazi Germany must comprehensive (“unconditional surrender”) and that all of Europe must be made safe for free and open democratic societies.  Fast forward to 2018. Casablanca’s location next to a major shipping port and just three hours from London by air make it a physical, geographic and political gateway to all of Africa. Aviation and aerospace giants like Boeing and Thales plan aerospace hubs near Casablanca because of the physical infrastructure and intellectual talent that is present there. State-led investments like Casablanca Finance City, Africa’s leading finance and investment center, represent a commitment to build a modern economy and broad middle class. The Casablanca-Settat region – now home to nearly 7 million people – is responsible for 32 percent of Morocco’s total GDP. Equal to foreign investment, the city is a snapshot of the current state of regional and international affairs in 2018. Like Casablanca in 1943, when the city served as a destination for European and North African refugees fleeing German forces, today the city is a destination for immigrants from across Africa, from Senegal to Nigeria to Sudan. Today, some 80,000 migrants reside in Morocco, many near Casablanca, Rabat and Tangier. Some want to stay, many want to settle in Europe. Like all big cities, Casablanca will face the challenges that accompany social and economic integration amid a period of profound migration across the MENA region. The city endures, benefiting from location and an embrace of the growing knowledge economy that will emphasize multilingualism and tolerance of diversity. Churchill and Roosevelt’s Casablanca Conference helped lay the groundwork for the destruction of Nazi fascism in Europe. It also helped build a foundation for a dynamic society in which the important Casablanca conferences in 2018 – from the African Digital Summit in February to the North Africa Renewable Energy Summit in May – are dedicated to a peaceful future.

  Rabat – 14-year-old Dounia finished her school day and headed to a bus station to go home. The Moroccan girl was prevented from taking the bus in Amsterdam for being Moroccan. Dounia was waiting for bus 38 in Amsterdam Noord, from Elzenhagen to Molenwijk, on November the 21st. The queue was long. The 14-year-old and an Egyptian schoolmate were waiting for their turn to enter the bus when its driver ordered her friend to wait outside. “At first he told my daughter’s friend that she has to wait outside. When my daughter tried to enter the bus, he blocked her too,” Dounia’s mother, Aicha Tapijt told Morocco World News. Dounia asked the driver the reason behind his request. “I would rather not have that kind of people on the bus,” he replied. The Netherlands-born girl proceeded to inquire as to what he meant. “Moroccans,” he answered. A Dutch passenger spoke against the driver’s discriminatory behavior and told him that she would get off the bus if the girls were not allowed in. Relentlessly, he let the two girls in and drove the bus to its destination. “My daughter didn’t have her phone with her. In the evening she told me about the incident.” Tapijt said. Furious, the mother contacted the bus company, GVB, to report the driver. “They did not answer me. The manager does not want to contact me and I can’t find his phone number.” Only when the story was reported by Dutch media did the GVB comment on the incident. “Nobody is allowed to be refused on board our vehicles because of their appearance,” the manager told the Amsterdam-based daily, Het Parool. He continued, saying that the company does not possess camera footage of the incident. “Camera images are erased after about 24 hours. Unfortunately, the report of this incident came in too late.” Tapijt reported the incident to the police, but they too couldn’t take action against the driver. “They told me that incident is not a crime and I can’t take legal action against the bus driver.” The mother reached out to the GVB’s customer service to file a complaint against the driver.  “We spoke to four bus drivers who were on duty around the time of the incident,” the customer service told her. However, according to the GVB, the drivers don’t match Dounia’s descriptions. But for Tapijt “finding him is very easy, because my daughter checked in the bus when she entered it. He was a blue eyed blond man, how hard is it for a man in Amsterdam to meet those description?” To this day, the mother continues reaching out to the authorities, hoping to identify the driver. “A man like him should be fired. The nature of his job requires him treat all passengers equally. How is my daughter any different?” Article 1 of the Dutch constitution states that “all persons in the Netherlands shall be treated equally in equal circumstances. Discrimination on the grounds of religion, belief, political opinion, race or sex or on other grounds whatsoever shall not be permitted.” Tapijit sees that the Dutch Constitution seems only applicable to white Dutch. “The constitution seems to implicate that only white Dutch must be treated equally to each other. If you are an Arab, then that’s a different story.” “I face racial discrimination almost on a daily basis and I don’t want my daughter to be subjected to the same discriminatory behavior.” After being discriminated against, Dounia asked her mother whether there is “anything wrong with me.” “I told my daughter that she is like everyone else. I then decided to find the bus driver and make sure he is penalized for his actions,” Tapijit said.

By Mohamed Bella Rabat – Morocco has always captured the attention of western literati. Throughout history, numerous prolific writers have flocked to Morocco to find spiritual and intellectual inspiration among the peoples of a diverse land. Here are ten writers who harnessed their individual experiences while in the Kingdom of Morocco to create timeless literary works. 
1. Paul Bowles An American expatriate, Paul Bowles is a writer whose name is intimately associated with Morocco and North Africa. It was in an apartment on the fourth floor of Immeuble Itesa in Tangier where Bowles lived and wrote several novels, short stories, poems and essays. His literary works were an inspiration that lured other prominent writers to explore Morocco. In his essay, “The Worlds of Tangier,” Bowles wrote, “beginning with the first day and continuing through all the years I have spent in Tangier, I have loved the white city that sits astride its hills, looking out across the Strait of Gibraltar to the mountains of Andalucia.” Bowles’ preeminent novel, The Sheltering Sky, was written in Tangier in 1949. The story of existential malaise among young American voyagers is considered a landmark of modern literature. It was later adapted to film by Academy Award Winner Bernardo Bertolucci in 1990. For half a century, Bowles explored, crisscrossed and trekked throughout Morocco. In Baptism of Solitude, Paul Bowles discussed his trip to the Moroccan Sahara: “Immediately when you arrive in the Sahara, for the first or the tenth time, you notice the stillness. An incredible, absolute silence prevails outside the towns; and within, even in busy places like the markets, there is a hushed quality in the air, as if the quiet were a conscious force which, resenting the intrusion of sound, minimizes and disperses sound straightaway.” 2. Juan Goytisolo The Anti-Orientalist Juan Goytisolo is regarded as Spain’s second most prominent writer after Miguel de Cervantes. “Juan Goytisolo is one of the Cervantes Prize winners who most closely identified with the author of Don Quixote,” said Spanish Culture Minister Inigo Mendez de Vigo during the Cervantes Awards Ceremony in 2014. Although Spanish by birth, Juan Goytisolo later declared that he was from Marrakech’s Jemaa el Fna Square, and pledged allegiance to Marrakech’s people as he called them, “My tribe.” From his seat in Café France in Jemaa el Fna, Goytisolo felt inspired and mesmerized by the storytellers, snake charmers, magicians, musicians and acrobats. Goytisolo’s passionate attachment to and affiliation with the renowned Jemaa el Fna square culminated in its declaration as a world heritage site by UNESCO in 2001. A part of “the intangible cultural heritage of humanity.” 3. Tennessee Williams Tennessee Williams is a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, and is regarded as one of America’s primary playwrights of the 20th century. While on vacation in Morocco, Williams wrote Cat on A Hot Tin Roof, a play that won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Tangier’s Petit Socco, a mythical square in the city’s medina, was Williams’s most utopian space in Morocco. 4. William S. Burroughs The “outlaw” William S. Burroughs, or “El Hombre Invisible” (the invisible man) as people in Tangier called him, is one of the central figures of the Beat Generation that found refuge in Morocco. Inside room no. 9 in El Muniria motel in Tangier, Burroughs wrote his best-selling book, Naked Lunch. During his time in Tangier, Burroughs wrote, “Tangier is one of the few places left in the world where, so long as you don’t proceed to robbery, violence, or some form of crude, antisocial behavior, you can do exactly what you want.” 5. Edith Wharton Edith Wharton was the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for her novel,  The Age of Innocence. It was later adapted to film in 1993 by Academy Award Winner Martin Scorsese and starred Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer. Pre-winning the Pulitzer for fiction in 1921, Wharton paid a visit to Morocco in 1917, at the invitation of General Lyautey. In Morocco, Wharton immersed herself in the diverse culture, the intriguing history and the splendor of the Moroccan landscape. In her book entitled, In Morocco, Wharton wrote that “Morocco is too curious, too beautiful, too rich in landscape and architecture, and above all too much of a novelty, not to attract one of the main streams of spring travel.” Wharton found the Moroccan architecture and its intricate ornaments a feast to the eye; “to visit Morocco is still like turning the pages of some illuminated Persian manuscript all embroidered with bright shapes and subtle lines.” 6. George Orwell The writer of the two dystopian classics, 1984 and Animal Farm, visited Morocco in 1938. George Orwell’s travel to Morocco was extremely fruitful and rewarding. While in Morocco, Orwell wrote his well-molded novel Coming Up For Air. To the British socialist, essayist and novelist Jack Common, Orwell wrote, “the long rest has done me good and I am getting on with a new novel [Coming Up For Air], whereas a year ago after that awful nightmare in Spain [the Spanish Civil War], I had seriously thought I would never be able to write a novel again.” 7. Jack Kerouac
Jack Kerouac is a pioneer of the literary movement known as the Beat Generation, and well-known author of the classic and critical novel, On the Road. As a great wanderer, sometimes a fool traveler, Kerouac didn’t stop himself from visiting Tangier, “La Novia Del Norte” (the bride of the north). In his book Desolation Angels, he documented his trip with other original core members of the Beat Generation in Tangier. In one of the chapters entitled, “Passing Through Tangier,” he wrote, “Majoon is a candy you make with honey, spices and raw marijuana (kief)…A tremendous high giving vent to many colored sensations like, ‘Notice the delicate white shade of those flowers under the tree’…Man, that hasheesh in Bull’s room – and it’s amazing how American pot smokers have gone around the world by now with the most exaggerated phantasmagoria of gooey details, hallucinations actually, by which their machine-ridden brains though are actually given a little juice of the ancient life of man, so God bless pot.” 8. Esther Freud  Esther Freud is another writer that paid a visit to Morocco, but only as a young child. The daughter of British painter Lucian Freud, and great-granddaughter of Sigmund Freud, embarked on a bohemian journey through Morocco with both her sister and hippie free-spirited mother in the 1960s. In her autobiographical novel, Hideous Kinky, Freud depicts the dazzling and unconventional life of her mother as she went wherever Morocco’s wind took her. Freud wrote, ”My first big journey was when I was four, to Morocco, where I lived until I was six, and wrote about [in Hideous Kinky]. For the rest of my childhood I felt I had a secret, exotic, colorful Moroccan life inside me that nobody else in gray, rainy England understood. It affected me in another way: I spoke a muddle of English, French and Arabic, but couldn’t write until I was 10. I thought that stories and tales I’d heard in Morocco were more magical than putting letters in a certain order. I think they politely called me ‘vague’.” 9. Jean Genet 
The controversial French author, Jean Genet, is one of the many writers that chose Morocco for permanent residence. His rebellious creative writing flourished while in Morocco. The “Thug of Genius,” as Simone de Beauvoir called him, embraced Morocco as his final resting place. When Genet died in Paris in 1986, his body was taken back to Larache, Morocco, where he was buried. Jean Genet loved Morocco and was largely indebted to the country and its people. 10. Mark Twain Mark Twain is an American author who is well known for his novel of high literary merit, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He is another great writer who traveled to Morocco to gain creative inspiration. In his travel book, The Innocents Abroad, Twain wrote of Morocco, “Tangier is the spot we have been longing for all the time…We wanted something thoroughly and uncompromisingly foreign—foreign from top to bottom—foreign from center to circumference—foreign inside and outside and all around—nothing anywhere about it to dilute its foreignness—nothing to remind us of any other people or any other land under the sun. And lo! In Tangier we have found it…I am glad to have seen Tangier—the second-oldest town in the world.” Today, various parts of the country, big and small, are still a representation and a testament to the accounts and adventures of many important Western authors who traveled to Morocco, discovered its many mysteries, and found creative inspiration.

Rabat – The Public Prosecutor’s office has ordered an investigation into the case of a young domestic worker from Zagora who was mistreated by her employer in Casablanca, reported the state news agency MAP on Wednesday. According to Amina Khalid, a local activist and member of the human rights NGO INSAF, the 22-year-old maid was subjected to “abominable aggression by her employer,” resulting in burns and bruises all over the body. The young woman was taken to the hospital by her employer, where she has been since last Saturday. The doctors quickly alerted INSAF given the woman’s condition and additional suspicions of sexual violence perpetrated by the homeowner. The association claims to have information regarding previous assaults committed by the employer against another domestic worker, who never pressed charges.

Rabat – Jean-Yves le Drian, French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, received in Paris, Horst Kohler, United Nations Secretary-General Personal Envoy for Western Sahara. During this meeting that took place on Wednesday January 17, Le Drian emphasized to Kohler that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan represents a serious and credible basis for the Western Sahara conflict.  The French official also recalled France’s commitment to full compliance with ceasefire agreements and reaffirmed his country’s support for a fair, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution, in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolutions. Le Drian also reiterated France’s full support for Kohler in carrying out his mission as well as his country’s commitment to MINURSO.  Le Drian and Kohler also discussed the activities that Kohler has undertaken since he was appointed in August 2017.  France showed its support to Morocco’s autonomy plan on many occasions whether during bilateral meetings with Moroccan officials or at the United Nations Security Council.  France stance on Morocco’s plan was underscored in a statement at the end of the 13th France-Morocco High Level meeting, which took place in Rabat last November.  The meeting was co-chaired by French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani.  During the two-day event, France also reiterated its support for the efforts led by the UN to find a solution to the four-decade long conflict between Morocco and the Algeria-backed Polisario Front.  In March 2016, French Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Romain Nadal told the press that “For France, the autonomy plan submitted by Morocco 2007 represents a serious and credible basis for a negotiated solution, to Western Sahara issue.  He said that France’s position regarding this issue is “well known and has never changed.” Paris supports “a just, sustainable and mutually acceptable solution under the auspices of the United Nations,” he added.

By Lauren Peterson Fez – Over the weekend, the “Photography &amp; Documentary Films in Africa” panel at the Fez Gathering art program highlighted global initiatives to expand photography in Africa after retracing Africa’s history of photography from in front of and behind the camera.   Perhaps a symptom of its high-looming geography or its divers of cultures, transparency between Africa and the rest of the world is less a window than it is a one-way mirror. The continent has long competed to, and often taken a backseat role in, authoring its biography and shaping its own international semblance.  The focal point of Friday’s panel was contemporary photography and documentary films in Africa, and was moderated by Tina Barouti, a Fulbright U.S. Student Fellow studying in Tetouan, Morocco and a PHD candidate at Boston University’s History of Art and Architecture Department. Barouti set the trajectory for the discussion with a crash course in the evolution of photography as it developed outside of and within Africa. “I think that photography is a really fun way to learn about African history and the social world in Africa,” Barouti stated in an interview. “A lot of people aren’t familiar with looking at images to analyze history, and art historians are really good at that. So it’s a fun activity to get the audience involved, to ask them questions about what they think when they look at images. I think it’s really important to train people visually.”  Spanning from 1839 Daguerreotypes to work from African photographers like Malick Sidibé and Seydou Keïta in the 1960’s and 1970’s, the timeline depicts a hard-hearted affair between Africa and photography’s expansion, particularly in regard to another continent, Europe, that too was expanding. “The first images that we see of Africa are of the landscapes, historic monuments in Egypt,” stated Barouti. “Then they moved to postcards, which were taken from private photos in commercial studio spaces and circulated around Europe without the consent of the sitters.”  “I think it’s great that an event like this, focused on the continent, is being held in Morocco because North Africa is always bunched in with the Middle East, and to reclaim that African identity for Moroccans is really important,” Barouti said.  From Barouti’s backdrop, the panelists extended the topic of Africa’s history of photography to their own work, which work to support African photographers and grow the field within Africa. Among the panelists was Berlin based photographer and founder of the CAP (Contemporary African Photography) Prize Benjamin Füglister, Moroccan photographer M’hammed Kilito, and Berlin based photographer Eve Marie Ocherbauer, whose institution, Photo Factory Lagos, trains young Nigerian photographers.

Rabat – Trump’s administration is cutting more than half of the financial aid that the United States normally provides to the United Nations agency helping Palestinian refugees. Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the US State Department said on Tuesday that the Trump administration will provide only USD 60 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). She added that the country will withhold another USD 65 million “for future consideration,” reported American news outlet New York Times. The official added that the US’ move is aimed at encouraging other countries to increase their funding of the UN agency. Nauert also insisted that this latest move by the administration was not linked to the threats voiced by Donald Trump after the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to condemn his recent decision to recognize Jerusalem as its capital and to relocate the US embassy. On January 2, the US President took to his Twitter account threatening to cut US aid to Palestinians.  Trump said, “It is not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries and others, As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED of Million of Dollars a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate” with Israel. It’s not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries, and others. As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018  For his part, Wassl Abu Youssef, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) denounced the US’ actions, tying it to Trump’s unprecedented decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. According to Reuters, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was not expecting any cut in aid but was “very concerned” about the possibility. In the 2017 fiscal year, the US provided UNRWA with funding estimated at USD 335 million.

Rabat – The Independence Party of Morocco proposed on Tuesday a new law to criminalize acts of racism and racial discrimination against foreigners.  The Independence  Party’s proposal was presented during a meeting in the House of Councillors. During the meeting, the party proposed prison sentences ranging from one to three years for any individual guilty of making racist remarks against foreign visitors or residents in Morocco, according to Moroccan newspaper Al Massae. Al Massae added that the party has urged the government to impose such measures because racist acts erode the country’s image national and at international levels. The party also called on the government to hold a regular census for foreigners and other disadvantaged groups. The proposal aims to identify the gaps that persist in order to better integrate these subsets into Moroccan society, added Al Massae. The parliamentary group recalled during the meeting that Morocco has become a hub for sub-Saharan migrants, some of whom seek better opportunities in Morocco or use the country as a stepping stone to reach Europe. Istiqlal insists that Morocco should provide migrants a decent standard of living and equal rights. The party is determined that the time has come to end racism and discrimination between Moroccans and sub-Saharans. The proposition thus aims to abolish all forms of discrimination within the country, which has welcomed hundreds of sub-Saharan migrants in recent years. A series of clashes erupted between sub-Saharan migrants and Moroccans in November and December 2017 near the Oulad Ziane bus station in Casablanca, where migrants were living in makeshift camps. The incident polarized public opinion. Some expressed outrage and accused fellow citizens of racist behaviors toward the immigrants. Others have claimed that it is not “racism” and have called for the sub-Saharans to be removed from the area.  Still, others have voiced their concerns over the ineffectiveness of Morocco’s immigration policy, claiming that what happened at the makeshift camp was “predictable.”

Rabat – The Atlas Lions are shining in the African Nations Championship. Morocco’s Ayoub El Kaabi scored a hat-trick that enabled his team to strengthen its lead of Group A. The Moroccan football team of local players beat their Guinean peer 3-1 in the second match of the first round (group A) of the 2018 African Nations Championship (CHAN-Morocco) on Wednesday in Casablanca.  With this second victory against Guinea, Atlas Lions will not have to wait until the last match against Sudan, next Sunday, to secure their ticket for the second round of the tournament.  This was the host’s second successive victory after having defeated Mauritania on Saturday, January 13. Ayoub El Kaabi opened the score for Morocco at the 26-minute mark. Guinea was very quick in responding to Morocco’s goal. Saidouba Bissiri leveled the score one just a minute after Morocco’s first goal. At the 64th minute, Morocco doubled the score to the delight of over 40,000 supporters. Four minutes later, El Kaâbi scored the third goal of the match.  This win allows the Atlas Lions to retain their first place in the group (6 points), ahead of Sudan (3 points) which will face Mauritania later in the evening. Morocco will play its third game against Sudan, which occupies the second position in group A with 3 points. With its second consecutive defeat in the tournament, Guinea, which played the semi-finals of the CHAN 2016 in Rwanda, stands no chances to qualify for the second round.

By François Koundouno Rabat – Last Saturday, as the African National Congress (ANC), South Africa’s incumbent party, celebrated its 106th anniversary, Cyril Ramophosa, the party’s newly elected leader, said in his speech that the ANC would not relent on its position regarding the Western Sahara question. This despite the recent rapprochement between Rabat and Pretoria. A former protégé of Nelson Mandela, Cyril Ramophosa is lauded by a number of high-ranking ANC members as a leader who will “bring transformative energy to the ANC.” “At the center of all our efforts this year must be the fundamental renewal and revitalization of the African National Congress (ANC),” Ramophosa said in his speech. As far as his domestic agenda is concerned, he vowed to help eradicate the “factionalism, corruption, and patronage” that pervaded the ANC in recent years. He called for an inclusive and socially responsible ANC, adding that “We need to work with urgency and seriousness to address challenges.” But it is his foreign policy guidelines that have attracted considerable attention from number of observers and analysts of the current state of affairs in Africa’s political landscape. Promising “faithfulness to the founding principles of the ANC,” Ramophosa said that “The ANC reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination and independence.”  “The ANC condemns the withdrawal of Morocco from the UN-led peace process and calls on the UN to bring all parties back to the negotiation table,” he added. This stance, though, faithful to what Ramophosa sees as the ANC’s founding pillars, comes at a particularly contentious time, especially given the fact that not more than three months ago, Morocco and South Africa engaged agreed to resume bilateral relations. During the African Union’s fifth summit in Abidjan on November, 29th, 2017, king Mohammed met his South-African counterpart. The two leaders discussed terms for warmer diplomatic relations between their respective countries. On January, 9th, 2018, Maite Nkoma Mashabane, South Africa’s minister of foreign affairs, met his Moroccan counterpart on the sideline of a summit on immigration held in Rabat. The two officials reaffirmed the stances of their respective heads of state, with Morocco’s minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation Nasser Bourita saying after their meeting that “When Morocco and Rabat join efforts to serve the African agenda, Africa will have a stronger voice, and a much bigger influence on multinational issues.” As Morocco and South Africa constitute “the two largest investors in the continent” according to a recent report by the Afro-Middle East Center, Rabat and Pretoria are expected to transcend their divergences by prioritizing feasible and mutually beneficial policies.

Rabat – Laura Roosevelt, former US president Franklin Roosevelt’s granddaughter, is expected on January 20 in Casablanca to commemorate of the 75th anniversary of the Anfa Conference, which constituted a watershed moment in World War II. Following an invitation from the United Kingdom and United States embassies in Morocco, Roosevelt’s granddaughter will participate in a roundtable in the presence of Allen Packwood, director of archives of former British Prime Minister Churchill, and the historian Meredith Hindley, author of “Destination Casablanca: Exile, Espionage, and the Battle for North Africa in World War II.” The book published in October 2017 sheds light on Casablanca’s pivotal role in World War II and tells the story of the real-life drama of the refugees, resistance fighters and Allied spies who flowed through the city in the build-up to Operation Torch in November 1942. It was the first major operation that US troops undertook in the North African theatre of World War II. The conference of Anfa took place in Casablanca in January 1943 between American President Franklin Roosevelt, Britain’s Prime Minister Winston Churchill and France’s General de Gaulle. During the conference, the allies agreed on “unconditional surrender” of the Axis power. President Roosevelt organized a dinner party in honor of the late Mohammed V, indicating America’s recognition of Morocco’s legitimate longing for independence.

Rabat – It turns out that Princess Lalla Asmaa, sister of King Mohammed VI, has a bit of a green thumb – or is interested in supporting Moroccans who do. The Princess is currently investing in Moroccan agricultural projects via her company, Yano Participation. One of her major investments is with Atlas Citrus, a fruit farm located in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains. Lalla Asmaa is cooperating with the owner, Rachid Fahmane, a major player within Morocco’s agricultural sector. Atlas Citrus annually exports more than 16,000 tons of oranges — and 10,000 tons of clementines and other small fruits — to different countries as far away as Russia, the United States, and Canada.  In 2016, the Princess also established Terfert Company, specializing in agricultural resource development and is chaired by Aziz Benzzoubeir, former president of. However, Lalla Asmaa’s interests may extend beyond the farm as well: Yano Participation also aims to invest in development projects more broadly. According to Moroccan magazine Telquel, Yano Participation’s “business strategy is based on taking out shares and gaining interest from [existing] companies or industrial, commercial, financial or real estate initiatives.” Although agriculture may be Lalla Asmaa’s current field of interest, she and Yana Participation may also be ready to expand into other sectors as well.

Rabat – Motorists should expect massive fuel price fuel increases this week. Fuel prices have increased on Wednesday in gas stations just 48 hours after the Moroccan government launched a flexible exchange rate system for dirham. Fuel prices have reached unprecedented levels since the liberation of pricing policies, according to Moroccan newspaper Assabah. The price of diesel for the first time exceed the threshold of MAD 10 per liter. Its prices range between MAD 10.5 and MAD 9.60/ liter depending on gas stations. The price of gasoline has reached MAD 11.30. Assabah said that the rise in prices came in response to the decline of the dollar, which was equivalent to MAD 9.50 on Tuesday. Adil Ziadi, President of Morocco’s oil group, says that as the dollar falls, the price of a barrel of oil has reached USD 68, while the price of refined products reached USD 630/ ton, according to Assabah.  Import costs, taxes and expenses related to distribution are not included. Morocco pays its fuel imports with the USD. Ziadi added that fuel prices differ from one gas station to another, for an average of MAD 9.70. The president believes that the gradual liberalization of dirham make oil companies face fluctuations in oil prices. According to Ziadi, the decline of dirham against the dollar should generate an increase in oil prices, even if prices remain stable. He emphasized that experts do not have a clear idea of the future of dirham exchange rate following the flexibility process.

Rabat – As Morocco plans new strategies to reduce foreign energy imports, the North African country is attracting three international bidders to build the 800-megawatt Midelt Noor solar power project. French energy giants Engie SA and EDF Energies Nouvelles have both submitted bids for the project, as has Saudi Arabia’s Acwa Power International. In December 2017, the bid was launched for the Midelt Noor solar project, named for the town in central Morocco where the project is set to take place. The French and Saudi energy firms are responsible for the  “engineering, procurement, and construction of the project,” Obaid Amrane, a member of the Masen’s management board, told American financial news outlet, Bloomberg Market. By the end of this year, Morocco’s government will hand the bidders contracts for the project, which consists of two 400-megawatt facilities. Both Acwa Power and Engie confirmed their offers. The Saudi-based firm said it will submit a financial strategy by April or May while EDF has not yet proposed a timeline regarding the project. Medelt Noor is part of a broader Moroccan initiative to curb foreign purchases of foreign energy and to produce more than 40 percent of its electricity from renewables by the end of the decade. Amrane said that Morocco seeks to build six gigawatts of installed renewable capacity, including solar, wind, and hydropower by 2020. Morocco, according to the member of Masen’s management board, expects “a lot of innovation” and lower prices in the battery market.

Rabat – A recent note published by JP Morgan came to confirm Moroccans’ worst fears about the dirham liberalization reform. The American bank predicts a 7 percent depreciation of the dirham over the next 12 months.  In a recent note issued by the Emerging Markets Research department of the bank, JP Morgan goes into details about Morocco’s new flexible exchange rate regime reform. After the botched launch of the first phase of the dirham liberalization reform in mid-2017, which led to a severe rush on currency that drained $3 billion from Bank Al Maghrib’s foreign currency reserves, JP Morgan believes “this time to be different.” READ ALSO: Dirham Liberalization: What Should Moroccans Expect According to JP Morgan, Morocco’s central bank discretion about the new date of the launch of the reform allowed it to “limit pre-emptive demand for foreign currency.” In addition, the American bank explains that the shock-effect of greater exchange rate flexibility should be much more muted now compared to April 2017, “as some policy steps towards exchange rate flexibility have been expected for some time already and fears of a large devaluation have been dispelled.” READ ALSO: Dirham Liberalization Carries Limited Devaluation Risks: BMI Research However, the shocking piece of information revealed by JP Morgan’s note is the 7 percent depreciation of the dirham against the euro-dollar basket in the next 12 months. For the bank, this depreciation “will be inconsistent with Bank Al Maghrib’s plans,” which widened the fluctuation band against the euro-dollar currency basket, trading up to a +/- 2.5 percent around a central rate. “The graph shows that the market prices in a gradual depreciation path of the dirham against the euro and dollar basket from MAD 10.47 (current spot) to MAD 11.18 in a year’s time.” says JP Morgan’s note. READ ALSO: Bank Al Maghrib Sets Dirham Prices Against US Dollar However, the bank adds that “current market pricing is inconsistent with this gradual sequencing of events,” namely because “it is not obvious that the dirham is significantly overvalued at current levels,” and the authorities are transitioning to the new system “under a relatively supportive global economic environment.” In this sense, JP Morgan believes that since Bank Al Maghrib is stepping carefully towards greater exchange rate flexibility, “we see the impact on the economy to be limited at this juncture.” For the bank, there is no scenario of undervaluation or overvaluation for the dirham in the medium term. “While the deficit in the external balance suggests that dirham could be overvalued modestly, our Consumer Price Index has appreciated by only about 4 percent since the 2012 low and remains below the long-term average.” JP Morgan believes that the alignment of the dirham close to its fair value, combined with a limited Foreign Exchange open position in the financial and corporate sectors, “explain why the currency has not come under pressure and has remained well within the band since the central bank announcement.” “Foreign Exchange loans were only 2.7 percent of total loans in the banking system in 2017 and banks’ net open foreign exchange positions to tier 1 capital had narrowed from 10 percent in 2010 to 4 percent at the start of 2017,” explains the bank. On the other hand, JP Morgan expects the current account deficit to reach about 4 percent of GDP, about the same level as in 2017 according to its projections. The balance of payments remains “supported by buoyant exports despite rising energy prices,” says the bank. “We do not expect a material increase in the volume of exports of goods and services which has slowed from an average of 8.6 percent in the last 5 years to about 6 percent in 2017. Nonetheless, the current steps to increase the dirham flexibility and the reduction in the weight of the Euro in the currency basket from 80 to 60 percent in 2015 should limit any deterioration in external balances and support competitiveness against the background of a rising Euro.” adds JP Morgan. “Given the limited increase in the flexibility of the Dirham, we expect a moderate rise in inflation, projected to average close to 2 percent, up from 0.7 percent in 2017.”

By Tamba François Koundouno Rabat – That the English language is the lingua franca of our globalized world is undoubtedly unsettling for many people. The idea is that the single-handed dominance of English, and the unprecedented inexorability with which it is spreading and pervading our daily activities, may, in the long run, render other languages redundant and downright irrelevant. The US-educated Japanese writer and academic Manie Mizumura makes much the same case in her 2014 book The Fall of Language in the Age of English. She bemoans the status of English as “the universal language”, extols the virtues and merits of “national languages”, and calls upon countries (Japan, in her case) to preserve the singularity of their perspective and outlook on the world, especially by keeping and bolstering their linguistic heritage.  For Mizumura, when a country loses its “national language”, it also loses its uniqueness, the heart of how it projects itself in the outer world. There is something particularly estranging and alienating in speaking and writing in a language that is not your own, she thinks. France, it now appears, has heeded Mizumura’s qualms about the universal dominance of English, and is ready to tackle the grip of English by “cleansing the French language of the English intruders.” In March 2013, there was a wave of demonstrations against a bill that sought more English-medium courses at university level in France. At the time, the government was targeting more international students from emerging countries who generally prefer English-medium universities. However, many students and academics protested against what they viewed as an “Americanization disguised as globalization.” With Emmanuel Macron’s Francophonie agenda, the new strong man of The Elysée Palace has made it consistently known that he wants to revitalize the French language, reclaiming, in the process, the country’s lost cultural hegemony. In his recent African tour in Burkina Faso, Emanuel Macron spoke of his determination to rebuild France’s lost cultural appeal and revive the French language’s status of “World language”. The recent nomination of Morocco-born Leila Slimani (winner of the 2016 Goncourt Prize for her novel Chanson douce) was very much an integral part of Macron’s Francophonie Plan. French, by Macron’s reckoning, shall outshine English’s global prestige by 2050. Recently speaking to the press in support of Macron’s linguistic plans, Slimani said that French is not—or should not be only seen as —a language of intellectuals and the elite. “French is also a corporate language… French is cool”, she added. French, as is well known, used to be the language of highbrow culture or ‘société’ in many countries around the world, including Russia, England, Turkey, etc. Classics of Russian and Turkish literatures are filled with examples of scenes showing that being a philistine was associated with not knowing French cuisine, French language, and French literature. As for dressing, France’s haute couture was the ultimate dish du jour, the best that Fashion could offer. In a series of announcements made last Friday in the Journal Officiel, French government expressed its determination to ditch intruding foreign terms and maintain, at all costs, the purity of the French language. France Terme, the website in charge of vulgarizing the new French words, noted that the government’s move seeks “to give a French touch to new realities and technological as well as scientific innovations by giving them French names.” The Commission d’enrichissement de la langue française, working in tandem with the infamously elitist Academie Française, is now calling on French and Francophones to resist the constant influx of English in daily speech. Instead of ‘Smartphone’, they say, French speakers should use ‘mobile multifonction’. It should be noted that the recent choice of ‘mobile multifonction’ comes as a result of past unsuccessful attempts to popularize terms like ‘ordiphone’ and ‘terminal de poche’. French twitter users, however, ridiculed the move and touted it as grotesque, hilarious, and unpractical. Camille Chevalier-Karfis, founder of FrenchToday.com, describes the decision as “totally stupid”. In an op-ed article published yesterday in The Local, she said that declaring a puritanical linguistic war sounds “really silly”, much less against a language that has borrowed so much from French (45% of English words are said to be of French origin). “Languages are primarily an exchange. An exchange of ideas, cultures… Why should we feel threatened by a few foreign words integrating our French vocabulary?”, she wrote. In what has been called “a global English-language tsunami”, there is some point in wanting to preserve one’s cultural heritage. Nonetheless, given the almost irresistible allure of American pop culture, this whole enterprise of keeping English at bay sounds rather futile. Accommodating, rather than taming or keeping at bay, is, according to many practitioners of international relations, the most sensible way forward. Once, upon being questioned by a journalist about the worrying dominance of English in global dealings, French Diplomat Stéphane Dujarric (currently spokesperson for the UN Secretary General Antonio Gueterres) replied: “It is not abdicating in the face of an English tsunami. It is about making sure you know how to swim. If you don’t speak and especially write English fluently you will not be hired in an international organization or you will not be able to prosper in it. Let’s recognize that English is today the dominant language. Nothing lasts forever. Tomorrow it may be Mandarin and a few hundred years later Arabic. But today it is English. That’s an indisputable fact.” French is today the 5th language spoken in the world. And with analysts and specialists predicting that the post-American world, if it does emerge, will be dominated by the East (China and India, most notably), it is difficult to see how French could become the most preferred language in a foreseeable future. In an endlessly complex and multipolar global stage, countries no longer effectively assert themselves through the sole robustness of their military might (hard power), or the somehow waning appeal of their culture (Soft power); winning hearts and minds now necessitates a dexterous combination of the two (Smart power). France, for sure, does have these; but not to the point of claiming global hegemony in 33 years. What is more, China’s ongoing spectacular Silk Road Project, together with her overwhelming presence in emerging markets, makes France’s position completely untenable.     Here is a list of some of the concerned words: English name   New French name

Rabat – The latest report from Marocmétrie, the company in charge of TV ratings in Morocco, revealed that during the first week of 2018, more than half of Moroccans prefer watching foreign channels to national ones.  Despite the diversity of national TV programs, the report shows that 50.5 percent of Moroccans viewers prefer foreign channels. Morocco’s TV channel, 2M, leads the national channels with a rate of 36.9 percent, followed by Al Aoula with a low rating of 8.7 percent.  Marocmétrie also added that peak audience hours are between 20:50 and 22:30. At this time Al Aoula has an audience share of 19.7 percent and 2M has 35 percent. However, foreign channels have the lion’s share, with 42 percent of the audience. In an April 2017 audience survey, the same company said that 56 percent of Moroccans choose to follow foreign channels, especially in Morocco’s northern cities. In December 2017, the Interprofessional Center for Media Audiometry (CIAUMED) announced that it renewed its collaboration with Marocmétrie to continue measuring television audiences in Morocco. The two sides signed a new 6-year audience measurement service contract, including a transition year.  The new audience measurement system is based on an expanded panel of 1,000 households (currently 750), equipped with a next-generation audiometer, and is representative of the Moroccan population on socio-demographic criteria (gender, age, region, socio-professional category…). According to the company, the TV audience measurements provide television channels with “exhaustive, accurate and objective” audience results on the performances of programs broadcast in order to better pilot and adapt their program schedules. This measure also enables advertising market actors such as agencies, boards, and advertisers to optimize their advertising investments.

Rabat – The Ministry of Culture is working in partnership with the Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco to add Malhoun to the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Minister of Culture, Mohamed Laaraj, said that it is now time to give Malhoun a place among the humanity’s cultural heritage. “This authentic Moroccan art is a heritage and a pride for Moroccans. It represents a part of their identity and culture, and contributes to the refinement of social relations and the establishment of social cohesion.” The minister indicated that Malhoun meets the criteria for intangible cultural heritage as announced in the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2003, and approved by Morocco in 2006. He added that his department “is working tirelessly to implement this convention through the promotion and preservation of the art of Malhoun.” “The art of Malhoun is not only an artistic practice but it is linked to all stages of the history of Morocco and manifests itself through the different aspects of modern life,” he indicated. The chairman of the Malhoun Commissions and member of the Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco, Abbas El Jirari, said that the Academy “is making enormous efforts to preserve this sublime and authentic musical style.” “The Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco has been working for 12 years to collect Malhoun poetry, which is widely scattered throughout Morocco,” he said. An “Encyclopedia of Malhoun” has been set up by the Academy to ensure the registration of Malhoun with UNESCO as cultural heritage. Meanwhile, an anthology committee has been established to document and protect this cultural heritage.

Rabat – The average Moroccan consumer consumed 180 eggs in 2017, a significant increase over the 138 eggs consumed in 2010, said the National Association of Egg Producers (ANPO). Morocco’s increased demand for eggs was entirely met last year, as the country produced 5.5 billion units in 2017 according to preliminary figures from the ANPO. In 2017, egg production required an investment of MAD 3.25 billion with an estimated turnover of MAD 6.75 billion, the Association said. Further, this sector offers 21,000 direct jobs and nearly 31,000 indirect jobs in marketing and distribution channels, added the same source. 
Where Do Eggs Come From? Morocco is home to three approved hatcheries producing 14 million chicks, 252 farms authorized to raise laying hens, five approved egg processing centers and three egg processing units. The ANPO has also indicated that consumption or table eggs are produced by hens called “laying hens” which are raised in farms in accordance with the provisions of Law 49-99, “on the health protection of poultry products.” These farms are approved by the veterinary services of the National Office for Food Safety (ONSSA) and are supervised by a private veterinary surgeon with a health mandate. These laying hens, which are reared for about 80 weeks, receive a balanced diet consisting mainly of grains such as corn, barley, by-products of oilseeds, soybeans, and sunflower as well as small amounts of vitamins and minerals to protect chicks against nutritional deficiencies.

Rabat – King Felipe VI of Spain received, on Monday, Lucia Jimenez, the President of Canarian Association of Terrorism Victims  (Acavite). During the meeting, Jimenez sensitized the King to the attacks committed by the separatist group during Spain’s colonization of Western Sahara. Jimenez was received by the King on the sidelines of a Human Rights Award ceremony entitled Adolfo Suarez, presented by the Spanish Foundation of Terrorism Victims, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Acavite president also discussed with the King the situation of the victims who have not received help since Polisario’s attacks. According to Spanish news outlet El Dia, Jimenez said during the ceremony that both Spain and Morocco at that time, had an agreement of security, protection and aid for Spanish skilled workers and their families affected by the brutal attacks committed by the Polisario Front on the Phosboucraa site between 1974 and 1977. The attacks, according to Jimenez, occurred on the phosphate conveyer belt in Laayoun from 1974 to 1977. The front attacked the conveyor belts in an attempt to stop the phosphate mining. Polisario also started violent attacks on Spanish fishing vessels, Moroccan army and French nationals. Polisario’s guerrilla attacks resumed throughout the 70s. Acavite president sensitized the King about the situation of widows and orphans in the Canary Islands as a result of  Polisario’s guerrilla attacks. The Spanish Kings received the Adolfo Suarez Human Rights Defense Award from The Terrorism Victims Foundation at the ceremony that held at Reina Sofia Museum on Monday in Madrid.

Speaking at an extraordinary session of the Oriental regional council, which was devoted to the socio-economic situation in the province of Jerada, El Jamai stressed that the emergency plan interacts with the demands of the local population, noting that other measures will be taken, in the medium and long term, to provide an efficient economic alternative and promote the upgrading of the region. Emergency measures are related to water and electricity bills, employment, the implementation of the social agreement concluded following the closure of Charbonnages du Maroc (CDM), the exploitation of underground coal wells and the degradation of the environment, he said. Among these measures, he stressed the importance given to the settlement of the situation of operators who work in an anarchic way in coal pits with a view to improving their working conditions and ensuring their safety and security. El Jamai underlined the importance of controlling exploitation permits and respecting the rules and laws in force and of conducting a study on security at the old mines in the communes of Sidi Boubker and Touisset. He also stressed the need to speed up the establishment of a geological map to define the mineral potential of the province. Among the actions included in the emergency plan, the Council of the Oriental region has allocated four million dirhams for the launch of a closure operation of abandoned coal pits, the Wali added. Regarding energy and electricity, a fifth production unit will be set up at Jerada’s thermal station, in addition to a new solar thermal station in Ain Beni Mathar, he said, adding that priority in terms of employment at the 4th unit of Jerada Station, which is completed, as well as in the 5th unit will be given to young people from the province who will benefit from training sessions in this field. A contract will be signed with the National Office of Electricity to provide jobs in the fields of transport, coal, security and other subcontracting activities, within the framework of the regulations in force, El Jamai pointed out. The plan also includes the integration of the province’s youth in national industrial clusters (Kenitra and Tangier) and the registration of more than 500 women from the province for seasonal work in southern Spain, he said. Regarding the social agreement, signed following the closure of Jerada mine in 1998, it was decided to lift the precautionary seizure of the immovable property of the Charbonnages du Maroc (CDM) to ease the sale of some 325 housing units, he added. In the area of environment and sustainable development, a particular interest is given to the problem of mining waste, he said. In the health sector, El Jamai noted the acquisition by ONEE of two ambulances and the organization of medical campaigns for coal miners and their families. Several meetings were recently organized in Jerada by the minister of Energy, Mining and Sustainable Development and the Wali of the Oriental region with representatives of political parties, the civil society, trade unions and the province youth.

Rabat – It’s all what everyone is talking about this week. Since the Moroccan Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance announced the launch of the dirham liberalization reform last Friday, a sense of confusion and apprehension is reigning on the public opinion, despite the continuous reassurance of the authorities.  The flexible exchange rate regime. Such a long name for a reform that is set to change the economic life of Morocco and Moroccans alike. Behind the complex technical jargon of an equally complex reform, lays a myriad of questions every Moroccan wants to ask.  Will this new reform impact Moroccans purchasing power? Will the cost of living increase? Will consumable goods’ prices be more expensive? In short, the fear is palpable. READ ALSO: Bank Al Maghrib Sets Dirham Prices Against US Dollar To answer these questions and clear up the imbroglio on the Dirham liberalization concept, Morocco World News interviewed Hicham Touhami, economist and financial expert.  Morocco uses the dirham for its internal transactions, and the dollar and euro for its external trade. The kingdom’s main foreign currency resources are exports, direct foreign investments, Moroccans living abroad remittances, tourist revenues and external debt. Prior to the launch of the dirham liberalization reform, the value of the Dirham was determined at 40 percent of the dollar and 60 percent of the euro. Since Monday however, this system change, and instead of driving its value from the dollar and euro, the dirham is now defined by the supply and demand law on the currency market. To understand this new exchange rate system better, a look at one of the most fundamental concepts of economics is necessary: Supply and Demand. In any market economy, when the supply of a certain product exceeds its demand, its values drops. If the demand exceeds the supply, then its value rises. In this case, gold is a good example. Since the metal’s supply is rare and its demand is high, its value is quite significant.    Likewise, if the demand on the dirham increases, its value compared to other currencies will increase as well. In other words, if the demand on Moroccan products and imports – such as phosphates and vegetables – rises, then the dirham price on the currency market will rise.  However, if the demand on the dirham drops, then its value will drop as well.   This new reform will have an impact on prices, especially on the prices of imported goods such as oil, gas, wheat, electronics, etc.  In the case of the increase of goods’ prices on the international market, Morocco, with its new floating Dirham, will have to issue a larger amount of currencies to acquire them. Thus, the value of the Dirham will drop, and imported goods prices will rise. The good news is that on the short term, this is unlikely to happen. As Bank Al Maghrib and the Ministry of Finance stressed more than once, this is a gradual transition to a more flexible regime.  The central bank sets the fluctuation band of the dirham, and consequently, its price compared to the dollar and the euro is closely monitored and defined. The change will be barely noticeable on the purchasing power.  On the long term however, as Bank Al Maghrib further expands the fluctuation band till the Dirham is fully liberalized, things will completely change. It’s hard to predict exactly what kind of turn its value will take, but it’s either really good, or really bad.  The value of Moroccans’ living abroad remittances will follow the same logic. If the price of the Dirham drops against the dollar or the euro, then yes, the volume of these remittances will increase.  However, volume doesn’t always mean value. In case of a devaluation of the dirham, you’ll be spending more on a product you used to buy at a lesser price. READ ALSO: How Will Bank Al Maghrib Feed Trading Rooms? But that is not the most important part. In this particular scenario, the real question to ask is: should I be sending this money in the first place?  Here’s where the tricky calculations come. What is the value of these remittances in dirham? What was their value before? And what will be their value in the future?  Unless you are an expert on currency analysis, answering these questions will be hard. A multitude of indexes must be taken into account, mainly the supply and demand system aforementioned.

Rabat – A second gruesome murder targets a Moroccan national in Verona, Italy, this month. After the Moroccan woman who was murdered and decapitated in a chilling ritual crime, a 64-year-old homeless man was burned alive by two Italian teenagers.  Sheltering himself from the winter cold, Ahmed Fdil was taking refuge in a car to sleep when two Italian teengaers, aged 13 and 17, threw burning paper rolls at the vehicle, according to news outlet RT.  The car quickly caught on fire, and the 64-year-old was stuck inside. “To see him die like that was atrocious. To see him burning, he was alive,” Gino Capo, a witness who was trying to rescue Fdil, told the Associated Press agency.  The two teenagers have been quickly identified as the prime suspects of the crime. According to Italian news outlet L’Arena, the boys admitted they took paper rolls from a nearby pizzeria to ignite and throw at the car.  “It was a joke, we didn’t do it on purpose,” Arena quoted one of the suspects. Local authorities immediately ruled out the possibility that the car caught on fire by accident, as they’ve received many reports on months of harassment by a small group of delinquents, who harassed the homeless taking refuge in the area, and attacked anyone trying to defend them.

Rabat – Casablanca’s Court of Appeal sentenced seventeen Hirak protesters to prison terms ranging from 10 months to 3 years after standing accused of “disobedience and unauthorized demonstrations.” In addition, the Spanish news agency EFE reported that the court has also reduced its sentencing against an activist, from two and a half years to one year due to his health concerns. Hundreds of Hirak activists were arrested in a government crackdown on protests held in Al Hoceima province in 2016 and 2017 after the death of Mouhcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was crushed to death in October 2016.  Many other activists are still placed in pre-trial detention including Nasser Zefzafi, one of the most prominent leaders of the Hirak movement. In November 2017, Amnesty International (AI) called on Moroccan authorities to unconditionally free the Hirak Rif protesters and Hamid El Mahdaoui, a Moroccan journalist who was also arrested during a protest in the region. Activists held in pre-detention are facing heavy charges, including “undermining the security of the state and territorial integrity of Morocco” and undermining “citizens’ loyalty to Morocco.”

Rabat – The construction works of the Al-Arjat 1 and 2 prisons in Sale lead to an unprecedented environmental disaster, as thousands of cubic meters of sewers flooded a nearby dam, contaminating the drinking water of more than 9 million people. Moroccan daily Al Massae reported in its Monday issue, that the Bouregreg Water Basin Agency, the public body entrusted with allocating the license to build the two prisons near the Sidi Mohammed bin Abdullah dam, did not respect the minimum regulations of construction works. According to the daily, after hitting a sewer pipe, the company subcontracting the project, resolved to digging makeshift wells and using suction tank trucks to contain the contaminated waters. However, things quickly got out of hands, and the sewers leaked to a nearby dam that distributes drinking water to the Rabat, Sale, Temara, Mohammadia and Casablanca population. The Regreg Environmental Network was the first to ring the alarm bells on this disaster, after a field visit confirmed the pollution of the dam waters. The network revealed that the magnitude of the disaster constitutes a dangerous threat to the health of millions of citizens. The network also denounced the complete silence of the authorities, who allocated the license to the Bouregreg Water Basin Agency without requiring a treatment plan. The newspaper added that this scandal found its way to Parliament after Authenticity and Modernity Party MP Rashid Al Abdi presented a written question to the executive, in which he confirmed the pollution of the water of the Sidi Mohammed bin Abdullah dam, and demanded the disclosure of all the data associated with this file. The MP warned of the repercussions of this pollution on urban dwellers who depend on the dam’s water. “It requires urgent action and measures to address the problem before it becomes a real environmental disaster,” the MP was quoted by Al Massae as saying.

Rabat – The Moroccan Royal Gendarmerie arrested new members of a crime network active in Rabat.  Al Massae reported in its recent edition of January 16 that the swindler syndicate promised their victims job opportunities — based on falsified contacts with the royal family and senior government officials — in exchange for large sums of money. Investigations by the special unit of the gendarmerie revealed that the individuals arrested in Rabat are linked to a married couple of scammers who were arrested last November in Casablanca on similar charges. The husband and wife were brought before the Casablanca Court of First Instance after they enticed their victims through fictitious connections to the royal family and senior officials. They managed to raise nearly MAD 7 billion by ripping off a person who was operating in a business of argan oil-based cosmetics.

Rabat – Morocco will soon launch an international call for tender for the construction of a gigantic industrial complex processing natural gas for a budget of USD 4.6 billion, reported Bloomberg quoting the Minister of Energy, Mines, Water and Sustainable Development, Aziz Rebbah. “This is a project to build an integrated plant to process gas,” Rebbah told Bloomberg, adding that the offer would concern the construction of an industrial unit while the selection of financial and technical consultants was already made.  Morocco, which imports 97 percent of its energy needs, is trying to diversify its energy mix mainly dependent on oil and coal. In this sense, Rebbah recalled that Morocco’s goal is to cover 42 percent of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2020. “We might surpass that target because there are massive investments now,” he said. But can Morocco’s gas industry, one that is mainly financed by foreign investment, sustain such project?  In 2016, over MAD 1.2 billion was spent on Moroccan oil and gas exploration. However, the sector is mainly monopolized by the country’s international E&amp;P partners, who invested ten times more in the industry compared to Morocco’s National Hydrocarbons Office (ONHYM).  In terms of investments, 2016 has certainly not been a conducive year. In its 2016 annual report, the ONHYM revealed that Morocco hardly allocated a MAD 117 million budget to the sector, while its foreign partners invested ten times more, with a MAD 1.117 billion budget. The ONHYM’s strategic approach is simple  and to the point. Instead of funding the sector itself, the office “continues to redouble its efforts to attract other partners and to ensure regular monitoring of its partners as part of the implementation of their commitments,” explained the office in its 2016 annual report.  To date, Morocco counts more than twenty E&amp;P companies which explore the country’s soil in partnership with the ONHYM. Among these international firms are British giants SDX Energy and Sound Energy in the gas exploration sector. These two firms alone are practically monopolizing the gas sector in Morocco. And it’s not only the distribution of interest in exploration permits allocated to these international firms, which allows them 75 percent of the gas wells revenues, that is attracting them to the kingdom.  According to Sound Energy, the formations that make Algeria rich in gas reserves, could soon benefit Morocco. In its Tendrara permit, east of Morocco close to the Algerian borders, the firm explains that its exploration wells could dig up the first gas production of Morocco, which would allow it to become a gas exporting country.  Following completion of a basin study, preliminary estimates from Sound Energy indicate a range of volumes across the entire Tendrara and Meridja permit areas, with a 9 Trillion Cubic Feet low case for gross gas in place and, if all the key elements of the petroleum system’s model are present, an upside case of 31 Trillion Cubic Feet of gross gas in place . These trillion cubic feet of gas discovered by Sound Energy can cover Morocco’s energy needs, estimated at 5 billion cubic meters per year according to the National Plan for Development, for the next 90 years.  At this stage, Sound Energy is beginning to talk about marketing aspects, and pipeline construction plans for this purpose, which will join the Maghreb Europe Pipeline (GME). But while the releases of Sound Energy are quite abundant, they come with the radio silence of the ONHYM and local authorities on the subject.  Several questions remain unanswered: What is the actual level of Morocco’s gas reserves, proven at this stage? How will the marketing be done through the GME? What are the necessary authorizations to transit through this one? Upon contacting Sound Energy’s public relations, their answer is that Sound Energy can not communicate anymore on the subject, inviting Morocco World News to check their press releases.  Sound Energy may have communication restrictions as the firm is listed on the London Stock Exchange. A fact that sustain the possibility that Sound Energy may only be looking for announcing effects through its releases, to boost its stock market. After James Parsons, CEO of Sound Energy announced that his company “could be sitting on a supergiant gas field in Morocco,” the price of Sound Energy shares soared instantly. A source at ONHYM, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Morocco World News that the assessment of 9 trillion cubic feet is already a certainty.  However, “this assessment means the volume of gas at the indicated location. This does not necessarily mean reserves that can be extracted,” adds the source. Currently, the study run by RPS Energy COnsultants Ltd confirms the findings of Sound Energy on the TE-5, TE-6 and TE-7 wells. MWN’s source explains that these first estimations are sufficient to support the Tahadart and Bni Mathar electric power units, which run on gas, and require one billion of cubic meter of gas per year.  “Sound Energy is currently carrying out the necessary evaluation tests to establish the economic feasibility of the production of the discovered reserves,” said the source.  Morocco World News also tried to reach Aziz Rebah, Minister of Energy to confirm whether these discoveries could sustain the construction of a USD 4.6 billion gas production unit, but to no avail.

By Mohamed Amine Rhaz Rabat – Noureddine Amir will hold an exhibition in the temporary exhibition room of the Yves Saint Laurent Museum in Marrakech on February 23-April 22, 2018. “Noureddine Amir is an artist who uses garment to create his work,” said Pierre Bergé, co-founder of the fashion label Yves Saint Laurent, in describing Amir’s work. Bergé first took note of Amir’s talent in Paris in 2014 at the Institut du Monde Arabe. Pierre Bergé immediately decided to dedicate for him an exhibition to the Pierre Bergé-Yves Saint Laurent Foundation in Paris in 2016. Amir’s use of textures, colors and shapes are reminiscent of Amazigh constructions that are seen in the cities of southern North Africa, from Morocco to Egypt. Moulim el Aroussi, philosopher and art critic, describes Amir’s creative process this way: “Wool, raffia, burlap and silk are carefully chosen, then tamed yarn by rope before undergoing a metamorphosis. The materials and fabrics are dyed with henna, dry pomegranate skin or indigo. Noureddine Amir gives life to these materials, pushing codes. The designer, internationally renowned, sublimates the Moroccan craftmanship creation by bringing a real reflection”. In 2018, Noureddine Amir is invited by the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in France to participate in the Haute Couture Fashion Week show in Paris, which will be held from 01 to 05 July. This international event is the highest distinction for a fashion designer. Noureddine Amir is the first Moroccan designer to take part in this international fashion event considered to be one of the most important and highest levels for designers of fashion in the world. The Majorelle Garden Foundation, faithful to its mission of promoting the Moroccan heritage and eager to endorse the work of Noureddine Amir, is pleased to host the creations of the artist in the temporary exhibition room of the museum YVES SAINT LAURENT Marrakech. The room designed according to international museological standards able to host all kinds of exhibitions on fashion, art, contemporary creation, anthropology and botany. The Foundation wishes to pay tribute to the artist who is distinguished by a singular adaptation of Moroccan craftsmanship in his creations. Amir was born in 1967 in Rabat. He is a graduate of the School of Fashion Arts and Techniques in Paris in 1996. He currently lives and works in Marrakech.

Rabat – If you believe in extraterrestrial life you might enjoy this: a group of scientists has analyzed two meteorites found in 1998 and both contain compounds necessary for sustaining life. The analysis was carried out through an international collaboration of scientists at the United States Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. They revealed that the two space rocks, discovered in Morocco and Texas, contain hydrocarbons, acids, and other organic substances. More importantly, however, the meteorites were found to carry water within them, the most essential element for life. The conclusions were published on January 10 in the American journal, Science Advances. In 1998, two rocks from outer space forced their way into Earth’s atmosphere, one hitting  Morocco while the other landing near a basketball court in Texas. (It was not revealed where exactly the meteorite smashed into Morocco.) Twenty years later, scientists are now questioning a possible connection between these meteorites and life on another planet. “This is really the first time we have found abundant organic matter also associated with liquid water that is really crucial to the origin of life and the origin of complex organic compounds in space,” said Queenie Chan, a planetary scientist. Chan, who was the study’s lead author added that the scientists are still looking at the organic substances that “can lead the origin of life,” reported British news outlet, The Express. The  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been taking care of the meteorites since 1998.

Rabat – For BMI Research, Morocco’s new flexible exchange rate regime signals the government’s commitment to become an investment hub in the region, and to diversify trade away from Europe. In its latest economic analysis report, entitled “Exchange Rate Liberalization Reaffirms Long-Term Commitment to Reform,” BMI a Fitch Group firm that provides macroeconomic, industry and financial market analysis, says that Morocco’s new reform is “unlikely to prompt a sharp currency sell-off, limiting near-term risks to growth and inflation.”  According to the research firm, Morocco’s decision to gradually move towards a more flexible exchange rate regime “will offer crucial economic tailwinds in the years ahead.” On January 15, the Ministry of Finance officially widened the band in which the Moroccan dirham trades against a basket of currencies, 60 percent for the euro and 40 percent for the dollar, from ±0.3 percent to ±2.5 percent.  Over a 10 to 15 years time frame, the ministry explained that it will move towards a free floating currency. For BMI, this move is “likely to help the country in its efforts to attract greater investment to the kingdom and diversify trade, while the risks of disorderly depreciation are well contained given the country’s robust financial buffers.” The firm maintains its view “that the risks of disorderly depreciation are limited.” This view was supported by Bank Al Maghrib’s recovery in foreign currency reserves, after the delay of the first phase of the reform initially scheduled for July 2017 resulted in a sharp rush on currency fueled by market speculation against the dirham.  This time around, BMI believes “that investor uncertainty has been contained, with reserves having expanded by 20.6 percent since June 2017.” In December 2017, foreign reserves held by Morocco’s central bank amounted to USD 25.8 billion, representing an estimated 6.9 months of import cover. “This should enable the central bank to comfortably defend the currency in the years ahead,” explains the firm.  Overall, BMI believes that “the gradual reform of the exchange rate regime will have a minimal impact on growth and inflation.” Beyond the reserves held by Bank Al Maghrib, Morocco’s macroeconomic backdrop remains conducive to a gradual and smooth transition towards a more flexible exchange rate.  “A strengthened fiscal position, low inflation levels, and an exchange rate broadly in line with fundamentals support our view that the modest widening in the trading band will have a limited impact on the Moroccan economy in the near term.” adds BMI. Morocco’s move to liberalize its currency prompted public fears of a similar scenario to that of Egypt. In this sense, BMI came to echo Bank Al Maghrib reassurance, stating that “this contrasts with the Egyptian example, where the weak economic backdrop forced the government to sharply devalue its currency in November 2016 amid the Central Bank of Egypt’s inability to defend the peg.” For BMI, this gradual liberalization is in line with Morocco’s economic ambitions, which consist in transforming the economy into an investment and trading hub between Europe and Africa.  In recent year, Morocco has eased capital controls, in a bid to become more attractive for foreign investors. “The liberalization of the dirham will enable further relaxation of these currency controls over the coming years, which will be a boost for investor sentiment,” comments BMI.  At a time when Morocco is seeking to increase exposure to African markets, “this move will also prove positive for trade diversification.”

Madrid – The number of global tourists increased 7 % in 2017, the biggest increase in seven years led by Europe with the lure of the Mediterranean’s sea and sun, the U.N. World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) said Monday. The sharp hike was mostly due to the economic recovery around the world, it added. International tourist arrivals grew by a remarkable 7% in 2017 to reach a total of 1.32 billion, the source pointed out. This strong momentum is expected to continue in 2018 at a rate of 4% to 5%. Led by Mediterranean destinations, Europe recorded extraordinary results for such a large and rather mature region, with 8% more international arrivals than in 2016. Africa consolidated its 2016 rebound with an 8% increase. Asia and the Pacific recorded 6% growth, the Middle East 5% and the Americas 3%. 2017 was characterized by sustained growth in many destinations and a firm recovery in those that suffered decreases in previous years, UNWTO said. Results were partly shaped by the global economic upswing and the robust outbound demand from many traditional and emerging source markets, particularly a rebound in tourism spending from Brazil and the Russian Federation after a few years of declines. ‘International travel continues to grow strongly, consolidating the tourism sector as a key driver in economic development. As the third export sector in the world, tourism is essential for job creation and the prosperity of communities around the world,’ UNWTO secretary-general Zurab Pololikashvili said. ‘Yet as we continue to grow, we must work closer together to ensure this growth benefits every member of every host community, and is in line with the [UNWTO’s] “Sustainable Development Goals.”‘ International tourist arrivals in Europe reached 671 million in 2017, a remarkable 8% increase following a comparatively weaker 2016. Growth was driven by the extraordinary results in Southern and Mediterranean Europe (+13%). Western Europe (+7%). Northern Europe and Central and Eastern Europe (both +5%) also recorded robust growth. Asia and the Pacific (+6%) recorded 324 million international tourist arrivals in 2017. Arrivals in South Asia grew 10%, in Southeast Asia 8% and in Oceania 7%. Arrivals to Northeast Asia increased by 3%. The Americas (+3%) welcomed 207 million international tourist arrivals in 2017, with most destinations enjoying positive results. South America (+7%) led growth, followed by Central America and the Caribbean (both +4%), with the latter showing clear signs of recovery in the aftermath of hurricanes Irma and Maria. In North America (+2%), robust results in Mexico and Canada contrasted with a decrease in the United States, the region’s largest destination. Based on available data for Africa, growth in 2017 is estimated at 8%. The region consolidated its 2016 rebound and reached a record 62 million international arrivals. North Africa posted a strong recovery with arrivals growing by 13%, while in sub-Saharan Africa arrivals increased by 5%. The Middle East (+5%) received 58 million international tourist arrivals in 2017 with sustained growth in some destinations and a strong recovery in others.

Rabat – The luxury Ritz-Carlton hotel, where Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) has locked up about 200 dignitaries and top Saudi officials for more than two months, is expected to reopen in February after it remained closed to the public. “Preparations are underway to open the hotel in February,” an unnamed source was quoted by AFP as saying without providing further details. On its website, the five-star Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh is taking bookings again starting from 14 February. In late November, Saudi Arabia’s strongman ordered the arrest of about 200 dignitaries and top officials as part of anti-corruption crackdown, claiming that over $100 billion had been lost to embezzlement and corruption in the past decades. The massive and unprecedented purge came hours after a Saudi royal decree announced the formation of an anti-corruption commission headed by the Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who promptly ordered a high-profile cabinet reshuffle. To date, the list of detainees is still unknown, but is said to include at least 11 princes, among whom the billionaire prince Al-Walid Bin Talal, who is facing accusations of money laundering, corruption and extortion. The majority of those detained were released after negotiating their exit for very large sums of money, but Bin Talal’s sum is believed to be one of the largest sought by the Saudi authorities after they ordered him to pay at least $6 billion in exchange for his freedom according to the Wall Street Journal.

By Sana Elouazi Rabat – Jawjab Studio’s innovative project “Marokkiates,” continues to break one stereotype after another, by shedding light on controversial subjects like adoption, hijab, sexual harassment and love in a series of videos. This time, the media platform has released its new video in which, Rihab, a Moroccan young woman was given the chance to speak up about her bisexuality in Morocco. “The first time I fell in love, I loved a girl. To make myself clear, I am a bisexual person,” Rihab said. For the young lady, it is quite difficult to describe her sexual orientation to Moroccans as it has no equivalent in Moroccan Darija. Rihab recounts her life of bisexual in Morocco, with its disadvantages, but also its relative advantages, saying that female homosexuality is treated with more tolerance compared with the masculine one. “Homosexuality or bisexuality for girls in Morocco is more socially acceptable than it is for boys. If people see two gay men holding hands or kissing each other on the cheek, everyone will stop. Morocco will just flip up. I know that I have a privilege, for once, for being a girl,” she said. However, Rihab confessed that at the beginning, she hesitated to take part in this video project. But by doing so, she hopes to inspire others to accept and reconcile with their sexual identity and orientation. “When I first contacted you [the director], I was asking myself if I was ready enough to appear before the camera and speak openly about my sexual orientation, knowing all the terrible consequences I might face in the society. But at the end, I think that soon or later, someone has to do it,” Rihab concluded. The video published online, went viral on social media and garnered hundreds of thousands of views. “Marokkiates,” or Moroccan women in Moroccan dialect, is a new project launched by media content platform Jawjab, created and direct by Sonia Terrab last November, who wants to answer the age-old question, who are Moroccan women? In addition to Rihab, several women also appeared in other videos to break the traditional mold by which Moroccan women are perceived. Their raw and touching videos are shedding light on the daily life of Moroccan women from all walks of life.

Rabat – Direct annual economic growth generated by digital payments could contribute up to 3.75 percent to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a city like Casablanca, finds a study conducted by Visa. The global specialist in digital payment estimates that electronic payments could add up to about MAD 8.41 billion to Casablanca’s economy on an annual basis, representing no less than 3.75 percent of its GDP. For VISA, reducing dependency on cash payments has significant immediate and long-term benefits for consumers, businesses, and governments. The study shows that consumers could save up to USD 30 million through digital payments. Banking, sales, and transit operations would be simplified while crime related to theft of cash would also be significantly reduced. As for businesses, the findings of the study show that up to USD 600 million could be saved  by processing incoming and outgoing payments more quickly. They will also earn higher sales revenue as they can expand their customer base to the web. Meanwhile, the government could save up to USD 300 million thanks to a significant increase in tax revenues due to a better traceability of commercial transactions. “The purpose of the study is not to eliminate or denigrate the role of cash, but rather to quantify the benefits and potential costs that would result from a significant increase in the use of digital payments,” says Visa in a statement. The results of the study also indicate that, by 2032, cashless payments could reduce unemployment in the city by 4.3 percent.

By Mohamed Amine Rhaz Rabat – The Yves Saint Laurent Museum in Marrakech (MYSLM)  won the “Best New Public Building” design award from the British magazine Wallpaper*, tying for first place with the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary African Art in Cape Town, South Africa. Wallpaper* annually awards young designers, new designs, and new architecture and released the list of Design Awards 2018 on Thursday, January 11.  “The Moroccan heritage of Yves Saint Laurent is now complete thanks to the opening of this elegant new museum dedicated to his life and his work,” writes the Wallpaper *. The museum opened in October 2017, and is in the same neighborhood as existing commemorations of Yves Saint Laurent in Marrakech. “Located next to the Majorelle Garden, a historic garden saved from redevelopment by the French couturier in 1980, the 4000 square meter museum houses exhibition spaces, a research library, and an auditorium,” the magazine recalls. The architects behind the design, Karl Fournier and Olivier Marty of Paris Studio KO, “opted for a simplified approach, using as much as possible local techniques of brick construction, and placed a circular courtyard in the heart of the building,” details the Wallpaper*. In addition to the South African Museum, MYSLM competed against CoFuFun Station Plaza in Japan, the Australian Islamic Center, and Centro Botín in Spain. This year’s jury included British architect Farshid Moussavi; Danish chefs René and Nadine Redzepi; British designer Jasper Morrison; Dutch artist Daan Roosegaarde; and Ethiopian model Liya Kebede.

Rabat – Abu Dhabi-based energy firm Masdar announced on January 14 the completion of a landmark off-grid power project in Morocco. The project, Morocco Solar Home System (SHS), is set to provide energy to 19,438 homes in more than 1,000 rural towns across  Morocco. The project was a partnership between Masdar and Morocco’s National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE). Aziz Rabbah, Morocco’s Minister of Energy, said in an announcement ceremony held on the sidelines of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW), t that the two countries have made significant achievements in the field of renewable energy.  Rabbah added that these achievements made UAE and Morocco two of the Arab world’s leaders in green energy. The Moroccan official also called for developing partnerships between Morocco, the UAE, and African countries in the field of renewable energies, given its strong potential impact ] in areas such as health and education. According to Masdar, “the solar home systems, along with broader electrification initiatives, will provide 99 percent of rural Morocco with access to [renewable] energy, enhancing the lives of more than 95,000 people that did not previously have access to electricity.” Thani Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Emirati Minister of Climate Change and Environment, has also welcomed the project and Moroccan-Emirati cooperation, noting that “the project mirrors the fruitful cooperation between the two countries as well as the brotherly ties and the historical relations between Morocco and the UAE. The Emirati minister also lauded partnership between ONEE and Masdar, saying that the success of this project will pave the way for other cooperation projects. Abderrahim El Hafidi, acting director general of ONEE called on Emirati companies to invest in renewable energy projects in Morocco, which will have a global budget of USD 30 billion by 2030. The Emirati energy firm will run solar home systems for two years via its Engineering Procurement and Construction contractors. ONEE will replace Masdar for an additional eight years. The homes now provided with the energy will have to contribute an undisclosed small monthly fee.

By Tamba François Koundouno Rabat – In September 2004, upon South AfricaSouth Africa’s decision to recognize Western Sahara as an autonomous and self-determined country, the Kingdom of Morocco recalled its ambassador to Pretoria, engaging the two African giants in a series of implicit hostilities that lasted for over a decade. Recently, after 13 years of cold and unfriendly bilateral terms, Morocco and South Africa have finally agreed to end their diplomatic stalemate. The move was made after King Mohammed VI met his South African counterpart during the 5th summit of the African Union in Abidjan, and is considered by many as part and parcel of Morocco’s recent drift towards a more dynamic and politically conclusive foreign policy, the culmination, in fact, of King Mohammed VI’s Africa agenda. Upon meeting in the Ivorian capital, the two leaders, according to a statement from Morocco’s foreign ministry, affirmed, through this bilateral rapprochement, their common desire to build a more prosperous and interdependent Africa. During a press conference, Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s minister of cooperation and foreign affairs, spoke of Morocco and South Africa as pivotal to the continent’s aspirations for peace, sustainable development, and sounder migration policies. For his part, President Jacob Zuma expressed the same upbeat mood regarding the move’s possible results for Africa. In a recent article on the topic, Reuters quoted the South African president as saying: “Morocco is an African nation and we need to have relations with them.” As promising as this bilateral rapprochement may be, however, it cannot be isolated from Morocco’s recent spectacular return to the African Union, a seat that, in 1984, the Kingdom decided to vacate upon disagreements on policies concerning Western Sahara. In late January 2017, with a crushing majority in favor of Morocco’s demand to join the African Union (39 voices for out of 54), Africa’s leaders expressed their willingness to accept Morocco’s claim over its “natural place”.  Over three decades after withdrawing from the body, Morocco was welcomed by its counterparts as an integral member of a body to whose foundation it had, after all, enormously contributed in 1963. In his speech on that epochal day, King Mohammed VI reaffirmed Morocco’s legitimate place in the body. He noted: “After 32 years of absence, I have finally decided to come back to my family.” Squarely addressing his African counterparts, “his African brothers” as he likes to insist, the king added: “I missed you. I missed my home.” The king’s fraternal tone resounded in the attitudes of many of his counterparts. Speaking to the press after the summit, the Senegalese President Makcy Sall explained: “Even if the Sahara question remains an issue… we can, as a family, continue to try to find solutions. The admission [of Morocco to the AU)] is done, and that’s the most important: today, Morocco is an integral member of the African Union.” Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the then Liberian president, expressed the same welcoming attitude when she tellingly remarked in the aftermath of Morocco’s admission that Africa wants to have one important voice. And for that voice to be vocal and important enough, all African states need to be associated. Pretoria-Rabat rapprochement, then, comes at a time when, more than ever, Africa needs the voices of its giants, its economic torch-bearers. There is no doubt that Morocco and South Africa are two indispensable players in African politics. In a continent mostly mired in social unrests and sluggish economic performances, Pretoria and Rabat stand out as hubs of political stability and sustained economic development. By deciding to open a new diplomatic page, the two countries send signals of their eagerness to claim the important role that is theirs in helping Africa materialize its 2063 agenda of a more prosperous and peaceful continent. In addition to exploring and coordinating their policies on topical issues like peace/security, sustainable economic development, and migration, Rabat-Pretoria rapprochement also heralds the two countries’ asserted aspiration towards more South-South cooperation. The Sahara question might still be, as underlined by a South African news agency, a stumbling block to the sustainability of this bilateral rapprochement. However, as time and again evinced in the King’s public stance on the Sahara question, Morocco has consistently shown its genuine commitment to a doable political solution that benefits both camps. The recent appointment of Nasser Bourita as minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation is, to a number of observers, an important indicator of the Kingdom’s shift towards a more efficient and grounded foreign policy. In the utterly unpredictable waters of international politics, however, whether things will turn out as anticipated is altogether another question. For now, though, one thing remains clear: The Africa 2063 dream of a more prosperous and vocal Africa can only be materialized if leading African economies cooperate on vital topics for the continent. That two African giants decide to resume their diplomatic relations might not bring immediate rewards to the continent; nonetheless, in the long run, it heralds an emboldened and fundamentally inward-looking Africa that wants to have its voice heard on global issues.

Rabat – Saturday morning, Hawaiian citizens received a phone alert warning them of the imminent arrival of a ballistic missile, sparking panic among the population. The threat was quickly denied by the authorities of the archipelago, saying that “someone pressed the wrong button.” Shortly after 8:00 am local time (18:00 GMT), several people, including Democratic House Speaker Tulsi Gabbard, announced on social networks receiving an alert on their phone, via the Amber Alert system of the US Department of Justice. “Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii, seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill,” read the message in capital letters.  The fact that this impromptu notifications comes in a very tense geopolitical context marked by threats of nuclear attack by the North Korean regime against US soil, did not help the matter. Within minutes from receiving the alert, Hawaii Governor David Ige and the local Emergency Management Agency (EMA) each ensured that the US state in the Pacific Ocean was not threatened by any ballistic missile.  The spokesman of the US military command center for the Pacific zone also said that the center had “detected no ballistic missile threat on Hawaii.”  During a briefing, Governor David Ige said that the incident occurred during the relief of an EMA team. As the employees moved in and followed the usual procedure to check that the system was operational “someone pressed the wrong button.” “There is nothing more important than to professionalize and put safeguards to th Amber Alerts system,” he added. Used regularly in the United States for kidnapping alerts, the Amber system is often criticized for its unreliability. “The public must have confidence in our emergency alert system,” the Hawaii governor said in a statement, saying it would “prevent this from happening again.” Witnesses said that the alert messages had also appeared on the television sets and broadcasts on the radio. Hawaii News Now broadcasted images of what it portrayed as students at the University of Hawaii in Manoa, a neighborhood of Honolulu, running for shelter. A Nashville weather presenter, Jim Jaggers, tweeted a picture of his family having taken refuge in a closet after the alert. Hawaii EMA chief Vern Miyagi apologized, as did the governor, at a press conference and took responsibility for the incident. He declined to say whether the officer guilty of sending the false alarm was going to be punished. “This gentleman feels bad,” he said. “He did not do that intentionally.” The governor announced that the activation of the system would now require the presence of two people, instead of only one person as before the fiasco.

Rabat – The Moroccan army is sounding alarm bells over the Polisario’s repeated provocative actions in the buffer zone of Guerguerat. The Moroccan armed forces have once again sent heavy military equipment to deter and, if needed, repel any illegal military actions Polisario may undertake in the region. According to Moroccan newspaper El Massae, the Moroccan army has built an unprecedented security wall along its border with Mauritania. According to El Massae’s source, the royal army has mobilized heavy military equipment in preparation for a large-scale armed operation along the border with Mauritania. Abdel Fattah Al-Warrak, Inspector-General of Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces, gave instructions to raise the state alarm to the fullest extent to respond to any ceasefire violations carried out by Polisario in Guerguerat. Morocco’s reaction to Polisario’s movement was very strong. The military equipment sent recently will reinforce the troops deployed on January 9 in the buffer zone. The Inspector General of the armed forces also ordered the military air bases to raise the state alert to the maximum level. The instructions include the southern air force bases. Moroccan fighter jets are flying over the buffer zone, ready to respond to any provocation. The separatist movement has been setting up illegal checkpoints in the border area between Morocco and Mauritania in recent weeks. The Polisario Front has also deployed its militia and tried to hinder traffic in the buffer zone, defying the UN Security Council and violating the United Nations’ 1991 ceasefire agreement. To avoid further escalation, Morocco called on both the UN and MINURSO to intervene and stop Polisario’s illegal maneuvers in the region. Morocco’s calls were reiterated on January 12 during a talk held between Morocco’s Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit and Head of MINURSO Colin Stewart. During the meeting, Laftit reasserted Morocco’s commitment to supporting MINURSO and UNSG Envoy Kohler Horst in fulfilling their mandate, emphasizing that Polisario’s activities could undermine peace, stability, and security in Guerguerat and hinder the negotiation process to reach a mutually acceptable solution to end the four-decade-long conflict over the Western Sahara.

Rabat – Two Moroccan women died while several others suffered injuries on Monday, January 15 after a stampede at one of the entrance gates of the Ceuta’s crossing border. Moroccan authorities have opened an investigation to determine the circumstances of the incident, local authorities of M’diq-Fnidq prefecture pointed out in a statement. Monday’s stampede was the first incident recorded in 2018.  Three reported stampedes happened in 2017. The first incident occurred on March 28, 2017, when a woman tragically lost her life in a stampede, while the second incident dates back to April 24, when a 50-year old woman died under the same circumstances.  The third tragedy occurred took place on August 28, when two Moroccan women died while others suffered injuries. In June 2017, Spanish authorities made an agreement with the Moroccan government to prevent the so-called human mules from crossing the borders through Ceuta’s El Tarajal II crossing in the same day. According to the agreement reached by the two governments, women are allowed to cross the border only on Mondays and Wednesdays, while men will be permitted on  Tuesdays and Thursdays. The decision was taken after Moroccan authorities asked Ceuta’s government to help decrease pedestrian traffic at the border. In the same month, Spanish parliament discussed a suggestion by Podemos Party to improve the working conditions of Ceuta and Melilla’s  human mules. This proposition has not seen a light yet.  In November 2016, The Association for Human Rights in Andalusia (APHA) condemned the situation of and the daily humiliation that the so-called “human mules” face during the crossing.  Thousands of Moroccan women cross this border post every day to sell their goods in Morocco and provide for themselves. Often, they carry up to 70 kilos and make several round trips during the day and are sometimes treated inhumanely by Spanish authorities in the crossing points.

Rabat – At the opening of the trading rooms this Monday morning, all hands are on deck, anticipating the first hours of the introduction of the dirham flexible exchange rate system. As it stepped into the first phase of a promised gradual transition, Bank Al Maghrib sets a band of MAD 8.9969-9.4524 to the US Dollar.  By the first hours of this Monday morning, the dirham was trading on the market at around 9.2380-2430, according to the data of the Casablanca Stock Exchange. This new rate is one level closer to the top of the MAD/USD ratio. This move to widen the dirham’s trading band is part of Morocco’s plan to liberalize the economy and turn the kingdom into a financial hub. Adjusting the dirham’s peg has been a highly anticipated move for years, but the reform was postponed in 2017 after fears of a devaluation prompted a frenzy rush on currency, causing a plunge in Bank Al Maghrib’s foreign reserves.  This time however, the Moroccan Central Bank in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance decided to adopt a different approach. In hopes to reduce the opportunity for mischief, trading and speculation, they announced the plan, to take effect on Monday, on Friday night. On the eve of the implementation of the reform, expert analysts and bankers reassured that the introduction of this new flexible system could only result in a slight depreciation on the short term.  While the dirham might become more vulnerable if oil and gas, and overall commodity prices rise, Bank Al Maghrib’s well stocked foreign reserves will act as a cushion mattress in case of a sudden devaluation. These stocks cover 5 months and 24 days of imports, allowing a smooth transition into the new system.  Bank Al Maghrib will also intervene through regular auctions for the dollar, and other currencies when it sees the need, according to a circular published over the weekend. This new reform will also help Morocco boost its exports, tourism revenues, as well as Moroccans living abroad remittances, which constitutes Morocco’s main source of foreign currency.  As of this Monday, the dirham’s fluctuation band widened from 0.3 percent to 2.5 percent, allowing a 5 percent range in total.

Rabat – The Moroccan superstar Samira Said, who celebrated her 60th birthday on January 11, received a six-minute video from her fans that brings together her career highlights spanning more than 40 years. “The best thing is to wake up and to find a present that summarizes much of my life.

Rabat – Unreported debt, plunging deficit, subpar revenues, lack of transparency, misuse of the treasury’s special accounts. These are the dysfunctions revealed by the latest report of the Court of Auditors on the execution of the 2016 Finance Act.  The Court of Auditors hits once again, and this time, it’s the Ministry of Finance who’s on the hot spot. In its recent report, Driss Jettou, head of the Court of Auditors, chides the ministry for the unreliable information it communicates to the public and to the government.  For the Court of Auditor, the ministry has an accounting issue. According to the report, the budget deficit communicated by the Ministry of Finance, estimated at MAD 40.6 billion, exclude some of the state’s debts accumulated in 2016. According to the institution headed by Jettou, the ministry omitted the debts the government owes to companies in terms of VAT and corporate tax credits. “The VAT receipts are considered as definitively acquired while the Treasury will be called upon to return part of it to the loaned companies,” states the report. In fact, the court estimates that the state owes MAD 28.6 billion in VAT loans to companies and public entities.  Moreover, besides VAT, the state’s debts vis-à-vis certain public institutions, namely OCP, ADM, ONEE, ONCF, ONDA and RAM, amount to MAD 5.5 billion. These debts relate to corporate tax, commitments made by the executive under contracts, as well as commercial services. In addition, the ministry’s presentation of the overall budget does not provide information on the real weight of taxation: showing only the net tax revenue, it excludes the Value Added Tax, the Corporation Tax and the Income tax.  Miscalculating the budget deficit is not the only dysfunction revealed by the court. The management of the Treasury’s special accounts was also on the agenda, and this time, the Court of Auditors didn’t mince its words. Best known as the “state’s black boxes,” these special accounts are support budgets dedicated to specific operations that cannot be included in the general budget of the state.   The 2015 organic law relating to the Finance Act introduced new management rules destined to better define the field of intervention of these black boxes in order to control their use in certain economic and social government programs. However, the Court of Auditors revealed that a number of these black boxes are used to finance ordinary operations, completely dissociated from their defined purpose. Moreover, in some cases, they are used to finance officials’ salaries, bonuses and allowances, whereas these expenses should be budgeted in ordinary conditions.  Some of these accounts present significant positive balances on a structural level, which according to the court, would require a review of the compliance with their revenues and actual needs.  By the end of 2016, the financial balance totaled MAD 4.3 billion, while the cumulative balance amounted to MAD 122.7 billion.

By Sana Elouazi Rabat – As the social unrest continues to hit several cities in Tunisia, the collectif  Mawjoudin (we exist), decided to lead the fight in its own way by holding in Tunisia’s capital, the first LGBT film festival that addresses issues of gender identity and non-normative sexual orientation. The Tunisian association Mawjoudin was created in 2014 to fight against gender and sexual orientation discrimination. “Mawjoudin LGBT Film Festival,” which is due on January 15 to 18, will not be only a first of its kind in the North African country, but also a step forward to confront Tunisia’s penal code that prohibits homosexuality which is punishable by three years of imprisonment. Judges have repeatedly forced Tunisian young people, who are prosecuted for homosexuality to submit to an anal test, a practice denounced as “cruel” and “inhuman” by human rights NGOs. “This festival, provides a better understanding of gender, non-normative sexuality and sexual orientation,” one of the coordinators of the event and spokesperson of the association told HuffPost Tunisia. The event comes only after few weeks of the launch of the first LGBT radio station, Shams Radio, to “promote tolerance in Tunisia where homosexuality is illegal.” “There is nothing out there that talks about the LGBTQ community honestly. This gives people a way to defend our community, and we need this for Tunisia and the Middle East,” Bouhdid Belhedi, the 25-year-old executive director of Shams was quoted by Reuters as saying. “We have to change the mentality of Tunisian society, they refuse anyone who is different from the rest of society,” said Belhedi. “I hope this will make a difference and create more tolerance. That is why we are here,” the executive director added. The radio’s team has received more than 4,000 hate messages and threats on social media following its opening, but they “refused to stop their efforts.”

Rabat – Rainfalls are finally here, watering the lands and easing the spirits. However, this winter season came with an unusual and intense cold wave, predicting several repercussions on the 2018 agricultural season. While the recent rainfalls are appeasing the fears of a devastating drought, the heavy snowfall that touched the majority of the mountainous regions of the country are raising some serious concerns among farmers. This intense cold wave could have dire consequences on this agriculture season: a decline in yield, lack of cattle feeds, and lethal hail for blooming crops. In recent weeks, the National Meteorologic Direction announced temperatures that are generally below normal, with heavy snowfall affecting the High and Middle Atlas from 900 meters above sea level, with temperatures as low as -5 degrees Celsius.  The center of the country, with its mountainous population accustomed to very harsh winters, has been most affected by this cold wave that has been felt since Friday. Several roads have been cut due to snow, according to the Ministry of Transport, aggravating the isolation of the villages at high altitude. The cold also affects, to a lesser extent, the Atlantic coast. In Rabat, a hailstorm hit the city on Monday, while an impressive waterspout was observed Sunday off the administrative capital. The heavy rains are greeted with some relief by farmers who were worried about the risk of drought, yet this cold snap remains a problem for the agricultural sector. Crops, even those grown in greenhouses, are strongly affected by temperatures that are not conducive to plant growth or the maturation of fruits and vegetables. Following the arrival of the long-awaited rains, it is now the unusual cold that worries the actors of the agricultural sector. Cereal production has already registered a certain decline during the month of December due to weather conditions.

Rabat – Will Fez have its own aeronautic industrial zone? According to head of government Saad Eddine El Otmani, this dream might become reality sooner than expected.  During a meeting with elected officials, economic operators and the representatives of civil society of the Fes-Meknes region, El Otmani said that the government “is currently reflecting on the subject in collaboration with the Ministries of Industry, Investment, Finance as well as Education and the officials of the region.”  The head of government added that the land destined for the implementation of this project is already available, expressing his wish to see this first of its kind project in the region come to fruition, in addition to an aeronautical training school. “All the parties concerned by this project will work together to make it come true, and convince investors for its importance and urgency,” El Othmani stated.  The head of the Moroccan Executive further stressed the need to provide economic incentives to attract investors to certain regions, adding that such objective requires continuous efforts.  In recent years, Morocco has been making  significant strides in the aeronautic sector, one of the most demanding branches of industry in terms of investment, knowledge and especially technological mastery. The establishment in Morocco of several heavyweights of this sector such as Bombardier, Eads, Boeing, Safran and others, confirms the leading place of Morocco on the world map of the aerospace industry. In 2017, exports of the Moroccan aviation industry reached over MAD 9.78 billion against 8.42 billion a year earlier, an increase of 16.3 percent, according to the foreign exchange office . To significantly increase its value added and improve its integration rate set at 17 percent in 2015, Morocco launched in November 2017 two new ecosystems in this sector (engines and composites) to complement and strengthen those installed in 2015 as part of the implementation of the Industry Acceleration Plan. By 2020, these industrial ecosystems are expected to create 23,000 jobs, increase export turnover to MAD 16 billion, raise the local integration rate to 35 percent and attract more than 100 new operators.

Rabat – Spanish maritime authorities announced Saturday, January 13  that they had rescued 150 migrants, who were attempting to reach the Eldorado through six precarious boats. The first group of migrants were rescued off south Spain and north Morocco. Two groups of 54 and 55 were transferred to the Andalusian port of Malaga, according to Agence France-Presse. Thirty-two migrants were landed in Almeria, 200 kilometer east of Malaga, said a spokesman for Maritime Security. Thirteen other migrants were rescued off the Strait of Gibraltar by the Spanish coast-guard in coordination with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, Frontex.

Rabat – Morocco’s national team defeated its Mauritanian counterpart 4-0 at the opening match of the African Nations Championship (CHAN 2018), which opened on Saturday in Casablanca. Morocco’s goals were all netted in the second half of the game after an unsuccessful first half. Though the Moroccan team dominated most of the first half, its attempts to net the first goal of the tournament were unsuccessful. The Moroccan players had to wait until the 65th minute of the match to unlock Mauritania’s defense and defeat its goalkeeper, who was instrumental in aborting many clear scoring attempts from the Moroccan side. Morocco’s key forward Ayoub El Kaabi scored the team’s first goal. Morocco’s team first goal forced the Mauritanian side to look for the equalizer, leaving plenty of space for the Moroccan players who succeeded in scoring three more goals. Ismael El Haddad of Wydad of Casablanca netted the second goal for Morocco only seven minutes after the first goal. El Kaabi, who also plays for Renaissance Sportive de Berkane club, scored his second goal for Morocco at the 80-minute of the match, while the Wydad of Casablanca star Achraf Bencherki netted the fourth goal for Morocco at 90th-minute mark. The match was marked by the attendance of Morocco’s Crown Prince, Moulay El Hassan. The opening ceremony was also attended by Ahmad Ahmad, President of African Football Confederation (CAF) and the President of the Moroccan Football Federation, Fouzi Lekjaa.

Rabat – United Nations Secretary-General Envoy, Horst Kohler aims to promote collaboration with African leaders to reach a mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara.   On Friday, Kohler held talks with AU Commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, about the territorial dispute pitting Morocco against the Algeria-backed Polisario Front.  Kohler aims, through this strategy, to provide the African Union with an opportunity to propose solutions that would help the UN find a lasting solution to the conflict.  The UNSG Envoy also met on Friday with Rwanda’s President, Paul Kagame, who will officially take over the chairmanship of the African Union on January 28.  During his visit to Rwanda, Kagame and Kohler “discussed a wide range of topics and shared ideas on how the AU can partner with the UN in bringing lasting peace in Western Sahara,” reported the Rwandan news outlet, New Times. Rwanda’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Louise Mushikiwabo, told local reporters after the meeting that the United Nations believes that African leaders can play an eminent role “in addressing the Western Sahara issue.” Both Kagame and Kohler discussed ways the African Nations can contribute to reviving the UN political process with a view to helping the parties to reach a mutually acceptable solution in line with the relevant UN resolutions adopted since 2007.  Kohler’s meetings with the African leaders came four days after his official meeting with the EU’s High Representative Federica Mogherini, in Brussels on January 9. During the meeting, the two high officials “exchanged views on the relaunch of the UN peace process for Western Sahara,” according to an official statement by the European Union External Action. “Mogherini stressed the EU’s resolute support for the UN’s renewed efforts, in the spirit of recent UNSC resolutions and in particular the latest UNSC resolution of 28 April 2017, to help bring to a conclusion this long-standing conflict and to achieve a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution” for the region.
Kohler, who is the former President of the Federal Republic of Germany, was appointed as Personal Envoy for Western Sahara by the US Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, on August 16. Horst succeeded Christopher Ross of the US, who completed his tasks as UNSG Envoy on April 30, 2017. With more than 35 years of experience in government and international organizations, Kohler occupied many important positions, including Managing Directory of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London.

By Sana Elouazi Rabat – Turki Al-Cheikh, the sports advisor to the royal cabinet of Saudi Arabia, made earlier this week, offensive statements against Morocco after the Saudi football player Fahad Al Mawlid visited Marrakech. In a television interview broadcast by Rotana Khaliji, Al-Sheikh, decried Al Mawlid’s visit to Marrakech, insinuating that he went there for the purpose of “sex tourism.” “I have a problem with Fahad Al Mawlid, we sent you to Manchester United and you had the training, but why the layover through Marrakech? why? I want to know what is the situation,” Al-Sheikh said amid the laughter of the guests. Al-Shaikh’s controversial statements caused a wave of uproar among Moroccans, who demanded an immediate apology for what they considered an insult to them and to their beloved city. ????? ???????? #????_??_?????:
???? ????? ?? ??? ?????? ?????? ????????? ???? ??????? ??????#????_?????? pic.twitter.com/Docr4MrJSc — ?????? ???? (@korarotana) January 8, 2018  The hashtag Saudi_Minister_Insults_Marrakech, went viral on social media and many Moroccans took to their Twitter accounts to express their denunciation of Al-Cheikh claims, while many others recalled the history of the ancient city of Morocco. In December 2016, another video of Saudi stand-up comedian Samer El Hazmi sparked an outrage among Moroccans after he insinuated that Morocco was a destination for “sex tourism.” The comedian explained how Saudis view Morocco: “People are divided into two groups when you tell them that you traveled to Morocco. The first group supports you and views traveling to Morocco as a victory. While, the second group rebukes you by saying astonishingly, ‘Oh, you traveled to Morocco [as it is a shameful country].’” “Morocco is a Muslim country, but Saudis are not eager to discover Morocco – they already know about it as a country for sex tourism,” he said, adding that Morocco is well-known to Saudis for its “pretty girls.” When approached by the media for a comment, the comedian claimed that “Moroccans misunderstood his show,” adding that he meant to imply that “Saudis who visit Morocco are the ones to blame.”

Rabat – The President of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), Ahmad Ahmad, has once again expressed his full support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. On the eve of 2018 African Nations Championship, which will kick off in Morocco today, CAF top official reiterated his “unwavering support” for Morocco’s bid to host the world tournament in 2026. In a press conference held in Casablanca, Ahmad said “There is no room for discussions. AS CAF president, is an obligation for me to support Morocco’s bid.” CAF president added that it is unfortunate that “ a continent with an impressive football history hosted the world cup only once throughout history.” The only African country, which won the right to host FIFA’s World Cup was South Africa. The southernmost African country was a host for the tournament in 2010. Morocco submitted its candidacy to host the 2026 World Cup on August 11, 2017. A few days later, Ahmad called on heads of football confederation in Africa to show support for Morocco’s bid. CAF president said that it is a must for Africans to show “clear” and “massive” support for Morocco as it is determined to become the second African country to host the football event. “Ahmad Ahmad, takes note of this decision and calls on all the African national associations to join their forces for a frank and massive support for this candidature”. Ahmad revealed that presidents of six regional unions have already pledged support for Morocco’s bid. The bid for 2026 is going to be the fifth for Morocco, after 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2010. Morocco’s will be competing with common candidature of US-Mexico and CANADA. Earlier this month, Fouzi Lekjaa, President of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation and 3rd vice president of CAF emphasized that Morocco has the potential to beat the North American bid.

Rabat – Friday night, local media all brandished the same headline: the Dirham liberalization is finally here. After months of confusion, wild speculations and exchanged accusations, the reform of the Moroccan exchange-rate system is due this Monday.  But away from the technical jargon, what does this reform really mean? What will change? And how will Bank Al Maghrib intervene from now on in the trading market?   The current fixed exchange-rate system means that Bank Al Maghrib meets all the operators’ foreign exchange needs, with no limit and no price adjustment. Currently, the Dirham has a small fluctuation band of 0.3 percent upwards or downwards, so it is moving in a 0.6 percent corridor at which the Central Bank intervenes to buy or sell currency.  Starting Monday, however, the corridor will be expanded to 5 percent, meaning a fluctuation band of ± 2.5 percent. Currently, Moroccan trading rooms are mainly acting as liquidity providers for their customers. They identify the needs in foreign currency and cover them, either with their currency stocks, or by acquiring financing from Bank Al Maghrib.  Trading rooms can also structure foreign exchange risk hedging products for clients and trade on their own behalf in the foreign exchange market. However, this activity is limited to low volumes compared to volumes achieved by major liquidity providers or market makers. Starting Monday, this deal will change. Contrary to what most believe, and what is widely reported by local media, Bank Al Maghrib is not a conservative institution. The central bank has a rather liberal philosophy which it respects in all its areas of intervention, without falling into the extravagance and excessiveness of the West. It always prefers to let the market regulate itself and only intervene as a last resort.  This is the case on the interbank market and soon on the participative interbank market, but also on what will be known from now on as the new Moroccan interbank currency market.  By pursuing this liberal philosophy, the Central Bank is always trying to push operators to develop their own tools, to be independent and resilient. In the “classic” interbank market, banks loan each other every day, refinancing and optimizing their resources in order to make their credit activity profitable. However, when it comes to currency, the banks have for the moment a unilateral approach with their customers on the one hand, and the Central Bank, on the other hand. Currency movements between banks are very limited, and BAM is there to provide when needed.  Once the Dirham is liberalized, Bank Al-Maghrib will initially set variation thresholds which, at their approach, provoke a systematic intervention on its part. But as long as these thresholds are respected, and there is no significant pressure on the price of the Dirham against other currencies, the market will simply self-regulate. At the beginning of the reform, Bank Al-Maghrib will continue to intervene daily by feeding the foreign exchange operators. The objective is to allow a smooth transition without volatility to reassure operators during the transition from one exchange rate to another. In a second phase, the central bank will limit its interventions to more or less a single auction per week and in a single currency that will surely be the Dollar. Banks wishing to refinance their foreign currency reserve from the Central Bank outside these deadlines, for one-off operations, may do so but at prohibitive prices to avoid making it a habit. This funnel approach will gradually allow the market to self-regulate. Concretely, the banks will most of the time have to refinance themselves in foreign currency, which will sign the birth of an interbank foreign exchange market in Morocco with all what this implies in terms of expectations, pricing and risk management.  The volumes in this market will be theoretically proportional to the needs of the real economy in the context of import/export, currency transfers, outbound or inbound dividends, but nothing prevents the development of a speculative secondary activity. The Dirham liberalization is a project that really stresses the role of the foreign exchange trader in the banks’ market activity. This job requires a good sense of ingenuity and anticipation, especially to value the price of currencies and their future developments. Finally, the Central Bank through one-off operations will exceptionally serve the banking institutions in cases of absolute necessity at high rates. As a result, traders will learn how to manage their foreign exchange needs and, most importantly, how to trade between one another to avoid making Bank Al-Maghrib’s intervention a habit.

Rabat – The US Department of State issued on Wednesday, January 10 a Travel Advisories system to alert its citizens of the world’s most (and least) dangerous countries. The department ranked Morocco in category 1: the safest for US travelers. The state department advised its citizens, willing or wishing to visit Morocco to “exercise normal precautions” in the North African country. The executive department advises the US travelers to be extra cautious in Algeria or avoiding it because of high terrorist threats. The department advised its citizens to ten war zones: Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen. These ten zones are ranked level four; “Do Not Travel.” The US department ranked North Korea in level four: “Do Not Travel,” with restriction that US law interdicts US travelers to use their passports in the country. Only three other MENA countries are in the same category as Morocco: the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain.  Tunisia, Russia and Turkey are ranked in category 3: “Reconsidering the Trave.” Category 2, which advised the US travelers to be extra cautious, includes France, Spain, UK, Italy, Germany due to terrorist attacks occurred in these regions in recent years. Five states in the US neighbor, Mexico have the sternest “do not travel” under the US department system. The Mexican states ranked in level four are Tamaulipas on the US border, Michoacán, Colima, Sinaloa, Guerrero.  The number of Morocco’s foreign visitors in Morocco increases every year. In July 2017, Morocco’s Ministry of Tourism and Air Transport said that the number of American tourists has increased by 27 percent during the first six months of 2017.  The increase of foreign visitors in the North African country was underpinned by the surge of German tourists in the visit to Morocco, which marked the increase of 12 percent, according to the ministry. The visits of Dutch arrivals increased by 8 percent and Spanish by 7 percent.

Taliouine – Today, January 12, 2018, the Amazigh (Berber) people all over the world, particularly in the North African countries, are celebrating the Amazigh New Year 2968, known as “Yennayer.” Yennayer is the first day of the agrarian calendar year used since ancient times by Amazigh people throughout North Africa. Even though Tamazight (Berber) is an official language in Morocco, the Amazigh New Year has not yet been recognized officially in Morocco as a national holiday. However, most Moroccans do not miss this occasion to celebrate and exchange wishes and prayers. Although Amazigh New Year is celebrated by many Moroccans every January 12 since a long time ago, only a few people realize the symbolic and historic implications of the day. Under different names, Yennayer is celebrated by both Arabic- and Tamazight-speaking communities. The Arabic-speaking community in old cities referred to the traditional event as “Haguza” or “Am Alfilahi” (the agrarian year). However, the Amazigh people, especially those living in the southeast of Morocco, call it “Id Suggas” (the night of the year). “Id Suggas” is a traditional festivity on the eve of the Amazigh New Year. Like many people in the cities and villages of Morocco, inhabitants of Taliouine, a mountainous town in the region of Agadir, hold collective dinners, parties, and lectures to celebrate Yennayer. The Association of Culture and Sport in the small village of Ighri, a few kilometers from Taliouine, hosted Amazigh activist Ibrahim El Hiyani to speak about the history and cultural symbols of the Amazigh New Year.  Elhiyani told Morocco World News that the Amazigh New Year “is associated with the god of fertility and agriculture.” In his lecture, the activist said that the history of Yennayer traces back to 950 BC, when the Amazigh nation defeated the pharaoh’s army and entered Egypt during the reign of the pharaohs. “Under the leadership of ‘Chachanq’ known also as ‘Cheshung,’ the Amazigh people were able to establish a new monarchy that ruled from Libya to Egypt. This glorious victory marked the beginning of the Amazigh date,” El Hiyanni added. To celebrate Yennayer, people all over Morocco prepare various succulent dishes. In the Souss region, people prepare “irkmen,” wheat with dry fava beans simmered in the form of thick soup. Others serve “tagola,” a meal based on corn kernels cooked and mixed with butter and accompanied with ghee, argan oil, and honey.  For the people in the southeast, couscous with seven vegetables remains the luxurious dish to serve. “This Amazigh New year coincides with the flowering of almond trees, which makes it a good starting point for men and women alike to begin their agricultural activities,” Abdelmajid Nidouisaadan, a community activist told MWN. Nidouisaadan wishes the Amazigh New Year was a public holiday in Morocco. “Since the Hijri and the Gregorian new years are official holidays in Morocco, why not the Amazigh New Year?” he wondered. There are also many traditions that accompany the food that the Amazigh prepare for Yennayer. Besides dancing and singing special songs of love, fertility, and prosperity to welcome a new agrarian year, the Amazigh people, especially those in rural areas, find a chance to socialize, exchange food, and seek reconciliation with those with whom they have misunderstandings. In different parts of the southeast, people prepare a special dish for the occasion, usually couscous with many vegetables. Back to the years of my childhood, I recall how my mother never missed this event. Having no Amazigh calendar at home, I appreciated it very much and wondered how my parents and other neighborhoods knew the exact time of the New Year. One of the most symbolic practices in the southeast, though less practiced, is explained by Lahcen Amokrane, an Amazigh activist who spoke with MWN on the occasion of the Amazigh New Year. “The Amazigh people of the south east prepare couscous for the night of January 12, every year, as a cultural ritual celebrating ‘Id Suggas.’ Traditionally, they put ‘ighs,’ a seed of dates or “alluz,” a piece of almond, as some prefer to do recently, in couscous. The person who finds this seed of dates or piece of almonds is to be entrusted with the keys of ‘lakhzin,’ a room reserved for storing the family’s food, and that person is believed to be ‘blessed’ throughout the whole year,” he told Morocco World News. For these happy moments, I, as well as MWN, wish our dear readers a happy new year full of joy and prosperity. In the Amazigh language, I tell you, “Assuggas Amaynu ighudan, s Tudert Nek A winu!”

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – Stephen K. Bannon, the former top aide to US President Donald Trump, stepped down from his position as chairman of right-wing news outlet Breitbart News on Tuesday. Although Bannon left the White House in August, the recent release of Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, a scathing account of the current administration, revealed several inflammatory defamatory quotes from Bannon directed at Trump and Trump’s immediate family members.  Of his former boss’ sanity, Bannon reportedly said “He’s not going to make it… he’s lost his stuff” while describing Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, as “dumb as a brick.” He also said of Donald “Don” Junior, “They’re going to crack [him] like an egg on national TV” with regard to an ongoing investigation into potential coordination by the Trump team and the Russians to besmirch Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and influence the election’s outcome.  It was during this very campaign that Bannon made a national name for himself, although he had been the chairman of Breitbart News since 2012. However, his meteoric rise from fringe conservative commentator to senior advisor to the US President has proven to mirror the speed of his fall from the Republican party’s good graces.  In the Alabama senate race last December, Bannon backed conservative candidate Roy Moore, who ultimately lost to his liberal rival, Doug Jones. This is the first time a Democrat has won a senate seat in the deeply conservative state of Alabama in 25 years.  A humiliating defeat for the Republican Party, the upset in Alabama’s election was seen to signal the waning influence of Bannon’s particular brand of populism, economic nationalism, and anti-immigrant rhetoric, which had resonated widely with the American public one year earlier during the presidential race.  However, before the loss in Alabama and his indelible contributions to Fire and Fury, a rift was already growing between Bannon and his major allies within the Republican establishment such as hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, is a minority stakeholder in Breitbart News and recently said, “my family and I have not communicated with Steve Bannon in many months and have provided no financial support to his political agenda, nor do we support his recent actions and statements.” Breitbart chief executive Larry Solov, in a statement online, promised followers a “smooth and orderly transition,” although it remains to be seen what a post-Bannon Breitbart will sound like. On Tuesday, Trump met with a bipartisan team in the nation’s capital to discuss comprehensive immigration reform and amnesty for undocumented immigrants, of which Bannon was an outspoken critic. However, with Bannon now blacklisted, his critics will say that there is now one fewer obstacle between America’s immigrants and reform.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – French president Emmanuel Macron ended 2017 in a televised address gesturing to his plans for the coming year, including changes to toughen the country’s laws on immigration and asylum.  On December 31, the telegenic Macron promised to deliver “humanity and efficiency” with France’s asylum policy.  The French parliament is expected to debate the proposed legislation in the first quarter of the year. Such measures would harden the existing laws by making it easier to expel undocumented immigrants more quickly and in greater numbers. Critics of the proposed changes are concerned about an expedited asylum process and worry that such legal changes might also buttress anti-immigrant sentiments across France.  During France’s presidential election last May, nearly 40 percent of the vote went to the far-right nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen, who campaigned on pledges to stop immigration to France.    Already in parts of southern France, new railway brigades of the police border force have been vested with the power to stop and search passengers’ identity papers, hoping to control undocumented immigrants suspected of traversing the country aboard its nexus of internal railways.   In an interview with the BBC, Pascal Mailhos, the prefect of the Occitanie region of southwestern France, spoke favorably of the new security measures introduced by the state.   “Obviously, the action we are taking against illegal immigration goes beyond just our borders and requires a lot of coordination with our neighbors” and that “this new brigade add[s] another element in the mission against this type of criminality.” However, activists and volunteers have questioned the consequences of such measures, fearing they will create greater desperation on the part of migrants. As temperatures plummet and conditions deteriorate, many are concerned that such measures may cause migrants to take more drastic measures to find transport. In Calais, a port city located on France’s northern coast, there have been three hit-and-runs in as many weeks, where migrants have been found dead or injured on the side of the motorway. The most recent of these tragedies occurred on Tuesday. As Annie Gavrilescu, the regional head of France’s branch of Help Refugees, wrote in the Huffington Post, “there is nothing we can do when refugees become so desperate.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Economy and Finance will launch a flexible exchange rate system for dirham currency on Monday, January 12, according to a statement issued on Friday by Morocco’s Ministry of Finance and Economy. The decision made by the ministry concerns a new exchange rate regime where the parity of the dirham is determined within a band of fluctuation of ± 2.5 percent against ±0.3 percent currently, compared to a central rate set by Bank Al Maghrib on the basis of a currency basket composed of the EUR and USD by up to 60 percent and 40 percent respectively. Morocco’s Bank Al Maghrib “will continue to intervene on the foreign exchange market to ensure its liquidity,” added the statement. The decision is undertaken under conditions marked by the solidity of the financial sector and the consolidation of macroeconomic bases, including an appropriate level of foreign exchange reserves and a controlled inflation. The ministry added that the reform will also be supported by the structural and sectoral reforms. The decision taken by the ministry is aimed at strengthening the resilience of the national economy to exogenous shocks in order to support its competitiveness and to improve its level of growth, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The exchange rate regime reform will also support the structural changes taking place in the Moroccan economy, particularly in terms of diversification, openness and integration into the global economy, concluded the statement.

By Sana Elouazi Rabat – Tunisian authorities announced on Friday the arrest of 773 people for their involvement in acts of “vandalism, looting and theft” since the outbreak of protests last Monday following new austerity measures resulting from the 2018 Finance bill, which is expected to increase the cost of living. The spokesman for the Tunisian interior ministry Khalifa Chibani told local media outlets that the detainees were placed in police custody on the orders of the Public Prosecutor’s Office. Among those arrested in several parts of the country, Chibani counted 16 takfirists, alleged to be involved in vandalism and incitement. Two of them appeared to be “dangerous” and were detained after consultations with the prosecution. “They are involved in the rampage in Nefza, a locality in southern Tunisia, a police station, a municipality and a recipe of finances,” Chibani told the ShemsFM radio. “These acts have nothing to do with peaceful demonstrations. They are planned, not spontaneous and benefit only terrorism and contraband. We have reliable information that terrorist groups were trying to take advantage of the situation to introduce weapons, ” Chibani added. He pointed out that the age of more than 31.5 percent of people arrested varies between 15 and 20 years and more than 50 percent of them are between 20 and 30 years old. Only one percent are over 40 years old. The official pointed out that 97 security agents were injured and some 88 police vehicles were damaged during the clashes with protesters. A Tunisian citizen told Reuter that police fired tear gas in two districts of the capital on Tuesday and fired gas at a crowd storming a supermarket, but no casualties were reported. According to the state news agency TAP, one protester was killed on Monday after clashes broke out in Tebourba, a town 40 km (25 miles) west of Tunis. Since the government announced that it would increase the price of gas, oil, cars, phone and internet services, as well as hotel accommodation and other items in the 2018 budget, many protests erupted across the country last week. The 2018 budget also raises customs duties on scores of imported goods, such as cosmetics and agricultural products. Protesters took to the street to demand a revision of the 2018 finance bill as well as a better social coverage for needy families and a tangible plan to fight corruption.

By Lauren Peterson Fez – The immemorial walls of the Fez medina could not deaden the symphony resounding from the ALIF Riad Friday evening.  Often raw, rumbling, and pulsating, only to dip into crude, windless echoes, the sometimes discordant sounds described something tribal and arcane, yet modern enough to lend itself to familiarity.    Responsible for the concert is Rwanda-born and Belgium-raised Aurelie Lierman, who showcased her unique fusion of “radio art, vocal art, and composition” on day two of the third annual Fez Gathering, an international art convention held in the Fez’s historic medina.  Lierman shapes her unique sound by piecing together personally recorded sound-bytes from rural and urban contemporary East-Africa. The result, she calls “Afrique Concrète.” According to Lierman, the focus of her style is not bound to the sound-bytes dictating its rhythm. In fact, her decision to colligate old Africa with new Africa plays into the more narrative aspects of her music. Her songs, as she says, tell stories.  “Storytelling doesn’t have to one line,” Lierman stated Friday. “It can go in different directions. It can be a labyrinth, like Fes.”  When asked how she imagines her music would transfer to visuals, Lierman refuted the premise, arguing instead that her music is not meant to be seen, and is best absorbed sonically; it is, after all, music.  “No image. I really love cinema, and am often inspired by images…but I think the sound will touch you deeper…I think sound is the most primitive emotion,” Lierman stated. Recently, Lierman began developing “a set of site specific installations and electro acoustic compositions” for Dutch band Slagwerk Den Haag, which premieres this month.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – Once again, the US President Donald Trump placed himself at odds with United States’ news outlets, this time disputing his alleged use of the slur “shithole countries” to describe developing nations during an Oval Office meeting on Thursday. High-ranking United States Senator Richard “Dick” Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, claims that the president used the insult “repeatedly” to refer to developing nations; Donald Trump patently denies making any such remark. While discussing immigration behind closed doors, Trump allegedly maligned African nations as “shithole[s]” and openly questioned why the US allows immigration from the continent, Haiti, and El Salvador without courting more immigrants from nations like Norway. The White House issued a statement on Thursday which did not dispute the allegation. However, early on Friday Trump took to Twitter to deny saying “anything derogatory,” placing his account of events at odds with those published by National Public Radio, the Washington Post, the New York Times, Politico, and the Wall Street Journal, all quoting witnesses or sources briefed on the meeting shortly afterward.   “The language used by me…was tough, but this was not the language used,” retorted the US President. The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made – a big setback for DACA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2018  A number of foreign governments and dignitaries have joined a growing chorus, expressing their displeasure at the president’s alleged comments. The African Union said it was “frankly alarmed” and the UN human rights spokesman Rupert Colville said the comments, “I’m sorry but there is no other word for this but racist.” The meeting in question took place to discuss the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, allowing undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children to seek temporary protection, which Trump proposes to scrap entirely. Senators Durbin and Arizona Republican Jeff Flake have drafted a bill to reform the existing program, a plan now eclipsed by a new spat between the press and the president.

Rabat – The third annual “Fez Gathering” kicked off January 11 in Fez Medina. The four days event is initiated by a network of Moroccan artists based in Fez, who seek to bring together researchers and artists from around the world to “explore the role and potential of the arts in a modern world.” Themed “Africa for the Africans,” the event aspires to debate around the role of arts in Africa, and whether the arts can lead to new social, regional and national policies. The artistic expressions to be discussed during the gathering are “Photography and Documentary Films in Africa,” “Sufism, Religion, Rituals and Their Artistic Expressions in Africa,” “Contemporary Art in Africa” and “Language Exchange in Africa.” Organized in partnership with the French Institute of Fez, the Regional Council of Tourism, Fez American Language Center and Cervantes Institute, this event will see the organization of conferences, exhibitions and music concerts. The event’s organizers see that “like Fez, Morocco today assumes a role of modern bridge between countries, continents, politics and cultures.” “The development, history, arts and culture of Fez and Morocco are inseparable from those of other countries in Africa, the Mediterranean and Southern Europe,” Chennafi said, adding that “constant interaction is essential for mutual development.” Among the artists invited to participate are art curator, Yvon Langue and photographer M’hammed Kilito, whose past projects have focused on the identifying hallmarks of daily Moroccan life. Also on the roster is artist and Islamic calligrapher Mohamed Charkaoui, visual artist Mohamed Arejdal, and Professor at Université Internationale de Rabat, Meriem El Haitami.

Rabat – United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is calling on the world to celebrate migration and acknowledge its benefits. The UN top official believes that the UN’s “Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration,” which will be adopted in Morocco in December this year, provides an opportunity to “maximize the benefits of migration.” In “Making Migration Work for All,” a report published Thursday, Guterres urges the world’s leaders and governments to embrace and promote foreign labor. “The basic challenge before us is to maximize the benefits of migration rather than obsess about minimizing risks.”   Speaking in defense of migration, Guterres said that it is “beneficial both for migrants and host communities in economic and social terms – our overarching task is to broaden the opportunities that migration offers to us all.” The Global Compact on migration will be adopted in the intergovernmental conference on international migration to be held in Morocco in December 2018. Guterres referred to migration as a “positive global phenomenon” that strengthens “economic growth, reduces inequalities, connects diverse societies and helps us ride the demographic waves of population growth and decline.” Guterres hailed the world’s migrants as agents of “international development – both by their work as well as through remittances back to their home countries,” valued at “nearly $600 billion, three times all development aid.” Guterres added that the majority of migrants “live and work legally.” Speaking about the migrants seeking a better life in foreign countries, Guterres said that “ a “desperate majority” risks their lives to reach countries, where they face suspicion and abuse. On December 24, the UN announced that Morocco will host the 2018 Intergovernmental Conference on International Migration. The North African country will also host the 11th Global Forum on Migration and Development to be co-chaired by Morocco and Germany. The symposium will also take place in December 2018. The Global Compact for Migration aims to address humanitarian, human rights-related, and developmental aspects of international migration, according to International Organization for Migration (IOM). It also aims to protect the safety and dignity for all migrants, regardless of their documents’ status. The compact vows to ease pressures on countries that welcome and host refugees; build the self-reliance of refugees; expand access to resettlement in developing countries and other complementary pathways; and foster conditions that enable refugees voluntarily to return to their home countries. In recent years, Morocco has established itself as a country of destination rather than simply a transit country for refugees and migrants traveling to Europe. In October 2017, UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner for Protection Volker Turk told Morocco World News that while “Morocco remains a transit country for refugees and migrants, it is also fast becoming a country of destination.” He added that the North African country is attempting to offer protection to refugees under its National Policy on Immigration and Asylum (NPIA) which was launched in September 2013, under the instructions of King Mohammed VI. Morocco has also set up a regularization campaign for migrants and refugees aiming to settle in the country.

By Sana Elouazi Rabat – Israeli authorities have just approved more than 1,100 new settler housing units in the West Bank, Peace Now NGO, which monitors settlement building, said in a statement on Thursday. Approvals were given on Wednesday by a defense ministry committee authorized to oversee settlement construction. “The government is attempting to destroy the possibility of a two-state solution and the prospects of peace,” Peace Now NGO said. “This agenda runs counter to Israel’s national interest, as well as the interests of everyone who seeks a peaceful future in the region,” the statement adds. The 1,122 housing units approved on Wednesday are at various stages in the process. Hagit Ofran of Peace Now told AFP that three hundred and fifty-two homes received final approval, while the others are at an earlier stage in the process. Following this decision, the European Union called on Israel on Thursday, to reconsider its plans to build new homes in the West Bank, recalling that any settlement activity is “illegal” and likely to undermine the viability of the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “The position of the European Union on Israeli settlement construction and related activities is clear and has not changed; any settlement activity is illegal under international law and undermines the viability of the two-state solution and the prospect of lasting peace, “said an EU spokesperson for Foreign Affairs in a statement. “The EU expects the Israeli authorities to reconsider and revoke these decisions,” the statement adds. Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, lambasted Israel’s move and said that it “continues with its plan to bury all the chances of a political settlement.” Erekat added that Israel is being “encouraged” by US President Donald Trump especially after he formally declared Jerusalem as Israel’s capital,  move that has been condemned by the international community as unproductive, dangerous, and against international law.

By Sana Elouazi Rabat – Podemos, the Spanish opposition party, has asked King Felipe VI of Spain to intervene in the case of Spanish activist Helena Maleno. Maleno, 47, has been based in Tangiers for more than 15 years but she appeared in a court on Wednesday accused of facilitating illegal immigration.  “We want to make a request to the King of Spain, who, as we know, gets along with the Moroccan authorities, to intervene so that Helena returns to her daily work as an activist,” said Noelia Vera, deputy of Unidos Podemos, cited by the Spanish daily Eldiario. “We think it’s an outrage, and we show our love to Helena Maleno, a human rights activist who has been denouncing human rights violations in the Mediterranean for many years,” Vera added.  Spanish police began an investigation into Maleno’s activities in 2012, but the case against her was filed by the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Spanish Court last April, as they found no evidence of any criminal offense.  According to Maleno, Spanish police passed their investigation on to the Moroccan authorities without specifying that it had been classified in Spain. The hearing came to court on  Wednesday because of an initial report by Spanish police suspecting Maleno of working for a “criminal organization due to her telling rescue workers where migrants were, which aided their transfer to Spanish coasts.” “Trying to save the lives of people crossing the Mediterranean is not a crime,” Maleno said. Many human rights organizations and personalities expressed their support for Maleno. A petition against the case has been launched and signed by more than 200 leading Spanish figures.   “We show our total solidarity with and support for Helena Maleno,” the petition reads, for “the defense of the right to life” and against “the criminalization” of her work.  By receiving calls from people crossing the Mediterranean or from their relatives, Maleno, who works now for the NGO Caminando Fronteras, was able to pass on their locations to the Spanish coastguard in order to accomplish their rescue operations.  According to Miguel Jesus Zea, head coastguard for the southern Spanish area of Almeria, Maleno has helped rescue “at least 10,000 people” off the coast of Almeria.  “I find it incredible that a person who saved so many lives, who gives so much, be probed,” Zea said.

By Sana Elouazi Rabat – The doors have opened on the world’s first car showroom exclusively for women in Saudi Arabia.  The showroom is located in Jeddah,  but more outlets are expected to open soon. The historic opening comes only a few months after a Royal Decree lifting on the ban on women driving in the Kingdom and six months before they will actually be able to climb behind the wheel. An all-female salesforce will help the new clients  The Royal Decree was issued in September 2016 lifting the ban on women driving in the KSA. Three months later, it was confirmed that women will be able to drive motorbikes, vans and trucks eventually. The move is part of a vast programme of reform which is being masterminded by the Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. His Vision 2030 is pushing through a huge programme of social and economic reforms to KSA which is largely welcomed both at home and abroad – but is also being met by some discontent in ultra-conservative circles.  The ban, which has been in place for decades, had become the source of much national and international controversy. Women in the KSA have protested against it for years and many had taken to the streets and even been imprisoned for defying the sexist policy.  The lifting of the ban, like all the reforms being made by the Crown Prince, has not been met with universal support in KSA. Sheikh Saad Al Hijiri sparked outrage when he said that women should not be allowed to drive because their brains were smaller than men’s.  In Saudi Arabia, the unemployment rate is very high among women due to their total dependence on male drivers. By allowing millions of new motorists to take the wheels, Riyadh’s decision could have a significant impact on the Saudi economy, aiming at reducing the country’s dependence on oil. Despite lifting the gender-based road restrictions, Saudi Arabia continues to have one of the most discriminatory laws against women, who are still severely restricted and must live under the supervision of a male guardian in their families in order to study, travel. or even to receive hospital treatment.

Rabat – France’s Observatory of Geopolitical Studies (OEG)  released a statement on Thursday, denouncing the legal opinion issued by the European Union Court of Justice’s Advocate General Melchior Wathelet in which he claimed that fisheries agreement concluded between EU and Morocco was “invalid.” While Wathelet said that the fisheries agreement concluded between the EU and Morocco is “invalid, ” OEG believes that the legal advisor is not aware of the historical context of the Western Sahara.   “At no time, Wathelet examines the historical context of the decolonization of the formerly non-autonomous territory and he does not attach himself to the present legal status of the territory,” said the statement issued by Charles Saint-Prot, a French geopolitician and director of the OEG. For OEG, the EU’s legal advisor used his own reading of the political context and has neglected economic development in Morocco’s Southern provinces that benefit the region’s local people, which is an essential element. Wathelet’s opinions, thus, are incompatible with the strategic stake that represents the future of relations between Morocco and the EU, according to the statement. The French body added that the court can discuss an international law only with circumspection, and  “It would be justified to refrain from any interpretation of international law.” The observatory added that the European Court of Justice ECJ)  has no universal jurisdiction. “ It is notable that Wathelet’s conclusions and the possible preliminary  ruling of the court will have no effect on [ the fisheries agreements between the EU and Morocco] in the short terms.”  OEG added that Wathelet’s opinion came just a few days after the EU and Morocco’s announcement to renew the fisheries agreements. The OEG said that his legal opinion will not be considered immediately as it “ignores or avoids several objections based on international laws.” The Observatory of Geopolitical Studies said that the European Council believes that ECJ does not have the competences to rule on the validity of the fisheries agreement: negotiated, ratified, and entered into force between the parties. “The agreement in question is not purely and simply an act of the institutions of the Union.” The statement added that international law has, in theory, a limited number of causes of the nullity of a treaty and in practice the invalidity of a treaty has rarely been found.  These conclusions for the OEG came due to “international law’s system sources and the lack of a hierarchy of norms in the international order, which has been invoked with caution and never to invalidate a treaty.” OEG added that Wathelet gives priority to the EU treaties and the ensuing constitutional principles resulting therefrom the international treaty, which for Morocco has been properly ratified.

Rabat – Another relaxed photograph of King Mohammed VI has caused a flutter on social media – the second this week. This time the king is seen wearing casual clothes, photographed with a young Moroccan couple in Paris. In the photo, King Mohammed VI is wearing casual clothes without the royal protocol. Like many pictures and selfies that were taken with him, the sovereign, as usual, responds overwhelmingly to the call of Moroccan citizens and foreigners wanting to document their face to face meeting with him In recent years, Moroccans living abroad have become accustomed to seeing the Moroccan monarch taking a stroll wherever he goes in casual clothes. Whether it is Paris, New York, Abu-Dhabi, Dakar, Tunis, etc., the Moroccan monarch does not hesitate to take pictures with Moroccan citizens who bump into him by coincidence.

Washington D.C.- After years of absence from the halls of the African Union (AU), Morocco has moved from the periphery to the center of Africa’s political and economic stages. This impressive reversal is due in large part to Morocco’s King Mohammed VI relentless efforts to reach out to African leaders in the four corners of the continent.  Nonetheless, Nasser Bourita, the “fairly new” Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation has been a key figure behind the recent victories of the Moroccan diplomacy in Africa and some parts of Latin America. The arrival of Mr. Bourita at the helm of the most prestigious ministry in the government has boosted the morale in the rank and file of the Moroccan diplomatic machine and jump-started a wave of “house cleaning” in some embassies.  The new top diplomat, who ascended the echelon of his organization on merit and without a hint of nepotism, is a product of Moroccan public schools and not the customary French elitist “Grandes Écoles.” This career diplomat, who grasps King Mohammed VI’s strategy in Africa, used his knowledge and experience to create a new diplomatic momentum for his nation in “unfriendly territories”  like Latin America. He has moved Morocco from isolation into a leadership role in key capitals. While a lot of work remains to be done to win over a universal endorsement of Morocco’s rights to Western Sahara, Rabat seems to be heading in the right direction for the first time. In fact, when the Monarch first embarked on his diplomatic-economic push into Africa, the Moroccan diplomacy struggled to keep up with King Mohammed’s fruitful trips and had few setbacks until Mr. Bourita showed up. This obvious turnaround and recent victories in high profile diplomatic skirmishes with Algeria earned the former Ambassador a Royal endorsement. Mr. Bourita’s big achievement and major asset have been his ability to keep the usual Palace foreign policy players in check.  Since his arrival at the Foreign Ministry, Nasser seems to have the full confidence of the King and complete control of the diplomatic corps. Reports, albeit unconfirmed, of Bourita’s efforts to dismiss some “well connected” inept ambassadors are good signs for the Moroccan diplomacy. Bourita avoids the high-profile foreign policy approach for a more low-intensity contact with an economic message and a humanitarian touch. This pitch seems to work for the Kingdom and fits with his personality. Many African nations that voted in the past for the self-declared Sahrawi Republic to the join the AU have welcomed Moroccan investments and commitments, and renounced their support for the Algeria backed plan for the Westerns Sahara. In the 1970’s, 80’s and 90’s Moroccan diplomats were viewed as arrogant in Africa and clueless in Latin America. But, the ongoing transformations within the diplomatic corps and King Mohammed’s personal involvement in overseeing the Kingdom’s foreign policy have changed these perceptions to the better and made the relations with sub-Saharan African nations especially as close as it has been recently. Unlike his predecessors, the Moroccan diplomat understands and considers the goals of his African counterparts making his efforts sincerer and far more effective. However, the challenge remains the ability of Moroccan ambassadors to capitalize on these recent gains and expand this winning formula in Latin America where the Algerian diplomacy is well entrenched. As Morocco solidify its presence in African and extend its reach in Latin America, Mr. Bourita and his staff need to ready and formulate a long-term diplomatic strategy for these two key regions. On the domestic front, the Moroccan public hopes to see his potential distractors and “competitors” stay at bay, giving him a chance to continue his great work.

Rabat – After Morocco’s Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM) announced its intention to request a bill to withdraw Moroccan citizenship from Moroccan Jews living in the occupied Palestinian territories, PAM Secretary General Ilyas El Omari met Paris Thursday January 4 with his counterpart in the Federation of Moroccan Jews in France, Simon Skira, as confirmed by Skira to Morocco World News. This move is part of a strategy to “reassure Moroccan Jews who have reportedly expressed their anger over PAM’s announcement which is aimed at opposing US President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the disputed region. After the meeting, Skira asserted that El Omari will back down from submitting the bill to the parliament, but did not reveal any further details of their meeting. El Omari had first raised the notion of revoking the citizenship of Moroccans living in Israeli settlements Moroccan Jews had opposed PAM’s suggested bill, calling it “reckless” and urging King Mohammed VI to block the party’s proposal. PAM’s request was allegedly supported by the members of other political parties who oppose normalizing relations with Israel. Aziza Chagaf, a PAM member, said that the decision to submit the controversial bill discussed during a meeting with former Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal during his visit to Rabat on December 26, 2017, at the request of the Justice and Development Party (PJD).

Are you currently contemplating purchasing a brand-new home or a pre-owned home? You’re not the only one. Unfortunately, there are many hurdles that you’ll be forced to jump through in order to purchase a new home. First and foremost, you’ll need to search the market and find the overall best property for your family. Then, you’ll need to gather enough money to actually purchase the home. Mortgage can be expensive and you’ll need to make sure that the costs fit into your budget. Within this guide, you will discover tips for getting the lowest mortgage possible. Fixed Or Adjustable When scouring through the mortgage market, you will quickly discover that there are two options at your disposal. You can opt for a fixed rate or an adjustable rate. They are exactly as they sound. The fixed rate will require you to pay a specific amount for the life of the mortgage. With the adjustable rate, the rate can actually increase and decrease over the life of the mortgage. Initially, the adjustable rate mortgage will usually be cheaper in the beginning. However, the price will usually climb rapidly after the introductory period. With that being said, most people will be better off with a fixed-rate mortgage. Paying For Points There is also an opportunity to pay for points to decrease your mortgage. The point is actually an upfront fee. Therefore, it might not be suitable for everyone. Generally, it will be one-percent of the total mortgage. By paying a point, you will be able to lower the interest rate by a specific amount. In general, it is possible to pay one-percent to decrease the rate by 0.125%. If you intend to keep the mortgage for a long period of time, it is best to go ahead and pay for points. However, if you intend to get the mortgage paid off rapidly, you’re better off not paying for points. Search For Mortgage Brokers While you’re at it, you’ll want to do your best to find the overall best mortgage broker Mississauga has to offer. The truth of the matter is that each broker is different. Some are better than others and the prices can vary significantly. With that being said, you should definitely spend a little time carefully researching the mortgage brokers in your area. By doing so, there is a possibility that you’ll be able to find a more favorable price. Look For Special Programs There are tons of special programs for new homebuyers. If you’ve served in the army, you may be eligible for a VA loan. This is a specific type of loan that is made available to active military and veterans. You should also consider taking out an FHA or USDA loan. The possibilities are endless. Always do your best to consider each and every one of your options. By doing so, you may find that one of the alternatives might be cheaper for you. Putting Down More Before buying a new home and taking out a mortgage, you should spend more time accumulating extra money. In the beginning, you may feel that paying more down in the beginning is a waste, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. In reality, paying a bigger down paying will prove to be enormously beneficial in the long run. By putting more down, you’ll actually be able to decrease your overall interest rate. A lower down payment will almost always equate to a higher interest rate and vice versa. With that being said, you should also save as much as possible before buying the home. Maximize the down payment to keep the interest rate to the absolute minimum! Sponsored Content

Rabat – Cutaneous leishmaniosis, or the oriental sore, a parasitic disease caused by the bite of a single-celled parasite, is spreading at an alarming pace across Southern Morocco, reported the French Press Agency (AFP). More than 3,000 cases have been recorded in recent months in the region of Drâa-Tafilalet, according to Bouhout Souad, head of” Parasitic Diseases” division at the Epidemiology Directorate of the Ministry of Health. “We are observing an increase in the number of patients affected in this region, to the extent that it became a public health problem,” Dr Souad was quoted by AFP as saying, warning that other regions are affected to “lesser degrees”. The World Health Organization explains that the disease produces ulcers on the exposed parts of the body, such as the face, arms and legs. There may be a large number of lesions – sometimes up to 200 – which can cause serious disability. When the ulcers heal, they invariably leave permanent scars, which are often the cause of serious social prejudice. The parasites that cause the disease are themselves infected by certain animals that serve as “natural reservoirs.”  In southern Morocco, these animals are brown rats. “The unfavorable hygienic conditions lead to the proliferation of the vector of the disease,” says Souad. “There is a worrying spread, with sometimes several cases recorded in the same household,” a local was quoted by AFP as saying. According to the same source awareness and treatment campaigns are underway in Drâa-Tafilalet region, with more than 200,000 people examined since last October, particularly in schools. The Ministry of Health said that it sent teams to conduct sensitization sessions on “the importance of neighborhood cleanliness.” However, “the medical team is understaffed and people here are asking for a real mobilization from the government, with the involvement of all relevant departments,” according to a local actor. According to the WHO, there are between 700,000 and 1 million new cases of leishmaniosis recorded worldwide each year, with “a small proportion of infected people” developing the disease.

Rabat – United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has sent a letter to Polisario’s leader Ibrahim Ghali, urging him to ease tension in the restricted buffer zone of Guerguerat. Following a series of illegal maneuvers carried out by the separatist front in the buffer zone, the UN Chief addressed a strong message to Polisario, stressing the importance of stability in the buffer zone to avoid further escalation. Stéphane Dujarric, a UN spokesperson affirmed on Tuesday during a press briefing that Guterres ordered the separatist front to comply with international regulations and to “avoid any operation likely to change status quo of that area. Cuba’s news agency, Agencia de Noticias Latinoamerica S.A, reported that the UN top official reiterated his steady commitment to relaunch the political process of dialogue between Morocco and Polisario over the Western Sahara conflict. Guterres’ new warning message came after his official statement issued on Saturday, January 6, where he expressed his deep concern over rising tensions near Guerguerat. Guterres statement and his new letter followed a series of illegal maneuvers carried out by Polisario in the region. Members of the Polisario Front have been blocking trucks registered in Morocco from crossing the Moroccan-Mauritanian border. Polisario has also threatened participants of Africa Eco-Rally from crossing the border, which led to the UN’s strong reactions and response. The separatist group has been defying the 1991 ceasefire and military agreements signed between Morocco and the front. Polisario has also refused to comply with the orders of the UN chief.  On January 6, Guterres said that “regular civilian and commercial traffic should not be obstructed and no action should be taken, which may constitute a change to the status quo of the buffer strip.” To respond to Polisario’s actions, Morocco’s  Inspector General of the Royal Armed Forces and Captain of the Southern Military zone issued orders to raise the state alert to the maximum level. Helicopters and troops were sent to the restricted zone in response to Polisario’s repeated armed maneuvers in the region. The separatist provocative actions were continuously repeated since December 2017. Morocco has also contacted the MINURSO and the UN chief to denounce the presence of the armed elements of the separatist group, asking the mission to urge Polisario to withdraw from the region.

Rabat – Moroccan authorities have announced the arrest of a 35-year-old French national of Algerian origin wanted by the International Police Organization for his involvement in an attempted murder and drug trafficking charges. The suspect was arrested on January 10, owing to collaboration between Morocco’s Judicial Police (BNPJ), General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST), General Directorate for National Security (DGSN) and International Police. The arrest came in response to an arrest warrant issued by the French judicial authorities against the suspect for being involved in an attempted murder and in drug trafficking crimes in 2016. Following investigations carried out by BNPJ members, the suspect was arrested in possession of a driving license and a forged French passport, featuring his photo and forged identification information. Moroccan authorities have not revealed where the suspect was arrested. The defendant was placed in custody as investigations are underway to help the police learn more details about the suspect and the forged documents. The arrest came in the wake of the strategies carried out by Morocco’s security forces to strengthen international security cooperation mechanisms aimed at combating all forms of cross-border organized crimes. Moroccan police have managed to help forces of the Interpol to arrest several wanted suspects in 2017. In October 2017, Marrakech authorities arrested an individual who was the subject of an international search warrant for drug trafficking. In the same month, Tangier’s security forces arrested an American pedophile in the city. The man in question was a subject of a search warrant by the Interpol for his involvement in “sexual exploitation of minors.”

New Delhi – Developments with respect to the Western Sahara of Morocco call for attention. First, Morocco has strongly condemned provocative moves by the separatist Polisario Front in the restricted area of Guerguerat in south-west Morocco. Guerguerat lies near Morocco’s border with Mauritania. It is considered as a buffer zone by the 1991 UN ceasefire agreement between Morocco and Polisario. However, on two separate occasions this week Polisario security elements entered the Guerguerat buffer zone. On the first instance, they turned back two rally car drivers transiting the area. This is indeed worrisome as Polisario actions come just days before the Monaco-Dakar rally is to pass through the region. On the second occasion, the Polisario’s so-called civilian police entered the buffer zone, again violating the UN agreement. The Guerguerat buffer zone is claimed by the Polisario as part of its artificial Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. It will be recalled that since the 1970s the Polisario – backed primarily by Algeria – has waged an armed struggle against Morocco for the creation of an independent Sahrawi state in the Moroccan Sahara. The latter, however, has long held historical ties of allegiance to the Moroccan monarchy. Hence, even when 19th century European colonial powers hived off the Moroccan Sahara and made it a Spanish exclave – Morocco proper was a French protectorate – the Sahara and Morocco could never be truly divided in spirit. This was best exemplified by the historic speech of Morocco’s late King Mohammed V – the grandfather of current King Mohammed VI – at M’hamid al-Ghizlan in 1958. At that significant occasion, the late King had publicly declared to the representatives of the Sahrawi tribal sheikhs, who had swore allegiance to him, that he would continue to work to recover the Sahara in keeping with Morocco’s historical rights. This was at a time when the Moroccan Sahara was still under Spanish control, no country other than Morocco had moved for the liberation of the region, and even before the Sahara question was tabled in the UN in 1963. The M’hamid al-Ghizlan speech incontrovertibly proves Morocco’s historical, legal and solemn ties to the Sahara. History aside, since the Sahara’s effective reunification with Morocco in 1975 following the historic Green March, Morocco has left no stone unturned to develop the region. It has heavily invested in physical infrastructure in the Sahara, made the region a tax free zone, boosted agriculture, aquaculture and other economic sectors under a separate regional budget, and empowered local governance through the election of local municipal and regional councils. Additionally, Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for the Sahara submitted to the UN in 2007 remains the most credible option to resolve the dispute over the region once and for all. Under the plan, the Sahara region will benefit from massive devolution of powers to local elected bodies that will independently manage all affairs within their jurisdiction under the overall sovereignty of Morocco. In fact, the South American nation of Chile saw its National Congress vote overwhelmingly in favour of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for the Western Sahara this week. This adds to the growing list of countries that are slowing coming around to Morocco’s position on the Sahara. And with Morocco returning to the African Union in January 2017, the Polisario is certainly feeling the heat. For, Morocco has decided to abandon its empty chair policy and assertively counter Polisario’s propaganda in all international forums. As part of this new approach, Morocco wants the Sahara to serve as its bridge to continental Africa. And it is in this context that Polisario’s moves in Guerguerat become clear. The separatist group wants to block Morocco’s only land access to continental Africa, thereby creating a physical and psychological barrier to Morocco’s growing engagement with Africa. But this strategy of Polisario is bound to fail. This is because Morocco today has not only returned to the African institutional family but has also invested heavily in shared prosperity with sister African nations. Morocco is the top investor in sub-Saharan African nations and the second biggest investor on the continent. Besides, Morocco is at the forefront of addressing African challenges in food security, sustainable development, climate change, poverty alleviation, energy security, healthcare and universal education. It is also in the lead in fighting transnational terrorism, viewing this as a problem of economic deprivation and religious extremism. Thus, there is no way Morocco can be separated from Africa. Morocco is and always was African. And it is meaningless for anyone to try and challenge this fact.

Rabat – Global economic growth will reach 3.1 percent in 2018 and slightly moderate later, the World Bank said in a new report. Global economic growth will edge up to 3.1% in 2018 after a much stronger than expected 2017, driven by the recovery in investment, manufacturing and trade, the World Bank pointed out. It will be the first time since the financial crisis that growth is operating at its full potential. The forecast is better than what the bank was expecting in its previous assessment last June. “The broad-base recovery in global growth is encouraging but this is no time for complacency,” said World Bank President Jim Yong Kim. “This is a great opportunity to invest in human and physical capital. If policy makers around the world focus on these key investments, they can increase their countries’ productivity, boost workforce participation, and move closer to the goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting prosperity,” he added.

Rabat – Chile’s Senate adopted, on Tuesday in Valparaiso, a resolution in support of Morocco’s autonomy initiative, less than a week after the National Congress approved a similar resolution. According to this resolution, Chilean Senators call on the Government of Chile, as a member of the United Nations, “to support and commit to the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1754, adopted on April 30, 2007.” The Chilean Senate lauded the pre-eminence of Western Sahara autonomy initiative presented by Morocco, which the United Nations and the international community regard as “a serious and credible initiative” for the final settlement of this regional dispute. The broad autonomy plan proposed by Morocco to settle the Western Sahara dispute leads to a “win-win situation” and enables the Sahara’s population to manage their affairs in a democratic, inclusive and participatory manner, Chilean senators said. Since its presentation to the United Nations on April 10, 2007, Morocco’s autonomy proposal for the Sahara region has been approved by the Security Council, which has unanimously adopted resolutions 1754, 1783 and 1813 and deemed the initiative as “serious and credible,” they added. The resolution notes that the Moroccan autonomy plan has been supported by several countries, which described the Moroccan initiative as an opportunity to advance in the settlement of an issue that is running for more than thirty years, taking into account the “inapplicability of the referendum.” Last Wednesday, Chilean National Congress approved a resolution in support of the Moroccan autonomy initiative. Chilean MPs said that the Moroccan initiative is “a serious and credible effort, which will undoubtedly enable the Sahara population to exercise their right to self-determination, by democratically managing their own affairs through legislative, executive and judicial bodies with exclusive powers under the sovereignty of Morocco.”

Rabat – While Hirak activists have repeatedly claimed that they were tortured in prison, during their most recent  hearing, the public prosecutor has once again refuted their allegations for being “unfounded.”  On January 9, during a tumultuous hearing,  the Defense Committee once again claimed that the detainees were exposed to mistreatment and torture in contempt of the prosecutor’s dismissal, who referred to their claims as  “unfounded”.  “Allegations of torture of the defendants are baseless,” he said. The Public Prosecutor’s office assured that they did not find any evidence of violence committed against the detainees.  Physical examinations and medical reports confirm the absence of any trace of violence, he continued. Further, he said that the wiretaps, searches and seizures and interrogations of the Hirak detainees were conducted in strict compliance with the law. The hearing was once again postponed, as the tension between the defense and the public prosecutor rises. The detainees will be heard next Friday in the Casablanca Court of Appeal.

Sana Elouazi Rabat – Fatna El Khiel, the State Secretary for Housing and India’s ambassador to Morocco, Kheya Bhattacharya, met on Tuesday, January 9.  In the spirit of both governments’ desire to work more closely together, the two officials discussed new ways to cooperate relating to the housing sector, reported the state news agency MAP.  At the end of discussions, El Khiel said that the meeting provided the opportunity to discuss the means to develop the housing sector and share the experience of both countries in the areas of social housing and the fight against the inadequate and poor housing.   “A joint working group will be set up to focus on the main areas of collaboration between Moroccan and Indian departments in charge of the housing sector, with the aim of strengthening bilateral cooperation in this field,” commented the Secretary of State. Bhattacharya said that the meeting reflects  the ongoing desire to strengthen South-South cooperation and recalled the visit paid by King Mohammed VI to India in October 2015, which was of a “great importance.”  There are existing partnerships between Morocco and India which include the Centre for Excellence in Information Technology in Casablanca,  a joint initiative between the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing in India and the Institut National des Postes et Télécommunications (INPT) in Morocco. A Memorandum of Understanding for Cooperation on Broadcasting was signed between the two countries during the 5th India Morocco Joint Commission Meeting (JCM) held in Rabat, in May 2017.  In 2015-16 the bilateral trade between Morocco and India was USD 1.42 billion.

By Sana Elouazi Rabat – The legal advisor of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) said in a legal opinion issued on Wednesday that fisheries agreement concluded between the EU and Morocco was “invalid” because “it applies to Western Sahara and its adjacent waters.” “The EU has failed to fulfill its obligation not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from the breach, by Morocco, of the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination and also not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation,” Melchior Wathelet said in a statement. Wathelet said the EU had also “not put in place the safeguards necessary to ensure that the exploitation of the natural resources of Western Sahara is for the benefit of the people of that territory.” “The fisheries exploitation by the EU of the waters adjacent to Western Sahara established and implemented by the contested acts does not respect the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination,” Wathelet said. The legal advisor’s opinion came after a British pro-Polisario group filed a complaint to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) claiming that companies operating on the coast of the Sahara must negotiate with Tindouf, not Rabat. In late May, the European Commission for Fisheries reaffirmed that Western Sahara and its waters are included in the fisheries agreement between the European Union and Morocco. The decision came in response to a question by 13 members of the European Parliament, who called into question the applicability of the agreement in the Sahara, calling into doubt the consent of the “people of Western Sahara, as well as the legality of the agreement.” “The waters off the coast of Western Sahara are included in the fisheries agreement between the Union and Morocco,” said Karmenu Vella, the European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and fisheries, in his response to the MPs’ questions in June 2017. The official also noted that the agreement contains “provisions to ensure that the agreement fully respects international law” and serves the interests of all the populations concerned.

Rabat – Hundreds of residents in the Fez medina took to the streets today in anger at the recent attacks on little children in the city. They were demonstrating outside the Court of Appeal where a 57-year-old French man appeared on charges of rape and sexual assault on two girls aged 11 and 14.  A week ago, the defendant was arrested in a tailor’s workshop in the Medina after allegedly committing sexual acts on the two little girls.  The girls spoke to Moroccan news outlet Alyaoum24 earlier this week. In a recorded interview posted on social media, the girls claim that the 57-year-old defendant had been grooming them with money and toys, promising gifts from France. Their identities are concealed in the film as they are filmed from behind.  “When I refused to comply with his orders, he threatened me and told me that he would slaughter my family,” said one of the girls in the moving interview.    The 57-year old French passport holder was arrested on January 1. Asmae Kabba,  President of the Moroccan Association against Violence and Homelessness, is following the case closely and her organization is providing support to the victims. Kabba confirmed to MWN that during the first hearing on January 5, the defendant admitted to drugging and raping the two young girls. According to Kabba, the defendant has been in Morocco for approximately 18 months and has been introducing himself to locals in Fez as a tourist.   The case has understandably attracted a large volume of media attention in recent days. MWN has been in touch with Khadija Hajoubi, another social activist and  President of the Nour Caravan association for Friendship and Social Development in Fez, who also represents the victims. Hajoubi informed MWN that the Frenchman was detained and questioned by police in mid-2016 for suspected sexual assault. Hajoubi added that an unidentified social activist saw the suspect with two little girls in the medina. After suspecting him, the activist called the tourist police. The defendant, however, was released after the parents of the minor girls affirmed that the French suspect is someone they know. On January 1, a barber in Makhfia caught the French man red-handed as he was committing sexual assaults against two little girls. The man told Alyaoum24 that when he looked through to the tailoring workshop he was shocked at what he saw. He added that there were two girls inside the workshop, while another girl was outside to make sure that nobody will caught them. Kabba told MWN that the residents of Makhfia, the neighborhood where the recent rape incident took place, suspected something unusual about the suspect. She said, quoting resident’s claims, that the defendant was treating the neighborhood’s children in a “special  way.” Nobody, however, could prove it until he was not caught red-handed. The barber, who gave his testimonies to both police and Al Yaoum24 said that when he performed the Isha prayer on January 1, he saw a girl waiting in front of the tailoring workshop, where the suspect committed the sexual assault against the two little girls. He said that he talked to the girl and asked her what she was doing there and suddenly she left the place in a hurry. As the barber looked through the workshop’s window, he saw the French tourist as he was committing sexual assaults against two little girls. “ I  closed the door of the workshop with a lock and called on people to come and see what was happening and I called the police.”  Both Kabba and Hajoubi are working to support the girls financially. The social activists are also counseling the girls to overcome the incidents. Kabba has also hired a psychologist for the girls. Doctor Wissal El Mghari, told Morocco World News that the victims are not aware of what happened to them. “ They are not aware of  what they have been through and the danger they were exposed to by this man.” MWN has also received a copy of the suspect’s passport, but cannot reveal on his identity until the police investigating released his details. El Mghari said that she will be giving psychological therapies to the girls and counsel them. The psychologist said that the real struggle will be with the neighborhood residents “who might accuse or insult the girls, which is very dangerous.” El Mghari added that she has proposed therapies for the victims’ mothers in order for them to know how to treat their little girls, who were victims of rape. The defendant is still in custody in Fez, while investigations are underway to determine the circumstances of the incident. Another investigative hearing will be carried out next Wednesday.

By Sana Elouazi Rabat – More than 200 people were arrested and dozens were injured on Tuesday as a wave of demonstrations continues to shake several cities in Tunisia following new austerity measures resulting from the 2018 Finance bill, which is expected to increase the cost of living. The spokesman for the Tunisian interior ministry Khalifa Chibani told local media outlets on Wednesday that 49 police officers were also wounded during clashes with protesters across the country and that 206 “troublemakers” were arrested. “Last night, troublemakers looted and damaged security centers, 45 police vehicles were set on fire and public buildings were attacked,” Chibani said. “They have blocked roads and stolen in many cities … Obviously, this is not protest, but theft and damage caused to public and private property,” he added. A Tunisian citizen told Reuter that police fired tear gas in two districts of the North African’s capital Tunis on Tuesday and also fired gas at a crowd storming a supermarket, but no casualties were reported. According to the state news agency TAP, one protester was killed on Monday after clashes broke out in Tebourba, a town 40 km (25 miles) west of Tunis. On Djerba island, a Jewish school was also targeted by incendiary cocktails that caused some damage without casualties. “Unknown people took advantage of the demonstrations to throw Molotov cocktails inside a Jewish religious school in Djerba,” said Perez Trabelsi, the head of the local Jewish community. Djerba is home to the oldest synagogue in Africa “El Ghriba,” which was targeted in 2002 by Al-Qaida-claimed truck bomb that left 21 dead. Since the government announced that it would increase the price of gas, oil, cars, phone and internet services, as well as hotel accommodation and other items in the 2018 budget, many protests erupted across the country last week. The 2018 budget also raises customs duties on scores of imported goods, such as cosmetics and agricultural products. Protesters took to the street to demand a revision of the 2018 finance bill as well as a better social coverage for needy families and a tangible plan to fight corruption.

Rabat – As more and more nations move to a post-industrial knowledge economy that is driven by information technology and professional service sector jobs, the need for post-secondary education that promotes portable and transferable skills will become critical. Prime Minister Saad Eddine El Othmani recently reassured the Moroccan public that the government has no plans to abandon free education in public institutions. He described media reports to the contrary as “completely untrue.” The future for public higher education institutions in Morocco, on the other hand, likely includes inscription (enrollment) fees and other fees that may slightly resemble tuition. It is likely that family income will be a main determinant of just who pays how much. Any potential enrollment fees should be returned as investments in the higher education system – staff, learning resources, adjunct faculty from the business, arts and science communities. The public should welcome a new paradigm that creates obligations for the education system to serve students while also creating new expectations for students to better visualize their professional career in Moroccan society. Morocco’s services sector accounts for half of the kingdom’s annual GDP. Many of these service sector jobs, from information technology consultants to marketing professionals, will become an increasingly important component of the kingdom’s economy. In many nations, there is excitement for the professional service sector and its role in creating jobs. This year for the first time, Moroccan tech startups will participate in the Consumer Electronic Show (CES), the premier consumer technology trade show held in Las Vegas and a showcase of small-firm innovation. Maghreb Arab Press reported in October that Morocco had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China to establish an economic zone in Fez, primarily for professional or service sector initiatives. The traditional mission of training Morocco’s civil servants, teachers and lawyers is going to continue but as the economy diversifies the university as private sector employee incubator will become critically important. Beyond the change that is required to meet new demands from a dynamic economy, partnering enrollment fees with new investments in higher education will help Moroccan public universities become even more invaluable public resources. As a byproduct, enrollment fees/tuition can create buy-in, a heightened sense of connection and obligation by faculty and students alike. Incurring some debt is a tradition for most American college students. It often creates stress, but it prepares students for a dynamic US economy where career change – planned and unplanned – is increasingly common. In 2015, the Higher Council for Education Training and Scientific Research introduced a strategic vision roadmap that outlined the future for Moroccan schools. Equality in access, increased standards for education/teacher training curriculum, and increased support for vocational training were all main components of the new strategic vision. Admirable in that the plan sought to re-engage young people, particularly those from rural Morocco and those who are Amazigh in ancestry. Large American land-grant public universities faced similar challenges related to affordability, cost, workforce development and public duty in the wake of the Great Recession (2007-09). Beyond the unpopular practice of raising tuition and other programming fees, these institutions gradually expanded innovative programs that may also find meaning in Morocco. Citizens are more supportive of increases in enrollment fees, tuition hikes and other payments when they perceive that there are direct benefits for the student and their respective community. Some of the post-recession priorities of public higher education include: The American model need not be seen as a default template. According to the College Board, the average total cost of one year at an American public university for an in-state student is $20,090 ($9,000 for tuition alone). Additionally, American students rely on college loans (government-funded and private loans). Though many students are eligible for academic scholarships and tuition discounts that reduce the final cost significantly, 44 million Americans held $1.3 trillion in student debt last year. But college is worth the costs: the average starting salary for new American college graduates is now $49,700. The high per capita income levels of college graduates help promote home ownership and a broad middle class. Morocco’s tradition of free university education is a noble endeavor, nurturing a modest middle class of administrative civil servants, teachers and community leaders. Importantly, it’s also a cornerstone of national pride and cohesion. Students from around the world come to study at Mohammad V University in Rabat and Cady Ayyad University in Marrakech. The diversity that exists in many Moroccan universities is one of great attributes of the kingdom’s higher education system. Those legacies can be maintained while acknowledging that there are drawbacks to nearly unlimited free higher education in an era where Morocco’s growing economy is increasingly tied to the economies of nations where private enterprise is the largest driver of job creation. The good news: an increasing number of the new jobs being created in Morocco, from IT to tourism management to automotive sector light manufacturing, require vocational education (1-2 years of post-lycee training, or less). New legislation that will provide several thousand dirhams in scholarship support to student trainees in the National Office for Vocational Training and Promotion (OFPPT) is the kind of critical support that students and families need. The current Al Akhawayn University strategic plan describes broad expectations for students that feature personal characteristics like “communication, collaboration, open-mindedness, proactivity, and professional curiosity.” Indeed, required skills for students and university administrators alike. Connecting higher education to workforce development is priority challenge for nations across the globe. Navigating the transition to a more competitive and fee-based higher education system will pay dividends in the future. Scholarships are wonderful and provide an opportunity that previously may not have existed. Equally important in the new economy is cost sharing, public-private partnerships and academic innovation. Supporting student success beyond the classroom.

The separatist movement has been setting up illegal checkpoints in the border area between Morocco and Mauritania in recent weeks. According to Moroccan daily Al Massae, the Polisario has also deployed militia and tried to hinder traffic in the buffer zone, defying the UN Security Council and violating the UN military agreements and the 1991 ceasefire agreement.

The region was marked on Sunday by the confiscation of Polisario military trucks involved in “drug trafficking.” The front’s vehicles were heading to Guelmim Oued Noun, a region that became a haven for drug lords, active in the region. According to the same source, Moroccan officials have given instructions to deploy heavy artillery in the border area of Guerguerat in order to respond to Polisario’s provocative actions.

Rabat – Despite repetitive threats from the Polisario Front to the participants of races, the Africa Eco Race went ahead successfully across the Moroccan-Mauritanian border in Guerguerat on January 8.  The passage of the participants of the competition was supervised by United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). In order to pass the border from Morocco to Mauritania, participants also had to stop and complete the extensive and cumbersome customs paperwork,  drastically simplified especially for this rally.  Futurosahara, a pro-separatist news website close to the Polisario Front claimed that the participants of the competition”ignored” the recent threats made by the front. “It turns out that the organizers did not take seriously the warnings of the Sahrawi authorities,” said the separatist news outlet. Earlier this month, armed groups of the Polisario conducted a series of armed operations in Guerguerat in an attempt to escalate tensions in the region. Polisario’s provocative actions were strongly denounced by both Morocco and the United Nations’ Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres. On January 6, the UN chief expressed his deep concern over Polisario’s maneuvers in the region, urging the Front and Morocco to ease tensions in the region. Guterres’ statement was highly welcomed by Morocco. Morocco’s Permanent Ambassador to the UN Omar Hilale, said that Gueterres fully expressed Morocco’s deep concern over the Polisario’s repeated violations of the ceasefire in the restricted buffer zone. Hilale said that the UN Chief is aware that no political process is possible as other parties “opt for provocation and escalation” in the region. The diplomat said that Morocco has taken steps at all levels to comply with the UN political process, recalling Polisario’s “provocative” actions in the region after they blocked the participants of the rally Sahara Desert Challenge from crossing the border.

California State Teachers’ Retirement System and New York-based Jana Partners have warned that the increasing use of smartphones and internet by children have long-term implications for their health.  The investors control USD 2 billion worth of Apple shares,  have appealed to the multinational technology giant to take action in order to offer more tools and choices for families to protect their children from the harm can be caused due to smartphones. “There is a developing consensus around the world including Silicon Valley that the potential long-term consequences of new technologies need to be factored in at the outset, and no company can outsource that responsibility to an app designer, or more accurately to hundreds of app designers.” The investors are urging the company to create an expert committee: child development specialists. The investors also propose in the letter that Apple have to enhance IOS and apps to make parents and guardians more resources in order to make them protect their children’s wellbeing.

By Sana Elouazi Rabat – Following the return of gambling advertisements on Morocco’s second channel 2M, many, including the Movement for Unification and Reform (MUR), have attacked the channel. According to them, 2M has violated the Benkirane government’s laws. The MUR, the ideological arm of Morocco’s ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD), issued a statement on Sunday, January 7 stating that gambling “endangers the cohesion of the family and the education of future generations.”  The movement also considers the return of lottery advertising campaigns as a “violation of the country’s laws.”  “2M does not take into consideration the values of society and the dangers of such phenomena on the cohesion of the family and the education of future generations,” the statement adds.  The ban on the promotion and advertisement of gambling dates back to 2012 following the regulations set by former Minister of Communication, Mustapha Khalfi, under the Benkirane government. His statements about banning the live transmission of gambling have stirred much controversy with critics objecting to what they viewed as the Islamization of the media, and supporters endorsing restrictions on activities prohibited in Islam.  “I will not allow gambling games to be screened live on state TV which is funded by the Moroccan people even if this costs me my job,” Khalfi told members of the Education, Culture, and Communications Committee in the parliament. He attributed his decision to the negative impact live gambling has on TV viewers, especially the youth. Khalfi added that the ban on live gambling on state TV is observed all over the world even in the most liberal of countries.  “There is a difference between social liberalism and this type of unlimited liberalism that does not work towards protecting younger generations.” The gambling industry in Morocco is still thriving despite the ban on advertising that has lasted for more than five years.  In 2015 Morocco’s gambling company, National Lottery, announced that Moroccans spend an estimated MAD 150 million on gambling annually.  As the company launched its new visual brand identity, Samir Benchekroun, head of lotto for National Lottery, a subsidiary of Caisse de Dépôt et de Gestion, Morocco’s biggest institutional fund, revealed that Moroccans buy 7.5 million lottery tickets out of 10 million distributed annually in the country.  Benchekroun said that the National Lottery distributed MAD 72 million in payouts to gamblers in 2014, adding that the company’s annual advertising budget for its products stands at MAD 6 million.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – After five days of silence following Wednesday’s release of excerpts from the damming new book Fire and Fury: Inside Trump‘s White House, Stephen K. Bannon, a former top aide to the President, issued a statement trying to diffuse the tension between himself and the Oval Office. In his statement Sunday, Bannon expressed his “unwavering support” for Mr. Trump and added that he “regret[ted]” his delay in setting the record straight. Of the many quotes featured in Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury, perhaps the most notable one came from Bannon, a former chief strategist to Trump, who branded a meeting hosted at Trump Tower with a small group of Russians as “treasonous” and “unpatriotic.” The meeting in question took place in New York during the 2016 election campaign and included three of Trump’s senior campaign operatives: Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner; Trump’s son, Donald “Don” Junior; and then-campaign manager, Paul Manafort. On Sunday, Bannon gave his direct response, elaborating on the context of his quotes without refuting them outright. His comments, he explained, were aimed actually at Paul Manafort, a seasoned political operative who “should have known [the Russians] are duplicitous, cunning and not our friends.” Manafort was placed under house arrest in October 2017 on felony charges as part of an ongoing investigation into potential coordination between Russia and members of Trump’s team during the 2016 presidential election. However, Bannon’s comments come after days of mounting political pressure from the Republican Party. Since last week, the Breitbart chairman has come under fire from furious financial donors and political acolytes, alike. The President himself weighed in via Twitter to dub his former ally “Sloppy Steve.” The White House sought unsuccessfully to delay the release of Fire and Fury; the publishers released the book four days ahead of schedule due to “unprecedented demand.” Indeed, amidst freezing temperatures and a blizzard currently consuming US East Coast, curious readers and keen buyers queued until midnight to get a copy.

Rabat – A group of teenage girls violently attacked Souad Kirama, a Moroccan woman living in New York, last week in downtown Brooklyn. The girls punched and spat on her after calling her a “terrorist” while she was wearing a Hijab. Shortly after the incident, the 51-year-old woman posted a live video on Facebook in which she recounts her experience and denounces what she describes as an act of hate. Kirama said she was at Panera Bread restaurant in Brooklyn where the assaut unfolded. As a group of six girls were “terrorizing” the second floor of the eatery and throwing themselves on the floor, she asked them to be quiet. “All I did was ask them to be quiet and they started attacking me and punching me in my back,” Kirama said. “They attacked me, beat me, and everyone around me watched me being beaten, treated as a terrorist, and nobody did anything. Nothing. Nobody came to help me,” she added. The 51-year-old, intimidated by the brutal display of hatred, was paralyzed by fear and was unable to defend herself against the kicks and punches she received from all sides. Animated by hatred, the teenagers also spat on Souad and ordered her to return to her country before attacking his companion. “Never in my life have I seen this kind of violence and aggressiveness,” Kirama said. According to CBS News, the hate crime unit of New York Police Department (NYPD) is investigating the incident but no arrests have been made. “I made sure to report it as a hate crime, we cannot accept this,” Kirama said. Albert Fox Cahn, the legal director of the New York chapter of the Council of American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, says he was grateful that the NYPD’s hate crimes task force is responding. “It is intolerable to see so many New Yorkers do nothing in the face of this sort of hatred. At this moment, when Muslim New Yorkers are enduring a historic surge in hate crimes, we must all stand up when we see our neighbors being attacked,” Cahn said. According to NYPD officials, hate crimes in New York City have increased dramatically since February 2017. A report by the Southern Poverty Law Center, attributed the surge of hate crimes to the election of President Donald Trump in November 2016 and to his “incendiary rhetoric.”

Rabat – In 2017, France received a “historic” number of asylum seekers. Over 100,000 asylum applications were registered last year, an increase of 17 percent compared to 2016. Director General of the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (OFPRA), Pascal Brice said that though this is not considered a “massive influx,” the number of asylum applications is still persistent. “This confirms that France is among the first destinations for asylum seekers  in Europe,” he said, especially behind Germany which received over 200,000 cases in 2017. The vast majority of asylum seekers came from Albania, with 7,630 requests (excluding accompanying minors), recording an increase of 66 percent compared to 2016. OFRPA only granted asylum to 6.5 percent of the applicants. The second country of origin is Afghanistan, which accounted for 5,987 of applications, up by 6 percent, with an admission rate of 83 percent. Brice indicated that Afghan migrants who arrived in France last year are probably more numerous because of the large number of holders of double nationality among them. Haitian nationals came in third, at 4.934 applications. The OFPRA also recorded a remarkable increase in the number of French-speaking and West African nationals, particularly Ivoiriens, whose number has more than doubled reaching 3,243 applications .  The number of asylum seekers from the Democratic Republic of Congo also recorded a considerable increase at 2.941, this rise is up by 15 percent compared to 2016. “This reflects the phenomenon of crossings via Libya to Europe,” says the head of OFPRA. Meanwhile, the numbers of  Syrians who sought asylum in France last year, have decreased by 10 percent to 3,249 requests. The OFPRA did not make any mention of Moroccan asylum seekers.

Rabat – Morocco has prohibited dish antennas on the facades and balconies of co-owned buildings across Morocco.  Moroccan daily Al Massae reported in its January 8 issue that a decree recently published in the Government Official Bulletin announced that citizens have no right to install a dish antenna on buildings facades and balconies, starting from January 1.  The bill was signed by former Minister of Housing and Urban Policy, Nabil Benabdellah a day before his dismissal by King Mohammed VI, due to his involvement in “dysfunctions” in Al Hoceima’s delayed development projects.

More than a million Scots are to be hit with a higher income tax rate than people on the same salaries in England from next April after Nicola Sturgeon’s government unveiled a radical overhaul of the levy targeting middle and higher earners. There is another penny added onto the income tax rate for Scottish citizens whose earnings are greater than £24,000. The theory, according to Holyrod, is that a larger personal allowance will mitigate the impact of the increase for several citizens. The new rate, for Scots who earn a salary greater than £24,000, will now be 21p according to the government of Scotland. Derek MacKay, the finance secretary to Holyrod, released his 2018-19 draft for the budget Thursday. The increases will also be felt by those earning more income, with the higher brackets being at 41p as well as 46p. The idea, told to MSPs is that the new rate is an amount that will mitigate lost revenue and further damage to the economy while still generating income. A higher increase is speculated to have reduced the following years income tax revenue, but at the expense of a large blow to public moral. With , some  increases were deemed crucial to ensure the health and growth of the economy. Tax Rates Income Range £11,850 – £13,830 ~ 19p “starter rate” incurred on the initial £2000 of taxed income. Income Range £13,851 – £24,00 ~ 20p “frozen basic rate” Income Range £24,00 – £44273  ~ 21p “intermediate rate” Income Range £44,274 – £150,000 ~ 41p Income Range £150,000 and above ~ 46p There are some considerations going on in Edinburgh to give Holyrood even more authority. Even with the increases, MacKay continues to claim that the majority of Scotland will actual pay less in income tax. This decrease in payment is due to the implementation of the “starter rate”.  This is supported by the rise in the personal allowance that is designed to cushion citizens earning more than 33,000 from the hike. Scottish Debt Advice Company Scottishtrustdeed.co.uk thinks this will push up the numbers in terms of people looking for debt help. “People are already stretched, the last thing they need is another increase which will hit their pockets.” The frozen basic rate of 21p on incomes starting at 24,000, will only rise in accordance with inflation rates. The result is an income tax rate and system that is not only progressive, but also more just. MacKay warned the public of the financial obstacles created by Brexit during his budget draft speech. He would go on to claim that Holyrood’s decisions were the solution for the obstacles created by the Brexit. He also claimed that these actions would protect the UK and Scotland’s position in the market. Leading comparison site Finance.co.uk said “Council Tax is already set for a 5.99% rise next year, the combination over the past year of slow wage growth, rising inflation and the impact of welfare reform is taking its toll on households’ budgets. This will no doubt increase the amount of people needing financial assistance”. In addition, there were promises made to increase funding in certain sectors such and infrastructure, education, and business research as well as investment. MacKay pledged to allocate 20M towards the development of electric vehicles, 1.8B for higher education and 1.2B for infrastructure. There were additional monies allocated to the police service and the creation of affordable housing. The goal is to create 50,000 homes to add to affordable housing during the next half decade.  The monies allocated to the police force are in the sum of £756m. Other pledges were made to address child poverty. The draft Budget proposed a new investment of £50m to go towards child poverty while £243m is being allocated to Scotland’s government to bolster the free childcare scheme. Sponsored content

Rabat – “A new day is on the horizon,” Oprah Winfrey promised “all the young girls” watching the Golden Globes, assuring that the times of women oppression, misogyny and sexism are being brought to a closure. In a strong referral to “Time’s Up” campaign, Winfrey promises that when “a new day finally dawns,” no woman has to say “Me Too,” as she delivered her acceptance speech for the Cecil B DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award on Sunday night. Winfrey went beyond American borders and expressed “gratitude to  women whose names we’ll never know.”   “The women who have endured years of abuse and assault because they, like my mother, had children to feed and bills to pay and dreams to pursue.” If you live under a rock, or like me were on a plane w/no wifi, and missed this @Oprah speech at @goldenglobes last night, watch it. If you did see it last night, watch it again. It is unifying, empowering, and inspirational. It’s ok to say, “Amen”. https://t.co/ZDWEFpmtR3 — Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) January 8, 2018  Winfrey started her speech recalling her youth as a young girl in 1964 watching Sidney Poitier, the first black man to win the Oscars.  In 1982, Winfrey watched him again, receiving this time the Cecil B DeMille award.  “It is not lost on me that at this moment, there are some little girls watching as I become the first black woman to be given this same award.” The journey that led her to stand where Poitier once stood is far from being free of sacrifice. Her mother worked in “other people’s houses so that one day her daughter might go on to become a worldwide name, a talk show host or an Oscars nominee.” Throughout her speech, the audience applauded and stood in ovation Winfrey, a central element in the foundation of the Time’s Up movement, built to provide legal support to those who have experienced sexual harassment, which prompted speculation about a run for presidency in 2020. After her speech, Winfrey’s partner, Stedman Graham, told the Los Angeles Times that “it’s up to the people. She would absolutely do it.” A day after Twitter users urged her to run for the White House, CNN reported that two of her close friends said that “she is now actively considering the 2020 run.” @Oprah is eminently qualified to be President.She is a patriot.She has integrity, is smart &amp;communicates with the broadest section of Americans, from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta;from the very rich to the very poor.She can raise our moral standing in the world. #visionary — Rev Jesse Jackson Sr (@RevJJackson) January 8, 2018  Oprah Winfrey is “actively thinking” about running for President in 2020, two close friends say https://t.co/3Q2Th0Jwj8 pic.twitter.com/c9PbGEPxng — CNN Breaking News (@cnnbrk) January 8, 2018  I will now officially divide time like this : Everything that happened before @Oprah speech : Everything that will happen after. — Reese Witherspoon (@RWitherspoon) January 8, 2018

Rabat – Morocco’s archaeological site Jbel Irhoud, where archaeologists discovered last year the oldest-known remains of Homosapiens, has just been classified as a historical heritage by the Ministry of Culture and Communication.  This decision came at the request of the Association of Laureates of the Moroccan Institute of Archaeology and Heritage Sciences, which led the research program in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. The oldest Homo-sapiens discovered on June 2017 at Jbel Irhoud near Marrakech made unexpected adjustments in science. New hypotheses about human history are actually being considered and it is now believed that human beings have been around for more than 300,000 years. READ ALSO: Homo Sapiens is Moroccan, Precisely from Marrakech “Jbel Irhoud was discovered by coincidence in the early 1960s. Since then, a substantial number of fossils have been unearthed from the site, attracting numerous archaeological expeditions from around the world,” Abdelouahed Ben-Ncer, research professor at the Moroccan Institute of Archaeology and Heritage Sciences and co-director of the discovery, told Morocco World News in a previous interview.   The recent discovery of Homo-sapien fossils was described by international media outlets as a major breakthrough, drastically altering the modern understanding of human evolutionary history. “This implies that 100,000 years of the presence of our species on earth was unexplored until the fossils of Jbel Irhoud were extracted and examined. This fact alone makes the discovery a scientific earthquake. It has rocked our knowledge on the very beginnings of the time our ancestors spent on earth,” said Ben-Ncer.  The discovery also indicated that the oldest remains of human species fossils evolved in Africa. During his visit to Jbel Irhoud in late August, Mohammed Laâraj, Minister of Culture and Communication said in a statement that the ministry is currently working to classify Jbel Irhoud among the world historical sites, given its “certain archaeological value for the whole of humanity.” “The region likely contains future archaeological discoveries that could make an international impact,” added Laarj.

Rabat – Moroccan Jews have called on King Mohammed VI to intervene after Morocco’s Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM) announced its intention to request a bill to withdraw citizenship from Moroccan Jews living in the occupied Palestinian territories. Moroccan Jews have reportedly expressed their anger over PAM’s decision. The latter came to oppose US President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to the disputed region. PAM’s suggestion followed the visit of former Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal to Morocco on December 26, 2017 at the request of Justice and Development Party (PJD). Meshaal has also met with other political leaders in Morocco, including PAM’s Secretary-General Ilyas El Omari. The idea of revoking citizenship from Moroccans living in Israeli settlements was suggested by El Omari.  According to Middle East Monitor (MEMO), PAM’s request was allegedly supported by other political parties’ members who are against the normalization with Israel, urging Morocco to cut ties with the occupying power. In response, Moroccan Jews considered PAM’s suggested bill as “reckless,” calling on King Mohammed VI to block the party’s proposal, reported MEMO. The draft bill was not submitted yet, however, Aziza Chagaf, a PAM member said that the decision was discussed during a meeting with Mechaal during his visit in Rabat. Chagaf said that her party would give in their proposal to the parliament in order to adopt the bill. MEMO reported that Chagaf said that the party would discuss the idea before putting it up for a vote.  In response, Secretary-General of the Federation of Moroccan Jews in France Simon Skira denounced PAM’s proposal. Skira told Morocco World News that  Moroccan Jews have the right to preserve their nationality wherever they live. Skira, who left Morocco when he was 15 to live in France still has a Moroccan ID card: He has called on King Mohammed VI to block PAM’s request; adding that Morocco should open a liaison office for Jewish people living here and that Israel should do the same in Tel Aviv. The Moroccan Jew added that PAM has gifted this decision to Meshaal, who currently visited Morocco. Speaking about the reason why Moroccan Jews are living in Israeli settlements in Palestine, Skira said that the Jews did not go there for political purposes, but because of the high living costs in Tel Aviv. “To buy a house in Tel Aviv, you must be a millionaire.” He added that Moroccans Jews living in Palestinian occupied territories are having a kind relationship with Palestinians.

Rabat – Due to the bad weather conditions paralyzing the United States since January 4, 2018, and the subsequent saturation of the NYC JFK airport, all airlines’ flights are experiencing significant disruption and cancellations, announced Royal Air Maroc (RAM) in a press release this Sunday. Following the disruption of the flights connecting Casablanca to New York, RAM has just issued a press release to clarify the situation. New York City has experienced severe weather disruptions, including the paralysis of J. F. Kennedy International Airport since January 4. Due to the bad weather conditions and following the repeated closures of the JF Kennedy International Airport, the flights of all airlines experienced important disturbances.  “Royal Air Maroc, which has not been spared, had to cancel or reschedule some flights linking Casablanca and New York (in both directions). However, RAM is sparing no effort to find solutions to resume US flights scheduled in the coming days, depending on the improved weather in New York,” said the airline. RAM also urged its passengers to be patient to facilitate the management of this “exceptional situation, independent of the will of airlines and airport authorities.” For scheduled flights from Casablanca to New York, Royal Air Maroc informed passengers that they will have to expect a congestion and long queues on arrival at the airport JFK (treatment baggage, paperwork, long wait in the plane before landing …). “By apologizing to the passengers concerned for the inconvenience caused by a situation beyond its control, Royal Air Maroc invites its customers to inquire about the situation of their flights on its website and through its call centers,” the statement concluded.

Rabat – Aspiring to reach a fruitful economic emergence, Morocco is more and more capitalizing on innovation. In this sense, nine Moroccan startups will take part in Las Vegas’s 2018 Consumer Electronic Show (CES), this January 9-12.  For the first time, Moroccan startups will participate in the famous Consumer Electronic Show (CES), whose 51st edition will be held from January 9 to 12, 2018 in Las Vegas.  An annual must-attend event for manufacturers in new technologies, the CES welcomes major groups and startups who compete ingeniously to present their achievements. The show has always been the place where many major innovations of the century were unveiled, from the first camera (1981) to connected watches, via Blu-ray or game consoles. For Said Benhajjou, president of the Moroccan Electronic, Micro-Electric and Mechatronic Cluster, the event constitutes “a priceless opportunity for Morocco to present its technological innovations.”  Benhajjou stressed that “this is a great highlight for Moroccan innovations at the international level and an added value that will allow Morocco to position itself as leader at the African level, given that Morocco is the first African country to participate in this great event.” The various projects selected are in line with world innovative trends in the electronics sector, and with application areas such as augmented virtual reality, home automation, Smart Grid, Smart-Cities and connected objects in general. Beside agriculture, startups and SMEs are the main turbo of the Moroccan economy, employing an important chunk of the young population. However, the country’s efforts in financing this economical hub are to date still insufficient. Many are the startups that see the light only to die in the first years of their creation.  Morocco’s participation in the CES might just be a lifeline for the nine startups taking part in this international event. In fact, the latter will have the opportunity to raise funds to finance their innovative projects.   In 2014, the Moroccan Central Bank launched a project to support medium, small and very small enterprises, in the form of funds allocated to Moroccan commercial banks to finances these starting companies.  However, the criteria set by the banks to allocate a loan to SMEs are borderline impossible. As Bank Al Maghrib sets the condition of an annual revenue of an average of MAD 175 million to be eligible for a loan, many SMEs are systematically ruled out.  Trusting startups is a vital condition to their success and development. If Morocco aspires to some kind of economical emergence, it must take entrepreneurship promotion more seriously.  In recent years, the government has caught up with the idea. Last October, the Moroccan Executive launched the Innov Invest Funds, a body that offers concrete opportunities in terms of support and financement for innovative startups.  For the government, the implementation of this fund shows its strong engagement in this sector, which constitutes the heart of the future Moroccan economy. For the time being, the fund allocates a budget of MAD 700 million for the next five years, and an additional MAD 300 million offered by the Moroccan Caisse Centrale de Garantie (CCG).

Rabat – Jordan’s capital, Amman gathered on Saturday, January 6 Arab foreign ministers, including Morocco’s Nasser Bourita to discuss the ongoing crisis over U.S President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. During the Arab ministerial meeting, six countries vowed their commitment to seek international recognition of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.  Foreign ministers of Morocco, UAE, Egypt, Palestine, Saudi Arabia and Jordan also vowed to ensure that no other country recognizes Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, according to Spanish news agency EFE. During the meeting, the Moroccan delegation reaffirmed its strong and constant solidarity with the Palestinian people. The meeting came one month following Trump’s unprecedented decision voiced on December 6. Trump’s recognition was strongly condemned by Arab and Western countries alike. Leaders, including King Mohammed VI denounced the US decision, considering it as a threat to peace negotiations between Palestine and Israel. On December 17, the Arab League decided to form a ministerial delegation to stand against Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and to move its Embassy from Tel Aviv to the area. Recently, Trump threatened to cut financial aids to Palestine, accusing the country of standing against peace talks with Israel. This is not the only time Trump threatens to cut US aids sent to developing countries.

Rabat – Moroccans seeking treatment in France are no longer welcome in French hospitals since they have been declared as “bad payers” after accumulating a total of debt EUR 7.3 million.  According to a report conducted by the Public Assistance-Hospitals of Paris (AP-HP) on unpaid bills in French hospitals, Algerians ranked first on the list with a debt of EUR 28 million, equivalent to MAD 308 million.  The United States of America and Tunisia’s nationals have also been reported to not pay their French hospital bills with a total of EUR 3.95 million and EUR 2.97 million respectively.  These considerable amounts concern only foreign patients who are not residing in France, and whose pathology requires treatment in Paris’ hospitals.  French hospitals, which never required advance payment of hospitalization for foreigners in the past, decided to restrict the hospitalization of foreign nationals in France by changing the payment method. Foreigners are now required to submit documents proving their solvency before receiving any form of care.  This new provision only concerns scheduled hospitalizations, not emergency cases. Over the years, foreign patients have left behind a EUR 120 million debt to Paris hospitals by late 2014.   Top foreign officials who go to France for treatment were also reported as bad payers. In 2015, Saudi’s King visit to France stirred controversy over the alleged nonpayment of a EUR 3.7 million bill to Paris Hospitals.  In a tweet, the well-known French physician and activist, Patrick Pelloux, recalled that the Arabian kingdom owed EUR 3.7 million to the Public Assistance-Hospitals of Paris (AP-HP). “Before leaving, the King of Saudi Arabia could pay his bills of EUR 3.7 million to Hôpitaux de Paris. A gesture of courtesy!” the tweet read.   The polemic tweet reached representatives at Hôpitaux de Paris who have confirmed the allegations. According to French media outlets, the debt is not only King Salmane’s responsibility. The EUR 3.7 million include many Saudis treated in Paris. These types of debts are a recurring problem since foreign officials are not required by law to pay these hospital bills at time of service.

By Sana Elouazi Rabat – Saudi authorities have opened investigations to verify the authenticity of a video purporting to show a gay wedding ceremony allegedly held in Saudi Arabia, reported The New Arab. The footage, which features two men in traditional Saudi dress while walking down the aisle, went viral in the Arabian country this week, with many expressing their outrage and posting homophobic messages. According to Al Marsd, this alleged ceremony took place in Aradiyat governorate, near Mecca last Monday. Some even tweeted that authorities have already carried out raids and arrested the people involved in the ceremony, pending investigations. However, a Saudi official said that an investigation was underway, adding that the Saudi authorities would release further details once the authenticity of the video is verified. He also warned Saudis that they must adhere to the “morals and virtuous values of this blessed country”. Homosexuality is strictly forbidden and considered as an illegal act not only in Saudi Arabia but also in several countries, where homosexuals can face imprisonment, violent punishments or even death penalty. Even though the report of the wedding has not been confirmed yet, the videos continue to circulate online sparking an uproar on social media, with some speculating that the clip was actually meant to be a parody while others lambasted the country’s new modernizing ruler, Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman. ??? #????_?????_?????? ???? ??????? ?? ?????? ???????? ?????? #???_??????? ! ??? ??

By Sana Elouazi Rabat – Following the release of a bombshell book that raises doubts about Donald Trump’s psychological fitness for America’s highest office, the US president took to his Twitter account on Friday to respond to the author’s claims, describing himself as a “very stable genius.” “Throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart,” Trump said in a tweet. ….Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart. Crooked Hillary Clinton also played these cards very hard and, as everyone knows, went down in flames. I went from VERY successful businessman, to top T.V. Star….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2018  “I went from VERY successful businessman, to top TV star to President of the United States (on my first try). I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius… and a very stable genius at that,” reads another tweet. The heated debate over the mental state of the American president was revived following the release of Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House on Thursday.  The newly released book describes a president with “erratic behavior, completely egocentric, tempted by conspiracy theories and lacking empathy.” The book tells the behind-the-scenes of the first year of Trump’s presidency, through testimonies collected from his surroundings and the White House president’s team. Wolff alleges that many people close to the President described him as a “moron, an idiot” and that Trump’s deputy chief of staff said working with him is like “trying to figure out what a child wants.” ….to President of the United States (on my first try). I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius….and a very stable genius at that! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2018  “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House” became a bestseller as soon as it was released on Friday despite the Trump administration’s attempt to suppress it. Speaking at Camp David, Trump said that he considers the book as a “work of fiction” and a “disgrace.” “He said he interviewed me for three hours in the White House, it didn’t exist. It’s in his imagination,” he told reporters. “The libel laws are very weak in this country. If they were strong, it would be very helpful. You wouldn’t have things like that happen where you can say whatever comes to your head,” he added. The White House issued a scorched-earth dismissal of both the author and his sources. Almost since Trump declared his candidacy for the presidency, his mental stability has been questioned several times by critics as they cite remarks and tweets that show him as “impulsive” and “erratic.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Permanent Ambassador to the UN, Omar Hilale, welcomed the statement issued by the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, on Saturday regarding the buffer zone, Guerguerat. For Hilal, Guterres fully expressed Morocco’s deep concern over the Polisario’s repeated violations of the ceasefire in the restricted buffer zone. Hilale said that the UN Chief is aware that no political process is possible as other parties “opt for provocation and escalation” in the region. The diplomat said that Morocco has taken steps at all levels to comply with the UN political process, recalling Polisario’s “provocative” actions in the region after they blocked the participants of the rally Sahara Desert Challenge from crossing the border. “Polisario’s maneuvers in the region undermine [Horst] Kohler’s current efforts to resume the political process,” to find a mutually acceptable political solution for the Western Sahara dispute, Hilale emphasized. The Moroccan official added that the Polisario’s armed forces continued their “provocative” actions in the buffer zone until they were forced to leave the premises by MINURSO on January 3. Hilale expressed Morocco’s strong condemnation of the Polisario’s presence, adding that the country alerted the UN of the Polisario’s violations in the Guerguerat on Friday. Morocco’s official also warned the UN of the Polisario’s threat to block participants for the Africa Eco Race rally, which will take place on Monday, January 8. Hilale also called on the UN officials to “assume firmly and promptly their responsibility by demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the Polisario armed elements from the region.” The ambassador added that Morocco “vigorously condemns these continuous provocative acts, which violate the Military Agreements and endanger the ceasefire in place since 1991.” Hilale emphasized that these provocative actions threaten security and stability in the region. “These irresponsible Polisario actions constitute a challenge to the international community and an affront to the Secretary-General and the Security Council.” Hilale added that Guterres’s message is very clear to the Polisario, urging the front to stop hindering, in any way, the freedom of commercial traffic and regular civilians in the region. Guterres’s warning statement “constitutes a firm and categorical rejection of Polisario’s provocative actions in the buffer zone.” “No action, which would change the status quo in the buffer zone, should be undertaken. Therefore, Polisario’s presence in Guerguerat is illegal, because it violates agreements and tends to change the status of the area.” Hilale stressed that Polisario’s maneuvers in the region “desperately” aimed to repeat the crisis of last March and April. “Polisario forgot that it was forced to withdraw its armed forces following the Security Council condemnation and threat.” Hilale said that these maneuvers are proof that Polisario and Algeria, who provides financing by delivering weapons and buying pickup trucks, did not learn from the lessons of their April failure.” Hilale warned that “no political process” is possible as long as the other parties persist in their violations of the military and ceasefire agreements.” “As the Secretary-General said, the political process urgently needs an environment of serenity, calm and respect for the commitments made,” he said. In response to Polisario’s continuous accusations, claiming that Morocco has violated the UN resolutions, Hilale said, “Morocco has honored its commitments since the crisis of last year and has not undertaken any act that would affect the status of the Guerguerat buffer zone.”

Rabat – Around 200 sub-Saharan migrants managed to breach the double fence border that separates Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla on Saturday. According to British news outlet The Guardian, four sub-Saharans were injured as they attempted to cross the six-meter fence. A migrant attacked a police officer, who tried to stop him, causing him an injury to the ear.  The migrants were taken to a detention center, reported the British news outlet. In 2017, 2,252 migrants forced their way into the Spanish enclave of Ceuta, while 2,000 of them were able to cross to Europe. In terms of nationality, 1,605 are sub-Saharan migrants, 512 are Algerians and 126 are from other nationalities. February and August saw the largest influx into the city. On February 17, 2017, 500 migrants forced the fence separating Morocco from the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. During this attempt, 11 Civil Guards and 25 migrants were injured. Three days later, 300 migrants staged another attempt and managed to enter the city. Last August, 260 migrants were able to make their way to Ceuta. During Christmas and New Year holidays, Moroccan authorities aborted the attempts of many sub-Saharan migrants to force Ceuta’s wire fence.

Rabat – The family of AFC Ajax midfielder Abdelhak Nouri, who suffered permanent brain injury, is in a shock after they found out that Ajax and the Dutch Football Federation have not told them about Nouri’s pre-existing heart defect detected during a routine screening in 2014. On Saturday, January 6, Dutch press revealed new information regarding Nouri’s case. Nouri, who collapsed during a friendly match last July due to heart rhythm problems, could have avoided this injury had his club and the Dutch football federation come forward about the player’s heart condition. According to Dutch daily NRC Handelsblad, tests conducted in April 2014 revealed the presence of a heart disorder in the Dutch-Moroccan footballer. His club and the federation expected the injury to be harmless and unserious. Their expectations, however, proved to be wrong, causing the youngster a permanent brain injury. The young footballer was one of the most brilliant and talented young players in the Netherlands. Nouri’s family felt betrayed after they were told about the news. According to British news outlet The Guardian, Nouri’s family said that they had neither suspected nor been aware of any heart defect at the time of the incident. The family knew about their son’s heart condition “only when they obtained the medical file that Ajax provides after repeated and explicit requests.” Nouri’s heart rhythm abnormality was detected in April 2014.For the family it is a huge shock because had they knew about it, they would have called for regular tests and follow-up examination to assess the nature and risks of such a condition,” said the lawyer of Nouri’s family.  He added that “Things did not happen like that and we are sure that no one would risk the life of their child.” It is still not sure whether there is any link between Nouri’s collapse and his pre-existing heart rhythm abnormalities. The footballer started his youth career in 2005 at the age of 7 and played for the Netherlands Under 15 Under 16, Under 17,  Under 18 and Under 19 categories.

Rabat – Recent news that free education for the senior classes in Morocco will be fazed out bring out the concern about the lack of opportunities for students who cannot afford expensive private education, and are otherwise stuck in a failing public school system.  That is an issue which has long been on the forefront of discussion in the United States. The public education system in the US is widespread but uneven, with a wide variety of districts, which have varying results. Wealthier districts tend to have vigorous education, high acceptance rates to top universities, and a diversity of extracurricular activities and advanced programs which prepare students for higher education. Poor districts may often present failing, overcrowded schools with low literacy rates even in senior classes, high delinquency rate, discipline issues, and other problems. However, uneven funding is far from the only issue here, as there is no shortage of expenditures in large cities towards public school education, and yet the results are by and large disheartening. Control by the unions, gross administrative mismanagement, bureaucratization of the educational process, overtesting, increasingly decentralized and “social” educational models, lack of discipline, lack of family involvement, dumbing down of the curriculum, and assorted ideological agendas at the core of public education are but a few contributing factors to the startling discrepancies in the outcomes. There is no shortage of public educational reform movements, yet at the core of it remains the central issue – any system, particularly one where the government is in charge of central management is corruptible. For that reasons, presenting choices to the families can avoid entrapment in a situation where talented and hardworking students are disadvantaged by the predetermined failures of others. Some of the innovative solutions to resolving this problem included: There is no single answer for the best possible and affordable education, but there are options other than terrible local district schools and unaffordable private schools that allow students to prepare for universities. Increasingly, private schools accord merit scholarships based on tests and/or performance, while in many communities, parochial schools are subsidized based on financial need through communities, religious institutions, and private organizations.  It seems that Morocco is at a very early stage of exploring options outside the standard (and failing) models. The importance of providing ample opportunity for students to benefit from excellent education cannot be overestimated. Educational opportunity is the best way to break out of poverty or to avoid getting involved in criminal or extremist activity.  Nevertheless, the resources for testing a diversity of creative educational options appears to be lacking.  Whereas the United States has been increasingly invested into developing jobs training programs and skills development for young Moroccans seeking economic opportunities, school education has not been part of these packages. And perhaps working on developing joint models with diplomats may not be the best way to approach innovation. Educational choice, at its heart, is entrepreneurial, and government bureaucracies tend to prefer the one-size fits all approach that stiffles creativity.  Furthermore, although, for instance, French model schools (Alliance Francaise), have been successful to some extent, this may not be the right for everybody, and may no longer be the best indigenous response to the direction Morocco is seeking to develop as a country. Perhaps greater integration with other African countries that it is currently pursuing will emphasizing other structures, educational concepts, or learning priorities.  That, however, does not mean that there is no room for partnerships, and pedagogical exchanges with assorted counterparts from around the world for an exchange of best practices and development of innovative concepts.  This is one of the directions for which there is likely a great future in cooperation between the United States and Morocco.  There is no shortage of existing exchange programs, and cooperation agreements, and yet they all have limitations. None, for instance, is aimed exclusively at school age children or educators. Fulbright is more of a research scholarship with Visa-related limitations, targeting a very small number of exceptional scholars, and other programs are lesser known, and likely also targeting special interests. A broad program of cooperation and educational scholarship between Morocco and the United States does not exist. There may be international educational conferences where teachers from both countries may participate among others, but that is a far cry from having a strong bilateral commitment to exploring and understanding the opportunities and challenges present in each country. There is no substitute for personal and group visits, tours of schools, understanding of the environment and curriculum, as well as wider social context and obstacles in the environment, families, and backgrounds of students – as well as the missteps and success stories along the way. Importantly, however, the model of education should be encouraging marketable skills, thorough grasp of material, and higher standards that motivate and inspire students to ask more of themselves and to become more competitive not just in terms of the expected disciplines, but in terms of breaking out of the social limitations and developing themselves widely and deeply. Coding, for instance, is becoming an increasingly popular skill to teach in schools rather than universities, as it is seen as providing a variety of opportunities along college, not just as a university major. But scientific exploration is yet another undervalued range of possibilities. The United States has developed an interesting option which allows senior level (high school) students to take a variety of college-level courses along side their curriculum, in order to further develop skills, save money and time in college, or focus on more advanced work once they enter the universities. Perhaps partnerships with universities may be another way out for students struggling with failing government school models, while the issue of private school affordability is being resolved. Increasingly, much of the educational curriculum from universities is being taught online. Perhaps the future of education, both in Morocco and the United States, lies not in the overcrowded classrooms with ill-prepared teachers reciting rigid material, but an interactive network of virtual classes from around the world, where truly talented professionals bring education to a far wider range of students, while students break barriers by meeting their peers from abroad as they learn. There is no shortage of opportunities for developing strong partnerships, finding creative solutions, and avoiding the seemingly never-ending problems of costs and bureaucratic ineptitude.  Hopefully, in the coming years, talented, innovation-oriented professionals in Morocco and the United States, will expand their horizons, enter each others’ worlds, and take first steps towards overcoming the unnecessary social abyss that keeps so many hardworking and deserving students from reaching their full potential.

Rabat – A new case of school violence is shaking up once again the city of Ouarzazate, after a teacher was reportedly attacked with acid by two men riding a motorcycle on the morning of January 3.   The school teacher was attacked in the middle of the street when two hooded men threw acid on him and fled under the lenses of the cameras, which will be of great use to the investigators.  The victim, who was badly wounded in the face, was later transported to the Ibn Tofail University Hospital of Marrakech due to the deterioration of his health state.  Police is now investigating the case to determine the identity of the attackers, as well as the motives behind the attack.  The investigators checked the camera recordings of a shop near the scene of the assault in the hope of finding clues leading to their identities.  According to the Moroccan newspaper Almassae, one of his students is allegedly involved in the assail. READ ALSO: Shocking Video of Student Beating Teacher Sparks Intense Debate on Violence in Moroccan Schools The incident is the fourth reported act of violence perpetrated by a student against their teacher in the 2018 school year. In early November, the release of a shocking video featuring a 17-year old student violently beating one of his teachers during a class in Ouarzazate’s Sidi Daoud high school, triggered many questions about discipline in Moroccan schools. The video showed several students intervening to try to stop their classmate, entreating him “to let the teacher go.” The teenager steps back for a few seconds, as the teacher upbraids one of his other students for not helping him while the student was beating him. The first student comes back again to assault the teacher even more violently, punching him and knocking him to the ground. A week later, a high school teacher in Casablanca was also gruesomely attacked with knife by her 17-years-old student upon leaving the institution.

Rabat – Following a series of illegal armed operations carried out by the Polisario Front near Guerguerat, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Morocco and Polisario to exercise “maximum” restraint to avoid further escalation in the region. In a statement issued on Saturday, January 6,  the UN Chief expressed his deep concern over rising tensions near the restricted buffer strip. The statement came just a day after Morocco addressed a letter to the UN, urging it to intervene on Polisario’s illegal activities in the region. Read Also: Morocco Urges UN to Intervene on Polisario’s Illegal Presence in Guerguerat Guterres emphasized that the withdrawal of “the Polisario Front elements from Guerguerat in April 2017 together with the earlier withdrawal of Moroccan elements from the area, was critical to creating an environment conducive to the resumption of dialogue under the auspices of his Personal Envoy, Horst Kohler.” The UN Secretary-General, according to the statement, is calling on the disputant parties to “exercise maximum restraint and to avoid escalating tensions.” Read Also: Polisario Maintains Presence in Guerguerat, Defying MINURSO’s Resolution While the separatist group has been recently stopping trucks registered in Morocco and blocking them from crossing the Moroccan-Mauritanian border, the UN said that “regular civilian and commercial traffic should not be obstructed and no action should be taken, which may constitute a change to the status quo of the buffer strip.” Polisario had been violating the ceasefire agreement signed between Morocco and Polisario in 1991. The separatist provocative actions were continuously repeated since December 2017. Morocco has also contacted the MINURSO to denounce the presence of the armed elements of the separatist group, asking the mission to urge Polisario to withdraw from the region.

Rabat – Following the success of his previous hit song “Boom Boom,” Moroccan-Swedish international record producer Nadir Khayat, commonly known as Redone, is excited for the 2018 World Cup.  The producer announced that he already sent a song to FIFA to secure the official 2018 World Cup anthem. The producer has chosen American diva, Lady Gaga to perform his track for the World tournament. RedOne told British tabloid newspaper Daily Star that he is aiming to do the official anthem for the 2018 World Cup, but “I  don’t know when that will be decided. I can’t give you a name of the song because it becomes to complicated!”  Even if the producer will fail to secure official 2018 FIFa World Cup official song, his fans will still be able to listen to the new hit. “Whatever happens I will have a song coming out for the World Cup,” the producer told the Lady Gaga. “I am doing another song for BN sports, the largest global soccer channel, that will be a single too,” he added.

Rabat – Casablanca’s police dismantled a network of professional counterfeit banknotes scammers, who used sophisticated equipment to replicate a total value of  MAD 13 million. In collaboration with the General Treasury of the Kingdom and Bank Al-Maghrib, Casablanca police seized MAD 9.1 million dirhams worth of counterfeit banknotes. The suspects’  most falsified notes are those of MAD 100 and MAD 200, representing respectively 57 percent and 26 percent of the total seizures. In order not to attract attention, the counterfeiters used the falsified banknotes in different cities, reported the daily Al Massae in its weekend issue. More than MAD 13 million counterfeit banknotes were seized in 2017, an increase of 19 percent compared to 2016. The suspects were brought before the Court of Appeal of Casablanca for constitution of criminal gang, falsification of banknotes and possession of equipment used for the falsification operations.

By Sanae Elouazi Rabat- A bottle of vodka claimed to be the most expensive in the world was reportedly found empty on a construction site, after being stolen earlier this week from a bar in the Danish capital of Copenhagen, local Police confirmed on Twitter. The owner of the Cafe 33 bar, Brian Ingberg, told Denmark’s Ekstra Bladet that the bottle is worth USD 1.3 million and appeared on the US television series “House of Cards,” where the Russian president gifts the bottle to US President Frank Underwood. “The expensive vodka bottle that was stolen in Vesterbro [central Copenhagen neighbourhood, ed.] in the early hours of Tuesday has been found,” the police’s tweet read. “The bottle is now in police custody, and appears to be intact and will be examined,” said a second tweet. Created by the Russian luxury car maker Russo-Baltique, the bottle is made of gold and silver and has a diamond-studded cap. “I had loaned [the bottle] from the Dartz Factory in Russia, which is known for making the world’s most expensive cars and vodka. It has been part of my collection for six months,” the owner said.   “Unfortunately, it’s empty. It is one of the employees working on the construction site that has found it.” “I feel fantastic. The vodka god saved us,” he added. Since the bottle was found unbroken, Ingberg said that he is planning to refill it again and put it back on display. A CCTV footage of the robbery featured what appeared to be a masked young man entering the bar and looking around the storage before taking the high-value bottle.  “They apparently had a key or copied a key, and they rolled up the shutters and unlocked the door, then gone into the bar and broken down the door to the vodka museum in the basement. They then left with only one bottle, even though there are 1,200 bottles they could have taken,” Ingberg told the media outlet TV2.

Rabat – The General Confederation of Enterprises of Morocco (CGEM) categorically denied media reports claiming that the organization benefited from 70 hectares of state land in Laayoune, for the realization of export processing zone. “Some media outlets echo unfounded information that the government plans to issue a decree granting the CGEM an area of 70 hectares in the region of Laayoune-Boujdour Sakia El Hamra for the realization of an export processing zone,” says a statement from the Confederation. “The CGEM wishes to inform its members and the public opinion that it has not benefited from this land, did not make the request neither from the government nor from the local authorities of the region,” added the source. In March 2015, the Confederation states that it has led, in partnership with the Ministry of the Interior and Local Authorities, “a solidarity and citizen and state-based initiative for mobilizing investments for the benefit of Southern regions,” which has generated MAD 6.18 billion of concrete investments and created 13,109 jobs. READ ALSO: The Govt’s New Year’s Gift to the CGEM: 70 Hectares of State Domain As part of this initiative, the CGEM drew attention to the delay in the completion of the second phase of the industrial zone of El Marsa in Laayoune which hosted investments planned by entrepreneurs from different regions. “It is the second phase that some media outlets have certainly confused, in good faith,” the CGEM explained. The employers’ organization reaffirms that it “didn’t ask in any case to benefit from this zone or another in any region whatsoever.”  On its January 1 issue, Moroccan daily Al Massae reported that El Othmani’s government will soon adopt a draft decree granting 70 hectares of state land to the CGEM for the construction of a free export zone in the south of Morocco.  According to the daily, the project responds to “a request” from the Wali of the Laayoune-Boujdour-Sakia Al Hamra region, addressed to the Ministry of Industry and requesting the transfer of 70 hectares to the CGEM.

Rabat – The international popularity of Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan continues to rise since his appearance with his father King Mohammed VI during the One Planet Summit. Today’s El Mundo newspaper in Spain has printed a long and flattering portrait of Morocco’s Crown Prince, describing him as “gifted and a polyglot”.   The multi-lingual Crown Prince, who can communicate confidently in Arabic, French, English and Spanish has clearly caught the eye of the Spanish media for many reasons.  They seem delighted to find out he follows Barca FC and is a Lionel Messi fan. They also give his distinct and modern fashion sense a big thumbs up. El Mundo acknowledges the influence and advice of his mother, Princess Lalla Salma, when it comes to ensuring he is always well dressed and looks like a future monarch.  Born in 2003, the Prince is referred to  as mature” for his age and “always serious and strict.” El Mundo pays tribute to the Prince’s personality and his ability to communicate with global leaders. “we have rarely seen a boy treat kings and head of states with so much courage and ease.” The profile of the young Prince focuses extensively on his education. Unlike young members of the Spanish royal family, Prince Moulay El Hassan is not attending private schools, alongside the children of other wealthy and notable parents. Instead, as El Mundo applauds, he is studying inside the Royal Palace with groups of other children who come from diverse backgrounds, selected carefully for their intellect and skills. El Mundo reports that when he finishes his secondary schooling, he is expected to pursue his studies in aviation, distinct from his father who studied Law.    Read Also: Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan Youngest Participant in One Planet Summit

Rabat – Morocco has strongly condemned the provocative moves exerted by the Polisario Front in the restricted area of Guerguerat, stating that these moves reflect “the high pressure” put on the separatist group. Moroccan daily Akhbar Al Yaoum discussed the issue with an unidentified Moroccan diplomat, who said that Polisario’s provocative actions in the buffer zone “were expected.”  “Morocco is aware that these provocative actions by Polisario will continue. This reflects the high pressure put on the Polisario, especially in its African strongholds,” disclosed the source. On Wednesday, January 3 the Polisario Front stopped the race vehicle of two participants in a rally competition, closing the borders that link the disputed territory to the Mauritanian borders. Blocking the road for participants, the armed mercenaries of the Polisario Front checked the identity of the vehicle drivers before ordering them to leave the premises. Morocco, according to the daily, strongly denounced the existence of the Polisario’ militias in the region, considering the move to be a violation of  UN’s 2351 resolution on the regulation of the statues of the Guerguerat buffer strip. Akhbar Al Yaoum’s source also recalled Morocco’s participation in the EU-AU Summit, which took place on November 29-30, 2017 in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire. “The summit revealed the degree of isolation that the Front is facing, and this is what sparked such provocative actions,” said the Moroccan diplomat. The daily’s source added that Morocco has informed the MINURSO of the provocative move that was recently carried out by the Polisario in the buffer zone. The diplomat has affirmed that the MINURSO acted immediately to solve the issue, which led to the withdrawal of the front’s forces from the region. The separatist front visibly expressed its envy and anger over Morocco’s return to the African Union and its notable involvement in Abidjan’s summit, which was marked by the Participation of King Mohammed VI personally. During the summit, Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Nasser Bourita, said that the presence of the so-called Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) delegation in the summit was not a “problem,” adding that their delegation is “invisible to Morocco.” The official also recalled the African countries that withdrew their recognition of the so-called SADR, including Malawi. He added that the future will see other countries withdrawing their recognition of the separatist body. Polisario’s provocative actions came in conjunction with the arrival of Colin Stewart, UN’s Special Representative for Western Sahara and the newly appointed head of MINURSO, in Laayoun on December 28, 2017. In the end of December, the separatist group conducted a series of military maneuvers near the restricted region. On December 25, armed forces staged a “parade” with heavy military equipment, handed to the front by its supporter, Algeria. The military operations in the region were attended by members of the Algerian forces. Polisario considers its provocative operations in the region as a direct threat to the United Nations, its mission in the region and to Morocco. During the same month, Polisario’s leader Ibrahim Ghali addressed a letter to the United Nations’ chief, Antonio Guterres. In the letter, Ghali threatened the UN and Morocco to access the region, claiming that Morocco is violating the UN’s resolution on the buffer zone. In a similar letter, the Front sent a letter earlier this month to Stewart, asking the UN to “ honor its commitments” and to “put pressure on Morocco” to stop “its violations and to implement international legitimacy in the Western Sahara conflict.” Morocco, however, withdrew its forces from the buffer zone on February 28, 2017, when Guterres issued a statement asking both the disputants to withdraw from the region. Polisario withdrew its forces from the regions by force on April 30 after the UN put pressure on it by issuing a draft resolution “in blue” – meaning ready for adoption – on April 27. The document ordered the separatist group to withdraw from the Guerguerat region or face a compulsory withdrawal.

Rabat – Morocco and Denmark want to develop bilateral cooperation in the fight against terrorism and  illegal migration, said a statement from the department of the Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani. Among other EU countries, Denmark has been facing an increasing flow of migrants in recent years. The number of people charged with being illegal immigrants in the scandinavian country has risen from  877 in 2015 to 1,348  in 2016. The Danish government has taken strict measures against the phenomenon, shifting its focus to repatriation rather than integration. In a meeting on Thursday in Rabat, El Othmani and Danish Parliament speaker, Pia Kjarsggard, brought up the subject of illegal migration. The Head of the Government suggested potential cooperation between the two countries in the field of migration,  praising “Morocco’s distinguished experience in managing the issue of sub-Saharan migrants.” “The kingdom has adopted a development approach through the strengthening of win-win economic partnerships in order to contribute to the development of origin countries,” he said. Denmark has also taken such diplomatic approach, pledging a USD 14 million  for family planning in Sub-Saharan countries, as it could help “limit the migration pressure on Europe,” according to Reuters. During the meeting,  El Othmani commended the Moroccan political model. “Under the leadership of the King, Morocco is an open, plural and democratic country where elections are held on the set dates and whose results are accepted by all parties,” he said. Meanwhile, the Danish Parliament welcomed the stability that characterizes Morocco, saying that the country is both  politically and economically stable. This leads to the prospect of developing  political and economic relations with the Kingdom of Denmark, according to El Othmani.

Rabat – A 46-year-old Moroccan woman was found dead last Friday in the Gargoni Valeggio forest in Verona, northern Italy. Her body was meticulously dismembered into a dozen pieces, according to Italian authorities.  Verona woke up to a gruesome murder on the eve of this new year. Khadija Bencheikha, a Moroccan woman who’s been living in Italy for more than 20 years, surviving on small jobs as a caregiver and cleaning lady, was found savagely dead in what the Italian media describe as a blood chilling murder. A legal immigrant, the victim had no contact with dangerous or suspicious activities, according to the Italian police. The murderer or murderers cut the body of the victim into a dozen pieces, probably with a power saw, sparing the limbs and head, dismembered but found intact.  Her corpse was found with only one item of clothing, an underwear, and was littered in a semicircle, fulling the hypothesis of a macabre ritual in a forest near the highway. On December 29, a woman passing by the scene of the crime noticed the presence of several plastic bags, and quickly notified the police. According to the primary investigations of the authorities, Bencheikha succumbed to her death after receiving a lethal blow to the head. According to the police, the murder took place elsewhere, as there were no traces of blood on the scene where the body was found; a field of vineyards and olive groves, which the killer knew quite well, said the authorities. The murdered didn’t take the care to bury the body parts. According to the authorities, he probably knew that a few hundred meters away from the scene, there is the site of a former military base, now used a landfill frequented by herds of wild boar. If the corpse had not been discovered immediately, the animals would have taken care of it without leaving traces, added the authorities. The police questioned the ex husband of the victim whom she had divorced in 2009 as well as one of her relatives. However, in the absence of incriminating evidence, both men were released.  For the time being, the investigation is still ongoing to uncover the circumstances of this chilling crime, while her murderer(s) are still running free.

Rabat – This Thursday, the Moroccan Executive is expected to review a draft bill concerning the manufacturing and sale of raw and manufactured tobacco during the Government Council held in Rabat.  Bad news for smokers. This new draft law provides for the increase in cigarettes and cigars prices, following the rise in VAT imposed by the government in accordance with the provisions of the 2018 Finance Act. The first increase which affected tobacco prices last July and the that of January 1 will be followed by a third, starting January 1, 2019. These increases of one to two dirhams include the brands Casa, Basic, Kasbah, Blue Olympic and Maghreb. On the other hand, the state and Moroccan tobacco companies want to fight the black market and present “quality” cigarettes, according to the text of the bill. However, these increases could push smokers with limited resources to look for another alternative to their addiction, especially since retail cigarette vendors dominate the market to a large extent.  These price increases might encourage smokers to move to smuggled cigarettes, which will affect Moroccan tobacco companies. Morocco counts over 300,000 retail cigarette sellers in different cities and regions of the country.

Rabat – British gas E&amp;P company SDX Energy announced this Thursday, January 4 that it will abandon the ELQ-1 well located in its Gharb Centre’s permit in Kenitra. The ELQ-1 well has been drilled to a total depth of 1,484 meters and has encountered 22.6 net meters of reservoir interval and two meters of marginal net conventional gas pay.  According to the management of the company, the potential of gas drilled is commercially insufficient to complete the drilling. Thus, the well will be plugged and completely abandoned, while its drilling platform will be relocated to SDX’s ONZ-7 development site.  “Despite the result at ELQ-1, we remain very upbeat about the remainder of our Moroccan drilling campaign, which has already yielded discoveries from the first three of this nine well campaign,” said SDX’s CEO Paul Welch.  “It is important to note that this well is also the only one in the current program drilled using legacy low-resolution 3D data, acquired from the previous operator.” explained Welch, adding that “it was an important test that has strengthened our belief in the need to acquire high resolution 3D seismic data, that we have successfully used in our first three wells, across all of our concessions of interest.” The company is still “optimistic” about the continuation of its operations in Morocco. In total, it plans to drill 9 wells. “The KSR-16 well has already been connected to the sales line and the flow tests are expected to start next week,” said SDX Energy.  SDX was granted a four-month extension to July 22, 2018 at its Lalla Mimouna permit, allowing it sufficient time to evaluate the results of its upcoming exploration drilling campaign, expected to take place in March. SDX is an international oil and gas exploration, production and development company, headquartered in London, England, UK, with a principal focus on North Africa.  In Morocco, SDX has a 75 percent working interest in the Sebou concession situated in the Gharb Basin. In Egypt, SDX has a 50 percent working interest in two producing assets located onshore in the Eastern Desert, adjacent to the Gulf of Suez.  These producing assets are characterised by exceptionally low operating costs making them particularly resilient in a low oil price environment. SDX’s portfolio also includes high impact exploration opportunities in both Egypt and Morocco.

Rabat – The overwhelming majority of Chile’s National Congress voted in support of Morocco’s autonomy initiative for the resolution of the Western Sahara issue, on Wednesday in Valparaiso. With 66 in favor, 11 against, and 22 abstentions considered as favorable votes, Chile’s National Congress approved the Sahara autonomy plan proposed by Morocco. Chilean MPs affirmed that the Moroccan initiative is “a serious and credible effort, which will undoubtedly enable the Sahara population to exercise their right to self-determination, by democratically managing their own affairs through legislative, executive and judicial bodies with exclusive powers under the sovereignty of Morocco.” This is not the first time Chile shows support for Morocco’ autonomy plan. In January 2017,  Claudia Andrea Nogueira Fernandez, chairwoman of the Chile-Morocco friendship parliamentary group said on a visit to Morocco that “Chile has always supported Morocco’s territorial integrity over the Sahara.” In the same year, two Moroccan delegations travelled to Chile to foster cooperation and friendship between the two countries, while exploring various ways to benefit from the partnership.   The United Nations and the entire international community consider Morocco’s autonomy plan as a suitable solution for the final settlement of the Western Sahara dispute. Presented  to the United Nations on April 10, 2007, Morocco’s autonomy proposal has been approved by the Security Council, deeming it as a “an opportunity to advance in the settlement of an issue that is running for more than thirty years now.”

Rabat – In the past few days, rumors about the government’s intention to put an end to free education spread like wildfire on national media and social networks, raising uproar and concern amid the public opinion. Today, the government finally reacted. “Completely untrue” is how the head of the Moroccan government, Saad Eddine El Othmani described the news, reassuring the public opinion that the Executive has no intention whatsoever to abandon free education in public institutions.  In short, this is the general commitment that emerged from the review of the 17-51 draft framework law on  the reform of the Moroccan educational system discussed during the weekly meeting of the Governmental Council held on January 4.  That being said, the government do in fact intended to introduce inscription fees to higher public institution. However, according to El Othmani, this measure will exclusively concern “wealthy families, while exempting the poor, fragile and middle class ones.” On what criteria will the government decide who’s rich enough to pay for an education and who’s not? And will these fees also concern the primary and secondary education?  These questions are yet to be answered. For the time being, El Othmani has vowed to “inform the public of the contents of the draft framework law after the ratification of the final text in the Council of Ministers, and after referring it to Parliament for presentation and discussion by the representatives of the nation.” READ ALSO: Moroccan Government Wants to Put an End to Free Education The 17-51 framework bill comes as a completion of the 2015-2030 strategic vision elaborated by the Higher Council for Education Training and Scientific Research to define the outlines of the future Moroccan schools. If this bill is adopted by the parliament next spring, and if the decrees are quickly implemented, the framework law will come into effect in the fall of 2018-2019. However, even after three years following the development of the strategic vision, a reform is still urgent. The project will have a strategic value as it defines the contours of the future Moroccan educational system. The text brings a lot of novelties with a potentially significant added value. Indeed, the bill deals in particular with curriculums, pedagogical methods, universal values as well as citizenship and patriotism. At first glance, the 10 chapters and 57 articles of the bill present an optimistic picture of what the Moroccan school will look in 15 years. High-schools graduates will have full proficiency in Arabic, fluent in at least two foreign languages, and will be able to perfectly communicate in Amazigh.   However, the flagship provision concerns the end of free higher education. The previous government had already tried a hand at the same subject, when former Minister of Education Lahcen Daoudi discussed the contribution of student families in the funding of certain specialties of higher education, mainly medicine. At the time, these statements had provoked an uproar. Today, the El Othmani government intends to take the issue head on and is much more explicit.

Rabat – Fouzi Lekjaa, President of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) is adamant in his belief that Morocco has the potential to beat the three-nation North American bid to host the 2026 World Cup. For Lekjaa, the word impossible is nothing. Discussing Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup with Moroccan daily Al Massae, the FRMF president said that the process by which the host country of the competition is chosen has changed.  It has now become based on a vote of all members of the FIFA. Lekjaa added that this can be in favor of Morocco, “unlike previous times when only the Executive Committee had the last word about the matter.” Lekjaa said that 104 votes for Morocco will be enough for the country to host the 2026 world tournament. In fact, around 221 national federations at a congress in Moscow will decide who is eligible to host the 23rd FIFA World Cup in June 2018. The candidates’ files should meet FIFA’s technical terms, including infrastructure and commercial criterias.  Candidates will have to submit their complete candidacy files and proposals by March 16. Lekjaa , who is also the 3rd vice president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), said that a Moroccan delegation met with FIFA officials in order to discuss Morocco’s 2026 World Cup candidacy. For the president, FIFA is looking forward to examine candidates proposals, adding that the federation already knows that there are still nine years ahead the tournament. “Those who compare Morocco to the US economically are absolutely wrong,” Lekjaa told Al Massae. FIFA has advised Morocco to build more stadiums with limited capacity, according to Lekjaa. He added that Morocco only needs stadiums that can offer 25,000 seats. “We are obliged to make investments, but they are not heavy ones,” he added. Lekjaa also said that the three-American bidders tried to negotiate for their files to pass without a vote, assuring that he refused the deal after a whole day of talk. In December, Sunil Gulati, president of the US Soccer Federation said that the North American bidders are expecting Morocco to “campaign hard” in order to host the 2026 World Cup. “We expect Morocco to put forward a very good bid […] we expect them to campaign hard,” he said. Morocco submitted its candidacy to host the tournament on August 11, 2017.  The bid was highly endorsed by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) president, Ahmad Ahmad. The 21 first edition of the tournament will take place in Russia in the summer of 2018. The competition will be marked by the participation of Morocco, whose team was absent from the tournament since 1998. Qatar will be the host country of the 22nd edition of the World Cup in 2022.

Rabat – French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to introduce a law to block fake news spread on the internet throughout the upcoming French election campaigns. For Macron, the law against fake news will “protect democracy,” describing it as a threat to “liberal democracies,” reported British news outlet The Guardian. He added that propaganda accounts are broadening their influences around the world, spreading lies about officials, journalists and public figures. In efforts to fight fake news, Macron said that he would set a law that imposes strict rules on social media to reveal the sources of their news content. The president explained that the law will set tough rules throughout election campaigns on social media’s content published online. “We will develop our legal system to protect democracy from fake news,” said the president who was quoted by AFP. The president added that the regulations of this law would give unconditional authority to France’s audiovisual regulator in order to tackle any “destabilization attempted by television channels controlled or influenced by foreign states,” reported British outlet BBC. In the 2017 French presidential elections, Macron’s opponent Marine Le Pen raised unfounded allegations against Macron just days before the election, claiming that the French leader owns offshore banking accounts.  Macron strongly denounced the allegations, describing them as fake news.

Rabat – The draft bill on the controversial Access to Information Act was finally ratified on January 2 by the Justice, Legislation and Human Rights Committee of the Second Chamber of the Moroccan Parliament.  The draft  was on the agenda of the 2nd Chamber for its final adoption on January 2, however, the bill was voted in the presence of only six of the 20 members of the parliament, consisting of the committee headed by the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM).  Four MPs of the majority parties voted in favor of the draft, while two members of the PAM and the Confederation of Democratic Labor party voted against it, pending a vote in the plenary session before being returned to the House of Representatives for ratification in a second reading. The delay in passing this highly controversial act is mainly due to the heated debates between the MPs of both the majority and the opposition parties, who failed to find an agreement on the amendments made to the first version of the text.  In total, around 65 amendment proposals had been handed to the Justice Committee at the second chamber. However, it remains to be seen whether all the proposed amendments will be taken into account, since the first version of the draft was highly criticized.  In fact, its publication was followed by a strong mobilization, notably within the civil society. Some associations have run a real campaign to convince the government to introduce some changes. The National Council for Human Rights has also been vocal in its opposition to the bill. In fact, the opinion of the CNDH had been perceived by MPs as a thinly veiled criticism of certain provisions included by the outgoing government.  For the CNDH, the definitions and the public institutions obliged to provide the information, “must be defined precisely in accordance with the objectives of the draft law in order to ensure access to information.”  The Human Rights Council also stressed the need to specify the status of institutions and private companies entrusted with public service missions, regardless of its form of implementation – whether it is delegated management, concession or public-private partnership – as entities covered by the scope of this article, within the limits of the public service tasks performed by these institutions and enterprises.  With regard to the persons concerned by the right of access to information, the Council had proposed extending the right of access to information by referring to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in its article 19, where the term “person” is used to enshrine the right of access to information.  Also, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights uses in Article 19 the term “individual” to state the same right.  “It is obvious that the use of these different designations of persons concerned by the right of access to information allows the integration of natural and legal persons, Moroccan citizens and foreign nationals residing regularly in Morocco,” stated the CNDH.

Education is always a hot topic, with everyone wondering about Common Core State Standards, budget shortfalls and charter school vouchers. While every parent wants their children to get a good education, the dwindling of funds for public schools is putting this possibility in jeopardy. The current U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has a lot in store for America’s educational system, so everyone should keep an eye on her in 2018. Increasing School Loan Debt Since 2009, student loan debt has doubled to $1.3 trillion. In 2016, the average college student was left with $30,000 in debt, while earnings for new graduates have remained very low. Many of these graduates are struggling to keep up with payments. Thirty percent of 22 million individuals with student loan debt are either delinquent or in default. The GOP tax bill recently passed by the House could worsen this situation, as it would do away with deducts for interest on all student loans. Some college graduates with student loan debt are saying their diploma is “worth little more the paper it is printed on.” As many are struggling to find work, the student loan debt continues to scale upwards. Spending Bill Lingers There is a pretty good chance that everyone has heard about the current tax bill working its way through Congress. It should come as no surprise to learn that the tax bill could have a negative impact on the public education system. The Trump administration has said repeatedly that they wish to place more emphasis on charter schools and that could negatively impact public schools and the funding that they receive. The tax bill curtails state and local tax deductions and that could have a negative impact on city schools. Just recently, the National Education Association put out a study that concluded that the tax bill could likely lead to the loss of $370 billion in state and local revenue. In return, it could ultimately result in the loss of 370,000 education jobs. An amendment by Ted Cruz may potentially help homeschooled students. Nevertheless, those students need money to begin with. The amendment strengthens 529s and allows bigger contributions to such accounts without incurring gift taxes. This expansion further hurts the public education system in the United States. Students dealing with financial difficulties and legal troubles should consider getting a probation violations defense attorney. Oracle Opening A School While the tax bill has hurt public schools, some are not worried about the tax bill. Oracle is a good example of this. The company has put plans in place to open a $43 million public high school on its campus. The company intends to create a public charter school. The $43 million building will be home to a Design Tech High School. The existing charter school is already home to 550 students. If Oracle has their way, those students will be transferred to the new Oracle building. In return, that will give Oracle immediate access to highly educated students that can help strengthen their business in the future. The school is expected to make the switch sometime in early January. There is a good chance that other Silicon Valley companies will follow in a suit in the near future. Sponsored content

Rabat – The Polisario Front has violated the UN’s 2351 resolution on the regulation of the statues of the Guerguerat buffer strip. The separatist group has accessed the Guerguerat region, where they harassed two participants of the Rally Desert Challenge.  Armed elements of the separatist front accessed Wednesday, January 3  the restricted area of Guerguerat, where they intercepted a race vehicle coming from the town of Dakhla, reported Moroccan news outlet Le360. Polisario’s provocative move came following a series of military maneuvers conducted by Polisario near Guerguerat, violating the ceasefire agreement signed by Morocco and the separatist group on November 6, 1991. Le360’s source said that the armed forces of the Polisario have checked the vehicle and verified the identity documents of the Rally Desert Challenge participants before ordering them to continue their journey towards the Mauritanian border. n the past few weeks, the Polisario has been conducting military maneuvers near Guerguerat, with heavy equipment received from the Algerian army. According to Al Massae daily, Polisario’s armed forces conducted a series of military operations near the Guerguerat strip zone. The last military maneuvers were conducted on December 25 in the presence of Algerian army officials. The separatist front stated that this “military parade” was a “special forces” exercise of live ammunition. According to the Moroccan daily, Algerian generals who attended the event supervised the delivery of heavy machinery and equipment to the separatist front, in fulfillment of what they described as “the absolute support provided by Algeria.” The front has been threatening to re-enter the buffer zone since its withdrawal from the region due to the pressure put against it from the UN Security Council in April 2017.

Rabat – The Polisario Front has reportedly sent a letter to Colin Stewart, the newly appointed UN Special Representative for Western Sahara and the New head of MINURSO, threatening to access the restricted zone of Guerguerat. According to a pro-separatist news outlet, the front has urged the UN to “honor its commitments” and to “put pressure on Morocco” to stop “its violations and to implement international legitimacy in the Western Sahara conflict.” It is only through these conditions Polisario claims to maintain “the continuity of the peace process. The Polisario Front has also accused Morocco of violating the UN Security Council resolution on the regulation of the statues of the Guerguerat buffer strip. The Polisario has threatened Morocco and the UN by stating it will reenter and deploy its armed militias in the restricted area of Guerguerat. The separatist group said that “it will not stand idly while there are violations committed by Morocco.” The resolution, which was adopted by the UN on April 28, 2017, underscored the importance of “full respect of the military agreements reached with [ the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara] with regard to the ceasefire and calls on the parties to adhere fully to those agreements.” Stewart arrived in Laayoun on December 28 in order to conduct an evaluation of the mission’s performance in the region. In the past few weeks, the Polisario has been conducting military maneuvers near Guerguerat, with heavy equipment received from the Algerian army. According to Al Massae daily, Polisario’s armed forces conducted a series of military operations near the Guerguerat strip zone. The last military maneuvers were conducted on December 25 in the presence of Algerian army officials. The separatist front stated that this “military parade” was a “special forces” exercise of live ammunition. According to the Moroccan daily, Algerian generals who attended the event supervised the delivery of heavy machinery and equipment to the separatist front, in fulfillment of what they described as “the absolute support provided by Algeria.” The front has been threatening to re-enter the buffer zone since its withdrawal from the region due to the pressure put against it from the UN Security Council. At the end of last month, Polisario’s leader Ibrahim Ghali addressed a letter to  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, accusing Morocco of violating UN’s 2351 resolution of April 28, 2017. In February 2017, Guterres issued a statement, where he called on the “parties to unconditionally withdraw all armed elements from the buffer zone as soon as possible to create an environment conducive to a resumption of the dialogue in the context of the political process led by the United Nations.” Morocco was first to withdraw from the buffer strip on February 2. However, the separatist group did not accept the UN’s request until April 30, after a draft resolution on Western Sahara was submitted “in blue” meaning ready for adoption- to the secretariat of the UN Security Council on Thursday, April 27. The draft resolution put high pressure on Polisario, urging it to withdraw from the Guerguerat region or face a compulsory withdrawal The Security Council expressed its “deep concern with the continued presence of elements of the Polisario Front in the buffer strip in Guerguerat,” asking for its immediate and “unconditional withdrawal from the region.”

Rabat – The Atlas Lions performances during the 2018 World Cup Qualifiers are still mesmerizing international football figures. For Spain’s national football team coach, Julen Lopetegui, Morocco’s national football team is the best in Africa. The international former Spaniard footballer held talks with Spanish daily sports news outlet Marca about his plans for the 2018 World Cup. In the interview, the 51-year old coach talked about La Roja’s Group B opponents: Iran, Morocco and Portugal. As he was speaking about Morocco, Lopetegui said that he believes that Morocco is the best team in Africa, adding that the Atlas Lions “achieved their objective in a wonderful way, without letting in any goals and by knocking out Ivory Coast, one of Africa’s strongest teams.” In the World Cup first round, Morocco has finished unbeaten in front of the continent’s tough teams, including Mali, Gabon and Cote d’Ivoire. This is not the first time Lopetegui expresses his admiration for Morocco’s team performances and achievement. After the World Cup final draw, which took place in Moscow on December 1, Lopetegui said that  “one of the toughest teams, is the Moroccan squad, who excluded the Ivorian team in the World Cup qualifiers.” Speaking about Spain’s future rivals, Lopetegui said that Portugal is the “champion of Europe” as it has “the best players in history, they have a great generation and they have a coach with a lot of experience.” For the Spaniard, the Iranian squad “has been the best team in Asia over the past five years, ahead of Japan and South Korea.” Lopetegui also shared with Marca his vision of what is leadership. For him, leading means “convincing, specifically convincing everyone to give the best that they have in search of a common goal.” He added that football is “a team sport and one of our main strengths is that we have great players who are committed to our common goal, both with the ball and without it.” Morocco will play against Spain on June 25 after facing Iran on June 15 and Portugal on June 20.

Rabat – The issue of unaccompanied minors seems to be an endless predicament for the authorities of the Spanish enclave of Melilla. According to the local government’s estimates, around 3,000 minors live in nearby localities, waiting for an opportunity to access the city. According to the Spanish news agency Europa Press, these minors’ goal is to land in the Iberian Peninsula by crossing through Melilla.  Daniel Ventura, the councilor of social welfare in Melilla’s local government told the news outlet that Morocco is obliged to keep its commitments on immigration by recovering “its minors” and handing them back to their parents. “The number of unaccompanied minors who arrived in Spain via Melilla quadrupled in some autonomous communities such as the Basque Country and Catalonia,” Ventura told Europa Press. The number of minors hosted in the Purísima Reception Center has exceeded 1,500 in 2017, an estimated increase of 300 to 400 children compared to 2016, reports the news outlet. According to Europa Press, some minors prefer to live on the streets and sleep near the busy port of Melilla, waiting for a chance to cross to the other side. The other issue that concerns both the Moroccan and Spanish authorities is the chaotic situation on transit sites between Morocco and Ceuta. However, the figures on migratory pressure relayed by the media confirm that the number of people who crossed to Ceuta illegally decreased by 14 percent in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2017, 2,252 migrants forced their way into the Spanish enclave, while 2,000 of them were able to cross to Europe. In terms of nationality, 1,605 are sub-Saharan migrants, 512 are Algerians and 126 are from other nationalities. According to the source, February and August saw the largest influxes into the city.  On February 17, 2017, 500 migrants had forced the fence separating Morocco from the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. During this attempt, 11 Civil Guards and 25 migrants were injured. Three days later, another attempt was made. This time, 300 migrants were able to access the city.  At the beginning of August 2017, 260 migrants were able to do the same. During the Christmas and New Year holidays, many sub-Saharan migrants tried to force Ceuta’s wire fence, but to no avail; the Moroccan authorities aborted each of these attempts.

Rabat – El Othmani’s government will soon adopt a draft decree granting 70 hectares of state land to the General Confederation of Enterprises of Morocco (CGEM) for the construction of a free export zone in the south of Morocco. However, the decision is being strongly criticized by the Justice and Development Party (PJD). The project responds to “a request” from the wali of the Laayoune-Boujdour-Sakia Al Hamra region, addressed to the Ministry of Industry and requesting the transfer of 70 hectares to the CGEMl, said Moroccan newspaper Al Massae in its January 1 issue. “This decision came after the request of certain investors affiliated to the CGEM companies wishing to benefit from this important lot of land for their investment projects in the region,” says the text of the decree, according to the daily. However, since this land is part of the State’s domain, it was necessary to obtain the agreement of the State Property Directorate, and the various parties concerned within the Ministry of Equipment, transport, logistics and water. For the PJD MP, Ibrahim Daif, “this decision is not reasonable.”  “The state can not allow the construction of a free export zone without conducting the necessary studies. The government will only pass this decree because the CGEM wants it,” reported Al Massae quoting Daif. According to the newspaper, other elected officials also oppose this decision, saying that they would make their opinions known “when the time comes.”

Rabat – Minister of Energy, Mining and Sustainable Development, Aziz Rabbah said Tuesday in Rabat that between 2003 and 2017, investments in Jerada have to amounted to MAD 12.3 billion. “Over 220 projects were planned to enhance the infrastructure of the city, for an overall budget of about MAD 1.543 billion,” Rebah said at the House of Councilors. The  economic sectors, with 28 projects, required a budget of over MAD 10 million, particularly the energy sector.  In the social field, investments were allocated for 111 projects for a budget of MAD 380 million, in addition to 336 projects carried under the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) worth MAD 340 million, he added. The minister also said that after the closure of Jerada’s mine, the government signed a collective agreement to compensate the miners, amounting to MAD 2.2 billion, specifying that 4,647 employees received compensation worth over MAD 1.3 billion. As to the economic activity created after the closure of the mine, Rebah said that over 100 people are currently working in Jerada Thermal Power Plant’s units.  The minister added that the government intends to establish a  fourth unit worth MAD 3 billion, which will create an additional 400 jobs for the local population. The government also plans to build a fifth power station in Jerada, as well as the extension of the Beni Mathar power plant, to improve its productivity and increase the number of jobs. However,  Esmahan Ait Ben Heda, president of the Human Rights Center in Jerada told Morocco World News that the  onlypower plant in questions employs workers from outside of Jerada. “It doesn’t make any sense that while Jerada’s youth are very bright and willing to work, the factory  owners employ people from outside of the region. And to make things worse, we pay up to MAD 1000 for the electricity bill, when most people are too poor to afford electronics or even use light bulbs,” she said. Ten days prior to the death of Houcine and Jedouane Dioui, two miners who drowned in the flooding of an underground mining well, Jerada was already flustered by a series of protests against high priced electricity and water bills. “How can you expect people to pay expensive bills when they barely make enough to feed themselves and their children. The golden days of Jerada ended in the 90s, people now live in utter tragedy,” Ahmed Belatay, member of the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH) told Morocco World News, calming the miners never received the compensations after the closure of the mine.

Rabat – Hakim Benchamas, speaker of Morocco’s House of Councilors sued four journalists and a member of the parliament after they “leaked classified information” to the media on the work of a fact-finding committee regarding the Moroccan pension fund. The public prosecutor of Rabat’s Court of First Instance has summoned Abdelhak Belashkar, director of Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum, Mohammed Ahddad, a journalist in Al Massae daily, and Kaoutar Zaki and Mohammed Sakhir, journalists at Al Jarida 24’s news website.   The journalist will attend the first hearing session on January 25, according to Moroccan daily Akhbar Al Yaoum. The court has also summoned parliamentary Abdelhak Hissan, a member of the House of Councilors for “disclosing secret information” and his involvement in “leaking information related to the work of the committee.” Benchamas sued the journalists and the MP for leaking confidential information about the findings of the ongoing investigation on alleged cases of corruption at the Moroccan Pension Fund (CMR). The proceedings were issued based on Article 14 of the 085.13 Organic Law. This law charges any person who is involved in leaking information on the fact-finding committee to MAD 1000 to MAD 10.000 fines as well as prison terms of one to five years. The complaint is also based on articles 446 and 129 of the Penal Code, which denounce complicity in cases of an offense classified as a crime and the disclosure of secret respectively.  This is not the first time Benchamas files a complaint against journalists. Last summer, the judicial police summoned Sakhir and Zaki after a complaint filed by Benchamass for leaking information on the “imbalances in Morocco’s pension fund during the work of the parliamentary fact-finding commission,” according to Moroccan daily Akhbar Al Yaoum. Morocco’s House of Councillors (upper house of the Moroccan parliament) created the fact-finding committee on pension fund in 2016 at the request of the Democratic Confederation of Labour to investigate the financial works of pension funds.

Rabat – The city of Fez woke up to a new sexual scandal involving a French tourist. Tuesday night, local authorities arrested the 58-year-old foreigner for sexually molesting two Moroccan minors aged 10 and 13-year-old.  The Prefectural Police Department of Fez arrested on Tuesday a 58-year-old French tourist suspected of sexually assaulting two underage girls, said the Directorate General of National Security (DGSN). The elements of the Fez tourist police brigade intervened late Tuesday in a tailoring workshop in the medina after a group of citizens gathered around the French national, says DGNS in a statement. The first elements of the investigation indicate that the suspect resided with the family of one of the two victims, added the statement, noting that a sex toy was seized from his belonging.  The suspect and the owner of the tailoring workshop were placed in custody and made available to the investigation conducted under the supervision of the competent prosecutor to determine the circumstances of this case, said the statement.

Rabat – Three years after its elaboration, the framework bill intended to reform Morocco’s education will finally see the light of day. However, far from amending the flaws of a devastated system, the draft bill wants to put an end to free education.  The only silver lining of an otherwise failing educational system will soon no longer be. Presented December 26 to the government, the 17-51 framework bill comes as a completion of the 2015-2030 strategic vision elaborated by the Higher Council for Education Training and Scientific Research to define the outlines of the future Moroccan schools.  If this bill is adopted by the parliament next spring, and if the decrees are quickly implemented, the framework law will come into effect in the fall of 2018-2019. However, even after three years following the development of the strategic vision, a reform is still urgent.  The project will have a strategic value as it defines the contours of the future Moroccan educational system. The text brings a lot of novelties with a potentially significant added value. Indeed, the bill deals in particular with curriculums, pedagogical methods, universal values as well as citizenship and patriotism. At first glance, the 10 chapters and 57 articles of the bill present an optimistic picture of what the Moroccan school will look in 15 years. High-schools graduates will have full proficiency in Arabic, fluent in at least two foreign languages, and will be able to perfectly communicate in Amazigh.   However, the flagship provision concerns the end of free education. The previous government had already tried a hand at the same subject, when former Minister of Education Lahcen Daoudi discussed the contribution of student families in the funding of certain specialties of higher education, mainly medicine.  At the time, these statements had provoked an uproar. Today, the El Othmani government intends to take the issue head on and is much more explicit. “Inscription fees will be instilled in some majors of higher public education institutions,” an official at the Ministry of Education told Morocco World News under the condition of anonymity.  According to MWN’s source, secondary education will suffer the same fate, but in a second step. “These fees will take into account the income of families.” While this project insists that education will remain free and compulsory for children from 4 to 15 years old, the text speaks further of the role of public authorities in the diversification of funding resources of the education system.  Furthermore, the bill encourages the state to appeal to “national and sectoral solidarity.” The project is made even more explicit by mentioning the parties that will contribute to financing, in particular “wealthy families, local authorities, institutions and public enterprises and the private sector.”  For the moment, the project does not accurately predict how this contribution will be collected. The latter will probably be fixed by regulation. That said, the draft bill implies that the contributions will go directly to a support fund dedicated to the generalization and improvement of the quality of compulsory education. In short, education until the age of 15 will be free in the public sector. Beyond this, the text in its current version opens the door to the payment of registration fees and probably other costs in universities and their various faculties in addition to institutions and other establishments of higher education, as well as qualifying teaching, namely high schools.  However, what the average Moroccan with limited income will retain first and foremost from this project, is this unexpected and unwanted gift from the Executive, under the leadership of the head of government, Saadeddine El Othmani.  Education in Morocco remains a major problem in a country that still has to find a balance between an expensive private sector for the majority of Moroccans and a devastated and taxed public school.

Rabat – Five detainees of the Rif Hirak movement, including Nasser Zefzafi allegedly refused to appear before Casablanca’s Appeal court on Tuesday, January 2, according to Moroccan media. Hakim El Ouardi, a public prosecutor said that he received a report from the director of the Ain Sebaa prison, saying that Zefzafi and three other detainees refused to attend the hearing. “The defendants were examined by the prison doctor, who affirmed that their health conditions are normal and stable, but they refused to attend the trial,” added El Ouardi. The prosecutor condemned the activists’ refusal to appear before the court, stating that this strategy will “hinder the progress of the trial.” The prosecutor also asked the court to issue a warning to the defendants, saying that he will bring the detainees by force if they persist in their refusal. The lawyers of the Hirak detainees, Mohamed Aghanaj denied the content of the report presented to the general prosecutor, saying that Zefzafi “personally insisted on his willingness to appear at the hearing.” The trial restarted around 14:30 p.m. and the five defendants were brought back from Oukacha prison to the trial’s room. On Tuesday, December 26 the Hirak detainees trial was postponed. The activist’s defense committee informed the judge of the trial that detainees are carrying out “mass strike” due to the “ill-treatment” and “deliberate collective punishment” they claim to be subjected to by prison officials. A prominent leader of the Hirak movement, Nasser Zefzafi has demanded the court “to accelerate his execution through a death penalty.” Zefzafi said that he is ready to be executed starting tomorrow. “I would die as a martyr for this country.” “Any victory is greater than this. We have left children, young men, and women behind us. They will win back this country,” he said inside the courtroom. The detained Hirak activists are facing a variety of charges, including “undermining the internal security of the state,” according to Casablanca’s court.

Rabat – Moroccan-French comedian Jamel Debbouze fell prey to embezzlement by his assistant, who stole nearly half a million euros by forging his signature.  The story dates back  to 1999. By then, Debbouze had already achieved national fame in France. In a country far away from home, Jamal meets Nadia, a 26 year old self-taught, manager of fast food chain McDonald’s, recounts French Media Business BFM. Both of Moroccan descent, their common origin bonds them. Conversation kicks off and Nadia tells him that she has worked for the tax department, and offers to look into the accounts of his company, Kissman Productions. Seeing that Debouze is buying her lies, Nadia makes a blind bet and plays a bold card: she tells him that his agent and partner, Jacques Massadian, has “stolen money from him.” She wins. Soon after, Jamel recruited her as a financial assistant, and gradually entrusted her with more and more tasks.  In December 1999, he asked her to open a deposit of EUR 134,071 in a new bank account at the CIC bank. Nadia complies, and opens the account in the absence of Debbouze. She imitates the comedian’s signature, and takes the opportunity to obtain a false power of attorney on the account. She also gives the bank Debbouze’s expired passport dating to 1994.  She provides the address of Jamel’s parents in Trappes, knowing that this move would allow her to pick up the letters of the bank from Debbouze’s parents, without complications. During the following months, Nadia made 14 transfers from his account to that of her family.  Nadia began to enjoy playing the copycat. Pushing her abilities further, she imitated  Debbouze’s signature and stole EUR 466,672 in six months from Kissman company. In June 2000, the CIC warned Debbouze about the abnormal operations of his account. He learnt that out of EUR  80,000 he received for an advertisement with Maroc Telecom, he’s left with only EUR 3,810. Debbouze rearranges his cards and gets prepared to play. He contacts Nadia, who assures him that she will explain everything to him, before disappearing.  He files a criminal complaint. Two trials are held. In the first, Nadia introduces herself as a “professional golfer.” She declares an income of EUR 120,000 thanks to her new job as a manager of a DIY store in Tangier. Nadia acknowledges the false signatures, but assures “to have done everything at the request of Debbouze.” She claims that Debbouze was unable to  manage his financial transactions because he was on tour.  She adds that she was the comedian’s agent and negotiated his contracts for TV shows, movies and  investments, including the purchase of a house in Bordeaux for EUR 260,000 and a riad in Marrakech for EUR 750,000. “The misappropriated money was in fact my pay for serving as his agent,” she said. Jamel denies her claims and the judges are not convinced either.  “Miss Nadia has no legal document proving that she took part in the negotiation of contracts.  Mr. Debbouze’s tours do not prevent him from writing,” the judge said.  In her defense, Nadia also provides investigators with a series of invoices and receipts, as proof of expenses she paid for Jamel. These consist of stretch marks creams, cellulite, toothpaste, towels, cleaning products, diapers, trips to New York and Marrakech.  “A pile of papers without probative value,” say the judge. “These documents are actually expenses incurred in the interest of Nadia or her family, and are far from covering the sums of money depleted from Debouzze’s account.”  On June 6, 2007, the district court sentenced Nadia to 18 months in prison,  for “forgery , counterfeiting and falsification of checks.”  She was fined to pay the misappropriated sums, plus EUR 4,000 euros for the legal costs, and another EUR 3,000 to compensate the moral damage. Nadia appeals, however, her request backfires. The judge sees that his sentence was too lenient, and on February 26, 2010, the appeal court increases the suspended sentence to two years.  Unfortunately for Debbouze, his trickster assistant has already spent a large amount of the plundered money.  She bought a used Mercedes at EUR 18,300, and an apartment in Marrakech, a few kilometers from Debbouze’s villa.

Rabat – After a growth rate of 3.8 percent during the fourth quarter of 2017, the national economy should experience a sharp slowdown during the first three months of 2018, as the growth rate is expected to fall to 2.6 percent. The High Commission for Planning (HCP) is not optimistic for 2018. In terms of prospects for this beginning of the year, the HCP expects a slowdown in growth during the first three months of 2018 to 2.6 percent, as a result of the downturn in agricultural activities in comparison with the notable performances achieved in 2017. “Unlike the previous agricultural campaign, which was characterized by favorable weather conditions for early crops, the 2017/2018 crop year will be characterized by less abundant autumn rainfall, the effects of which would be more noticeable in the area sown to cereals and pulses, but also at the level of irrigated crops,” reported the HCP. The source revealed that the filling rate of agricultural dams stood in mid-December 2017 at its lowest levels in the last six seasons, at 32 percent. “The return to normal winter weather conditions should limit the fall in agricultural value added to -3.1 percent year-on-year, in the first quarter of 2018, instead of an increase of 14.2 percent in 2017.” In terms of non-agricultural value added, the HCP expect an acceleration of its growth in the first quarter of 2018, benefiting from an improvement in the business climate in the advanced economies and which would result in a 4.5 percent increase in world demand addressed to Morocco. While the HCP set the 2018 growth rate at 2018, for the rest of the year, everything will depend on the rainfall situation in the coming months, and the possibility for the agricultural sector to catch up with some of the delay lived at the beginning of the current season. In 2017, the Moroccan economy performed rather well as the growth rate stood at 3.9 percent by the end of 2017, compared to 1.2 percent a year earlier. These achievements were recorded in a context where foreign demand addressed to Morocco strengthened by 5.1 percent, in the fourth quarter of 2017, in line with the evolution of world trade. The HCP also stated that the trade balance deficit declined by 3.4 percent while the coverage rate increased by 2.6 points to 57.6 percent. “The relief of this deficit would have resulted from the less significant increase of imports compared to exports,” explained the HCP. Exports, up 15 percent, benefited mainly from the good performance of exports of crude phosphate and natural and chemical fertilizers. With respect to domestic demand, the HCP noted that it continued its upward trend that began in 2016, despite a context of a slight rise in consumer prices. The increase in local demand resulted in a 4.2 percent increase in imports of consumer goods from households.

Rabat – Twenty-one people are believed to have been killed in Iran during the ongoing unrest and demonstrations against “weak economy” and “corruption.” A series of demonstrations broke out between Iranian protesters and the country’s authorities on December 27, 2017 in Iran’s major cities, including Tehran and Mashhad. Protesters took to the street to denounce to corruption and rising prices of goods, as well as the country’s “involvement in conflicts” in the Middle East, according to international media. Protesters are flocking the country’s streets, chanting slogans against Iran’s President, Hassan Rouhani as well as Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader. During the weekend, Iranian law enforcement arrested hundreds of activists who were taking part in the protests. On Tuesday, January 2, the state TV reported the death of six citizens during an attack on a police station in the town of Qahdarijan. Ilna news agency said that 450 people were arrested in Tehran since Saturday. Authorities have not, however, revealed the total number of people arrested during the protests. On Monday, Rouhani held talks with Iran’s members of parliaments, acknowledging protesters’ anger over the country’s economy. However, the president warned that “the government would not hesitate to crackdown on those it considered lawbreakers,” according to British news outlet The Guardian. For their part, Iran’s officials insisted that the meeting with parliamentarians was held before the unrest. US President Donald Trump, who has been vowing to withdraw from the Obama-era nuclear agreement with Iran, said that this latter “is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration.” Trump added in a tweet that “the Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food and for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted,” adding that it is “time for change!”  Iran’s ongoing demonstrations are the largest in the country since 2009, when protests broke out against the results of the 2009 Iranian presidential election in support of opposition candidates Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi. The protests, dubbed “Iranian Green Movement,” took place in major cities from June 2009 into early 2010.

Rabat – Expectations are high for Morocco’s attacking midfielder Sofiane Boufal. The 24-year old doesn’t seem to be worried about facing the 2018 World Cup future opponents. The footballer, who is currently playing for English club Southampton, said in an interview with BBC that “the most important thing now is to have a good World Cup.”  For Boufal, all that the Atlas Lions have to do is to “play without pressure.” “We have nothing to lose.” The youngster expressed his will to do well with his Premier League club in order to enhance the possibility of being part of the World Cup selection. “I want to have a good session and help my club (Southampton)  to be in better position and also have a good season to be part of the World Cup team.” Boufal has scored twice during his 18 appearances with Southampton. The English club signed Boufal in August 2016 on a five-year contract for a GBP 16 million from French team, Lille. The French-born player did not make his debut with the English club until October due to his knee injury. “I passed the difficult moment and all is behind me now. I want to focus on the future now that I am feeling better,” Boufal told BBC. Boufal added that he feels fit, expressing his hope to continue to progress. “But the most important thing is the team.” The footballer made his debut with the Moroccan national team in March 2016 in a 1-O African Cup of Nations qualification victory against Cape Verde. He also made two appearances with the Moroccan team in 2017 in two friendly matches against Tunisia and Burkina Faso. Before World Cup qualifier game against Cote d’Ivoire, Morocco’s football team manager, Herve Renard called up the youngster to serve his national duty. Boufal is expected to take part in the world tournaments’ next phase, which is scheduled to take place in Russia next summer.  Morocco was placed in Group B along with Spain, Portugal and Iran. International football figures have called this pot “the deadly group.” Moroccan footballers and their coach, however, are determined to make greater achievements during the next phase of the tournaments. Renard said after the World Cup final draw, which took place in Moscow on December 1, that although the Atlas Lions are going to play against “monsters,” his team needs to beat the best in order to grow up.”

The most popular destinations go by air, with 44 percent of trips, said Nathalie Meert, spokesman for tour operator Thomas Cook, quoted by the newspaper. She said short-haul flights to the south, including Spain, the Canary Islands, and Morocco, won the most votes.

Rabat – Morocco’s economic growth grazed the 4 percent in the last quarter of 2017. Supported by the healthy rebound in agricultural activities, national economic growth reached 3.8 percent in 2017, compared to 1.2 percent in 2016. According to the latest note of the High Commission for Planning (HCP), this progress is due to the 14.5 percent increase in agricultural value added, compared with a 13.6 percent decline in 2016. On the other hand, value added of the secondary sector marked a 2.7 percent compared to 0.8 percent in 2016. According to the HCP, this growth is mainly due to the improvement of the mining industries activities with a 17.8 percent growth against a 1.6 percent decline in 2016. The processing industries also played a key role in boosting national growth, registering a 1.6 percent increase in 2017, compared to 0.4 percent in 2016. However, the growth rate of tertiary sector slowed to 2.6 percent instead of 3.1 percent in 2016. With the exception of education, health and social work services showing a decrease of 1.8 percent in 2017 instead of a 2.4 percent increase a year earlier, posts and telecommunications activities slowdown to 2.1 percent instead of 4.8 percent in 2016. Overall, the value added of non-agricultural activities increased by 2.7 percent instead of 2.3 percent during the same period in 2016, says the HCP, noting that despite the sharp slowdown in taxes on the net revenues of subsidies at 1.6 percent instead of 9.9 percent, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by volume grew by 3.8 percent during the 3rd quarter of 2017 instead of 1.3 percent a year before. The GDP grew by 3.3 percent in the third quarter of 2017 at current prices, thus the rise in the general price level was down 0.5 percent instead of 2.1 percent in the same period in 2016. At the same time, this growth was supported by final consumption and foreign trade, according to HCP, stating that exports of goods and services posted an increase of 10.5 percent in the 3rd quarter of 2017 instead of 2.2 percent a year ago, while imports experienced a sharp slowdown to 1.5 percent from 17.1 percent in 2016. In addition, another feature of the national economy in the third quarter of 2017 is the sharp underperformance of gross investment which fell by 5.3 percent instead of an increase of 18.1 percent in 2016. This decline marked a negative contribution to growth of 1.8 points instead of 5.5 points, during the same quarter of the previous year.

Rabat – Saudi Arabia and Emirates are no longer a safe haven for business owners. For the first time, the Gulf countries introduced the Value Added Tax (VAT) effective the first day of 2018 to boost their revenues. On January 1, Saudi Arabia and Emirates set a VAT on most goods and services in order to enhance revenues after the drop in oil prices, reported British news outlet BBC. Saudi Arabia, which is among the world’s largest exporter of oil, announced on Sunday evening respective increase of 127 percent and 83 percent on the prices of different types of petrol. The two Gulf countries are setting a new strategy to find new revenue sources and to reduce their budget deficit due to the steady decline in the price of oil. The increase in petrol prices aims at “ensuring the optimal utilization of national natural resources, according to Saudi News Agency (SPA). The five-percent tax will be applied to food and non-food items, including clothes, electronic devices, petrol, phone and electricity bills. The strategy was proposed in June 2016 between the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC): Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, and Qatar. The 5 percent Value Added Tax is expected to raise the countries’ revenue to USD 21 billion in 2018, equivalent to two percent of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The Saudi Finance Ministry expects a gain of about USD 6.3 million in 2018. In December, the Kingdom adopted its budget for 2018, forecasting about USD 209 billion in revenue. Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, and Qatar have decided to postpone the use of VAT until 2019.

Rabat – If you are a sky gazing lover, do not miss the opportunity to enjoy tonight’s supermoon. On Monday, January 1, the night sky will be graced with the first supermoon in 2018. 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter than usual, the night spectacle is a sight to see. This phenomenon happens when the moon is at its closest spot to earth, thus becoming more bigger and brighter in the sky. This will be not the only supermoon of the month. The glowing show will be repeated on January 31.  Dubbed “blue moon” for being the second full moon during the same month. This moon will look reddish, because it will cause a total lunar eclipse, also known as a Blood Moon, on the morning of January 31. The distance of the moon varies each month between approximately 357,000 and 406,000 kilometers due to its elliptical orbit around the earth. The moon needs two key elements to occur. First, it needs to be at its closest approach or perigee to the earth during its 27-day orbit. The moon also has to be full, a phenomenon that happens every 29.5 days when the sun fully illuminates the moon. Supermoons occur only a few times per year. December 2017 was the only month when the supermoon occurred last year. 2018, however, is bringing more supermoons, with two occurring in the same month (January 1, January 31). The supermoon word was first noted in 1979 in a magazine called Dell Horoscope. The article was written by astrologer  Richard Nolle, who arbitrarily defined supermoons as “a new or full moon which occurs with the moon at or near (within 90 percent of) its closest approach to Earth in a given orbit.”  The astrologer, however, did not explain his 90 percent theory. In short, supermoon for Nolle happens when all earth, moon, and sun are all in a direct line, with the moon in its nearest approach to earth. On September 27, 2015, the supermoon came in conjunction with a lunar eclipse “blood moon.” The moon glowed up with brownish-red due to the light, which was reflected from earth. The former supermoon eclipse that happened in the world occurred in 1982, while the next one is scheduled to take place in 2033. In 2016, the earth witnessed three supermoons in a row during the three last months of the year. November 30’s supermoon was the closest supermoon, with A distance of 356,508 kilometers from earth. This supermoon was the closest full moon to earth in 69 years after that one of January 26, 1948, according to Space.com.

Essaouira has been the home of Jewish heritage and is therefore a place, where Jewish of the world meet annually to celebrate the Hiloula of Rabbi Haim Pinto. In 2001, Medina of Essaouira was added to the World Heritage list of UNESCO. The city also hosts one of the most important festivals, which attract both local and international visitors every year. Every year, the beautiful coastal city devotes its maze of streets and lovely beaches to music for the Gnaoua and World Music Festival. 2017 marked the 20th birthday of the event, bringing together a mixture of Moroccan, African and international artists to celebrate the music of Gnaoua.
