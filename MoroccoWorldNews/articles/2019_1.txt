rabat – Yellow-clothed protesters in Tindouf are venting their anger at Algeria for restricting freedom of movement in the territories, according to reports in pro-Polisario outlets. The demonstrators, who earlier today gathered in front of the general secretariat of the Polisario Front in Rabouni.  According to reports, Algiers recently confiscated a number of passports from Tindouf locals who came to visit from European countries, where many of the region’s Diaspora live and work. “The passport is a travel document that must be returned to its owner as soon as it the police stamps it,” local reports quoted demonstrators as saying. Others accused the Algeria police of extortion.   Not content with confiscating their passports at checkpoints, the police generally ask passport owners for money, threatening them with extending the delay for the return of their documents. Algerian authorities generally keep confiscated passports for up to a month.  “We are obliged to stay in Tindouf in one month,” a protester fumed, complaining that in most cases they are only allowed two or three weeks of vacation from their jobs in Europe. “Confiscating our passports for one month is just unacceptable,” another said.

Rabat – “Not long ago, a woman confided a terrible secret to Zineb Hidra,” starts an Elle article on the new wave of female Moroccan Islamic clerics impacting the lives of women. “Hidra,” the article continued, “listened calmly, but when she answered, her voice burned with conviction.”  As one of the mourchida, the beneficiaries of a recent program launched under the auspices of King Mohammed VI to train women in Islamic law and tradition, Hidra’s tasks at the Ain Chock mosque in Casablanca include teaching lessons, offering counsel, and consoling the sick and bereaved.  Trained in theology, history, philosophy, psychology, and Islamic law at the Mohammed VI Institute in Rabat, the mourchida are given license to deliver on religious matters, especially topics pertaining to the status of women in the Islamic tradition.  Although prohibited from leading prayers, the responsibilities of a mourchida are “otherwise similar to those of an imam,” the article noted.  A response to the proliferation of extremism post-2001, the mourchida initiative is part of broader reforms launched by King Mohammed VI to safeguard Morocco’s tradition of open and tolerant Islam. The need to arm the country’s clerics with solid theological foundations became more pressing after a terrorist attack in Casablanca in 2003. “In a country that had long prided itself on its tolerant interpretation of Islam, the devastating attack convinced Morocco’s head of government, King Mohammed VI, to create a program to train spiritual guides,” Elle elaborated. But the need for spiritual guides also “dovetailed” with an even more pressing need to revise women’s status in society. A year after the Casablanca terrorist strike, the country revised its Family Code, raising the minimum female marriage age to 18 and granting women the right to divorce. “I told her that she must try to get him help. And then I insisted that if he didn’t change, she must divorce him,” Hidra said of the woman who confided the “terrible secret” about an abusive and alcoholic husband. But female spiritual guides do not only work on education and awareness-raising about women’s status. Well versed in Islamic texts and armed with robust training in subjects like philosophy and psychology, they are constantly on the lookout to detect and curb extremism. With its emphasis on Islam as a tolerant religion and jihad as an internal struggle, the Mohammed VI Institute is “a sort of inoculation against radicalization,” according to Elle. The success of Morocco’s initiative has resonated with many countries. France and a sizable number of sub-Saharan countries are sending their next generation of imams to be trained at the Rabat institute.  Like Nigeria and Mali, the other countries well-represented in the institute’s student body, France seeks to import Morocco’s successful model of a diversity-friendly and anti-radicalization state-sponsored Islam.  Despite the success of the program in revising a number of traditional social codes on women’s rights, it is hard to categorize the program’s working philosophy as feminist.  While from the inside graduates and trainees show reluctance to be labeled feminists, outside critics, without writing off the program’s relative success in advancing women’s status, doubt its commitments to radically transforming the lot of Moroccan women. Asma Lamrabat, a renowned Moroccan female cleric who recently resigned from the Mohammedia League of Scholars or the Ulema, Morocco’s highest ranking religious body, said that the program still has a patriarchal undercurrent.  Ann Marie Wainscott, a Miami University political scientist, agreed with Lamrabat. She told Elle that it is doubtful whether gender equality is the program’s real agenda. ”The training the mourchidat receive is quite good, and like all state employment, the jobs they get afterward are stable and well-paid. So in that sense, it increases their status,” Wainscott said. She elaborated, “But the creation of the mourchidat was first and foremost a strategic move on the part of the Moroccan government to extend the reach of the religious bureaucracy. It’s not really about empowering women.” Asked whether she would become an imam if granted the permission, mourchida Fatima Ait Said, from the Makka Mosque in Rabat, shrugged off the question. “There is no example of women imams in the Quran.”  But that the mourchidat program is not strictly egalitarian is no reason to whitewash the “hugely impressive” and “revolutionary” changes it has made in the lives of many women, the article remarked. By instilling confidence in female clerics to take on some of the burning issues of Moroccan society by providing much-needed social, psychological, and religious support to women in need, the program has paid dividends in the lives of many, Ait Sad explained. She said, “Women are the heart of the family, it is they who shape behavior. The most important thing we do as mourchidat is transmit ideas to them, so that women can become the solution to problems. The men will follow.” Labels should not be the point, Hidra said, explaining that categories like “feminist” often fail to capture the impact of the work mourchidat are doing. What should matter, Hidra contends, is the actual struggle for the rights of women, especially those in need of support. “Feminists care about the rights of women…. And we also care about the rights of women. Just from a different point of view, an Islamic point of view,” she said.

Rabat – A Vogue writer Lane Nieset has published a travel feature on Oualidia, a coastal village in the El Jadida region of Morocco. She dubbed the village the “Montauk of Morocco,” comparing Oualidia to the famous surf town in New York that draws crowds every summer. She also comparer Oualidia to another famous travel destination, St. Tropez, saying that Oualidia “draws jetsetters each summer, chic Marrakshis and Casablancais still mimic the royals in August” just like St.Tropez. Among the benefits of visiting this seaside town, she listed its temperatures and conditions that allow for year-round surfing.  She mentioned that unlike Taghazout, Oualidia remains relatively unknown to tourists, and remains relatively uncrowded.  Of course, there’s more to Oualidia than surfing; Nieset also highlighted that its a great place to birdwatch in the spring and autumn bonds as 400 species of birds migrate via the village. Excellent cuisine and local seafood are also on offer, as Oualidia is home to 7 oyster farms. “While Essaouira’s UNESCO-listed medina … and beach resorts may be a more common pairing with Marrakech, Oualidia’s noticeable lack of hotels is part of the village’s charm.”

Rabat – Diplomats who received a briefing on the ongoing Western Sahara talks have expressed confidence that the Horst Kohler-led process could set up unprecedented overtures in the 43-year-old territorial conflict. Horst Kohler, the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy spearheading the negotiations, has told his entourage that he expects positive returns from the series of meetings scheduled in the coming weeks and months, Al Jazeera reported yesterday. On Tuesday, Kohler briefed the UN Security Council on the Western Sahara question, reiterating his commitment to brokering a settlement in the decades-long territorial dispute. The second Geneva meeting, a follow-up to the first meeting that convened Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and the Polisario Front in early December, is scheduled for March.  But Kohler is said to be preparing to hold separate meetings with the four parties before March. Christoph Heusgen, Germany’s permanent ambassador to the UN, said that the Kohler-led process is different than any other the UN has tried since the dispute broke out 43 years ago. In terms of the confidence-building measures that Kohler’s team has so far established, there is hope that the conflicting parties will come to an agreement, Heusgen said. “I do see hope. The unity of the Security Council is a very important factor. This is a conflict we can resolve.” Although his country has openly vowed to use its two-year term as a non permanent member of the UNSC to advance the Polisario Front’s independence claims, Jerry Matjila, South Africa’s ambassador to the UN, also expressed hope in the ongoing process. “It’s very positive that the parties are talking,” Matjila said. According to Matjila, there has been a perceptible change in recent years in how discussions to broker a lasting peace are held. One aspect of the changes, he noted, “is that the parties now respect one another.” The South African official was referring to years when the prospect of the four parties sitting at the same table would have been laughed off by most diplomats. Back then, Algeria and Mauritania would strongly deny having any role whatsoever in the dispute, while Morocco and the Polisario Front seemed to irreversibly doubt each other’s motives. Even though the hostility shows no sign of abating any time soon, there now is hope that conflicting parties will be more pragmatic in their demands and expectations from the UN-led process, according to UN diplomats. “Heusgen said there was a lot of support in the Security Council for Kohler’s proposal to look at different confidence-building measures at the March meeting, including demining and arranging family reunions,” the Al Jazeera report noted.  For the upbeat mood within Kohler’s team, there remain red lines that will considerably define how the process ends and whether the hope Kohler has so far generated will bear fruit. Omar Hilale, Morocco’s permanent representative to the UN, said that the country’s 2007 Autonomy Plan is the ultimate concession. He said the plan grants locals “large operative power” under Moroccan sovereignty, and Rabat is not considering making any further concessions. “On this basis, we are ready to negotiate it and give the largest operative power possible for the autonomy. Outside autonomy, nothing. We are not ready to negotiate anything,” Hilale said. Meanwhile, Polisario’s UN representative, Sidi Omar, said the front’s “position is very clear.” He said that the front’s main demand is self-determination through referendum. In spite of the deeply rooted divergences between the parties’ demands and expectations, others are still hopeful that a commonly agreed upon settlement can be incrementally reached once the confidence-building process is completed. “I think one of the lessons in diplomacy, and on this issue in particular, is each step at a time,” France’s Ambassador to the UN Francois Delattre said.

Rabat – Berlin’s foreign office has issued safety instructions for German tourists traveling to Morocco, which the German embassy in Rabat published on January 31. Germany warned against traveling to “the border regions with Algeria and generally beyond paved roads.” The instructions made an exception for routes to the near-border towns of Zagora, Erfoud, and Merzouga, some of the most popular tourist areas in southeastern Morocco for experiencing the Sahara desert. However, the German authorities recommended that trekking tours in the mountainous regions and off-road tours in the desert areas of Zagora and Merzouga “should only be undertaken in groups and with registered local guides.” “The security situation for such tours should also be queried daily by the Moroccan police authorities.” The German foreign office feared risks of terrorist attacks since Morocco saw the violent murder of two Scandinavian women near Mount Toubkal in the Atlas Mountains in December. “Despite significant security measures, there is a risk of terrorist attacks,” reads the statement. Berlin’s foreign office also advised its citizens to avoid travelling to Morocco’s southern provinces in Western Sahara for fear of kidnapping and due to the absence of a German consulate in the region. “Traveling to the territory of Western Sahara is strongly discouraged. The boundary wall between the part of Western Sahara controlled by Morocco and the one controlled by the Polisario Front is restricted area,” reads the safety instruction statement. The statement also noted “a threat of mines and undetonated ordnance of all kinds” on Morocco’s border with Mauritania beyond paved roads. Germany advised tourists to avoid street demonstrations and crowds due to “violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces” that occurred recently in some “unauthorized demonstrations.” The authorities admonished German tourists from travelling to the Rif Mountains “alone” because of some “occasional harassment” by drug dealers in the area where cannabis is grown. They “strongly discouraged” the purchase and possession of drugs.

Rabat – A Sahrawi family has condemned malnutrition and lack of humanitarian aid for Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps in Algeria.  The family has been conducting a sit-in since Tuesday in front of the MINURSO headquarters at Mijek, a town in Western Sahara near the Mauritanian border and 670 kilometers southwest of Tindouf. Anti-Polisario activist Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud shared a letter on Wednesday that Hamoudi Bshari Al Saleh, the father of the family, addressed to Horst Kohler, the personal envoy of the Secretary-General, to cry for help.  Al Saleh said that his family had protested before, on October 17, 2018, against the situation of Sahrawis in Tindouf camps “after being surrounded by the Polisario forces who assaulted our comrades who fled from refugee camps on the Algerian soil due to the systematic restrictions.” Al Saleh said his comrades had fled Tindouf only to be assaulted by Polisario. The father added that the first sit-in was the preliminary step to “show the whole world that there is a marginalized third party in the Sahara issue,” which is oppressed and exploited by the Polisario leadership. He said Polisario has been serving its own interests in Algeria for more than 40 years. Al Saleh added that he and others committed to “spare no effort to defend the rights” of the “vulnerable majority in the camps, which are close to 80 percent of the refugees which the Polisario take advantage of.” Al Saleh said that they did not end their protest until they me Deputy Councillor Adam and the security advisor and the military adviser of MINURSO, who promised to convey their demands to the UN Secretary-General. According to the Sahrawi activist, the MINURSO officials promised that they would “study possible solutions with the competent authorities.” However, the Sahrawi said that nothing has been done for the families who contested Polisario’s exploitation. He added that since the families had no one to resort to, he and his family decided to speak out and announce a sit-in at MINURSO’s Mijek headquarters to inform the public of their situation. “We appeal to all free people of the world to call for the relief of our family and children who have been displaced.” He added that he and his family have been in the desert region of Mijek for a year now, “besieged by the Polisario regime,” and suffering a “systematic siege of all kinds of humanitarian aid, donated by some international bodies.” Al Saleh also cried for help, emphasizing that his family will be protesting in the open air and waiting for a “humanitarian gesture from the international community.” “We will continue to fight with all the peaceful means available,” waiting for the international community to “meet our demands and the demands of the silent and vulnerable majority like us.” In October 2018, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed in his report to the Security Council “the lack of progress in the political process,” as well as “persistent difficulties, such as malnutrition, brought about by the steady reductions in humanitarian aid.” In the sixth section of the report, the UN chief spoke further about malnutrition. “Malnutrition and anaemia prevalence remained public health concerns,” he wrote. Throughout the years of the conflict, Sahrawis in Tindouf have condemned the embezzlement of humanitarian assistance directed to the refugees. Pro-Polisario news outlets, including Futuro Sahara, reported that Sahrawis were surprised to find popular aid products on display in Algerian grocery shops.

Rabat – Ahmed Zefzafi’s statement that his son had symptoms of hemiplegia and was suffering paralysis of one side of the body, the CNDH sent a medical team to examine Zefzafi’s health and review his medical file. The three-member medical team, which included a forensic specialist, found that Zefzafi had been tested seven times at the Ibn Rochd University Hospital and received three radiology exams. Zefzafi was also treated by two doctors at the Casablanca Oukacha prison where he is imprisoned. CNDH concluded that Zefzafi does not suffer from any serious health problems and that his current health status “does not raise any concern.” CNDH reported that it will publish its report regarding Zefzafi’s health once the Casablanca Court of Appeals “renders its final decision.” On Saturday, January 26, Zefzafi requested that he receive medical care because of pain in one of his legs. According to a Facebook post his father wrote on Monday, Zefzafi could not move or feel the right side of his body, suggesting that the symptoms resembled those of hemiplegia. Ahmed Zefzafi said that his son’s condition was due to violence he suffered on the day of his arrest “when his head was banged against the wall in his house … and his head was hit with iron cuffs while being handcuffed.” He accused the prison of hiding Zefzafi’s diagnosis of “arterial contractions” from him since March 2018. He also alleged that the prison director forced Zefzafi to sign a false report that he had destroyed office supplies when he banged his hand against a desk. The father’s statements followed the Oukacha prison administrators’, who said that Zefzafi only wanted to create a scene in prison by engaging in self-harm. In its statement, the prison administration reported that Zefzafi self-harmed in prison. When a nurse began to treat him, Zefzafi “threw the treatment tools and deliberately hurt himself by hitting his hand against the edge of a desk and the wall,” the statement read. Zefzafi’s father said he was protesting insufficient medical care. Zefzafi was sentenced to 20 years in prison along with other Hirak activists. A Casablanca court gave 54 Hirak activists sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years in June 2018 for participating in the “unauthorized” Hirak protests. The Hirak movement began in October 2016 after the death of Mohcine Fikri, an Al Hoceima fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities. The incident angered many, causing protests across the country, especially in Al Hoceima province, which condemned Fikri’s death and social disparities in Morocco.

Rabat – Moroccan poet Khouloud Bennaser has qualified for the final of the 8th annual Prince of Poets (Amir Al-Sho’ara’) competition in Abu Dhabi. Bennaser was one of 20 poets selected from hundreds of candidates.

The Moroccan poet won in the initial stage of the competition, placing her in the top four. She competed with a poem called “Ballerina.” She is now facing Abdelmounim Hassan from Mali, Ibtihal Mustafa from Sudan, and Hani Abdeljawad from Jordan in the final.

“Poetry is a beautiful space—an escape. It helps me face and live gracefully,” said Bennaser. According to the foundation, the first stage of the competition will be broadcast live on Tuesday, as part of its strategy to preserve cultural heritage and promote interest in Classical Arabic literature and poetry.

The Cultural Programs and Heritage Festivals Committee of Abu Dhabi organized the first Prince of Poets event in 2007. The competition takes its name from the nickname of the famous Egyptian poet Ahmed Shawqi.

Rabat – The Belgian Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons (CGRS) rejected the request of a Moroccan jihadi, Malika El Aroud, for political asylum in Belgium after the country considered expelling her to Morocco. The Belgian authorities stated that El Aroud has proved unworthy of international protection because she has not expressed “remorse” for her actions. Belgium stripped El Aroud, an al-Qaeda member, of her Belgian citizenship in November 17, after a Belgian court in 2010 sentenced her to eight years in prison for her involvement with terrorists. In October 2018, Belgian authorities announced the country may repatriate El Aroud to Morocco in line with Belgium’s new migration and asylum legislation which went into force in May 2017, deeming her the “most dangerous woman in Belgium.” The law dictates the repatriation of criminals whose behaviors threaten Belgium’s national security. El Aroud’s lawyer, however, said that expelling her may prove treacherous, suggesting that she may be tortured in Morocco. Born in 1960, El Aroud is the widow of a Taliban jihadi, Abdessatar Dahmane, who had posed as a television journalist in Belgium to assassinate the Afghan political and military leader Ahmad Shah Massoud. In the early 2000s, El Aroud was known for her Islamist writings which she used to post on the internet in French under the name “Oum Obeyda,” in attempts to rally women to adopt her and her husband’s radical ideology.

Washington D.C – The United Nations as a whole, and the Security Council in particular, needs to reconsider its approach towards conflict resolution. For many decades, it seems that the UN’s main goal has become not to resolve conflict or find long-lasting political solutions, but merely to bring them under control without any prospects for ending them. This has been the case for the Western Sahara conflict, as well as for many other conflicts. When we look at the history of the UN, we realize that it has succeeded in bringing peace to very few conflicts. The main problem that cripples the Security Council is its composition and the irreconcilable positions of its members, especially the permanent members. In each conflict on the Security Council’s agenda, the P5 members tend to stand by their allies rather than try to find a common ground and compromises that could end conflicts. In recent years, this has been on display regarding the Syrian civil war. While there has been quasi-unanimous support for the departure of Bashar Al-Assad and widespread outrage over the use of chemical weapons against civilians, Russia and China have vetoed eight resolutions calling for the departure of the Syrian President or condemning its use of chemical weapons. The same can be said to a lesser extent regarding the Western Sahara question. Because each of the P5 countries takes into account its bilateral ties and interests with Morocco and Algeria when considering their positions on the conflict, finding common ground to reach a mutually agreed upon political solution has been elusive so far. Need for creative problem-solving To make things worse, there is a conceptual problem that ties the UN’s hands and prevents it from moving forward. When one analyzes the UN approach towards conflicts on its agenda, it appears that this global body has remained frozen and fixated on the same approaches it followed in the 1960s and 1970s. The main problem of the United Nations is that it has no creativity or willingness to look for alternatives when the approaches it has tried have proven to be unproductive. This is the case with the Western Sahara. The UN still clings to the same interpretation of self-determination from the early years of decolonization in the 1960s. Though the UN has failed over the past 27 years in applying this approach to the Western Sahara conflict, it has still not realized the urgency of moving away from this sacrosanct concept and looking for a more realistic alternative. In addition, while autonomy is among the three options of self-determination, the UN has been more inclined to interpret self-determination as necessarily meaning the independence of a secessionist entity or separatist movement. Need for more realism It is high time the UN progresses from its fixation on self-determination and comes to term with the fact that it cannot apply to today’s conflicts the same approaches of the 1960s and 1970s. The UN cannot keep calling on the parties to work towards a mutually acceptable solution while it maintains the option of self-determination on the table. The UN is fully aware that Morocco will not budge from its position that independence is not an option. This position has been repeated on several occasions by King Mohammed VI and the Moroccan government. The UN has to be more creative and more realistic and work out a solution that would meet the expectations of all the parties, while maintaining stability and geopolitical balance in the region. When one compares the language of the last two Security Council resolutions on the conflict with the previous ones, it appears that the UN is moving in this direction. For the first time since the beginning of the political process in 2007, the Security Council has called on the parties to work towards a “realistic, practicable, and enduring political solution to the question of Western Sahara based on compromise and the importance of aligning the strategic focus of MINURSO and orienting resources of the United Nations to this end.” Replacing its usual call for the parties to show “realism and compromise” with an emphasis on the need to reach a “realistic” solution is significant and echoes Morocco’s calls on the UN to work towards a viable solution. In addition to the significant change in language, the Security Council seems to be more amenable to Morocco’s repeated calls to include Algeria fully in the political process. For the first time since the beginning of the political process, Resolution 2440 adopted in October includes Algeria in a Security Council resolution on the conflict. This inclusion mirrors Morocco’s emphasis that no political solution can be reached as long as Algeria does not fully partake in the political process. Morocco has made it clear for many years that Algeria is Polisario’s main political, diplomatic, financial, and military backer and without its support, the Polisario would not have lasted. If the UN Security Council is serious about reaching a realistic and mutually acceptable political solution, the way towards achieving that is by admitting the obvious and including Algeria as a main party to the conflict. Bolton’s leanings might upend the political process However, the progress achieved in the past two years might be undone by US National Security Advisor John Bolton’s long-held position on the conflict. The American official is known for not holding the UN in high esteem and for favoring a referendum as a way to end the Western Sahara conflict. He made his views clear in his 2007 memoir. While it seems that a referendum has not been on the table since the beginning of the political process in 2007, the fact that Bolton mentioned it in his address at the Heritage Foundation on December 13, is worrisome for Morocco. In addition, in the event Bolton clings to his view, his opinion would stand in stark contrast with his stated goal of making the UN peacekeeping mission more effective. The main reason why the UN has failed to achieve a solution to the conflict is its obstinacy of keeping the referendum as an option. The UN is aware that a referendum is not possible because of Morocco and Polisario’s irreconcilable positions on who is Sahrawi and eligible to take part in a referendum. Any attempts by Bolton to revive the option of the referendum would be counterproductive and would set back the political process, thus endangering all the efforts the UN has made in the past decades to move towards a more realistic approach. Learning from South Sudan The Trump administration should draw lessons from what happened in South Sudan. The Obama administration was an influential power that supported South Sudan’s independence. Self-determination was one of the main principles brandished by Obama’s administration to justify its support for the aspirations of South Sudan’s leaders. American celebrities like George Clooney also used their aura and fame to garner support for South Sudan’s independence. Yet seven years after its independence, South Sudan has neither provided the dividends of peace and stability to its people, nor become a safe and stable country or a trusted American ally. The country has been mired in civil war for most of its existence, and it has become home to the third largest refugee and humanitarian crisis in the world after Yemen and Afghanistan. More than half of the country’s 12 million people face severe hunger and food insecurity. Despite all the international efforts to end South Sudan’s civil war, there seems to be no end in sight. Rather than bringing peace, stability, and prosperity to the region, South Sudan’s independence has brought instability, starvation, and bloodshed. In addition, the country has become a burden for the international community and a drain on the UN peacekeeping and humanitarian affairs’ budgets. Following an attack led by South Sudan’s government forces on Western aid workers, including Americans, in August 2016, the US moved to adopt a Security Council resolution that provided 4,000 more UN helmets to secure the capital. As recently as December 11, 2018, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed to the international community to donate $1.5 billion to provide much needed humanitarian assistance to 5.7 million people. The South Sudan story should serve as a sober reminder that the principle of self-determination as necessarily leading to independence is neither a panacea nor a one-size-fits-all solution that can apply to all conflicts on the UN agenda, including Western Sahara. The United Nations and the Trump administration should be clear about the goals they want to achieve in the region. If they want to achieve peace and stability, they should be more creative, more realistic, and work out a mutually acceptable solution that would take into account the interests of all parties. Any approach differing from the political process initiated in 2007 risks plunging North Africa into chaos, instability, and war, endangering America’s vital strategic interests in the region.

Rabat – French airport solutions provider IER deployed 30 self-service check-in kiosks and 12 self-service bag drop units in the newly renovated Terminal 1 of Casablanca’s Mohammed V Airport, IER said in a statement January 29. On January 22, King Mohammed VI inaugurated the new Terminal 1, which covers an area of 76,000 square meters and increases the airport’s overall capacity to 14 million passengers a year. “This project is responding to the ongoing growth of passenger traffic and participates actively in the socio-economic boost of the region,” IER’s statement reads. Morocco’s National Airports Office (ONDA) operates the new terminal. IER worked with Morocco’s national carrier, Royal Air Maroc (RAM) , to introduce the new technology to Mohammed V Airport. Jean-Luc Rauline, a vice-president at IER, said, “We are convinced that the implementation of IER self-service solutions will increase RAM passenger satisfaction and experience.” RAM passengers departing from Terminal 1 will enjoy “a smooth check-in process.” The self-service kiosks include options for passengers to give language preference, select a seat, and print their luggage tag. The bag drop units will allow passengers to “scan their tag before their baggage is injected in the baggage system,” according to IER’s statement. Established in 1962, IER provides airport operators and airlines with self-service solutions such as hardware and software, from check-in to boarding.

Rabat – A second roundtable on the Western Sahara conflict might smooth the regional tension between the parties involved in the dispute.  But the positive circumstance of the talks between the parties should not make the UN forget the principles imposed by the Moroccan government to end the issue. Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN Omar Hilale told the press on Tuesday following the Security Council meeting on Western Sahara that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is the ideal solution to end the conflict. According to Hilale, the Moroccan initiative introduced to the UN in 2007 is the “top” and the “bottom.” “That is everything, and within the sovereignty of Morocco,” Hilale added. Hilale added that Morocco is ready to negotiate but only within the framework of its proposal. “We are ready to negotiate it and give it the largest operative power for the autonomy. Outside autonomy, nothing. We are not ready to negotiate anything.” Last week, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said that the autonomy plan is an initiative that seeks to integrate Sahrawis in development plans and to preserve the Moroccan Sahrawi heritage. The Moroccan government also mentioned the international community’s acknowledgement that the autonomy plan is a credible and realistic political solution that could end the conflict peacefully. Several UN ambassadors reiterated their support for the UN during the Security Council meeting, which took place in the presence of Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General Horst Kohler. During the meeting, Kohler briefed the council on developments in the conflict, emphasizing that he will meet members of the parties involved in the conflict in February to prepare another roundtable in March. The date of the March roundtable has not yet been set. Several ambassadors in the Security Council talked about the meeting, reiterating their support for the UN-led political process. German Ambassador to the UN Christoph Heusgen said that Kohler remains “very committed” to resolving the conflict. He also supported a “realistic, practical and a sustainable solution.” French Ambassador to the UN Francois Delattre told the press that the “context, in [Kohler’s] own words, remains favorable for the resumption of talks.” Delattre also commended Kohler’s efforts, emphasizing that the envoy  has a vision “and the confidence of all the delegations around the table, so we have a good environment.”

Rabat – The Canadian aerospace company Bombardier has launched construction on an extension project for its plant in Casablanca’s Midparc economic free zone in Casablanca. The company is set to complete the project in early 2020. The plant extension will specialize in producing Airbus Neo A320 nacelle thrust reversers and other aeronautical equipment. The extension will nearly double the space of the current plant, covering an area of 14,500 square meters, adjacent to the current plant’s 16,000 square meters. The plant currently has 400 direct jobs, according to Matin-Eco. The vice president of the Manufacturing Center of Morocco for Bombardier, announced that the expansion would enhance his company’s long-term “aerostructures strategy to develop its nacelle market expertise.” The news outlet reported that the extension is within the framework of a memorandum of understanding signed between the Moroccan government and the company in 2011. The company pledged to invest $200 million in Morocco by upgrading its industrial plants to offer about 850 direct job opportunities by 2020. “Bombardier has demonstrated a strong commitment to Morocco. We are extremely pleased with our progress and look forward to achieving our goals,” he added. Several international aerospace companies are increasing their presence in Morocco.  In November 2018, Moroccan and Canadian officials talked about the importance of promoting aerospace cooperation in an event in Ottawa, Canada. Morocco’s ambassador to Canada, Soraya Otmani, said that the aerospace sector is “now one of the kingdom’s promising levers for growth and job creation.” In addition to Bombardier, Boeing also has a joint venture with France’s Safran in Casablanca to build aerospace parts, such as wire bundles and harnesses. Last year, Morocco’s foreign exchange office announced that the Moroccan aviation industry earned more than MAD 9.78 billion in the first 11 months of 2017, compared to MAD 8.42 billion in 2016, an increase of 16 percent.

By Amal El Attaq Morocco and Saudi Arabia started several working meetings in Casablanca on Monday to discuss options for economic cooperation and investing in Africa. The meetings come during a one-week visit by a Saudi economic and trade delegation led by Mohammed Al-Hammadi, head of the Saudi-Moroccan Business Council. In order to increase bilateral trade, Al-Hammadi and his Moroccan counterpart, Khalid Benjelloun, discussed launching a maritime shipping line linking Saudi Arabia and Morocco. The project would “support small to medium enterprises (SMEs), bilateral cooperation program in African markets, challenge obstacles of bilateral trades as well as to prepare for the next meeting of the High Joint Committee between the two countries’ governments.” According to Saudi Press Agency, Al-Hammadi said that they have “the intention to visit Gabon very soon.” He pointed out the importance of economic openness in Africa due to the promising opportunities it offers, especially in food security. He also called Moroccan businessmen to invest in Saudi Arabia and invited Moroccan economic operators to explore Saudi industrial facilities. Khalid Benjelloun also said that “both countries are in urgent need of integration between both countries’ enterprises to benefit from investment opportunities in the African continent,” reported the agency. He added that “there is a need to give a strong impetus to bilateral economic relations and promote the integration of Moroccan and Saudi enterprises through various partnerships.” The delegation arrived on Wednesday in Marrakech for a three-day visit in which its members will participate in several meetings. The delegation visited the headquarters of the Regional Investment Center  to hear about the advantages of investment in the region andmet professional organizations to discuss tourism projects in Marrakech. Is there a silent crisis? Moroccan-Saudi relations have appeared to be strained over their relations to Qatar. In June 2017, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates led a campaign against Qatar, banning Qatari airplanes and ships from entering their airspace and sea routes. Saudi Arabia also blocked Qatar’s only land border. Morocco refused to join the Saudi and UAE campaign, and even sent food and medical supplies to Qatar. In June 2018, Saudi Arabia refused to vote for Morocco when it bid to host the World Cup in 2026. Morocco then boycotted the Saudi military maneuvers and Arab meetings in Jeddah. In November, King Mohammed VI refused to receive Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was accused of ordering the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Although Morocco offered for Bin Salman to meet the King’s brother, Moulay Rachid, the crown prince rejected the King’s suggest.

Rabat – Thousands of Muslim customers have called on Nike to recall their Air Max sneakers, saying that Nike is insulting Islam by putting the word “Allah” in Arabic on the underside of the shoe.

One customer, Saiqa Noreen, who found the inscription offensive, started an online petition two weeks ago, asking the sports company to remove the new line from stores.

Noreen accused the company of being “disrespectful” of Muslims by putting “the name of God on a shoe.” Over 18,000 people have signed her petition. A Nike spokesperson told American talk show Today that “Nike respects all religions and we take concerns of this nature seriously.” The spokesperson said that the logo is “a stylized representation of Nike’s Air Max trademark. It is intended to reflect the Air Max brand only. Any other perceived meaning or representation is unintentional.” 

Similar cases happened in the past, ranging from perceived connections to intended references. 
A few weeks ago, Amazon removed doormats, bath mats, and other goods imprinted with verses from the Qur’an from its site. In 2018, H&amp;M removed a set of children’s socks from its stores after many claimed a jackhammer logo on them imitated the word “Allah.”

In 1997, the Council on American-Islamic Relations criticized Nike for using a flame-shaped logo that resembled the word “Allah” in Arabic. The company apologized and stopped selling shoes with the model.

Rabat – The Brussels Criminal Court has sentenced 54-year-old woman to three years in jail for attacking her 19-year-old daughter. The woman had stabbed her daughter in the abdomen and under the chin after she had converted to Islam and secretly married a Muslim. The judge stated that the sentence would show the mother that her behavior was “unacceptable,” reported Belgian news outlet DH.be. The Muslim convert married a Muslim man without telling her Orthodox Christian family. The mother said that she had lost control because she was afraid she would not see her daughter anymore. The daughter does not want to see her mother again, according to the mother’s lawyer, Olivier Martins. While an exact figure of Belgium’s Muslim population is not available, Muslims make up an estimated 4 to 6.5 percent of the country’s population. The main religion in Belgium is Christianity, primarily Roman Catholicism, followed by Protestantism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Late in December, a hooded passerby assaulted a veiled Moroccan woman on a street in Anderlecht near Brussels, by punching her in the face and fleeing. The woman called for Belgian authorities to bring the assailant to justice. Social media users described the violence as “a shameful Islamophobia,” after they had watched a viral CCTV footage of the attack. The Muslim Executive of Belgium (EMB) has strongly condemned the attack and expressed solidarity with the Moroccan woman. Islamophobic attacks are not uncommon in Belgium. According to data gathered from victims by a local anti-Islamophobia association, 76 percent of Islamophobic attacks in Belgium targeted  women in 2017.

Rabat – As part of its strategy to protect the rights of Moroccans residing abroad (MRE), the Delegate Ministry in Charge of Moroccans Residing Abroad (MCMREAM) will organize the 3rd Forum of Moroccan Lawyers Residing Abroad. Morocco seeks through this forum to involve the Moroccan community abroad in a debate on Morocco’s Family Code law, the ministry said in a framing note. The conference will be held February 8-9 in partnership with the Ministry of Justice, the Superior Council of the Judiciary, the Presidency of the Prosecutor General’s Office, and the Association of the Lawyers’ Bar of Morocco. The Family Code, known as Moudawana, regulates marriage, polygamy, divorce, inheritance, and child custody.  Morocco first codified the Moudawana after it gained independence in 1956. The government most recently revised Moudawana in 2004, a significant revision that primarily addressed women’s rights and gender equality within an Islamic legal framework. The reform included over 100 amendments, and Parliament passed it in January 2004. Many human rights activists and international organizations supported the reform. The MCMREAM’s note, shared with Morocco World News, emphasized that “the provisions of the Family Code, in force for more than 14 years, require not only a reflection to delimit the acquired knowledge and evaluate the [Moudawana] experience, but also an interpretation invoking the effects and impact of its application in the countries of MREs.” Under the theme “The Family Code in the Light of Comparative Law and International Conventions,” the conference will discuss two major topics: “The effects of judgments rendered and contracts concluded abroad, in the field of family law, in the light of international conventions” and “The protection of the child in the light of international conventions.” The discussion will take, as starting a point, the message that King Mohammed VI to the Fifth Islamic Conference of Ministers in Charge of Childhood, held on February 21 last year in Rabat. “I have also sought to strengthen family cohesion through the adoption of an advanced Family Code that takes into account the best interests of the child and protects his or her rights in all circumstances,” the King said in the letter. The 3rd Forum of Moroccan Lawyers Residing Abroad will “analyze the position of the Moroccan judiciary on the effects of judgments and decisions made by the authorities and jurisdictions of host countries, while emphasizing the role of bilateral and multilateral conventions,” reads the framing note. The discussion also seeks to identify possible solutions that can help overcome difficulties that the Moroccan community faces abroad regarding family law issues. “Disparities in family law are often the result of differences between Muslim legal systems and secular legal systems. Indeed, the former generally adopt solutions based on religious foundations while the others are strongly egalitarian and advocate individual freedom. In such conditions, the Moroccan family living abroad strays between the desire to preserve their attachment to their identity and their culture of origin and the integration policies adopted by the host countries,” the notes explained. The forum will also examine challenges pertaining to child protection, such as child custody. The  ministry in charge of MREs cited some child custody issues, including “the diversity of the rules regulating it, parents’ nationality, the law applicable to mixed marriages and its exclusion in case of breach of international public order, and the supreme interest of the child.” The forum will bring together Moroccan magistrates, Moroccan lawyers and Moroccan lawyers abroad, professors, and representatives of several ministerial departments and institutions.

Rabat  – Both mother and baby boy died in Sheikh Zayed University Hospital in Casablanca, the husband and father, Said, announced. It is not yet known whether the virus also caused the infant’s death. At first, the woman had normal flu symptoms, but when she started to cough up blood and underwent medical tests at the hospital, she was diagnosed with H1N1, Said told Moroccan television channel, 2M. After performing the caesarean section, doctors treated the baby until his death on Tuesday. Morocco’s Ministry of Health announced in a recent statement that “the appearance of the seasonal influenza H1N1 is common.” The ministry called on “health sector employees to engage in preventive behaviors, like washing hands regularly, reducing contact with flu patients, covering the mouth when coughing or sneezing with a paper tissue, and not to reuse paper napkins, and ventilating rooms.” Despite cases of H1N1, the ministry reassured Moroccans that the epidemiological situation is stable. Reacting to the ministry’ statement, the husband of the H1N1 victim told Moroccan media that “H1N1 exists.” He said the country should make vaccination campaigns to prevent Moroccans from succumbing to the flu. The mournful man also criticized the “negligence” and belated intervention of doctors to treat his wife. He also condemned the ministry’s initiative to “reassure” people while his son was fighting for life, saying: “I lost my wife because of other people’s mistakes and now I am losing my son.” The H1N1 virus emerged in 2009.  As stated by World Health Organization (WHO), “Influenza A (H1N1) is similar to seasonal influenza but has been characterized by higher activity during the northern summer season, higher fatality rates among healthy young adults and higher incidence of viral pneumonia.”

Rabat – The Mines Leaders club, called “African Leaders” by the competition  organizers, will represent Morocco at Shell’s energy efficiency competition, the Shell Eco-Marathon in July 2019.   Speaking with Morocco World News, the Mines Leaders’ club communication manager, Rim Lamrani, said that seven students at the National School of Mineral Industry (ENSMR) created the club. To participate in the global competition, they resolved to build “an automotive vehicle to achieve the highest possible fuel efficiency.” The Mines Leaders team has now grown and is marching toward a shared dream. Their project involves building an energy-efficient prototype car that drives farther and consumes less fuel. Providing MWN with a glimpse on their activities, Lamrani stated that the club’s technical team works on building the car’s engine, from “the aerodynamism, injection, weight, to materials used … to fully optimize energy consumption.” The young engineers learned from their previous mistakes and currently have more experience to avoid them and find better solutions.  “We take advantage from our previous experiences in order not to repeat the same mistakes and not to waste time trying some solutions that were already tested but didn’t work well,” said Lamrani. She noted that the hardest part of their technical work is that “sometimes some solutions might look perfect but once we want to apply them in real life, loads of constraints appear.” Throughout the years, the club’s prototype vehicle continued to evolve, and “the team was able to validate the technical and the safety tests for  the competition,”achieving a record of more than 256 kilometers per liter of fuel. The young Moroccan engineers’ heightened awareness of the rising demands for energy that come with life in an industrial society prompted them to call for “an urgent and efficient energy management plan for more durable energy resources.”
 The club’s communication staff seek to “raise awareness among both professionals and general public to the extent of the ecological and energy problems,” and to find potential sponsors and convince them to fund their project.
 The Shell Eco-Marathon Europe 2019 will take place in London  July 2-5. Shell provided all the technical rules and specifications needed for participating teams to build their vehicle ahead of the competition.

Rabat – British water and wastewater solutions company Biwater announced it will build a solar sludge drying facility for a new wastewater treatment plant in Laayoune, in southern Morocco. Morocco’s National Office for Electricity and Potable Water (ONEE) awarded Biwater a $7.5 million contract to design and build the facility, the British company said in a statement January 29. The solar drying facility will “sustainably dry the effluent sludge produced as a bi-product from the Laayoune wastewater treatment plant,” according to the statement. “The treated sewage sludge will be reduced to a dry solids content of approximately 80%, which will be safely transferred off site for its disposal.” Biwater’s Regional Director for Africa Giles Jackson said that the sludge treatment will meet “environmental requirements and emission standards.” Biwater has been awarded a contract to design and construct a solar sludge drying facility for a new wastewater treatment plant in Laâyoune, southern Morocco. Read more: https://t.co/6GrUXeuBiF pic.twitter.com/4FLTvdosJr — Biwater (@BiwaterTweets) January 29, 2019    The England-based company is currently building Laayoune’s main wastewater treatment plant under a separate contract that ONEE granted the company in 2017. The wastewater plant, which is 75 percent complete, “will reduce the ecological impact of wastewater disposal and provide treated water for reuse and irrigation,” Biwater wrote. Laayoune, whose population accounts for 40 percent of the people in southern Morocco, does not have “adequate wastewater treatment infrastructure,” according to the statement. The new wastewater treatment plant, according to Jackson, will improve sanitation conditions for Laayoune region’s population and provide the city with “sustainable waste management.” As part of the contract, Biwater will provide assistance and maintenance to the workers in the new facility for one year. In 2014, Biwater constructed a wastewater treatment plant to serve the 150,000 people of Khenifra, a city in north-central Morocco, and its rural inland area. Biwater was founded in 1968 and has completed over 25,000 projects in 90 countries.

Rabat – The Colombian Congress has reiterated its support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, which has received nods from the international community since its introduction in 2007. The two houses of the Colombian Congress adopted a resolution reaffirming their position in favor of a political, fair, and lasting solution to the Western Sahara conflict on the basis of the credible and serious autonomy plan. Senator Jose Luis Perez read the resolution to the press on Wednesday following a meeting between Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and the head of the Colombian Senate’s Foreign Relations Committee, Jaime Duran Barrera. The resolution expressed full support for “the efforts made since 2007 by the kingdom of Morocco in favor of a fair, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution to the regional dispute over the Sahara, on the basis of the Moroccan autonomy initiative, which has been deemed as a preeminent, serious, credible, and realistic” solution by the UN Security Council in its resolutions. The resolution also acknowledged the recognition that the autonomy plan has received internationally, including from Colombia. The resolution added that the sovereignty of Morocco over its territory is an “important” aspect to guarantee and “promote peace and stability in the Maghreb and Sahel region.”  The resolution, which was quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), also raised concerns over the “persistence of serious human rights violations” by the Polisario Front, including the “restriction of freedom of movement, expression and demonstration in the Tindouf Camps.” In the text, congressmen of both houses of the Colombian Congress emphasized their concerns over the “persistence of extremely inhuman practices against the populations sequestered in the Tindouf camps,” echoing Morocco’s demand for a census of the populations in accordance with Resolution 2414 of April 27, 2018. The resolution of the congress also expressed satisfaction with the “excellent” bilateral cooperation between the two countries, which have had diplomatic relations for 40 years. The Congress also showed determination to strengthen bilateral bonds in all areas. Congressmen from major political parties signed the resolution, including the Democratic Center, the Radical Change Party, the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, the Social Party of National Unity, the MIRA Party, as well as the opposition Green Alliance Party.

By Carolina McCabe Rabat – The Heritage Foundation’s World Index of Economic Freedom for 2019 scored Morocco’s level of economic freedom at 62.9, classifying the country as “moderately free.” With a one point increase between 2018 and 2019, Morocco moved up 11 places in the worldwide ranking.  The research demonstrates Morocco’s progress in economic freedom, while also highlighting remaining challenges.  Morocco has shown growth in the fields of fiscal health, property rights, and judicial effectiveness. The research attributes Morocco’s successes to “low labor costs and proximity to Europe” which have allowed Morocco “to build a diversified and market-oriented economy.”  The study demonstrates a six point increase in fiscal health over the one year period as well as a three point increase in property rights and judicial effectiveness. In areas of financial and investment freedom, the values did not change. The research found Morocco to decline in the areas of government integrity, labor freedom, and trade freedom. The low scores in labor freedom and government integrity fell below regional and global averages and were attributed to inflexible labor laws and unequally implemented rule of law. With regards to government integrity, Morocco’s points decreased between 2018 to 2019 from 41.2 to 39.1. This ranking leaves Morocco in the ‘repressed’ category for government integrity. For labor freedom, Morocco was given a score of 33.1 compared to its score of 36.0 in 2018. The regional average for labor freedom is 59.4. Morocco’s overall level of economic freedom has slowly been increasing since 2014. Overall, the Heritage Foundation ranked Hong Kong to have the most economic freedom, followed by Singapore and New Zealand. France ranked at 71st, in the same category as Morocco. The most repressed countries were North Korea, Venezuela, and Cuba.  The Heritage Foundation’s Economic Index has been tracking economic freedom for 25 years to demonstrate changes in economic freedom, prosperity, and opportunity. According to the foundation, “In economically free societies, governments allow labor, capital, and goods to move freely, and refrain from coercion or constraint of liberty beyond the extent necessary to protect and maintain liberty itself.”  The data used to calculate the 2019 index values was collected over the second half of 2017 and the first half of 2018. The information was accurate as of June 30, 2018.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita responded to Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido’s request for support hours after an official working with Guaido announced their party’s determination to revive diplomatic ties with Morocco. Yesterday, Bourita spoke over the phone with the opposition leader of Venezuela, informing him that Morocco backs all the actions taken by him for the legitimate aspirations of the Venezuelan people for democracy and change. Last week, Juan Guaido declared himself interim president of Venezuela, invoking a constitutional provision that names the leader of the national assembly as president for 30 days if the presidency is vacant. Guaido asserts that Nicolas Maduro did not legitimately win last year’s elections, and so his inauguration earlier this month was invalid and left the presidency vacant. Guaido reiterated his determination to renew relations between Morocco and Venezuela on “healthy and serene bases” and to remove the obstacles that hampered their development, referring to Maduro’s presidency and his position on the Western Sahara conflict. Following the phone call, the foreign affairs advisor at the Venezuelan National Assembly, Manuel Avendano, said that Venezuela will “reconsider its recognition of the Sahrawi Republic” under Juan Guaido. He added that recognizing the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) was more in line with “left ideologies, like those of Nicolas Maduro’s regime” rather than “a real quest for a peaceful and political solution to the dispute over the Sahara.” Guaido also wants a “peaceful solution” to the conflict, adding that they support any “process that would lead to this end, within the framework of the UN.” Morocco and Venezuela experienced diplomatic tension because the Latin country supported the Polisario Front.  In the days since Juan Guaido declared himself president on January 23, the majority of South America, the US, and Canada officially supported his presidency.

By Carolina McCabe Bilal Hassani’s lawyer, Etienne Deshoulieres, announced on Tuesday that the French representative for Eurovision 2019 had filed a complaint in court over harassment and threats he received. The 19 year-old singer of Moroccan origin won the contest to represent France at Eurovision on January 26, 2019. Hassani’s lawyer stated the complaint had been lodged against unnamed defendants for “insults, incitement to hatred and violence and homophobic threats.” The organization Stop Homophobia has supported the lawsuit.  Campaigners claim that the singer has been targeted by over 1,500 homophobic tweets. The singer, who has a large following, has also received death threats. If convicted, culprits, “could face up to six years imprisonment and a 45,000 euro fine,” said Deshoulieres. “As for these 200 complaints, the goal of Bilal Hassani’s is to say that we can no longer insult, threaten, call to murder on the internet without the anti-homophobia associations reacting,” elaborated his lawyer.  “People who believe they are protected by anonymity behind their computers need to be concerned.” While Hassani was born and raised in Paris, his parents are Moroccans from Casablanca. After singing throughout his childhood, Hassani was a contestant on “The Voice Kids” in 2015. As a teenager, Hassani creates songs and posts them to his social media accounts. Hassani is openly gay, has a gender-neutral style, and owns a large collection of colorful wigs.     J’ai désormais 19 ans, et je vous présente mon premier single chez @low_wood , « Roi ». Ce morceau me tient énormément à cœur et je suis très très heureux de pouvoir vous le présenter aujourd’hui ! Je vous aime plus que tout au monde ❤️ Merci A post shared by  Bilal Hassani (@iambilalhassani) on Jan 4, 2019 at 8:49am PST  Hassani’s song “Roi” (King), which he performed for Eurovision, has over 7 million views on his Youtube channel, which has over 818,000 subscribers.

Rabat – Moroccans who have applied to perform hajj in 2019 and have won the selection lottery must pay the fees between February 18 and March 1. All pilgrims, whether using official or private travel agencies, must pay the fees at Al Barid Bank branches across the country, according to the Royal Commission in charge of the pilgrimage. The commission held a meeting with Minister of Islamic Affairs Ahmed Toufiq when they announced the costs of the official hajj pilgrimage.  The ministry and the commission set the cost at MAD 49,906. Any pocket money pilgrims may want is not included. The ministry usually encourages Moroccans to carry MAD 15,000 for personal expenses. The pilgrimage fees cover accommodation, food in Mecca and Medina, transportation in Saudi Arabia, luggage fees, and airplane tickets for a round trip between Saudi Arabia and Morocco. The fees also cover vaccination expenses and the 5 percent tax imposed by Saudi authorities. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that a roundtrip ticket from Morocco to Saudi Arabia costs MAD 11,000. The price for the same ticket will be reduced to MAD 9,500 for the members of the official Moroccan delegation. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs announced that meningitis and cold vaccinations cost MAD 480. The head of the Pasteur Institute, Abderahman Maaroufi, said that vaccination fees have increased from MAD 190 because Morocco is using a US supplier after stopping acquiring a European vaccine. He added that the new vaccine is more effective, lasting five years instead of three. Maaroufi said that Morocco made an agreement with the supplier to reduce the price of the meningitis vaccine from MAD 607 to MAD 441 per dose. He added that the price of the vaccine could be reduced further in the coming years. The commission and Islamic ministry gave two designated carriers, Royal Air Maroc and Saudia, a deadline to make a flight schedule and communicate it to the ministry. The period of stay in Saudi Arabia is 28-30 days. The two airlines have pledged to refund the total amount of the ticket, if a pilgrim fails to travel to Saudi Arabia. Moroccans can bring two suitcases onboard of 23 kilograms each. Women who are six months pregnant or more during the pilgrimage will not be allowed. On the 2018 hajj, Moroccan pilgrims complained about their struggles in Mecca due to lack of management, transport, and shelter. Several Moroccans also said that they had missed major hajj rituals, such as the “stoning of the devil.” In December 2018, the ministry promised a smooth hajj season this year. Taoufiq held meetings with the Saudi minister of pilgrimage, Mohamed Saleh Bin Taher Benten, to agree on preparations for the next pilgrimage for Moroccans.

Rabat – In a press statement which EMB shared with Morocco World News, the institution expressed immense solidarity with the victim and “strongly” condemned the assault. “The EMB salutes the lady’s calling on youths to not succumb to the emotions” of helplessness if treated similarly and “to not respond to violence with violence,” EMB wrote. EMB said that it has faith in the Belgian authorities to bring the assailant to justice and condemns his act of violence. On December 30, 2018, the Moroccan hijabi woman was walking down a street in Anderlecht with her daughter when a hooded man passed by and punched her in the face. The incident was caught in the street’s CCTV camera, and the footage went viral on the internet.  The Belgian news outlet La Capitale reported that the victim is a 47-year-old woman named Fatiha, who is calling on Belgian authorities to find her attacker. While it was not yet confirmed whether the assault was rooted in Islamophobic malice, commenters deemed it “a shameful act of Islamophobia.” EMB represents the Muslim community in Belgium. It conducts trainings for imams (preachers), supervises local mosques, and takes care of Muslim public cemeteries.

Rabat – The headquarters of the UN in New York convened the 15 members of the Security Council on Tuesday to hold a meeting on the Western Sahara conflict after a briefing from the Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General Horst Kohler. Kohler informed the council of his plan to invite the four parties involved in the conflict to take part in a new roundtable in March. Kohler will also meet all of the parties next month to set the exact date, ambassadors from the Security Council told the press at the end of the meeting. Kohler confirmed to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that a round table is planned between Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and Polisario. “We are preparing for the next round and we are expecting a good meeting in March.” French Ambassador to the UN Francois Delattre said that although Kohler did not talk about a specific date, the “context, in his own words, remains favorable for the resumption of talks.” Delattre added that Kohler has a vision “and the confidence of all the delegations around the table, so we have a good environment.” Speaking on the Security Council consultations, the French diplomat said that it was a good meeting, “of which I mostly remember the unanimous support for the efforts of the Personal Envoy.” German Ambassador to the UN Christoph Heusgen said that Kohler remains “very committed” to resolving the conflict. He also showed determination to find a “realistic, practical and a sustainable solution.” The German official echoed Delattre’s statement, emphasizing that Kohler has gained the confidence of all the members. “Everyone said it was a conflict we could find a solution for.” All parties of the conflict showed satisfaction with the Geneva roundtable held in December 2018 at the request of Kohler, until Polisario carried out a series of maneuvers that Morocco informed the Security Council and the UN of. The Moroccan government said that such maneuvers east of the Moroccan defense wall might hamper the UN’s political process and the outcomes of the talks from the previous roundtable. On Tuesday, Spokesperson for the Secretary-General Stephane Dujarric spoke about the conflict in a press briefing. Dujarric said that in the Western Sahara conflict, “We’re dealing with a longstanding issue that has gone through a number of Personal Envoys.” He added that the conflict requires “realism,” the involvement of all parties, and a lot of work from the UN. “When this Personal Envoy is ready to announce a new round, confirm a new round, he will do so.  The Secretary‑General, I think, is being briefed as we speak by the Personal Envoy, but, again, I think no one is under any illusion, and this will take a lot of work from our side and from all the parties involved to move this forward,” he concluded.

Rabat – The foreign affairs advisor at the Venezuelan National Assembly, Manuel Avendano, said on Tuesday that Venezuela will “reconsider its recognition of the Sahrawi Republic” under the potential government of Interim-President Juan Guaido. He told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that recognizing the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) is more in line with “left ideologies, like those of Nicolas Maduro’s regime” rather than “to a real quest for a peaceful and political solution to the dispute over the Sahara.” Avendano said that Guaido’s government wants a “peaceful solution “to the conflict, adding that they support any “process that would lead to this end, within the framework of the UN.” Guaido’s government requested Morocco’s support after declaring himself interim president on January 23. He gained support from much of South America and elsewhere internationally, including from Trump’s administration. On Tuesday, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke with Guaido by phone, informing him that Morocco is closely following the developments in Venezuela. Bourita also expressed Morocco’s support for Guaido for all his actions to meet the legitimate aspirations of the Venezuelan people for democracy and change. During the phone conversation, Guaido reiterated his government’s determination to restore diplomatic ties between the two counties on “healthy and serene bases” and to remove the obstacles that hampered their development. Moroccan observers, including Abdelfettah Fatihi who spoke with Morocco World News, believe that Morocco’s support for Guaido’s presidency would be favorable for Morocco’s position on the Western Sahara conflict, especially because the majority of Venezuela’s previous presidents supported the ideologies of the Polisario Front. Morocco severed ties with Venezuela in 2009, when the latin government expressed full support for the front, a threat to Morocco’s territorial integrity. In statements to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Avendano said that his government is ready to restore the diplomatic ties because both countries “had cultural and economic exchanges that we want to grow.” “At the diplomatic level we are seeking more support, but unlike the Maduro regime, we are doing so under the Venezuelan constitution,” contended the advisor. He added that the Guaido government wants “to obtain the recognition of the Kingdom of Morocco.”

Rabat – After King Mohammed VI inaugurated the extension of the Casablanca Tramway Line 2 on January 23, he left directly for Rabat on the same day, Moroccan daily newspaper Assabah reported Tuesday. The day before, King Mohammed VI had inaugurated Terminal 1 at Casablanca’s Mohammed V Airport. Informed sources told the newspaper that the monarch spent no more than 24 hours in Casablanca because he was angry at the city’s officials and especially at the local government. The officials had not followed up with some development projects that were not completed according to schedule. In September 2014, King Mohammed VI launched the Great Casablanca region development plan 2015-2020. The King chaired the signing ceremony of 10 agreements on the implementation of the development plan worth MAD 33.6 billion. Many projects of the plan that were supposed to be completed at least two months ago have either stopped or become stalled for different reasons, Assabah wrote. According to the newspaper’s sources, the local development company “Casa Amenagement” is the primary entity responsible for the delays because it received over MAD 26 billion of the development plan budget. The sources cited the MAD 200 million project to build the Sea Promenade of Hassan II Mosque which started in January 2017 and should have been completed by mid-2018. According to the Casa Amenagement website, the project is 94 percent complete and is estimated to be finished in March 2019. Another stalled project of “MAD 700 million” is for upgrading the Ain Diab coastline, especially “Atlantic Ocean boulevard.” The Ain Diab coastline is 3.5 kilometers long and includes “an entertainment area, a seaside tourism area and a natural area for relaxation, strolling, open-air sports and a direct access to the beach,” according to Casa Amenagement.  The MAD 100 million project, according to the company, was launched in January last year, is 75 percent finished, and is expected to be completed in March 2019. Assabah also mentioned one of Casablanca’s major development projects, the “Grand Theatre of Casablanca”－an MAD 1.44 billion project. The newspaper reported that the theater which “is set to be one of the most important cultural centers in Africa and the Arab world,” should have been finished by June 2018. The project works started in October 2014. However, Casa Amenagement expects to finish the project only by March this year, the same deadline set for the other development projects the company is contracted to build. Construction on the Sidi Maarouf Bridge in Casablanca, an asymmetric cable-stayed bridge, is also delayed, having passed its scheduled completion date of October last year.  The Sidi Maarouf Bridge cost MAD 422 million and is one of the biggest projects of the city development plan 2015-2020. The Italian construction company Maeg is building the 138-meter-long central span bridge. Following the recorded delays, Assabah’s sources expect changes to take place within Casablanca’s local government and among company executives in charge of the development plan following the “accountability versus responsibility” principle.

Rabat – The African Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) was the focus of talks between Morocco’s foreign affairs and international cooperation minister, Nasser Bourita, and UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) executive secretary, Vera Songwe, in Rabat on Tuesday.

Songwe said the agreement would open up access to a 2billion-person market and promote African economic integration.

“We also talked about the importance of digitization and its role in free trade areas because many of our exchanges will take place on digital platforms,” said Songwe. She added that Morocco, which began digitizing relatively early, has accumulated “considerable” expertise. 
The meeting also focused on the UN Conference of African Ministers of Finance, set to open in Marrakech in March, ““whose agenda will concentrate on taxation and digitization,” Songwe said.

The CFTA treaty was signed in March 2018 at the 10th extraordinary session of the African Union Assembly in Kigali, Rwanda. So far, 12 countries, including Morocco, have ratified the agreement. Another 10 countries are expected to join by March 2019 before the CFTA comes into force.   The UN Economic Commission for Africa estimates that the CFTA would increase African trade by 52 percent by 2022.

Rabat – The Faculty Of Medicine and Pharmacy (FMPC) in Casablanca inaugurated the first university degree focused on the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Morocco and the rest of the Maghreb on Tuesday.  Students pursuing the degree will receive three years of training on autism approaches and interventions to improve the lives of people on the autism spectrum. The training program will produce 20 qualified professionals each year. The autism education degree program will also support families in difficult conditions to better care for and attend to the needs of their children with autism. Mustapha Abu Maarouf, the dean of FMPC, told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) the training should benefit doctors, psychologists, and other healthcare professionals as well as fill the gap in practical knowledge about the spectrum in the country. The degree was created in partnership with the Mohammed VI National Center for People with Special Needs, the Orange Foundation in Morocco and France, and Belgium’s SUSA Foundation caring for children with autism. Autism is “a range of conditions characterised by some degree of impaired social behaviour, communication and language, and a narrow range of interests and activities that are both unique to the individual and carried out repetitively,” as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). Lack of medical research in the field of autism mirrors the lack of awareness about the spectrum and proper care in Morocco. Parents of children with autism are often left to handle the condition alone. It is especially difficult for families with limited income to educate and help their children become active members of society. It is, however, about time that Morocco fills the gap.

Rabat – The Dubai criminal court has charged a Moroccan man with “stealing a taxi, crashing it into a villa and then assaulting two police officers,” the Emirati news outlet the National reported Tuesday. The incident goes back to the early hours of September 13 last year when the 24-year-old Moroccan suspect called a taxi to take him to Mirdif area in Dubai after spending the evening drinking. When the suspect arrived to his destination, he got out of the taxi to bring money to pay the Pakistani taxi driver, according to court hearing. “I dropped him off and he asked me to wait for him so he could get money to pay me,” the taxi driver told the hearing. After waiting for long, the Pakistani driver went looking for the Moroccan man, but left “his car keys in the ignition,” according to the National. The suspect came back, taking advantage of the absence of the driver, accelerated the car and smashed it against a nearby villa. Not only did the Moroccan crash the car but he wanted to smash another one as well. “But he didn’t return after entering the house. Then I saw him near the villa using a bicycle to smash a parked Toyota car,” the taxi driver said. The story went on as the suspect assaulted two police officers who came to arrest him. “He repeatedly kicked the back door of our police patrol vehicle as we were trying to get him inside it,” said one of the officers. The Moroccan suspect was charged with “assault, drink driving and damaging property,” reported the National. Since the Moroccan man was blind drunk, he could not remember anything of the damage he caused. “I can’t recall what happened that day,” he told the court.

Rabat – Moroccan-Dutch kickboxer Badr Hari tested positive in an anti-doping test that the Anti-Doping Authority of the Netherland conducted last year. 

The Dutch media outlet Nieuwsuur revealed on Monday that Hari risks being suspended for four years.

The test results showed evidence of prohibited doping substances in the urine of the 34-year-old boxer after his last major match against Hesdy Gerges, who also tested positive for doping, in March 2018 in Rotterdam. 
The case is before a disciplinary judge who will decide whether to suspend Hari.

In 2017, the Supreme Court in the Hague handed down a sentence to Badr Hari of six months in prison for aggravated assault.

Rabat – Qatar trashes host nation UAE 4-0, emerging as the dominant side in its second “blockade derby” at the 2019 Asian Cup. When Qatar’s players entered the Abu Dhabi stadium this afternoon to take on the host country UAE in the second semi finals of this year’s Asian Cup, they had already made history by beating one of the South Korea, one of the tournament’s favorites. But the buildup to the encounter with UAE suggested the hosts, keen on reminding Qatari players that they were on hostile soil, were ready to make the game the most challenging for their opponents. Qatar’s first “blockade derby,” the final group stage game against Saudi Arabia, was relatively incidence-free. Officials from both countries had promised that the geopolitical crisis between the two countries would have no impact on a “simple” football match. Here, though, playing in a stadium that had officially no Qatari fan, the game was explicitly played and framed as part of the ongoing Gulf crisis. Qatar, meanwhile, seemingly oblivious to the obvious hostility from a crowd that had acquired government-purchased tickets to make the encounter a nightmare for Qatari players, counted on its football, as it had done in previous encounters, to keep its records at this tournament. The composure of Qatari players was rewarded, with the first goal of the game coming early, at the 22th minute. While UAE players looked for an equalizer to revamp their dream of reaching the final for a second time in row, Qatar’s talismanic striker Almoez Ali smashed in his team’s second goal at the 37th minute, making the home crowd nervous and more hostile. As Ali and his mates celebrated the young striker’s eighth goal at the tournament, UAE fans started throwing sandals at the opposition players, suggesting that, at 2-0 down in the first half, the host country’s hopes of reaching the semi finals were slowly evaporating. There already was an air of resignation in the air. Although more tense than the first, the second half settled Qatar’s grandstand dominance as the game evolved. Dodging sandals and defying slurs, Qatar was compact throughout. At the 80th minutes, Hassan Khalid Al Haydos inflicted more pain to the home crowd with a third goal. The goal, killing any hopes that were left of miracle come back from the previous 2-0 lead, momentarily silenced the stadiums. At that point, UAE players stared in the void while fans, visibly dismayed, fought to resign to a heavy defeat at the hands of a regional rivalry. But Qatar was not quite done. Adding insult to injury, Hamid Ismail sent in a fourth goal. That goal was greeted by a barrage of battles from the home crowd. Qatar will take on Japan in the final on Friday.

Rabat – The Corruption Perception Index 2018 (CPI), published today by Transparency International, provides an ambivalent reading of Morocco’s fight against corruption although Morocco gained eight places in the ranking from 81st in 2017 to 73rd in 2018.  According to the report, the mismatch between recent encouraging efforts to combat corruption and the “grim” reality in citizens’ daily life suggests that Morocco is oscillating between improvement in perception and stagnation in implementation. “This year, while both Morocco and Egypt improved 3 points apiece with scores of 43 and 35 respectively, these scores will offer citizens of both countries little comfort. With a global CPI average of 43, both countries have much room for improvement,” the report said. Morocco’s lackluster performance in fighting corruption, Transparency International suggests, has both domestic and regional causes. In terms of regional dynamics, Morocco is part of a cohort of MENA countries where democratic consolidation has been historically lagging behind.  The MENA region’s anti-corruption and transparency commitment remains “grim,” according to the report. It explained, “In a region where civil liberties continue to be under suppressive state control and the social contract between states and their citizens has been broken for decades, it is no surprise that corruption remains stubbornly high.” The report assessed the public corruption perception of 180 countries worldwide and 18 countries in the MENA region. It drew its conclusions from 13 surveys of business leaders and expert opinions, operating on a scale of 0 to 100, with zero meaning “highly corrupt” and 100 standing for “highly clean.” The global average score was 43, while MENA’s average was 39. Morocco, with a corruption perception score of 43, ranked 73rd out of 180 countries worldwide and 7th in the MENA region.  The United Arab Emirates, which scored 70 and ranked 23rd worldwide, led the dance in the MENA. Qatar (62) and Israel (61) completed the region’s top 3 on CPI performance. Compared to its 2015 score (36), Morocco’s anti-corruption performance has steadily improved. In 2017, Morocco scored 40. The country’s slight anti-corruption upward trend is due in large part to the adoption in February 2018 of the access to information law, the report noted.  The passing of the law enabled Morocco to access the Open Government Partnership (OGP), an international platform of governments and advocacy groups devoted to transparency and the fight against corruption.  But while the free-information law was a positive step to improve transparency in public service, the country has not effectively implemented its anti-corruption measures. Nor has it substantially abandoned traditional practices like cracking down on dissent and the capture of the state by a restricted circle of ruling elites. According to Transparency International, despite recent reforms, Morocco still presents features of MENA countries where “political and economic elites influence government and divert public funds at the expense of citizens.” Crucial in Morocco’s stagnating anti-corruption index is the highly restrictive nature of the public debate.  According to some critics, access to information in Morocco is hampered by, among other things, vague directives, harsh penalties, and unclear sanctions for public officials. The report comes amid successive public statements from Morocco’s King Mohammed VI calling for more transparency and effectiveness in public administration. In a number of recent occurrences that Moroccan media have associated with “royal anger,” King Mohammed VI called out a number of high-ranking officials for their perceived lack of commitment to the government’s stated reforms. Most recently, the King appointed an ombudsman and a chair of the competition council, tasking both appointees with the mission of enhancing good governance and transparency.  In December last year, Mohammed Bachir Rachdi, whom the King appointed to lead Morocco’s fight against corruption, took a solemn vow to “cleanse” Morocco of impunity. “We hope to be part of an era of real and irreversible changes,” Rachdi said. But it remains to be seen whether new appointments and royal anger will put Morocco on course for more transparent and effective public administration.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch said that the negotiations between Morocco and the EU also included talks on protecting “solidarity farming” to improve the income of small and medium farmers in rural areas.  Akhannouch said on Monday in Rabat that the negotiations had aimed to improve market access conditions for productive and competitive agriculture, “one of the pillars of national exports.” Quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Akhannouch said that in terms of exports, the parties agreed to liberalize trade restrictions on all but seven agriculture products, including tomatoes and clementines. Olive oil is one product that the deal will liberalize. For imports, products will be divided into three categories. The first category is products that will be directly liberalized while the second category includes products that will be liberalized over a period of five years. The third category is for products that will be liberalized over a period of 10 years, including cotton, rice, and chocolate. Akhannouch also commented on the fisheries agreement, the negotiations between Morocco and the EU resulted in the signing of the fisheries agreement on January 14. Akhannouch added that the agreement will enter into force after its adoption by the Moroccan and European Parliaments. Akhannouch said that the agricutre agreement confirms the commitment of the EU to a “strategic, solid and balanced agreement” with Morocco. He also said that the vote that the agriculture agreement received in the EU Parliament ends the “maneuvers that have relatively disrupted progress in the agreement.”  The agreement received 444 votes in its favor on January 16. The deal extends the agriculture trade between Morocco and the EU.

Rabat – Following the statement in which prison administrators said that Nasser Zefzafi, a leader of the Hirak Rif protests in Al Hoceima, self-harmed while in prison “to create disorder,” his father denied the story and gave his own account. At 6:30 p.m. on Saturday, Zefzafi asked for medical care because of pain in one of his legs. According to Zefzafi’s father, Ahmed Zefzafi, the Hirak activism leader had symptoms of hemiplegia, the paralysis of one side of the body, which prison staff did not mention in their statement on Sunday. Nasser Zefzafi “felt pain in one of his legs before it began to become like symptoms of hemiplegia since he could not move or feel the right side of his body,” Ahmed Zefzafi wrote on his Facebook page on Monday, reporting what his son told him in a phone call. “He then asked prison guards to notify the prison director to bring a doctor.”  The prison administration said that Zefzafi “threw the treatment tools and deliberately hurt himself by hitting his hand against the edge of a desk and the wall” when a nurse began to treat him. But according to Ahmed Zefzafi, a “guard” came in with “a bottle of rubbing alcohol in his hand to rub it over his body.” Zefzafi’s son was protesting the neglect of his health because the prison guards did not bring in a nurse or doctor.  The prison administration said that Zefzafi committed “acts in violation of the law with the intent of causing disorder and chaos” because many Hirak Rif detainees “refused to return to their cells.” Zefzafi’s father explained that the detainees were showing solidarity with the Hirak Rif leader, declaring that they would not return to their cells unless a doctor came. The doctor came, Ahmed Zefzafi continued, and after checking him, asked to immediately transfer Nasser Zefzafi  to the emergency room. “After the diagnosis, my son found out that the prison administration had kept information about his health status hidden since March 1, 2018, when he was first diagnosed with a stroke and hemiplegia,” Zefzafi’s father wrote. It was only on January 26, 2019, that the prison administration told Zefzafi that “MRI tests for the past year revealed he had arterial contraction on the right side of the head,” he added, expressing his surprise. Nasser Zefzafi said he had never before suffered atrial contractions. The jailed activist said he suspected that the condition was “due to violence he suffered on the day of his arrest as his head was banged against the wall in his house … and his head was hit with iron cuffs while being handcuffed.” The violence did not end here. According to Ahmed Zefzafi’s Facebook post, the prison director mocked Zefzafi’s health status when he was transferred to the hospital. The director said “[Zefzafi] was wrong when he got sick on Saturday” and asked the guards to “get him out of his face.” The director said that he “had family obligations and was not fully available to follow Zefzafi alone.” Zefzafi “protested the disgraceful behavior which he deemed torture and psychological violence … an insult to a person in a situation needing” treatment and not degradation of dignity, reads his father’s post. Nasser Zefzafi pointed out that the prison director forced him to sign a record acknowledging he broke office supply items in a state of anger－an admittance that the Hirak leader “compeletely denied” and deemed “false and groundless.” Zefzafi’s father called on the prison authorities to publish video footage of the incident to inform the public of the truth. He also requested the prison administration to “urgently” show him his son’s medical file. In a statement published today, the prison administration said that Zefzafi had a number of medical tests about a year ago, including an MRI and an electroencephalogram, a test that evaluates electrical activity in the brain. The tests revealed that Zefzafi had “a slight congenital defect,” according to the treating physician, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. The statement added that Zefzafi “was then notified of the results, in accordance with the ethics of the medical profession” and was given “the appropriate therapeutic prescription.” The prison administration denied that it hid the tests’ results from Nasser Zefzafi, calling Ahmed Zefzafi’s post “false allegations” to mislead the public. “The tests’ result have nothing to do with the conditions of the prisoner’s arrest.” The medical tests that Zefzafi had on Saturday, said the administration, gave the same results, a congenital defect. “The treating physician requested to perform additional examination to identify more precisely the nature of the congenital defect.” “The prisoner was given a new medical appointment for two months later and was provided with a prescription.” If Zefzafi had “hemiplegia resulting from a stroke,” the administration stressed, he would not be able “to remove his clothes and break the desk which he hit with his hand, as recorded by a security camera.”

Rabat – The Spanish civil guard arrested a 25-year-old man on Tuesday who had allegedly disseminated terrorist propaganda and become self-indoctrinated on the internet. A statement from the Spanish police said that that the suspect, arrested in Zaragoza in northern Spain, began the process of radicalization 5 years ago.

Rabat – Venezuelan Interim President Juan Guaido is seeking to restore diplomatic ties with Morocco which were suspended under the presidency of Nicolas Maduro. On Monday, the foreign affairs advisor of the Venezuelan assembly Manuel Avendano told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) on Monday in Caracas: “We want to restore our relations with the kingdom of Morocco.” The official added that Venezuelan President Maduro’s position on Morocco has not been beneficial for both countries. There has been actions and rhetoric that have separated the two countries.” Avendano said that Guaido’s government wants to turn a new page after  20 years of “Chavism” and “Madurism” to adopt its “own positions on diplomatic issues.” Under Maduro, Venezuela was one of several countries that recognized the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. “Formal” diplomatic ties between Venezuela and SADR began in 1982 during the regime of Luis Herrera Campins. Morocco officially broke diplomatic ties with Venezuela in 2009 because of its support for the Polisario Front, a threat for Morocco’s territorial integrity. In January 2009, Morocco summoned Venezuela’s ambassador to condemn his country’s support for the separatists. In response to the situation, Avendano emphasized the importance of restoring ties with Morocco because both countries “had cultural and economic exchanges that we want to grow.” He insisted that the primary goal for Guaido’s new government is to restore diplomatic ties, adding that the government wants to “repair the damage suffered.”  Commenting on the Western Sahara conflict, Avendano said that the Guaido government will “support the political process led by the United Nations to reach a peaceful and mutually acceptable solution to this regional dispute.” “We want to support the process of settling this regional dispute within the framework of the United Nations.” Moroccan expert on the Western Sahara conflict Abdelfettah Fatihi called on the Moroccan government to take advantage of the political situation in Venezuela in order to guarantee support from the new government. Fatihi told Morocco World News that he does not understand why Morocco has not yet expressed support for the “transitional democratic process in Venezuela, especially as this country has cost us countless problems over the course of history,” referring to the Western Sahara conflict and Morocco’s territorial integrity project. The analyst said that Morocco’s delay will make it lose diplomatic efforts in the future. He also called for the need to “eliminate” Venezuela’s negative position on Morocco’s territorial integrity through the support of Guaido’s government On January 23, Guaido declared himself president, invoking an article of the Constitutionthat makes the national assembly leader president for 30 days if the presidency is vacant. Guaido generated widespread South American recognition and international diplomatic support, including from US President Donald Trump. Avendano said that “on January 10, Maduro tried to stay in power and start a new term of office after unrecognized elections.” “At the diplomatic level we are seeking more support, but unlike the Maduro regime, we are doing so under the Venezuelan constitution,” contended the advisor. He added that the  Guaido government wants “to obtain the recognition of the Kingdom of Morocco.”

Rabat – Morocco’s OCP and Spain’s Fertinagro Biotech company recently announced they created a joint venture company to produce enhanced fertilizer. The new company will produce “granular high analysis [nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium] NPK as well as fertilizers enhanced with urease inhibitors, bio-stimulants and trace elements (micronutrients), to address the international market,” OCP said in a statement January 24. The new venture comes two months after one of OCP’s subsidiaries acquired 20 percent of the shares in Fertinagro Biotech in October last year. OCP Group, one of the leading exporters and producers of phosphate-based fertilizers in the world, announced on October 23 that it obtained all required regulatory approvals and Fertinagro’s shareholders approved the acquisition. Named “OCP-Fertinagro Advanced Solutions,” the 50-50 joint venture will be located in Jorf Lasfar, 120 kilometers south of Casablanca, and will have “an initial annual capacity of 250,000 tons of specialty NPK fertilizers by 2020.” The company will receive “up to 1 million tons of further ranges of enhanced plant nutrition solutions” with “advisory services to farmers, capitalizing on both companies deep experiences in the field.” Marouane Ameziane, an executive vice-president at OCP Group, said that the venture “anchors the ambition of both partners to sustainably address the growing demand in enhanced and ‘technology’ fertilizers, and to expand their offerings to farmers worldwide, in terms of customized products and services.” OCP and Fertinagro seek to “combine industrial flexibility and competitiveness with innovation and agronomic services for farmers,” said Jose Luis Moya, general manager at Fertinagro Biotech. Both companies will “develop new industries, products and solutions in agriculture with a global joint vision to achieve a more sustainable world,” Luis Moya added. Fertinagro is a major Spanish fertilizer company which produces and commercializes plant nutrition solutions. It is also known for its “product development capabilities” and “biotech application.”

Reacting to the prize-giving, many commenters on social media criticized the absence of women and ridiculed the Emirati government for choosing to honor only men when the initiative intends to foster gender equality in the workplace and promote fair opportunities. The Gender Balance Index features three award categories: “Best Personality for Supporting Gender Balance,” “Best Federal Entity for Supporting Gender Balance,” and “Best Initiative for Supporting Gender Balance.” Scottish academic Gerry Hassan commented on the controversy through a tweet:  “Tell me this isn’t a subversive satire on gender balance politics, patriarchy &amp; #manels.”    Tell me this isn’t a subversive satire on gender balance politics, patriarchy &amp; #manels. https://t.co/KSqYnrPNDf — Gerry Hassan (@GerryHassan) January 27, 2019

Rabat – A citrus company called Citreck has begun cultivating caviar lime in Morocco. The company’s farm, in Essaouira, is the only farm that makes caviar lime, also known as finger lime, in Morocco.  Last fall, the company was developing caviar lime as a potential new commercial crop for Morocco. The product is just as expensive as caviar, going for MAD 820 per kilo. According to Agri Maroc, caviar lime is used for various purposes. It can enhance salmon, white fish, and oyster dishes. It can also be used to garnish gourmet dishes or as anexfoliant in cosmetics, due to its alpha-hydroxy acid known for its ability to exfoliate the skin. Citreck said that caviar lime is a rare product and deserves the utmost care. The company aims to “produce first choice lemons while respecting the environment.” The fruit’s value comes from its use as an ingredient for haute cuisine, which is commonly used by the greatest chefs and the most luxurious tables in the world. The fruit grows on a small tree of lowland subtropical rainforest and rainforest in the coastal regions of Queensland and New South Wales in Australia.

Rabat – Moroccan football player Mehdi Benatia has left the Italian giant Juventus for the Qatari Al Duhail football club. Juventus confirmed the player’s exit on Monday, thanking Benatia for his services. Benatia replied via tweet, thanking the Old Lady and emphasizing that it was a pleasure to play for them. Grazie di tutto, @MedhiBenatia !https://t.co/6gbUwTqfOu pic.twitter.com/DhKfJyQvJl — JuventusFC (@juventusfc) January 28, 2019  “It has been an immense pleasure! I hope to be able to come to Madrid to cheer for you – this Juve deserves it,” Benatia wrote.  In a press release, Juventus said that it had finalized an agreement with Al Duhail “for the definitive disposal of the registration rights of the player Medhi El Moutaqui-Benatia for a consideration of  € 8 million to be paid in two instalments within October 2019.” The statement added that the permanent transfer fee “may increase of (sic) further maximum  €2 million on achieving given conditions in the course of the duration of the contract.”  Upon his arrival at the Turin club, “Benatia immediately became a dependable player by demonstrating his qualities of physical prowess, class and defensive vision,” Juventus cherished his performances. The footballer played 40 Serie A games with Juventus. He made 14 appearances in the Champions League, 1 in the Italian Super Cup, and 4 in the Coppa Italia. In 2016 Juventus signed the Moroccan player with a three-year deal worth €17 million. Benatia is also the captain of the Moroccan national football team, with whom he appeared during the 2018 World Cup. Benatia spent most of his career in Italy, where he played for Udinese, AS Roma, and Juventus. He joined Juventus from Bayern Munich. Several Moroccan fans have criticized Benatia for moving to Qatar, saying it will be the end of his football carrier.  Benatia struggled in his final season with Juventus as he was benched in the most important games. The footballer kept his expectations high, though, saying a “lion never dies, he sleeps.”

Rabat – African news outlets reported that both Nigeria and Morocco finished the feasibility study for the construction of the Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline. The 2016-initiated project is set to be 5,660 kilometers of pipeline and supply 15 countries in West Africa, according to Punch. The Nigerian outlet the Nation quoted Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation’s Group Managing Director Maikanti Baru who said that the stakeholders are currently making the pre-Final Investment Decision. He added that the pipeline will enhance the region’s industries. Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Ibe Kachikwu said that African nations would invest around $2 billion to develop a “financing body that will fund the energy sector,”” according to the Nation. Baru also called on African countries to help develop infrastructure. “Today, Nigeria and Morocco are collaborating to construct a gas pipeline that will traverse at least 15 West African countries and connect the existing Europe gas pipeline.” Both officials made their remarks on the project during the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit in Abuja. Several senior officials from Africa, Europe, and America participated in the symposium. Baru added that the pipeline between Morocco and Nigeria would meet “the needs of consumers for heating and other uses” in 15 countries. “We see gas as a fuel to take Africa to the next level. New gas discoveries have been recorded offshore Senegal, Mauritania, Mozambique and are in various stages of development.” Kachikwu acknowledged that the project is facing some challenges, including “oil pricing, investment limitation, President Trump and so many other things.” Last week, Fitch Solutions  released a study listing some of the obstacles to the project’s completion. The study emphasized that political and security concerns in some of the countries through which the pipeline will pass may cause delays.  “The envisioned pipeline route is poised to have high exposure to political risks,” the report noted, referring to feasibility studies’ results. The construction will be phased to meet the growing needs of the countries as well as those of Europe for 25 years. In June 2018, King Mohammed VI received Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in Morocco. Both leaders co-chaired a signing ceremony of three cooperation projects, including the pipeline. Morocco and Nigeria signed an agreement in Rabat on May 15, 2017, committing both parties to jointly fund a feasibility study on the project.

Rabat – No officials from Morocco or Israel have confirmed the widely circulating news, but recent developments suggest they may be engaged in rapprochement talks. Last week, on January 23, Norm Coleman, a former senator and former chairman of the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC), tweeted a picture of a recent trip to Rabat. Rabat, Morocco- with the Foreign Minister and @AriFleischer @mbrooksrjc , Elliot Abrams &amp;Andrew King. An Arab country that that promotes tolerance-for Jews and Christians- in their Constitution. pic.twitter.com/UTZ7Kss8cL — Norm coleman (@normcoleman) January 23, 2019  The picture showed Coleman with Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita; pro-Morocco lobbyist Andrew King; and three other senior Jewish Republicans, Mat Brooks, Ari Fleischer, and Elliot Abrams, known for their pro-Israel activism. Bourita’s meeting with the RJC adds legitimacy to the claims that Rabat is flexing its diplomatic muscles to garner more support from the American establishment, Washington-based outlet Al Monitor reported. Israel as key to Trump’s uncertain foreign policy The Trump administration has been unpredictable on a number of foreign policy issues. While Washington has in many regards remained committed to Morocco as an ally—the continued cooperation on security is one example—some other moves from the Trump administration have bewildered Rabat. Most recently, National Security Advisor John Bolton’s apparent anti-Morocco statements and Trump’s “Africa Strategy” were a major source of contention in Rabat-Washington circles. Where the US saw the necessity of reclaiming its “lost prestige” by containing Chinese inroads in Africa, Rabat, more concerned with its Western Sahara position, feared a sudden shift in terms of US priorities in Africa. Commitment to Israel has been one of the few unambiguous guidelines of the Trump administration’s foreign policy priorities. Morocco’s diplomatic activism and Netanyahu rumors When asked about the aim of the RJC’s visit to Rabat, Abrams wrote off suggestions that the group was working to facilitate prospective diplomatic overtures between Morocco and Israel. “My only comment is that I have many friends in Morocco, especially in the Jewish community, and was happy to see them again,” Abrams said, according to Al Monitor. Despite the denial, the group’s Rabat visit came amid reports of a potential visit to Morocco by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Reports on the visit have emphasized Netanyahu’s desire to seek “normalization” with the Muslim world, including countries in the Middle East and Africa. The caption of Coleman’s Rabat trip picture referred to Morocco as “An Arab country that that [sic] promotes tolerance—for Jews and Christians—in their constitution.” The language resembles that of the keywords of Netanyahu’s “normalization” efforts, which have been couched in terms of brokering “historical peace with the Muslim world.” On the Moroccan side, meanwhile, rapprochement with Israel is more likely to do with the North African country’s efforts in recent years to increase its visibility on the global stage and broaden international support for its stance on Western Sahara. Since 2017, Rabat’s diplomatic efforts has made valuable diplomatic inroads in Africa and the Americas in previously uncharted territories for Moroccan diplomacy. The efforts have paid off. The UN Security Council’s recent resolution about the Western Sahara contained a language that is viewed in Morocco as positive. In addition, many countries in Africa, Europe, and Latin America have vowed support for Rabat’s position in Western Sahara. While the US, too, has applauded the Moroccan Autonomy Plan on many occasions, the Trump administration’s position has not been clear. Last week, President Trump signed into law the 2019 spending bill, a document that includes explicitly Morocco-friendly language. The bill’s section on Morocco includes Western Sahara in US aids to Morocco and calls for international efforts to monitor the humanitarian assistance to the Tindouf camps in Algeria, two points that echoed Rabat sentiments on the Western Sahara question. Rabat shifts to bold PR For all its boost to Morocco’s position, the bill came after Washington had sent mixed messages to its North African ally. The adoption of the bill followed an episode that has been associated with the “Bolton effect” in the framework of the ongoing UN-led negotiations for a sustainable settlement in Western Sahara. Last year, amid indications of a more promising UN-led process in the Western Sahara under the auspices of Host Kohler, the Trump administration unexpectedly requested that the mandate of MINURSO, the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, be only renewed by six months. The usual renewal period was one year, and many perceived the unprecedented sixth-month timeframe as a Bolton-concocted strategy to put more pressure on conflicting parties, especially Morocco, where Trump’s appointment of Bolton raised concerns. While being assertive and bold with its other partners–note Rabat’s boldness when negotiating the renewal of the fisheries and agriculture agreements with the EU–Morocco has overwhelmingly relied on the reciprocity principle when dealing with Washington. When Ambassador Omar Hilale said last month that no senior US official can jeopardize the longstanding relations between Rabat and Washington, he did not merely intend to downplay the “Bolton effect.” Ambassador Hilale’s larger point, given Morocco’s position as the US’ strongest ally in North Africa and given the kingdom’s known commitment to its alliance with the US, was that Morocco did not need, like other players in the Sahara dispute, to resort to aggressive PR and lobbying campaigns. Morocco could always count on its American ally to stand by its side, Hilale suggested. Weeks later, however, the US House of Representatives passed a Morocco-hostile spending bill. The move was largely perceived as a relative PR setback for Rabat. That setback catapulted Moroccan diplomats into initiating backdoor negotiations with Washington, yielding results that have been unfolding in recent weeks. Despite the confidence that has come with President Trump passing into law a spending bill that reflects Morocco’s position, the RCJ’s trip to Rabat suggests that Morocco has learned its lesson from: When dealing with the Trump administration, the reciprocity principle should be accompanied by bolder and firmer and firmer steps. According to Moroccan and Israeli news reports on Netanyahu’s rumored visit to Rabat, Moroccan diplomats hope that rapprochement with Israel will put Morocco in a better position to get game-changing support from the US government on Western Sahara. While there are clear indications that Rabat is poised to lobby for US support on its Western Sahara position, Netanyahu’s rumored visit should be taken with a grain of salt. Support for the Palestinian cause is part of Morocco’s foreign policy directives, and it remains to be seen whether that can change overnight.

Rabat – UK based company SDX Energy is planning a natural gas exploration campaign in Morocco. In a press release issued on January 28, the company said it is planning a 12-well drilling campaign. The company will start the drilling  campaign late at the third quarter of 2019 or early fourth quarter of 2019. The completion of the project is expected during the first half of 2020.  “The 2019 total gross capex is expected to be approximately US$10 million with SDX’s share being approximately US$8 million. Out of this US$8.0 million, US$6.0 million relates to the three planned wells and US$2.0 million relates to the Company’s share of facilities and field maintenance capex,” said the statement. The company, which owns 75 percent of working interest in Morocco, said that it will retest two wells, which were originally drilled in 2018 in Lalla Mimouna, a town in Kenitra province near Rabat. The company is aiming to reach a gross production of 9-11 million metric standard cubic feet per day of conventional natural gas sales in 2019. In April 2018, the company made a major gas discovery at the LNB-1 onshore well on the Lalla Mimouna permit. The UK based announced that the area contains some 10.2 billion cubic feet of conventional natural gas and 55,000 barrels of condensate.

I have spent time in slums in Senegal, in fishing villages in Cambodia and with former child soldiers in Uganda. I have met female fighters in Iraq, stayed in small villages in Afghanistan and in the homes of families in Kashmir.  I have travelled through the Brazilian Amazon by boat, met with ex slaves in Mauritania and Syrian refugees in Lebanon. I have spent time in the United States, in homes in Kazakhstan and with Sahrawi refugees in the Algerian desert and so much more.   I have noted that through these travels, that while there are many differences amongst us, there are some things that we share in common.  One of them being the way in which we normalize violence and discrimination against women and girls.  There has been literally no part of the world that I have been to, where violence and discrimination against women and girls is not accepted, in one way or another, as a normal part of daily life. In different intensities and in different ways but nevertheless, it is everywhere.  It could be rape or blaming women for being raped. It could be relentless sexual harassment and then blaming women for that too. It could be men hitting their wives or just blatant declarations that women have less value than men.  It could be honor killings, forced marriages, female genital mutilation, unequal pay, not allowing girls to school or to enter into political office.    Even in the face of the most horrific forms of violence and discrimination, people so often don’t even shrug a shoulder, or raise an eyebrow.  They just say its normal. They say that it’s their culture.  In the Middle East my travels have taken me through the various countries of the Gulf, the Arabian peninsula and to the far reaching corners of Kurdistan in Iraq and Turkey. I have come across attitudes and institutionalized laws that deliberately discriminate against women and girls and in many cases, support violence against women and girls. Throughout the region, social norms and ‘cultural’ values dictate that women should not have the same rights to participate in social life as men. In Yemen, for example I barely saw a woman on the street, nor did I in Iraqi Kurdistan.  Honor killings are prevalent in this part of the world. An honour killing stems from a deeply misogynistic male need to control women’s sexuality. In this part of the world, women and girls are not allowed to have sexual relations outside of marriage and are expected to be virgins until they are married.  Any deviation from this, or even a suspected deviation, is believed to destroy the family honor and the only way to redeem this honor, is to kill her.  In Africa, attitudes that discriminate against women are also rampant. In Morocco, I found it almost too difficult to be outside, the lecherous staring and incessant rude comments from the men, was just so bad. Something that Moroccan women deal with on a daily basis. One Moroccan woman even said that she had bought a car, just so she didn’t have to deal with the daily harassment on the street. In Mauritania, women can face jail time for sex outside of marriage, even if they were raped and even if they were raped when they were a slave. What is known as decent based slavery was legal in Mauritania up until 2007.  In Mozambique, sexual harassment from school teachers is common in the country’s poverty stricken schools. In a phenomenon known as ‘sex for grades,’ young girls are expected to exchange sexual favors with their teachers in return for grades. In South Africa, women complained about the relentless daily sexual harassment. In Senegal, a school teacher said that in Senegal, ‘sexual harassment is everywhere.’  In Latin America it’s not much better. ‘Women are just sexual objects,’ one Colombian man told me. A fact that was obvious from the incessant lecherous stares and rude comments that I faced on daily basis on the street in Colombia and in fact, virtually anywhere I went in Central and South America.  I remember one young Colombian girl telling me that, ‘there would be more punishment for stealing a chicken than raping a young girl in Colombia.’   Asia can also be an incredibly difficult place for women. I have yet to meet a woman from India or a woman who has visited India, that has not faced some form of violence, harassment or discrimination.  In the Maldives, women told me that due to the increasing presence of Islamic extremists in the country, they were loosing their rights to do things such as leaving the home without permission from a male member of the family. In the Philippines, I met young girls who had been tricked and sold into sexual slavery.  In the Western world, sexual harassment, domestic violence and unequal pay are still all problems women face on a daily basis. As they are in the islands of the Pacific, Indian Ocean and Caribbean and in fact virtually everywhere around the world.  These are just a few examples, but they are endless.  They are in part endless because they are so accepted. Because these attitudes and behaviors are dismissed as ‘tradition’ and ‘culture’. Because people just shrug their shoulders and say, ‘well that’s normal’. Violence and discrimination should never be normal, ever. It should never be considered normal to hit a woman. It should never be considered normal for a young girl to be sold into prostitution. It should never be normal for teachers to sexually harass their students at school or to sexually harass women and girls anywhere for that matter.  What should be normal is respect. Respect for the dignity and well being of everybody. What should be normal is that men who abuse, disrespect, degrade and humiliate women, are punished.  A global effort is needed to bring an end to these very serious forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls.  Everybody needs to be involved with and most importantly, we need to stop saying that violence and discrimination against women and girls, is normal.

Rabat – Macau police arrested five people, including two Moroccans, on Friday for allegedly “using 50 fake credits cards for online shopping to buy goods they later sold,” Asia Times reported Monday. The suspects were using fake credit cards from Canada, the US, and some Middle Eastern countries to purchase luxury products and electronic goods in Macau, an autonomous territory bordering China and under Chinese authority, and Hong Kong. The gang sold the goods for more than $57,300, according to the Asian outlet. The five, all in their 20s, included two men from Morocco—a 27-year-old surnamed Azzeddine and a 28-year-old student surnamed El Alami, two men from the Philippines, and one woman from Russia. “Reports said that the [two] Moroccan nationals were key members of that group and have admitted to the crime,” the Macau Daily Times reported. “After investigation by the authorities, we discovered the suspects’ identities and found out that they leave Macau every time they carry out [illegal] activities,” the news outlet quoted Leng Kam Long, spokesman and chief criminal investigator of the judiciary police, as saying. Macau police issued a search warrant in October last year after they “received reports from two separate online shopping websites which found their customers had used counterfeit credit card information.” The police suspected an international fake credit card syndicate. The police seized 39 mobile phones, $1,270, several prepaid phone cards, and information about the fake cards used in the sales operation, according to Asia Times. The case is under investigation by the public prosecution office.

In the aftermath of the Iraqi army’s takeover of Mosul in July 2017, Iraqi and Western leaders recklessly published the end of ISIS.  The fall of ISIS Caliphate, symbolized by the removal of the flag stamped with the seal of the Prophet from the minaret of the mosque where Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi had proclaimed himself caliph just three years before, in August 2014, was indeed a victory it was not the peace.  Announced dead several times, Al Baghdadi in August 2018 mocked Donald Trump bragging, claiming that: “ The defeat or victory of the mujahideen and of the faithful and pious people is not a matter of captured cities or villages … The US has proclaimed their so-called victory by expelling IS from the cities and countryside of Iraq and Syria, but the land of God is vast, and the course of the war is changing. ”  The terrorist organization went underground in Iraq; ISIS henchmen hide in deserts; in many villages they reign on the night assassinating the local chiefs; in the cities ISIS perpetuates attacks. Bashar al-Assad won the war. Western intervention contributed to his victory. The Syrian leader had perverted a secular and democratic people’s revolt in a civil and religious war that had become an international conflict by the interference of Western, Arab, Turkish and Russian countries.  Confident of Assad overthrow to block the establishment of a Shiite axis – from Iran to Hezbollah Lebanon area – allowing the transport of Iranian oil and gas via the Mediterranean, Gulf oil monarchies competed for fund Islamist militias, Al Qaeda mostly, but also of the Islamic State.  In Syria, the American, English and French planes strikes significantly reduced the Islamic forces, reversing the balance of forces, preventing ISIS topple alawite regime.  The Syrian army then reconquered ‘useful’ Syria thanks to Russia carpet bombing and field Hezbollah mercenaries driven by the Iranian Al Quds brigade. Bashar al Assad had released in the summer of 2012 jihad leaders in a pay tactic : “me or chaos”; Syrian President focused its attacks not on the jihadists but on the Free Syrian Army, dropping TNT filled barrels on schools and markets and hospitals, carrying out unconventional war, using chemical bombing, laying siege to cities. The half-million deaths of the war are mostly collateral civilians.  Russia intervened in September 2015 to save its naval facility in Latakia, deriving the political and geostrategic benefit of a defeat of the Islamic State largely partly achieved by Western arms.  End of 2018 there are winners and losers of the Iraqi-Syrian conflict because “war is pursuing politics, by other means” according to Clausewitz formula; some belligerents have achieved their objectives, others not.  The Western countries conceal their disappointment of the resilience of the Syrian leader claiming that Daesh, a threat to their own security, is over but some ISIS terrorist capability remains.  Ten to twenty thousand of its militiamen hide in Syria and Iraq. Turkey, despite its NATO obligations, let the passage of jihadist recruits and ISIS smugglings through its borders until 2016; Turkey is now in a stalemate; Kurdish Rojava at its border is a fact.  Saudi Arabia has been unable to subjugate Qatar, has to concede UN interference to put an end to its infamous war in Yemen. Israel relied too much on Russian assurances to limit Iran’s ambitions in Syria; now it is dangerously weakened by the presence  of Iranian forces and the reinforcement of Syrian anti-aircraft capabilities by Russian missiles.  One-third of Syria is now either occupied by Turkish troops and by the Syrian Democratic Forces, an armed Kurdish-Arab coalition supported by two thousand US advisers and an unrecognized number of French advisers. On December 19, 2018 President Donald Trump tweeted the hasty withdrawal of US troops from Syria. This move impedes the difficult UN Geneva political settlement process, reinforces the inflexibility of Bashar al-Assad and complicates Russia winning exit.  The rushed withdrawal of US forces from Iraq by Barack Obama in December 2011 contributed to the Islamist insurgency. Donald Trump hectic diplomacy may relaunch the conflict in Syria, it puts Israel and Iran at odds with Putin as unpleased go between.  It is to be feared that the humanitarian crisis will continue in Syria; Russia and Iran were able to keep in power Bashar al-Assad but cannot afford to finance the reconstruction of a country ruined by seven years of war.

By zackaria wadghiri Rabat – Spain is determined to improve cooperation with Morocco in the tourism sector, Spanish Minister of Industry, Trade, and Tourism Reyes Maroto said Wednesday in Madrid.

Spain and Morocco are strong partners “who share a common history and enjoy strong relations,” added Maroto after a meeting with Moroccan Minister of Tourism, Air transport, Crafts, and Social Economy Mohammed Sajid, at the 39th International Tourism Fair (FITUR) in Madrid.
 “Spain is the second [most popular] market for tourists to Morocco after France and Morocco is the top destination for Spanish tourists outside Europe,” said Secretary of State to the Minister of Tourism Lamia Boutaleb. Maroto asserted that the renewed memorandum of understanding between the two kingdoms in tourism, expected in 2019, will add new momentum to this cooperation. 
Through the new memorandum, said Maroto, “we will be able to formalize the future of our relations in the tourism industry, not least by finding in the common culture, we share a project that will allow visitors who come to Spain to enjoy Morocco” and vice versa. Held for the first time in 1980, FITUR is a global gathering of tourism professionals. The event attracted 251,000 visitors in 2018. Over 12 million tourists visited Morocco in 2018, up 8 percent from 2017.

By Amal El Attaq Rabat – The Norwegian Statistical Office has announced that “Mohammed” and its various spellings wass the most common baby name in 2018 among males in the Norwegian capital, Oslo. In an article published on January 24, the office said that while Lucas is the most popular male name nationally, Mohammed dominates in Oslo. A Norwegian statistics expert, Joergen Ouren, said that in Oslo “‘different’ names are more popular than elsewhere in the country” because of Oslo’s immigrant communities.    He pointed out that the name Mohammed was the most popular in Oslo 10 years ago. In 2018, Mohammed was followed by Lucas, Philip, Oscar, and Oliver in popularity in Oslo. According to Pakistani outlet the Nation, Mohammed does not come in the top 10 names in other Norwegian cities. According to Sputnik, Oslo has the largest immigrant population in Norway, with many Norwegians born to immigrant parents. Of its total population of 624,000, 190,000 are immigrants or people born to immigrant parents. “The proportion of Muslims living in the Norwegian capital is 8.7 percent,” said the news agency. It related that people from Morocco, Pakistan, and Somalia form the largest international Muslim communities. Mohammed was also the most popular name in the Swedish city of Malmo in 2017, and was ranked 10th most common in England and Wales during the same year.

Rabat – Following the recent investigation revealing that Swiss cigarettes sold in Morocco have more nicotine than those sold in Europe, Philip Morris’s affiliate in Morocco has reacted to the findings. The investigation’s results, recently published by the organization Public Eye, found that “in 2017, 2,900 tonnes of Swiss cigarettes were exported to Morocco, the equivalent of some 3.625 billion ‘ciggies.’” Arousing controversy among Moroccans, the investigation targeted several tobacco brands, including the giant Marlboro, one of the brands produced by Swiss-based tobacco manufacturing company Philip Morris International. Officials at Philip Morris Maroc, an affiliate of Philip Morris International, reacted to the inquiry, saying there is no “less or more harmful cigarette than another and the best choice for smokers is simply to quit smoking,” daily newspaper Aujourd’hui Le Maroc reported. The tobacco company emphasized that its products sold in Morocco “perfectly meet the relevant regulation in Morocco,” the Moroccan newspaper added. The Swiss journalists who led the investigation, Marie Maurisse and Gie Goris, said they analyzed samples of Swiss cigarettes in Morocco and in Europe at the Lausanne Health Institute, a laboratory affiliated with the World Health Organization. “For each substance tested, nearly all cigarettes produced in Switzerland and consumed in Morocco contained levels higher than that found in Swiss and French cigarettes,” their analysis reads. Aujourd’hui Le Maroc affirmed that Philip Morris Maroc was telling the truth because Morocco does not have any regulations defining the maximum levels of substances in tobacco products. “Unlike, for example, Europe where these levels are regulated by Standard 10-1-10.” The newspaper mentioned a draft bill on tobacco products introduced in 2012 but never examined or voted on. The Swiss investigation also confirmed that there is no regulation of cigarette components in Morocco. “In 2012, Morocco passed a law akin to European legislation, limiting the permissible levels of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide. However, the decree implementing it was never promulgated and there is no laboratory to check the levels of these substances.” Sources at Philip Morris Maroc, nevertheless, told the newspaper that the quality of their Swiss cigarettes cannot be manipulated since tobacco plants around the world respect the same quality and production standards. Since Morocco does not have a law on these standards, “it is up to the Moroccan legislator to quickly fix its own standards instead of letting doubt float with the current legal vacuum,” the sources stressed.

Rabat – The news of a possible visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Morocco has created backlash among Moroccan anti-normalization movements. “The visit would take place around March 30, right after a visit to the African country by Pope Francis,” Times of Israel reported last week.  Israeli news outlets claimed that Morocco hopes to receive support from the US government on the Western Sahara conflict. The Moroccan government, known for its support of the Palestinian cause, has not yetcommented on the rumors. The government’s silence deepened speculations, but anti-normalization movements are already warning the government not to make a move towards normalizing diplomatic ties with Israel. The Moroccan Observatory Against Normalization with Israel issued a press release on the issue. The observatory said that “the issue of the Sahara for the Zionist entity, is like a milking cow that [Israel] cannot abandon as promoted by the media to justify the ominous visit of Netanyahu (if it happens).” The statement added that “Zionists will seek to perpetuate the Maghreb tension and inflame it.” The secretary general of the observatory, Aziz Hanawi, told Morocco World News that those promoting a visit by Netanyahu to Morocco are trying to “convince us that it is a matter of mediation on the Sahara issue.” Hanawi also said that the Zionist lobby is taking advantage of the Sahara issue to extort Moroccan concessions. Hanawi said that Israel wants Morocco to abandon its support for the Palestinian cause in return.
 The Moroccan government and King Mohammed VI have always expressed their full support for the Palestinian cause. King Mohammed VI also was among the first world leaders to warn the US and the United Nations after King Mohammed VIUS President Donald Trump decided to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Regarding the Western Sahara conflict, Morocco is firm that the issue must be solved within the United Nations without the interference of any country or organization, including the African Union. The Moroccan government also said that it will accept no compromise on its sovereignty over the region. Moroccan officials object vociferously to any normalization of relations with Israel. After the US decided to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018, Moroccan MPs asked for a vote on a draft bill to criminalize normalization with Israel. “Anyone who contributes to, participates in or attempts to commit acts of normalization with Israel shall receive a sentence ranging from 2 to 5 years in prison and shall pay a fine of between MAD 100,000 and MAD 1 million.” In 2017, the spokesperson of the Moroccan government denied the existence of trade between Morocco and Israel, emphasizing that the country “does not have any relations of any kind with Israel.”

Rabat – The National Office for Food Safety (ONSSA) has not yet finished carrying out a “quality and authenticity analysis” on about 20 containers of olive oil that have been detained at the Agadir port for almost two months, Moroccan news outlet L’economiste reported Monday. Seafood canners, who use olive oil, have expressed concern about their business as they await the results of ONSSA’s analysis.  For its part, ONSSA declared that customs at Moroccan ports have increased import restrictions to ensure the quality of the different types of imported olive oils. Any imports that do not conform to the country’s import control standards will be disposed of, ONSSA said. Recently, ONSSA issued new statistics showing that 67 percent of surveyed Moroccans do not check for a label on olive oil that indicates expiration dates, preservation conditions, sanitary and safety requirements, and the product’s license number, before purchasing. ONSSA’s survey followed Morocco’s Ministry of the Interior warning of fake, poisonous olive oils distributed in the country.  The ministry has deployed a campaign to combat vendors selling fake olive oil across the country. Frauds allegedly use capsules, mixing them with lukewarm water to produce a liquid that resembles olive oil, potentially causing health risks. In December, Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch said his ministry would also deal strictly with frauds selling fake essential oils. Morocco is the 4th biggest olive oil producer in the world, with olive trees covering more than 1.07 million hectares, accounting for 65 percent of the tree species in the country. Morocco had harvested 2 million tons of olives in 2018, according to Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch.

Rabat – Morocco rejected Belgium’s request to receive Mustapha Bali, a Moroccan national with a criminal record in Belgium. Bali, according to RTL Info, served a 17-year prison sentence for drug-related crimes.  The news outlet reported that he was also sentenced to three years for rape, a sentence he has not yet served. Belgium has stripped Bali of his residence permit making him an illegal immigrant in Belgium. Belgian Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats politician said that Morocco refused to give Bali the necessary travel documents to return to Morocco, according to DH.be. Belgian outlet Het Laatste Nieuws reported that Bali was “radicalized.” Bali’s sister also has a criminal record for killing her ex-spouse. She was sentenced to 27 years in prison in Belgium. In October 2018, Belgian news outlets reported that the country wanted to extradite a Moroccan jihadist known as “the most dangerous woman in Belgium” to Morocco.  Malika El Aroud is the widow of a Taliban jihadist, Abdessatar Dahmane. Dahmane had posed as a television journalist in Belgium to assassinate the Afghan political and military leader Ahmad Shah Massoud. Also in October, an appeals court in Belgium stripped Moroccan imam Fouad Belkacem of his Belgian citizenship. Belgium imprisoned Belkacem in 2013 after determining that his Sharia4Belgium group had sent dozens of individuals to fight in Syria. Belkacem is facing a 12-year prison sentence.

Rabat – A direct flight connecting Morocco and China is set to open between the end of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, the Moroccan National Tourist Office (ONMT) director general, Adel El Fakir, told a press conference in Casablanca on Tuesday.

“Chinese tourists [traveling to Morocco] have to transit through the Middle East or Europe. Opening a direct line can boost the growth of this promising market,” said El Fakir.

The new flight would connect Beijing, Shanghai, or both to Casablanca. El Fakir did not reveal which airline would operate the route. 
Moroccan Minister of Transport and Tourism Mohammed Sajid, and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) administrator, Feng Zhenglin, met in September to discuss an air transport agreement and a direct flight.  
Over the past three years, the number of Chinese tourists in Morocco rose exponentially from 15,000 to nearly 180,000, following the relaxation of Moroccan visa restrictions.

Rabat – Following reports of the alleged death of an ex-security official in the Tindouf camps, Ahmed El Khalil, Sahrawis have launched an international campaign calling on Algeria and Polisario to explain his absence and presumed death. Sahrawis have created a Facebook page to draw attention to the issue called “We Are All Ahmed El Khalil.” On the page, Facebook users have shared videos and posts about the life of El Khalil, while people commenting on the posts repeat the same slogans: “We Are All Ahmed El Khalil,” “Freedom for El Khalil Ahmed,” and “We Are Against the Forced Disappearance of El Khalil Ahmed.”  On January 9, former Polisario security official Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud wrote a post on his Facebook account announcing the alleged death of his colleague. According to Mustafa Salma, El Khalil, who had been a leading member of the separatist group, was kidnapped by Algerian intelligence services over 9 years ago. Polisario tasked El Khalil with overseeing human rights in the Tindouf camps in Algeria in 2009. A few months after his appointment, Polisario arrested him under unknown circumstances. An anti-Polisario activist, Mustafa Salma spoke with Morocco World News about the kidnapping. Salma said that the Polisario member has been forcibly imprisoned in Algerian prisons for more than 10 years. He added that El Khalil is one of the most important Sahrawi intellectuals, who had published distinguished writings.  “He is a literary and cultural critic and a social and geopolitical analyst.” El Khalil was born in Tan-Tan, in the region of Guelmim-Oued Noun in southwestern Morocco. El Khalil moved to Fez to complete his high school studies, and he also gained a degree in philosophy from the Department of Social Psychology at the Mohammed V University in Rabat. After finishing his bachelor’s degree, El Khalil joined the first group of young Sahrawis in southern Morocco who called on the liberation of the Sahara from the Spanish colonizers. At international embassies in Rabat, “he participated in several demonstrations and carried out campaigns to sensitize Sahrawis of the Sahara issue.”  In 1977, the Polisario member decided to join the Tindouf camps for Sahrawis in Algeria. He then held several positions, including director of security in Tindouf; director of the Free Sahara newspaper; the media, political, and economic adviser of the “presidency;” and a human rights adviser, the last position he held before his disappearance. El Khalil was also a lecturer in Algerian universities, including the University of Houari Boumedienne. El Khalil also released some publications in French and Arabic. Mustafa Salma said that after El Khalil’s disappearance under “mysterious circumstances,” one of the detainee’s sons was allowed to visit him at the Blida prison in Algeria.  Mustafa Salma said in a previous Facebook post that he knew El Khalil very well. “I knew that the detainee had been jailed and hidden by the [Algerian] intelligence services for almost a month after I consulted [El Khalil’s] case,” Mustafa Salma wrote. It is not the first time El Khalil’s family has called on Algeria to reveal his fate. In 2017, his relatives resorted to the United Nations to pressure Algeria and the separatist group to reveal the truth. El Khalil’s case is not the first of its kind. Polisario military member Ammar Ould Ayanne died under unknown circumstances in the Tindouf camps. Tindouf’s Autonomy Support Forum (FORSATIN) shared a recording of Ayanne’s sister with Morocco World News earlier this month. Ayanne’s sister said that her brother suffered a “minor health issue.” But the Polisario member died after his health deteriorated due to neglect.

Rabat – On Sunday, Amazigh (Berber) activists marched to the grave of Omar Khalek, an Amazigh student who was brutally beaten to death by pro-Polisario students in 2016. The march occurred at the invitation of the National Coordinating Committee of the Amazigh Cultural Movement, which continues to condemn the violent killing of Khalek. Khalek, known as “Izem” or lion in English, died 5 days after suffering serious injuries during the violent clash. On its Facebook page, the committee posted videos of the rally on Sunday.  Marching to his grave, activists carried Amazigh flags and shouted slogans condemning the killing of the prominent activist. Prior to the march, the committee also organized a conference to discuss violence in Moroccan universities and the killing of the activist. The committee also condemned an act of vandalism on Khalek’s grave. The gravestone was covered in black paint. “In conjunction with the third anniversary of the assassination of the martyr Omar Khalek, a group of unknown people desecrated this grave for the second time to disrupt the commemoration,” the committee wrote.  The clashes, which erupted between Sahrawi and Amazigh students at the Faculty of Literature and Human Sciences in 2016, injured five other people. In 2017, the Marrakech Criminal Court sentenced five people to 10 years in prison and 11 others to three years each for the premeditated murder of the Amazigh activists. Spain deported another Polisario separatist, Hussein Bachir Brahim, to Morocco on January 17 of this year in connection to the clashes. Spain rejected the suspect’s asylum request. Morocco issued an arrest warrant for Brahim for alleged involvement in the killing of Khalek.

Rabat – Nasser Zefzafi, a leader of the Hirak Rif protests in Al Hoceima, self-harmed while in prison “to create disorder,” prison authorities said on Sunday. At 6:30 p.m. on Saturday, Zefzafi asked for medical because of pain in one of his legs, the Ain Sebaa 1 prison administration in Casablanca said in a statement. When a nurse began to treat him, Zefzafi “threw the treatment tools and deliberately hurt himself by hitting his hand against the edge of a desk and the wall,” explained the statement. The Hirak activism leader, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June last year, asked for the prison director and a doctor, stating “the [medical] care he received was insufficient,” according to the statement. The prison administration said that Zefzafi committed “acts in violation of the law with the intent of causing disorder and chaos.”  Following Zefzafi’s act, many Hirak Rif detainees “refused to return to their cells,” reads the statement. Prison staff immediately transferred Zefzafi to a hospital for medical treatment. “The prison administration immediately intervened to impose order and ordered the transfer of the detainee to the hospital … because of a swelling over his hand resulting from the injury he deliberately did to himself.” Zefzafi abstained from attending an appeal hearing on January 14 at the Casablanca Court of Appeals, due to what he called the “absence of fair trial conditions.” Following his sentencing in June 2018, Zefzafi, along with other detained Hirak activists, went on a series of hunger strikes to protest alleged torture and harassment. Zefzafi asked, according to his father, “for the rights that other prisoners enjoy: that he be taken out of isolation in a solitary cell and put him in a dignified cell where he can see and talk.” On June 26, 2018, Casablanca’s Appeals Court issued sentences between 1 and 20 years in prison for 53 detained Hirak Rif activists.  The court convicted most of the activists of “undermining the internal security of the state” and “preparing a conspiracy against internal security,” following their participation in protests which broke out in the northern Al Hoceima province in 2016 and 2017.

Rabat – The president of the Constitutional Council of Algeria, Mourad Medelci, 76, died early on Monday after battling illness. 
Algerian media announced that Medelci will buried this afternoon at the Ben Aknoun Cemetery in Algiers. Medelci’s death comes at a critical time for Algeria. Algeria will hold presidential elections on April 18. As head of the Constitutional Council, which monitors and supervises presidential elections, Medelci had a central role. He had served as the Constitutional Council’s president since 2013. 
Medelci earned a master’s degree in economic studies from at the University of Algiers in 1968 and later worked in both the private and public sectors. He became secretary-general of the Ministry of Trade in 1980. Medelci was the minister of trade from 1988 to 1989 and deputy minister for the budget from 1990 to 1991. In 1999, Algeria’s now-81-year-old President Abdelaziz Bouteflika reappointed him as trade minister, a post he held until 2001. From 2001 to 2002, Medelci was minister of finance. Medelci was also Bouteflika’s adviser from 2002 to 2005.
Bouteflika, president of Algeria since 1999, will be running for his fifth term as president in the upcoming elections.

Rabat – A row of historical cannons, each weighing about 1.5 tons, disappeared from the Agadir Oufella Kasbah, a visitor to the kasbah found on Thursday, according to Moroccan news outlet Erem News. The 40 copper cannons are believed to have been stolen. The price of copper has risen dramatically in the last 20 years globally. The Moroccan jewelry industry frequently mixes copper with gold, according to the news outlet, increasing its value. Given the World Bank forecast for copper price in 2019 to $6,540 per ton, the value of the stolen cannons solely in copper material is over $300,000. Sultan Mohammed al-Sheikh al-Saadi, the first sultan of the Saadi dynasty, built the Agadir Oufella Kasbah in 1540. He built the kasbah 236 meters tall to protect against Portuguese attacks. The Agadir earthquake of 1960 partially destroyed the kasbah.

Morocco has had several cases of antiquities and art theft in the past few years. In 2017, police found a stolen 17th-century masterpiece by Italian painter Giovanni Francesco Barbieri in Casablanca. The painting was worth €6 million, according to Italian newspaper the Local. In 2013, precious antiques dating as far back as the 9th century went missing from Al-Quaraouiyine Mosque in Fez. Four years before, unidentified persons stole valuable relics from the Abu Al-Mahasin shrine in Fez. Agadir is a popular tourist destination in Morocco. Agadir welcomed 1 million tourists in 2018, up 13 percent from the previous year.

Rabat – The Ministry of Health has announced that cases of the seasonal “H1N1” virus are nothing to worry about and the epidemiological situation is stable. In a press release, the ministry said that “the national system of vigilance and epidemiological surveillance annually records contamination cases of ‘H1N1’ virus during the cold season, like all other countries over the world.” The ministry related that vaccination remains the most effective prevention against the disease, and called for all citizens to be immunized, especially pregnant women, children between six months and five years, elderly people aged 65 and older, and those with chronic diseases. “The appearance of the seasonal influenza H1N1 is common,” added the ministry. The ministry also called on health sector employees to engage in preventive behaviors, such as “washing hands regularly, reducing contact with flu patients, covering the mouth when coughing or sneezing with a paper tissue, and not to reuse paper napkins, and ventilating rooms.” The Ministry of Health also said that it will provide the public with any updates regarding the epidemiological situation, but gave no information about the number of cases it has recorded this year. According to the Ministry of Health, Morocco recorded its first two cases of H1N1 contamination on June 12, 2009.

Rabat – Over 80 Moroccan figures of various professions and faiths signed an online petition published on Monday denouncing Israel demanding compensation for lost Jewish properties since 1948. Among the signatories is political scientist Gabriel Banon, economist Raymond Benaim, anthropologist Andre Levy, director Kathy Wazana, and philosopher Ahmed Assid.

”Such a ‘demand’ lacks credibility as we easily recall the different phases of Jewish emigration from Morocco,” the petition says. “Moroccan Jewish emigration to Israel began in 1950 with a quota set by the Israeli authorities at just under 25,000 Moroccan Jews a year,” adds the petition. “Spreading these lies will only serve hatred and extremism,” concludes the petition.
Speaking with Morocco World News, Moroccan-French activist Jacob Cohen criticized Israel’s request, describing it as “cynical.”

Cohen said that it was the Israeli intelligence service, known as the Mossad, that sent Jewish Moroccans to Israel.

In 2017, the founder and chairman of the World Federation of Moroccan Jewry, Sam Ben-Shitrit, send a letter to Israeli Minister for Social Equality Gila Gamliel following a “misleading” article by Israeli newspaper Maariv. “We want to state in the clearest way that the Moroccan authorities, for centuries, never expelled the Jews nor confiscated their individual or community property.”

A group of US senators had made similar financial compensation demands to a “list of countries [that] included Morocco. I wrote them a firm letter so that they remove Morocco from this list, and to my great joy they acceded to my request,” the letter says.

According to the Times of Israel, Ben-Shitrit has acted many times as a “middleman” between Israel and Morocco.

A total of 6.6 million Jewish people live in Israel, while 8.1 million live outside Israel. 2,000-6,000 live in Morocco.

Casablanca – It was 8 a.m. and students were standing in serpentine rows, facing a wall steps away from the school gate. Two administrators were shouting at them to line up straight and start singing the national anthem, which they could barely recall. The flagpole was a stone’s throw from them, but nobody was looking at it. Instead, they were looking at the wall where the map of the country was sketched side by side with the national anthem. The students shivered and their voices shook. They sounded like a bunch of foreigners who were trying hard to sing the national anthem of another country. Finally, administrators herded students to their classrooms with shouts and claps. I was wondering whether the students appreciated this kind of treatment, what feelings they took with them to the classroom, and most importantly, whether they felt safe in this factory-like establishment or not. In general, schools are considered safe, but lately we have heard and read more in the news about violence in schools. A feeling of insecurity is creeping up inside both teachers and students. But setting rules, being rigid, and even creating disciplinary punishments will not make schools safer. Instead, this defensive approach will turn schools into a breeding ground for anxiety. We always link safety to the absence of violence and, while this is true, it only focuses on one small piece of reality. What we really need is to focus on the emotional meaning of safety. Elementary school teacher Christina Mattise defines emotional safety as “I have the right to be myself and to have the freedom to learn, work, and play without having my heart, my head or my body hurt.” Creating safe schools, then, takes more than just preventing violence. Instead, it takes creating an environment in which students can experience a sense of belonging, of being welcomed and valued, free from judgment and discrimination, and being free to express their opinions and feelings without fear. Educators need to have a broader perspective to create safe schools. Having a defensive mindset will not help anyone. Interestingly, what makes students feel safe at school is similar to what teachers need: Being respected for one’s professional judgment and opinions, being supported by the administration, and being included in any decisions that might affect performance. As a teacher, up until recently I always used the method of being strict and leaving almost no room for laughter or amusement. Recently, I came to realize that I was wrong and selfish. I thought only about having a silent classroom, but I ended up having a dead classroom. I never thought about my students’ feelings. A 20-year veteran of teaching once said, “I tell my students they have to check their feelings at the door when they walk into my room. We’re there to learn!” I never did that before. Now, as I am writing these words, I am recalling the images of some of my students crying in the schoolyard, and others coming to the classroom with plastic sandals the whole year. Are they emotionally ready to learn? I do not think so. Emotions and learning go hand in hand. The emotional climate in the classroom is crucial. It has a direct impact on students’ learning. In any given learning situation, most teachers exclusively focus on delivering the lesson, but there are other aspects that can either distract or enhance students’ concentration. Some of these aspects are sight, sound, the emotional state of the teacher, the background, and the foreground. Students, whether they are high or low achievers, can tell if a teacher has prepared their lesson before coming to school or not. Being unprepared means resorting to improvisation, and for teachers it is fatal. Students need to be “students.” They need to act their age, and most importantly, they need help. Students do not have a clear grasp of the concepts of maturity, time management, and prioritizing tasks. They need to feel safe and comfortable in the classroom, regardless of classroom conditions. We do not know for sure why some students come to school. Some of them consider school as an asylum from family problems. Some are angry, and school is their only outlet. The teacher should estimate some wrongdoings every now and then, and they should show tolerance towards this kind of misconduct. Devoting some time to silliness and laughter with students will make them feel at ease and will surely grant us many more minutes of concentration and on-task behavior. We have developed a “pay-attention” class with a predominantly “chalk and talk” method. Students come to the classroom with a pre-set psyche. They continuously adapt themselves to the school and the classroom rules. We tend to make the decisions about everything that happens in the classroom. We usually do not ask students about their preferences, and I believe that this is a dictatorial attitude. We presume that students do not know how to learn and listen and that our way is better for them. In the field of teaching there is no one-size-fits-all approach because there are no exact “same classes” and “same levels.” Every class is unique. Even when we teach the same lesson to different classes, the procedures are not the same or verbatim. So we teachers should adopt a teach-and-reflect approach. In other words, we should think thoroughly about how we teach and try to constantly self-evaluate, observe, and analyze our own way of teaching. The world around us is changing quickly. Everything is changing—our country, our social norms, technology, and even workplaces. Why is there an insistence on maintaining one way of educating? This “one way of educating” generates the same kind of half-hearted students whose ultimate goal is to study in a vocational training center for two years and work in a factory. Why don’t we change up our teaching philosophy? Instead of advocating a teacher-student model, we should encourage a model that changes the relationship from teacher-student to mentor-mentee and from send-receive to discussion-debate. Reforming our educational system necessitates a change in climate. I believe that the starting point is having “real” schools. We do not need buildings with classrooms, blackboards, and desks. We need electricity, lamps, televisions, CD players, copy centers, projectors, and any equipment that is involved in creating a healthy atmosphere for teaching and for students to feel comfortable and willing to learn. The dominant atmosphere in schools today is spiritless. Teachers, administrators, and students lack a sense of belonging. Nothing attaches them to the schools where they work and study. They spend the whole year in a place that they do not appreciate. In some schools, teachers and administrators are not united and they seem more like rivals. Everyone is striving for their own benefits and comfort. We cannot reform the system if we are not united. We are waiting for reformation to come from air-conditioned offices, fancy cars, and high-priced suits. The “let sleeping dogs lie” policy that the people in charge are following will not bring about the radical change that the educational system requires. The aftermath of this policy is revealing itself through the mindset of society, growing ignorance, and, of course, new idols and role models. In the “Shawshank Redemption” movie, Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) spent an entire night crawling through prison drainpipes to escape his unfair imprisonment. Reformation comes from within everyone in the educational system. We should portray the reformation that we want to see and bring to school the safety that we want to feel. Regardless of the poor working conditions, crowded classrooms, and the lack of basic equipment, teachers have to crawl through this river in order to succeed in their mission. Continuous learning is the only way we can break the monotony of the lessons, upgrade our skills, widen our professional knowledge, and, most importantly, provide a welcoming and safe learning environment that is key to the process of teaching and learning.

Rabat – Anyone living in Casablanca would be hard-pressed to miss the yellow Glovo billboards that have blanketed the city for the last five months.  And even if you managed to miss them, surely the army of mopeds with yellow Glovo boxes or the persistent YouTube advertisements would have attracted your attention. So what is Glovo? Glovo is a delivery service application that began in Barcelona in 2015 and has rapidly expanded to 19 countries on multiple continents.  Using your smartphone, you can order anything that fits on a bike or moped and have it delivered to you or to someone else! Glovo buys and delivers your item using their independent couriers, called “Glovers.” Customers can use Glovo for anything from retrieving forgotten items like keys or an umbrella to ordering take-out or sending a special someone flowers or chocolate. Recently, my wife ordered a book from a shop downtown. The shop called when it arrived, but rather than spend the time to go pick it up, she had a Glover buy the book and deliver it right to our door! The delivery fee was small compared with the time and stress of battling traffic, fighting for a taxi, searching for an elusive parking spot, or purchasing a tramway ticket. Currently operating only in Casablanca and Rabat, Glovo has plans to expand their services into Marrakech, and eventually Tangier, Fez, and Agadir.  Customers can pay with cash or with credit card, so no money is exchanged with the courier. The app also sends notifications to let you know when your order has been picked up and an estimated time of arrival.  Glovo’s entrance into Morocco may boost the local job market. Couriers can begin earning income with only a bicycle, and as independent contractors, they have flexibility in the hours they work. Glovo’s network of couriers may lower the unemployment rate and provide a source of income for families.   Glovo’s arrival also highlights the ripe opportunities that exist in Morocco for businesses with a vision to capture market share as early entrants. Though many Moroccans look to Europe as the land of opportunity, international companies recognize the incredible potential of the Moroccan market and are setting themselves up to ride the wave of Morocco’s emerging economy. Glovo is a sign of what is to come: Digital start-ups offering new services to Morocco’s burgeoning middle-class.

Rabat – Quoting Moroccan officials, a recent report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), confirmed that Morocco is set to further broaden the dirham currency band when all economic conditions are met. “The authorities remain committed to continuing the exchange rate transition,” reads the report which was made public by IMF on Thursday.  The report added that the transition “would consist in a further broadening of the dirham fluctuation band when conditions permit (…) in the context of a well-structured communication strategy.” Morocco’s government announced the flexible exchange rate system for its currency in January 2018. The parity of the dirham is determined within a band of fluctuation of 2.5 percent against the previous 0.3 percent.  The report included a letter addressed to the head of IMF from Central Bank Governor Abdellatif Jouahri and Morocco’s Finance Minister Mohamed Benchaaboun. In the letter, the Moroccan officials said that “the authorities intend to move to the next phase of this reform for preventative purposes as soon as economic conditions allow them to do so.” According to the authorities, “such a transition will help the economy better absorb potential external shocks, preserve its competitiveness, and support its diversification.” According to the officials,  the government will continue to improve the business climate, including by strengthening incentives and the legal environment for firms” following the “outstanding progress” made in the last few years. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that two Moroccan officials, who requested anonymity, said that the government is likely to wait until “at least 2020 before considering further easing their hold on the currency.” According to the anonymous sources predicted that the system might result in further crisis as Morocco faces debt. Officials, including the Head of Court of Auditors Driss Jettou and President of High Commission for Planning (HCP) Ahmed Lahlimi, warned the government that debt is weighing down Morocco’s economic growth. The overall public debt of the economy will increase to 82.5 percent of GDP, slightly up from 82.2 percent in 2018, according to HCP. Morocco’s economy will also experience a slowdown in growth as the economy is expected to grow at 2.9 percent in 2019.

Rabat – Turkey is one of the multiple countries that support Morocco’s territorial integrity. The country reiterated its support through the spokesperson of the Turkish president, Ibrahim Kalin. Kalin, who held several talks with Moroccan senior officials said that Morocco’s territorial integrity and its stability is a strategic priority for Turkey. The official who carried a letter to King Mohammed VI from Turkey’s President Recep Tayipp Erdogan, said that Morocco is a “of a paramount importance to “Turkey.” The Adviser of Erdogan commented on Turkey’s position during his meeting with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita on Friday. Kalin handed Erdogan’s letter to Bourita. After his talk with Bourita, the Turkish official emphasized the solid ties between the two countries, saying that his country is looking forward to strengthening its cooperation between the countries in all areas, including business and cultural fields. “We are working to intensify our joint actions to bring bilateral relations to the level of a true strategic partnership in the years to come,” he said. Kalin also held talks with Morocco’s head of government Saadeddine El Othmani on Friday in Rabat. According to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, diplomatic ties between both countries were “established on 17 April 1956 by a joint declaration of the Governments of two countries; following the proclamation of independence of the Kingdom of Morocco. Turkey considers Morocco as an important country in the Mediterranean region and North Africa.” The ministry added that both countries “always” maintain good ties and are “mutually cooperating on many regional and international issues.” The main export items linking the two countries are electrical and electronic equipment, vehicles, and jewelry and accessories, while the main import items are oil, electrical and electronic equipment, and machinery.

Rabat – Moroccan Secretary of State for Foreign Trade, Rakiya Eddarhem, has said that the continuous increase in Turkish textile imports to Morocco has so far caused the loss of approximately 46,000 jobs between 2013 and 2016. In a written answer to a question from a member of the Justice and Development Party (PJD), Eddarham said that “the continuous increase in Turkish products has reduced the volume of textile sales of several producers in the local market,” Moroccan newspaper Al Akhbar reported Friday. Domestic production destined for the local market fell by between MAD 11-13 billion, while production volume went down from 80 percent in 2013 to 69 percent in 2016. A 200 percent increase in imports of Turkish products between 2013 and 2017 caused disruption to the textile industry destined for the domestic market, according to the government official. Turkey has taken advantage of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) it signed with Morocco in April 2004. The agreement entered into effect in 2006. The textile sector in Morocco is of great importance in Morocco as it employs approximately 35 percent of national industrial jobs, approximately 368,000 workers, and four percent of the total workforce, according to the 2016 statistics, Eddarham explained. Eddarham said earlier last month that her department had taken some safeguard measures to minimize the disruption that the Turkish imports caused to the Moroccan textile industry, in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Article 22 of the FTA, Moroccan television channel Tele Maroc reported. In the first phase of the FTA, Morocco applied 90 percent duty on some Turkish imports for a period of 200 days starting from January 8, 2018. After consultations with the Turkish authorities, Morocco decided to extend the 90 percent import duty until December 2021, Eddarham said. Morocco’s exports sales of the textile and leather sector in 2018 increased by MAD 1.6 billion from the previous year, according to Moroccan foreign exchange office.

Rabat – President Trump has reappointed David T. Fischer as US ambassador to Morocco after Senate failed to confirm first nomination due to senatorial adjournment. The president’s move suggests he decidedly wants a major Republican figure in the strategic position in Rabat. Earlier this month, federal documents indicated that the Senate failed to confirm Fischer as US ambassador to Rabat. Congressional records for January 4 indicate Fischer was among the nominees for high-ranking federal positions whose nominations had been returned back to presidential consideration. The return of Fischer’s appointment to Trump’s reconsideration meant the president could either resubmit his initial nomination or move on with a new nomine. “Nominations that are pending when the Senate adjourns sine die or recesses for more than 30 days are returned to the President unless the Senate, by unanimous consent, waives the rule requiring their return…. If a nomination is returned, and the President still desires Senate consideration, he must submit a new nomination to the Senate,” according to a Congressional Research Service-sponsored paper. President Trump has clearly chosen to go along with his initial opinion, re-appointing Fischer to the US ambassadorship post in Morocco. Fischer, a car dealer from Michigan, is known for being a major Republican donor. He considerably contributed ($250,000) to President Trump’s inauguration funds, and his nomination to US ambassador has been largely perceived in US policy circles as an expression of gratitude for Fischer’s contribution to President Trump’s inauguration. Trump nominated Fischer to US ambassadorship in Morocco nearly ten months after Dwight L. Bush, the latest US ambassador to Rabat, left his position.  But Fischer’s Congress hearings suffered an even longer delay, taking place in August 2018, ten months after his nomination. For a US administration that has repeatedly vowed unflinching commitment to America’s strongest and oldest allies, the long delay in appointing an ambassador to Rabat was bound to send mixed messages to Moroccan diplomatic circles. So what will happen now that President Trump has chosen to reappoint Fischer, returning the burden of reconsideration to the Senate? “The Constitution, in Article II, Section 2, grants the President the authority to fill temporarily vacancies that “may happen during the Recess of the Senate.” These appointments do not require the advice and consent of the Senate; the appointees temporarily fill the vacancies without Senate confirmation. In most cases, recess appointees have also been nominated to the positions to which they were appointed,” according to the Congressional Research Service study. Meanwhile, for all the mixed feelings that the Trump administration’s delay to appoint its Morocco representative has elicited in Rabat, there appear no perceptible setbacks in the US-Morocco relations. Just yesterday, President Trump approved a spending bill that included a pro-Morocco language with regards to US aid funds and humanitarian assistance to Western Sahara.

Rabat – The White House announced yesterday a partial end to the US government shutdown, ending 37 “excruciating” days of government inactivity. President Trump signed a spending bill to end the country’s longest government shutdown yesterday. The new budget is in tune with Morocco’s Western Sahara position.
President Trump would not sign previous iterations of the bill into law amid divisive party politicking in the heat of the government shutdown. While Trump did not secure the $5.7 billion of funding he wanted for his Mexico wall, he raised a white flag yesterday and signed the bill with an option to later explore common ground on border security. The bill will reopen the government for three weeks, a respite Trump said he will use to get a longer-term bill. “We have reached a deal to end the shutdown… I will sign a bill to open our government for three weeks,” Trump said. “Over the next 21 days I expect that both Democrats and Republicans will operate in good faith.” Pro-Morocco language Trump noted that a bipartisan committee made up of the House and Senate would present him with a “package for me to shortly sign into law.” While for the US the end of the shutdown means the resumption of work and paychecks for federal government workers, for Rabat it means the passing into law of a pro-Morocco spending bill in terms of US financial and food assistance to Western Sahara. “Funds appropriated under title III of this Act shall be made available for assistance for the Western Sahara: Provided, that not later than 90 days after enactments of this Act and prior to the obligation of such funds, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the USAID Administrator, shall consult with the Committees on Appropriations on the proposed use of such funds,” read part of the bill. The language reverses that of an earlier draft which removed Western Sahara from the “Morocco” section in the spending bill, tacitly supporting the Polisario Front’s claims. The bill’s most critical part, however, as far as Morocco is concerned, is its call for more coordinated actions from US and UN officials to monitor food and financial assistance for refugees in the Tindouf camps in Algeria. The goal of coordination, the bill noted, is to ensure that humanitarian assistance actually reaches the camps’ “vulnerable refugees.” Morocco has denounced Polisario’s perceived embezzlement and mismanagement of the funds and humanitarian assistance for refugees in Tindouf. For the US spending bill to raise the same concerns implies that Rabat’s repeated calls for international monitoring have not gone unnoticed.

Rabat – Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov said that security in the Middle East and North Africa cannot improve without the resolution of long-drawn-out conflicts, referring to the Palestinian-Israeli and Western Sahara conflicts. Speaking at a press conference Friday after talks with the Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita, Lavrov emphasized that the Western Sahara issue should be resolved in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions. “Both must be resolved and both require strict implementation of agreements committed to paper in the United Nations Security Council resolutions, including efforts to find mutually acceptable solutions with the participation of all parties concerned in this or that crisis situation,” Russian news agency TASS quoted him as saying. The Russian minister stressed that his country does not back one party at another’s expense. “The friendly relations that we have with the countries in the region is not for the benefit of one party against another,” Moroccan media quoted him as saying. Lavrov is in Morocco, on the last day of a four-day official visit which took him to Tunisia and Algeria as well. The Russian minister expressed his gratitude to King Mohammed VI for the audience he granted him Friday evening at the Royal Palace of Rabat.  The audience, said Lavrov, proves the mutual trust and bilateral cooperation between the two countries. Moscow and Rabat share the determination to implement agreements made during the King’s visit to Russia in March 2016. Lavrov gave the King “greetings and a message of friendship” from Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a press release from the Royal Cabinet. “For his part, King Mohammed VI extended an official invitation to President Putin to visit Morocco.” Lavrov pointed out that both countries made progress in trade and investment. Foreign minister Bourita said noted that trade between Russia and Morocco increased by 13 percent last year. Boasting of the strong relations between Rabat and Moscow, Bourita said that “Morocco is Russia’s second [business] partner in the Arab world and Africa and look forward to be the first partner and Russia’s gateway to the continent.” He stressed that Morocco seeks to boost business partnerships in several sectors such as  agriculture, tourism, fisheries, and energy.

Rabat – Ukrainian authorities have arrested a Moroccan man after he attacked a border guard at Kyiv Boryspil International Airport, Ukraine, for denying him entry. After the man arrived at the airport on Thursday from Turkey and had an extended interview with the Ukrainian immigration authorities, officials decided not to allow the man into Ukraine. Expressing anger and defiance, the man charged at the Ukrainian border guards, who immediately tackled and detained him. The guards took him to administrative officials responsible for noncompliance with law enforcement, reported Ukrainian news outlet UNIAN on Friday. The Moroccan immigrant alleged that he was going to Ukraine to teach English and another language to children as part of an exchange program. The Ukrainian authorities did not believe the man, judging by his “poor English,” the news outlet reported. According to the Ukrainian press service of the State Border Guard Service, the Moroccan man also failed to present evidence supporting his claims.

Rabat – Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani reiterated that small merchants are not impacted by the electronic billing system. The new tax measures requiring electronic invoicing, which recently sparked uproar among merchants, will only impact merchants whose revenue reaches MAD 1 million, El Othmani explained. The head of government pledged that the amount will be further reviewed while meeting merchants’ demands. El Othmani, who was speaking at an interview with Tamazight television channel on Thursday, said he “feels the merchants’ distress understands their demands.”  He emphasized the important role small and medium merchants play in the national economy. Recalling moments when he was young, El Othmani said his father used to send him to some merchants to learn commerce from them. The new measures, which El Othmani said were suspended, stipulate that merchants should use billing software approved by tax authorities to issue invoices.  Regulatory texts regarding the electronic billing, said El Othmani, will not come into effect until after input and consultations with professional bodies and merchants. Allowing a common database with the tax authorities, the measures were expected to come into force in early 2019 to fight tax fraud. During Thursday interview, the prime minister said the meetings he had with professional bodies made him recognize “some problems that worry merchants such as health insurance to which I attach special attention.” On January 18, merchants across the Rabat region closed their shops in protest of the government’s new tax measures using electronic invoicing. Many other cities in Morocco also went on strike during the last two weeks. On January 23, merchants and service providers across Kenitra, near Rabat, also shut shops, groceries, bakeries, and butcheries. Trade unions and associations representing merchants demanded the repeal of Article 145 of the General Code of Taxes on electronic billing and the business identification number, which stipulates that merchants have to use electronic billing for commercial transactions. For some merchants, the new tax measures using electronic invoicing will affect them indirectly. A small merchant in Kenitra, a city north of Rabat, told Morocco World News Thursday that even if the government says “we are exempt from electronic billing, we will be affected by the new tax measures.” “We do transactions with large merchants, concerned with the taxes, who will increase taxes on us.” But after all, it is the citizen, the end consumer, who will pay increased prices and be affected, he complained.

Rabat – Morocco is the 42nd “best country” out of 80 countries, based on how it is perceived internationally. The ranking, produced by BAV Group and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and released by U.S. News, described Morocco as a country that “has a unique mix of Arab, Berber, African and European cultural influences.” Morocco’s ranking has improved on the list since 2018, when it ranked 47th out of 80 countries. Another Maghreb country, Tunisia was listed in 72nd place, falling from 65th in 2018. The top six in the best countries list were Switzerland, Japan, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. Among Arab countries, Saudi Arabia’s rank improved from 37th in 2018 to 32nd in 2019.  The overall ranking assesses the global performance of 80 countries, in terms of quality of life “beyond the idea of broad access to food, housing, quality education, health care,” but also other factors such as individual freedom, job security, environmental quality, and political stability. The 2019 Overall Best Countries Ranking is built on responses from 20,300 respondents from 36 countries in Europe, Africa,, the US, and Asia. Morocco ranked 103rd out of 149 countries on a global prosperity index of 2018 by the Legatum Institute, an independent educational charity based in London. The country fell one place behind Tunisia and one above Tanzania. The North African country scored its best in terms of safety and security (81.66), ranking 45th globally. The global prosperity index measures state performance on economic equality, business environment, governance, education, health, safety and security, personal freedom, social capital, and natural environment. When it comes to freedom in Morocco, the 2018 Freedom House report considered Morocco as “partially free.” The report addressed several issues in Morocco, such as freedom of the press and freedom on the net, noting the government’s crackdown on online news outlets and imprisoning of journalists and activists for their involvement in the Hirak protests in Al Hoceima in northern Morocco. The report also pointed out the difficulty of creating a news website in Morocco.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI granted an audience today to Serguei Lavrov, the Russian foreign affairs minister. Lavrov, who is heading an important Russian diplomatic delegation, was hosted by the King after he had met a number of high-ranking Moroccan officials in the framework of diplomatic overtures between Rabat and Moscow. According to a pres release from the Royal Cabinet, exchanges between the King and the Russian diplomat revolved around the two countries’ readiness to push for more political and economic cooperation on an array of strategic issues in regional and global affairs. Lavrov’s high-stake visit to Morocco comes approximately two years after King Mohammed VI traveled to Moscow, an unprecedented move that sought to assert Moroccan diplomacy and seek more cooperation in untraditional places for Rabat’s diplomatic clout. Drawing on diplomatic inroads made since the King’s visit to Moscow, the Royal Cabinet’s statement noted that Lavrov’s audience with the King comes to seal months of negotiations to strengthen bilateral ties. “This audience is part of the broader in-depth strategic alliance sealed on the occasion of the King’s visit to Moscow in Mars 2016,” the statement said. The statement mentioned the “historical significance” of the rapprochement mood between Rabat and Moscow, explaining that the King’s visit to Moscow has since paved the way for an “exceptional” partnership between the two countries. “This exceptional partnership has developed deep and multidimensional ties between the two countries and opened ambitious perspectives for boosting political dialogue as well as economic cooperation.” Sectors as diverse as fisheries, agriculture, energy, security, industry, and tourism, featured in Lavrov’s audience with the Moroccan monarch, emphasizing the need for further overtures in the Morocco-Russia partnership. Lavrov, who said he was satisfied with the visit and prospects of heightened diplomatic relations with Morocco, extended to the King “greetings and a message of friendship” from the Russian president Vladimir Putin. “For his part, King Mohammed VI extended an official invitation to President Putin to visit Morocco,” according to the press release. The statement suggested that the King’s gesture “reiterated” his commitment to working with his Russian counterpart to bring their two nations and governments closer in terms of dealing with global and regional crises.

Rabat – The Moroccan government is satisfied with the European Union’s decision to defend their partnership against Polisario’s allegations. On Thursday, Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said that the EU “has clearly reaffirmed that it does not recognize” the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). In a press conference, El Khalfi  said that the vote of the European Parliament in favor of the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement and the adoption of the fisheries deal by the EU Parliament’s Fisheries Committee “confirms that the kingdom is steadily accumulating assets and achievements, which reflects the relevance of the position taken under the leadership” of King Mohammed VI. The official also mentioned that two-thirds of African countries do not recognize the separatist group, compared to a third before. He said that Morocco has made “the fight against the separatist ideology a constant.” On Thursday, Morocco’s Permanent Ambassador to the UN Omar Hilale sent letters to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the Security Council to inform them of the adoption of the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement. The adoption of the agreement, according to Hilale, “marks the culmination of a long process of technical negotiations and political consultations.” On January 16, 444 members of the European Parliament voted in favor of the agriculture agreement between Morocco and the EU. Hilale also recalled the visit of EU officials to Western Sahara to inspect the development in the region. In his letters, Hilale said that “in adopting this Agreement, the European Parliament has recognized that its application benefits the development of the Sahara region and the local populations.” He also recalled that the EU Court of Justice (ECJ) “rejected Polisario’s appeal, requesting the cancellation of the agriculture agreement on December 21, 2016.” After the adoption of the agriculture agreement, Polisario described the EU decision as illegal and wrote its own letter to the Security Council. The front also said that it will make a second appeal to the ECJ.

In an interview with MAP, he said that this participation aims to showcase the place that his company has forged “not only in Morocco, but on the whole African continent,” where he is planning to do cooperative projects with 16 countries. The security equipment “made in Morocco” provided by the company presented “relevant and competitive price-quality ratio.” He said his company noted “special” interest by visitors in their exhibited equipment. The Tactical was also the only Moroccan company present in October at the “Milipol Salon Qatar,” a prestigious gathering of security experts in the Middle East.

Rabat – After both houses of the Moroccan Parliament adopted Law 44.18 on military service, the Moroccan government approved two decrees to implement the law. The military service is expected to start in September after the launch of a national campaign to inform citizens. Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said in a press conference following the weekly Government Council yesterday that the military service is an “important national project.” He added that the project aims to “provide young Moroccans with the opportunity to acquire vocational and technical training so that they can join the labor market and integrate into the national economic life.” Commenting on the decrees, El Khalfi said that the law includes the adoption of a voluntary application procedure for Moroccan women and citizens residing abroad in order to protect their rights. The original obligatory service law applied equally to men and women. El Khalfi added that King Mohammed VI will review the two decrees soon, before they can will be published in the official gazette. The procedure will be followed by the launch of a national communication campaign that will announce the details of the new law. According to El Khalfi, 10,000 people will be summoned to conduct the military service each year. People over the age of 25 who were eligible for an exemption can still be called to service up until the age of 40 if the reason for their exemption is no longer relevant. The bill grants exemptions for illness and married individuals. Men who are supporting their families financially will also be exempted. In November 2018, Minister Delegate for the National Defense Abdellatif Loudiyi reportedly said that compulsory military service would cost Morocco MAD 500 million.

Rabat – A man tried to derail the Al Boraq high speed train linking Casablanca to Tangier on Monday by throwing a three-meter tree trunk onto the train tracks.  The gendarmerie arrested the 30-year-old man and recreated the crime scene, according to Moroccan news outlets. Morocco World News contacted the national railway operator (ONCF), but the company did not comment on the incident. The man, who lives in Kenitra Province, north of Rabat, reportedly acted out to avenge his brother’s death. His brother died when his head struck a high speed rail bridge while he was riding on top of a truck. Early Monday morning, the high speed train stopped for over 30 minutes before the path was clear. The individual does not suffer from a mental illness, according to Moroccan outlet Al Akhbar. He reportedly made a video of his plans.

Rabat – Since Morocco’s budget deficit came in at 3.5 percent of GDP in 2018, down from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2017, Fitch Solutions expects the ratio to continue to decrease in the coming quarters. In its recent report titled “Economic Analysis – Continued Gradual Fiscal Consolidation Ahead In Morocco,” Fitch Solutions, a unit of Fitch Group, forecast the fiscal deficit at 3.4 percent of GDP in 2019 and 3.3 percent in 2020. Fitch Solutions Macro Research, formerly BMI Research, said that Morocco’s high spending growth in 2018, estimated at 4.9 percent, kept fiscal consolidation relatively slow. On the downside, the report, shared with Morocco World News, predicts an increase in public wage spending since the government allocated a bigger budget to social sectors, primarily education and health, in the 2019 Finance Bill. The government allocated MAD 68 billion for education in 2019, an increase of MAD 5.4 billion from 2018, and MAD 16.3 billion for the health sector, up 1.6 billion from the previous bill. “This will involve some 40,000 new hires in the public sector which, coupled with salary increases, should serve to drive higher wage spending in 2019.” The trend, according to Fitch Solutions, “should also continue into 2020 given that it is an election year, and as the planned reinstatement of mandatory military service in September 2019 generates new wage obligations in the defense sector.” The obligatory military service will cost Morocco an estimated MAD 500 million according to the 2019 Finance Bill. Morocco’s spending on capital projects will also grow apace. The government is committed to developing rural regions by investing in infrastructure and creating jobs, the report explained. Fitch Solutions cited major infrastructure projects in rural regions such as the $1 billion Nador West-Med port project with its $500 million highway link. The government’s spending will also include “substantial investments into the Green Morocco plan, which seeks to improve agricultural efficiency, output, and drought resiliency.” Despite the considerable increase expected in government spending, the report anticipates rapid growth in revenue. The revenue growth, which is likely to outstrip spending, according to the report, will “rely on the successful privatisation of state assets.” “Stronger real GDP growth, which we forecast at 3.3% in 2019 and 2020 compared to 2.9% in 2018, coupled with a number of tax reforms should help drive continued robust revenue growth in the quarters ahead.” The government adopted several tax reforms for 2019, such as the 2.5 percent social “solidarity contribution” for companies with annual profits exceeding MAD 40 million and increasing taxes on tobacco consumption. The government believes it will generate MAD 2 billion in 2019-2020 from the 2.5 percent corporate income tax and an estimated MAD 1.2 billion in 2019 from taxes on tobacco consumption. However, the government needs to rely on making at least MAD 5 billion from privatizing public companies to achieve its revenue targets, “through the sale of its 30.0% stake in Maroc Telecom.” In October last year, the Moroccan Minister of Economy Mohamed Benchaaboun declared that Morocco would privatize some public companies to help reduce the budget deficit to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2019. The decision, according to Benchaaboun, would improve the governance of public companies and increase state resources. The move is expected to generate MAD 8-10 billion. Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi announced in November 2018 that the government approved Draft Law 39-89 permitting the privatization of public institutions and had decided to sell La Mamounia Hotel in Marrakech. Morocco planned to sell a 51-percent stake in the hotel this year, according to Bloomberg. La Mamounia’s value is expected to be more than MAD 3 billion. “In the absence of the expected privatisation proceeds, and without proportional spending restraint, we would see … the fiscal deficit rise to 3.9% of GDP in 2019,” reads Fitch Solutions’s report. When it comes to the debt to GDP ratio, the report said it will slowly decrease “at least over the long term” despite a planned Eurobond issuance in 2019. “We expect a drop from 67.5% of GDP in 2018 to 66.3% in 2019, and further to 55.8% by the end of our long-term forecast period in 2028.” Morocco’s external debt, according to Fitch Solutions, remains “extremely low” because “four-fifths of debt is denominated in local currency.”  “Repayments are also sufficiently spread out to avoid sudden pressures on liquidity.” Since the country has access to the IMF’s $2.97 billion Precautionary and Liquidity Line over two years, approved in December last year, it will contribute to external stability. Despite the North African country’s plans to issue a new bond in 2019 of around €1 billion, the report expects the issuance “is unlikely to materially affect the external debt load.” Morocco started issuing bonds in the international financial market in 2007 when it received a €500 million loan, then €1 billion euros in 2010, $1.5 billion in 2012, $750 million in 2013, and €1 billion in 2014. However, Fitch Solutions warns that “control over broader public external debt (twice the size of the treasury’s) remains an issue that will complicate the government’s efforts to reduce its overall liabilities over the coming years.”  At the end of 2017, Morocco had MAD 900 billion in public debt and MAD 149 billion in debt service, according to the Association for the Taxation of Transactions and Aid to Citizens in Morocco (ATTAC Maroc).

Rabat – A video has surfaced of a pilot ejecting from a Royal Air Force Mirage F1 fighter plane before it crashed in the Taounate region of northern Morocco. The plane crashed on Monday afternoon during a training mission because of a technical malfunction, a Royal Armed Forces (FAR) statement said.

The navigator managed to eject from the aircraft and is “safe and sound.” The crash occurred “in an uninhabited area and did not cause any collateral damage,” according to FAR. The video shows a few buildings and cows within eyeshot of the crash. 

FAR uploaded the video on its YouTube channel to show the pilot’s ejection. The recording shows the pilot parachuting down from the plane. The sound of the airplane crashing can also be heard.

The Mirage F1 is a fighter plane made by French aircraft manufacturer Dassault.

In 2015, a Royal Air Force Mirage F1 airplane crashed near the Sidi Slimane Air Base, northeast of Rabat. The airplane crashed after hitting a “flock of large birds,” but the pilot managed to eject safely. FAR reported that there were no casualties from the crash, which occurred in an uninhabited area.

Rabat – The Moroccan government has commented on the 2019 Human Rights Watch (HRW) report on Morocco. The Interministerial Delegation for Human Rights (DIDH) said that “these political positions and these allegations and erroneous conclusions will be the subject of a detailed answer in the weeks to come.” Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) said that DIDH quoted Moroccan authorities who expressed their “total rejection of the political positions” and allegations included in the report on human rights in Morocco. The Moroccan authorities maintain that  HRW “continues to adopt an approach that lacks objectivity and professionalism, based on estimates and general conclusions, selected and one-sided.” The statement added that the conclusions would likely distance the NGO from the “spirit of cooperation and the positive and constructive dialogue with the various actors concerned with the promotion of human rights in the kingdom.” DIDH contended that the negative comments in the report “reflect the predefined orientations of HRW.” The national delegation for human rights said that the report lacks credibility and is unrealistic, “which require investigations, reliable sources, and useful cross-references.” The statement added that the Moroccan authorities “consider that the introduction in this report of an isolated case concerning illegal immigration, claiming that the authorities have carried out a large campaign against thousands of migrants is an additional and clear indicator of the adoption of an erroneous and selective approach in this report.” Last week, HRW issued its report summarizing all human rights concerns that took place in Morocco in 2018. The NGO claimed that the Moroccan law enforcement used “excessive force in breaking up protests, as well as arrests of peaceful protesters,” noting protests about mining deaths in Morocco’s eastern town of Jerada. The report also said that the government launched a “large-scale crackdown on thousands of sub-Saharan migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees without due process.”

Rabat – In a video shared on social media, a Moroccan toddler of about 18 months named the capitals of 44 countries, getting all correct except for one. The toddler’s Moroccan mother asked what the capital is for each country she named Zambia, “Niger, Thailand, Yemen, Macau, Italy, Bulgaria, Russia, Japan, China, Italy, Norway, Morocco, Bangladesh, Austria, Vatican, Azerbaijan, Cuba, Bolivia, Peru, Senegal, Afghanistan, Uganda, Maldives, Canada, Sudan, Iraq, Britain, Palestine, America, Lebanon, Greece, Iran, Qatar, Mexico, Kuwait, Germany, France, Tanzania, Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, Algeria, and Tunisia,” which the toddler immediately answered. That was until the mother asked, “What is the capital of Israel?” The toddler responded that it “does not exist.”  The video came a few days after news of an educational book for children published in Morocco negated the existence of Palestine and described Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, sparking controversy.  The Ministry of Education denied that a recognized schoolbook included a map of the world that does not show Palestine While US President Donald Trump formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on December 6, 2017, Moroccans who support the Palestinian cause do not recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. The Moroccan government has long supported the Palestinian cause. King Mohammed VI, and other Arab leaders like King Abdullah of Jordan and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, condemned Trump’s decision.

Rabat – It is official: young Moroccan women cannot visit Jordan without a male guardian, called a mahram, unless they have a Jordanian invitation. The Jordanian ambassador to Rabat, Hazem Al Khateb Attamimi, acknowledged that Moroccan women aged 18 to 35 are subject to stricter rules when applying for visas to visit Jordan. Quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the ambassador said the visa regulations “have been applied for many years and have not been modified.” The ambassador added that the policy “is governed by regulations related to the legalization and protection of the labor market in Jordan.” Attamimi said the policy only “restricts and limits the entry of certain age groups, and does not prohibit them.” Earlier this month, a group of Moroccan human rights activists condemned the discriminatory policy after their visa requests were rejected by the Jordanian embassy in Rabat. The women, who spoke with Morocco World News, intended to represent the international human rights organization Oxfam in workshops in Jordan. Mounia Semlali, one of the Moroccan women whose visa request was rejected, said that the embassy verbally told her that she could not visit the country without a mahram. “Why must Moroccans between 18 and 35 years old be accompanied by a mahram to have the right of entry in Jordan? Why Moroccans in particular?” she asked. She added that not all Moroccans are “prostitutes” and that the policy should be applied to all nationalities world instead of just singling out Moroccan women. The ambassador argued that Jordan does not “prevent Moroccan citizens from entering its territory, provided they submit to regulatory measures to specify the workplace or to indicate the reason for the visit.”  He noted that “our Moroccan brothers are welcome, as has always been the case, in their second country, Jordan. “ Attamimi gave no explanation for why Jordan applies the rule only to Moroccan and Tunisian women. After his response, Semlali wrote a letter to the ambassador. In her message, which she shared with Morocco World News, Semlali sarcastically thanked the ambassador for his indirect response. She also mentioned she was unable to meet the ambassador directly  because she did not get an answer to her request. “First, I would like to apologize for this response on my Facebook page, but as you know, you have not responded to my invitation to meet you.” She noted the ambassador’s strong “will in facilitating the visa application process for the citizens of both countries” and for his “respect” for both genders. “I tried to believe you because Her Majesty Queen Rania is one of the greatest figures in the world who supports the cause of women.  I tried to believe you, and to deny my story with your esteemed embassy, ​​I tried hard to believe you, and to deny the hundreds of letters you have received that confirm this qualitative discrimination and verbal insults against my country’s women,” she wrote.  Questioning his side of the story, the activist asked: “Is it reasonable, Ambassador, that all this exists, and you are not aware of it ?????” Asmaa Fakhoury, another Oxfam employee who faced the same issue, talked about the stereotypes that some Jordanians hold against Moroccan women. Fakhoury shared a Facebook post condemning the comments she received from a policeman at the airport of Amman during her visit for work. “Do you know what Moroccan [women] do here in Jordan?” a policeman asked, implying they are prostitutes. When she said, “Yes,” the policeman’s colleagues laughed. He then rhetorically asked her: “What do they do?” Fakhoury then said that women work in international organizations and run projects and programs aiming to end poverty. “They travel more than 16 hours to attend workshops but they are insulted because they are Moroccans.” Despite her firm words, the policeman laughed and said, “I promised myself that my second wife would be a Moroccan. I like wild women.”

By Amal El Attaq The World Health Organization (WHO) has found that immigrants from Morocco are more likely to have diseases in Europe than other Europeans. In the Netherlands, migrants from Morocco “had a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases than the host majority population, and this risk did not change with duration of stay or cultural adaptation,” said the WHO report. Ill health may be linked to weight problems. WHO added that “some evidence suggests that, in Europe, the prevalence of overweight and obesity is higher for migrant children of both sexes from Morocco and Middle East.” The report also found that girls with migrant background were more likely to be overweight or obese than migrant boys. The report related that national laws can conflict with international ones in providing the fundamental right to health. The WHO attributes the higher prevalence of diseases to a lack of adequate medical care and highlighted the case of pregnant women. “Frequently, irregular migrants do not have access to antenatal and postpartum health care services and are often limited to emergency care services,” said the report. The report noted higher rates of cardiovascular diseases among migrant populations and speculated “prevalence may be linked as much to socioeconomic factors as to migration-specific factors.” The report called for European countries to provide medical services for migrants and ensure they have access to medical facilities with good diagnostic methods. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Moroccans were the second most common national to immigrate to Europe during 2018. A total of 12,745 Moroccan immigrants attempted to get to Europe via the Mediterranean; among them, 11,342 migrants survived the journey to the continent.

By Zakaria Ouadghiri Rabat – The Casablanca Court of First Instance sentenced Moroccan boxer Mohamed Rabii to a one month’s suspended prison sentence for “adultery ” in accordance with Article 490 of the Criminal Code. A 36-year-old woman confessed to the court in September 2018 that she had an extramarital affair with the boxer, according to Al Massae newspaper.

The woman, who received the same sentence, claimed to have had a physical relationship with the athlete after he promised to marry her. She stated that they would meet in an apartment in Rabat that Mohamed Rabii rented. Under Article 490, having sexual relations with a person of the opposite sex outside of marriage is punishable by one month to one year in prison. 
Rabii said he knew the plaintiff a year ago. He wanted to marry her but gave up after his family objected to their marriage on the grounds that she was divorced with a child. He also said he informed her of his decision to end their relationship, reported Al Massae.

Rabii, 25, won a bronze medal in the welterweight event at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Rabat – A map of Morocco without Western Sahara may come as no surprise to Moroccans because the football club that posted it is owned by Turki Al Sheikh, the former chairman of the General Sports Authority in Saudi Arabia, who has seemingly held an anti-Moroccan sentiment for a quite some time. The Egyptian football club, the Pyramids FC, disrespected Morocco’s sovereignty over its southern provinces. The club posted a map yesterday to announce the time of a game between two Egyptian football teams, Zamalek and Pyramids FC. The map shows the time of the football game in each time zone. The map shows Western Sahara divided from Morocco. Up to publishing time, the football club has not deleted the provocative map from Facebook and Twitter. Several Moroccans commented on the post, condemning the division of the Moroccan map into two parts. “Why are you dividing the Moroccan map while it is historically complete from Tangier to El Guira,” one wrote. Another commenter said that the relationship with “our Egyptian brothers is a relation of brotherhood and love since thousands of years. This [penguin] will not be able to sow enmity and hatred between us,” referring to Al Sheikh. It is not the first time that Al Sheikh, known for his unfriendly comments towards Morocco, has received backlash for dividing the Moroccan map. In December 2018, the Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA), chaired by Al Sheikh, divided the Moroccan map into three parts, excluding Western Sahara from Morocco.  Al Sheikh’s unfriendly position toward Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup made the move appear intentional. The official launched a campaign against Morocco during the 2026 World Cup bid last summer. He also politicized the bid by commenting on the Moroccan neutrality in the Gulf crisis between the Saudi coalition and Qatar. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) informed Morocco World News in December that it had contacted the Secretariat General of the Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA) about the mistake of the map. The UAFA then deleted the map immediately. FRMF is expected to report on the Pyramids’ map again.

Rabat – The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) ordered that a chief police inspector working at Marrakech-Menara airport be temporarily suspended from duty on Thursday after he was caught stealing. 

The Marrakech Judicial Police Prefectural Service opened a judicial inquiry to investigate charges that a British tourist brought against the inspector, according to a DGSN statement. 
The tourist asserted that he handed in his passport to the police officer at the airport counter.  He later noticed that Moroccan and British banknotes were missing from the document. After realizing the money was gone, the tourist retrieved the money “in three parts” from the police inspector.

The national security services viewed the surveillance camera footage, which backed up the tourist’s story. The chief inspector will have to appear before the disciplinary board to determine how he will be disciplined.

Rabat – European automotive logistics company GEFCO announced that it will transport 45 autoracks from Saint-Nazaire port in France to Tangier port by the end of 2019. The company had transported the first two autoracks, or wagons, last month to French carmaker PSA Group’s new plant in Kenitra, 40 kilometers north of Rabat. “A total of 47 wagons will transport new vehicles on the railway connecting Tangier to Kenitra, where Groupe PSA will inaugurate a new plant,” GEFCO said in a press release on January 23. Morocco’s National Railways Office (ONCF) will operate the autoracks and carry the cars by train from PSA’s plant in Kenitra to Tangier port before exporting them to Europe, according to the press release. Anne Lambusson, an executive vice president at GEFCO, said: “We’re very pleased Groupe PSA has trusted GEFCO with this exciting project and we’re confident we have the right expertise and capabilities to make it a success.  GEFCO said that the project will also consolidate its position in Morocco. In September last year, PSA Group announced that its Kenitra plant, set to produce 100,000 cars in 2019, will double its annual production capacity to 200,000 next year at a cost of €560 million. GEFCO, which serves 300 destinations worldwide, said it “is supporting Groupe PSA’s ambitious development strategy in Morocco and in Africa more widely.”  PSA “plans to make Kenitra a leading industrial hub and has already started developing a dedicated network,” the company added. The French car manufacturer’s sales in the Middle East and Africa region grew by 61.4 percent from 2016 to 2017, selling 618,800 units. “The Kenitra plant is the best performing of the industrial plants of PSA Group,” according to Jean Christophe Quemard, PSA Group’s executive vice-president in the Africa-Mideast region. The Kenitra automotive construction site started in 2017. By the end of 2017, PSA Group had a total workforce of 350 in Morocco. According to the Moroccan Ministry of Industry, the workforce is expected to reach 2,200 people  in 2019.

Rabat – The Danish government is still b struggling to end the sharing of the video that allegedly show what some believe to be the killing of one of the Scandinavian tourists near Imlil, a village in the Atlas Mountains near Mount Toubkal in Morocco. Authorities found  the bodies of Maren Ueland from Norway and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen from Denmark on December 17. According to Danish news outlet BT, the Danish public prosecutor Kirsten Dyrmann said that  a large group of people in Denmark are sharing the video, urging them to refrain from sharing it.  According to the news outlet, the publish prosecutor has been tasked to investigate into the sharing of the video. According to Dyrmann, the sharing of the video may be punishable. The video purportedly showing the murder also caused uproar in Norway. In December, Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg urged people to stop downloading and sharing the graphic video. Solberg said that she hopes that people “will show support and compassion for the victims and their relatives by abstaining from spreading” the video. She added that the video has been posted on her own Facebook page. At least 22 suspects have been arrested in connection with the murders.  Morocco has still not revealed the result of the investigations into the video.  Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said in a press conference in December that investigations were still underway to determine whether the video was related to the crime.

A human and drug trafficking network made up of two Moroccan men, two Spanish men, and one unidentified woman kidnapped a minor Moroccan migrant in Spain.  On Wednesday, members of the civil guard found the boy in a bad condition “as was forced to sleep on a mattress on the floor under strict supervision,” in a house where he was incarcerated in Puerto Real, a town in Cadiz province. The kidnappers snatched the minor, who reached Spain on an irregular migration boat, from a juvenile center in the municipality of El Bosque, and blackmailed his family in Morocco to give them money in exchange of the boy’s safety, reported Diario de Cadiz newspaper. The civil guard found hash smuggled from Morocco at the house in which the boy was held. The Spanish police arrested the five members of the network who specialized in abducting foreigners in Spain and smuggling drugs.

Rabat – Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Bin Mohamad said that his country will not allow athletes from Israel to compete in a tournament in Malaysia later this year. The competition would serve as a qualifying tournament for the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics. Mohamad said in a press conference in Vienna on Tuesday that every country “has the right to accept or refuse entry of anybody.” Mohamad noted that in the US, “they are erecting a very high wall to prevent Mexicans from going to America.” He said that his country has the same idea. “People who are undesirable for our country will be kept out of our country.” He also labeled Israel a “criminal country.” “If their people want to compete in sport, they can go to some other country.” He also condemned Israel’s move to prevent aid ships from entering Gaza. “There are many other things done by Israel that are against international laws and against morality,” Mohamad added. It is not the first time Malaysia has said it will deny entrance to Israeli athletes. Channel News Asia reported that Malaysia refused to grant visas to two Israeli windsurfers in 2015. Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon responded, “This is shameful and totally opposes the Olympic spirit.”The statement continued, “Israel condemns the decision, inspired no doubt by Malaysia PM Mahathir’s rabid anti-Semitism.” Dozens of swimmers will take part in the competition from July 29 to August 4 in Sarawak, Malaysia.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI’s effective combination of diplomacy, friendship, and business is spearheading a brand new post-colonial order in Africa, according to an opinion article by Jon Marks published today in the Financial Times. According to Marks, one reason for “Morocco’s unexpected pivot towards its own continent” is the “diminished confidence” of African countries in their “traditional [Western] partners.”  At the center of Morocco’s “Africa turn,” lies the North African country’s so far well-selling South-South agenda and King Mohammed VI’s perceived genuine commitment to a continent he has called “Morocco’s institutional family.” “Morocco Inc,” as Marks dubbed Moroccan banks’ success story in the rest of the continent, reposes essentially on coupling sound diplomacy with win-win investment ventures. While “big questions remain” and “cynics” continue to doubt what Morocco will reap in the long-term from its Africa turn, Rabat is bound to be an integral player in the big games to come. For Marks, the “trend cannot be ignored if one is to understand contemporary Africa.” From OCP Africa’s agricultural activism, to the financial might of the “big three” (Attirajawafa Bank, BMCE Bank, and Banque Centrale Populaire) and the Nigeria-Morocco pipeline project, Rabat has extended its outreach to “previously unfamiliar markets” like Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Egypt.  That means that Morocco’s now two-year-old return to the African Union has so far yielded positive results. And in addition to its financial presence on the continent, Morocco also enjoys close historical and cultural ties with many countries involved, improving Morocco’s prospects despite projected setbacks. But Morocco-Africa has not been an immaculate experience. For all the plaudits that Moroccan diplomacy has collected in recent months and weeks, there remain some grey zones in Morocco’s diplomatic outreach. The article explained, “The Ecowas application has stalled. The pitfalls of building up sub-Saharan exposure by banks and big companies are discussed privately but played down publicly. Morocco is having to live with the SADR’S AU membership, which may complicate diplomatic ties with some countries.” Overall, though, the piece suggests there is more to come from Morocco’s South-South policy as new dynamics are set to emerge in African affairs. “While Morocco’s new African strategy has been most evident in commercial deals, it also points towards the emergence of a genuinely post-colonial African order,” Marks concluded.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita gave an interview to Al Jazeera, explaining recent developments in Moroccan diplomacy. Bourita’s interview was aired yesterday on the Bila Houdoud (Without Borders) television program. The interview started with an overview on the Gulf crisis. Al Jazeera journalist Jalal Chahda asked Bourita whether Morocco’s neutrality in the crisis created tension between Morocco and Saudi Arabia. Bourita denied that there is tension between the two kingdoms. Instead, he said, Morocco was clear in its neutrality statement and has attempted to get to the bottom of the crisis between the Saudi coalition and Qatar. According to the official, the crisis was unfortunate because the Gulf Cooperation Council, which has since been dissolved, was the “only point of light in the Arab world.” Bourita also recalled that Morocco offered to mediate in the Gulf crisis because Morocco’s destiny is linked to the stability of the region. “If the parties so wish, the Kingdom of Morocco is ready to offer its services to foster a frank and comprehensive dialogue,” Morocco said at the time. Morocco also sent food assistance to Qatar. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs cited religion as a reason “especially during the month of Ramadan where solidarity among Muslim people is required.” King Mohammed VI was also the first world leader to visit Qatar after the blockade, earning the nickname by Qataris as the “blockade breaker.” The Moroccan official acknowledged that Morocco was originally part of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman’s world tour in November 2018. Bin Salman, also known as MBS, made stops in Tunisia, Algeria, and Mauritania but skipped Morocco. Bourita said that Bin Salman did not visit Morocco due to the country’s schedule:“If relationships are measured by different schedules, this trivializes the relationship.” In November 2018, rumors ran wild that Bin Salman had snubbed Morocco. But a government source confirmed to Morocco World News that actually, Morocco had turned MBS down. The source told MWN that King Mohammed VI suggested that he would not receive MBS, but that Bin Salman could meet the King’s brother, Moulay Rachid. However, MBS rejected the King’s offer. Increasing rumors of diplomatic tension, Morocco decided not to participate in  the Red Wave naval exercise in Saudi Arabia from December 30 to January 4, 2019. Bourita said that Morocco had participated in Saudi Arabia’s campaign in Yemen, but then decided to “change our participation” after further evaluation, which resulted in Morocco’s absence from the military maneuvers and Arab meetings. He added that Morocco supports the Gulf’s plans and would be against anything that undermined the stability of the UAE and Saudi Arabia from Yemen. But Morocco expressed concerns over the humanitarian aspects of the Yemen war. He added that the Yemeni people do not deserve the suffering they are experiencing. The interview did not exclude the Moroccan-Iranian diplomatic crisis. Bourita recalled that Morocco cut ties with Iran in May 2018 because of Hezbollah’s collusion with Polisario. He added that Morocco provided evidence of the collusion, but Iran denied that Hezbollah trained and equipped the separatist group.  Bourita said that diplomatic ties between the two countries had not been good since 2009 when Rabat last cut ties with Iran after accusing it of spreading Shi’ism in Morocco. Morocco renewed ties with Iran in 2014, but their diplomatic bonds started to weaken after Morocco handed over Kacem Mohamed Tajeddine, one of Hezbollah’s top financiers, to the US.  According to Bourita, the Moroccan government has not received any explanation from Iran about Hezbollah-Polisario links. He said that Morocco opened negotiations with Iran many times, but “saw that Iran entered in issues that affect Morocco’s interests and security.” Bourita said, “there should be Arab coordination concerning Syria‘s return to the Arab League.” Egypt also supports the idea. In a press conference co-chaired with Bourita earlier this month in Cairo, Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry called on Syrian President Bashar Al Assad to return to the Arab League. “There’s a need to get out of the current crisis in Syria through the political framework sponsored by the UN envoy in Geneva,” said Shoukry. Syria was suspended from its membership in the Arab league after Assad’s crackdown on protesters during the early phase of its civil war in 2011.

Rabat – During an interview with Al Jazeera’s television program Bila Houdoud (Without Borders), Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said that both Moroccan and Algerian peoples have a sincere determination to break the stalemate. Tunisia has offered to mediate between Morocco and Algeria to solve their long-standing diplomatic disagreements. However, Bourita said that Morocco does not need a mediator to solve its issues with Algeria. In November 2018, King Mohammed VI offered Algeria a dialogue initiative to break the division and lack of cooperation between the countries of the Maghreb, especially the absent diplomatic bonds between Morocco and Algeria. Bourita said that Moroccan and Algerian peoples have an honest willingness to turn the page and re-establish diplomatic ties. Bourita also stated that Algeria’s request for a Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) Foreign Affairs Ministers Council was not an answer to Morocco’s dialogue offer. Bourita emphasized that the Maghreb region would be stronger if dual diplomatic ties between the Maghreb countries existed. Several countries supported Morocco’s dialogue offer.  Tunisian Minister of Foreign Affairs Khemaies Jhinaoui said in an interview with Tunisian news outlet Assabah News that his country is continuing “efforts with the leaders of neighboring [countries] Morocco and Algeria to turn the page of Arab and regional bilateral differences, including the Moroccan-Algerian conflict.” In his interview, Bourita explained that Morocco’s sovereignty over its southern provinces is not negotiable. He argued that the conflict should be solved within the auspices of the United Nations only, recalling that influential UNSC members welcomed Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, and described as a “credible” solution to the conflict. Bourita also asserted that the autonomy plan, which Morocco introduced to the UN in 2007, shows its commitment to the development of the region for the benefit of Sahrawis. When asked about the Moroccan Autonomy plan, Bourita said that the initiative seeks to integrate Sahrawis in development plans and to preserve the Moroccan Sahrawi heritage. Bourita also said that several powers like the US and France found the plan as a credible solution to solve the conflict over the region.  Bourita also spoke about the UN’s Geneva roundtable, which took place in December 2018. He said that the importance of the roundtable lay in the participation of all parties in the talks. He pointed out that Morocco went there to evaluate the other parties’ readiness to solve the issue and to reiterate Morocco’s principles: that Rabat will never accept a solution that excludes its sovereignty over the region. Bourita went on to add that the meeting took place in accordance with the last two resolutions of the UN Security Council, in particular Resolution 2440, which calls for a realistic, pragmatic, and sustainable solution based on consensus and urges all stakeholders to participate in the process.

Rabat – The foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in Morocco amounted to MAD 33.5 billion in 2018, a significant increase of 28.6 percent than the previous year, the Moroccan foreign exchange office said Wednesday. The office explained the figures by the increase in revenues (up by MAD 11.6 billion) over expenditures (up by MAD 4.1 billion), in a note on foreign trade through 2018. The 2018 Ernst &amp; Young Africa Attractiveness Survey showed Morocco and South Africa as the top FDI destinations in Africa. Morocco attracted 96 FDI projects in 2017, an increase from 81 projects in 2016. Morocco also jumped 9 places since 2017 and ranked 60th out of 190 countries in the 2019 World Bank’s “Doing Business” ranking. The North African country aims to be among the top 50 countries in the Doing Business rankings by 2021. Morocco’s trade deficit went up 8 percent from MAD 189.2 billionin 2017 to MAD 204.5 billion last year, according to the foreign exchange office.  The North African country’s imports rose by 9.3 percent, recording MAD 478.7 billion in 2018 compared to MAD 438.1 billion in 2017. The hike is mainly due to increases in the cost of energy imports (up MAD 12.8 billion) which made up 31 percent of the total of the import increase, explained the office. Exports rose to MAD 274.2 billion, up 10.2 percent from the previous year. The office explained the change by the rise in exports sales, including phosphates (up MAD 7.5 billion); the automotive sector (up MAD 6.3 billion); agricultural products (up MAD 3.7 billion); aeronautics (up MAD 1.7 billion); and the textile and leather sector (up MAD 1.6 billion). “The sectors account for nearly 81.7% of the total increase in exports.” Morocco’s central bank, Bank Al-Maghrib, said on Tuesday that Morocco’s foreign exchange reserves were down by 5.2 percent year on year amounting to MAD 229 billion as of January 9. Last year, remittances from Moroccans residing abroad amounted to MAD 64.8 billion, down by 1.7 percent from 2017. Meanwhile, tourism revenues increased by 1.4 percent to MAD 73.2 billion, the foreign exchange office noted. Tourism revenue and remittances from Moroccans residing abroad are the main sources of Morocco’s foreign currency reserves. Morocco registered a “tourism surplus” of MAD 54.3 billion in 2018, slightly down from MAD 54.8 billion a year earlier. The tourism surplus means that foreign tourists spent more money in Morocco than Moroccan tourists did in foreign countries. The office attributed the surplus to “an MAD 1.1 billion increase in revenues combined with an MAD 1.6 billion in expenditure.”

Rabat – Officials from the African Union (AU) and the European Union (EU) have reaffirmed their common desire to strengthen ties to face their shared challenges. Speaking on Tuesday, January 22, at the first AU-EU ministerial summit in Brussels, Frederica Mogherini, the high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy, said that Europe needs to bolster cooperation with Africa. “Africa and Europe are closer than ever in today’s complex world,” Mogherini at a press conference after the Brussels meeting. She added, “We all want a stronger and more prosperous Africa with more quality jobs for the youth, more inclusive societies, and peace and security for all.” The sentiment echoed trendy rhetoric in policy circles in the European Union. As EU member states have failed to reach an agreement on the proposed common migration policy that spells out the migrant quota burden for each country, individual states and EU officials have multiplied Euro-African-themed statements in recent months. The recurring rhetoric includes calls for greater cooperation between the two continents to face “common security and strategic challenges.” Further echoing that spirit, Mogherini explained that the realities of our “complex times” compel “tighter ties between continents and countries.” The EU, she elaborated, is poised to review her policies and priorities to facilitate institutional cooperation with the AU. “The EU wants Africa to prosper for the good of its own people, but also because a strong Africa is a good thing for Europe.” Mogherini’s suggestion that achieving socio-economic sustainability and job security will considerably discourage the flow of irregular migration to Europe has been a major point of order in policy circles. Some EU officials, Angela Merkel, even raised the idea of a prospective “Marshall Plan for Africa.” The hope is to engage with Africa on a more sincere and egalitarian basis, integrating trade and human dimensions in Euro-African relations. Meanwhile, while the EU seeks to revise its policy toward Africa, the body’s member states have been engaged in a war of words over migration. Most recently, Italy took jibes at France’s “colonial” presence in Africa for escalating Europe’s migration problems. “If we have people who are leaving Africa now it’s because some European countries, and France in particular, have never stopped colonizing Africa,” Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said.

Rabat – Croatian artist Dominik Zdenkovic chose Chefchaouen as the location for an as-yet-unrealized video game. Called “The Trials,” the cold war era spy game would be set in 1978.  According to Zdenkovic, Morocco was an important commercial station for the Russians at the time. The game’s storyline starts when Commander Geraldine Connaught orders Madeline Strong, a spy stationed in Morocco, to track Greg Andrews, a defected agent.

“I wanted a mysterious atmosphere. Having recently visited Morocco and Chefchaouen, I had no problem with the inspiration,” said Zdenkovic. “Older generations typically wear djellabas. I guess that in the 70’s, even more people would wear traditional clothing. someone undercover would like to blend in. This has allowed me to move away from traditional espionage clothing,” he added. A game designer with a background in architecture, Zdenkovic found an exceptional townscape in Chefchaouen. “Unexplored,” a campaign by Currys PC World, hired three game developers to re-imagine 10 “forgotten” cities as game venues, with ideas about the games that could take place there. While famous games like Grand Theft Auto were set in California, Unexplored seeks to bring far-flung locales like Ushuaia, Cape Town, Accra, to the spotlight.  The artists have already contributed to renowned works such as Black Panther, Call of Duty, and Assassin’s Creed.

Currys PC World is a brand of the Dixons Carphone Group, a UK-based electrical and telecommunications retailer and service provider.

Rabat – Morocco’s new high speed train stations owe their elegant decorations to a renowned Moroccan designer and interior architect, Hicham Lahlou. Hicham Lahlou, 45, the Moroccan designer born in Rabat whose signature is recognized throughout the African and Arab world, is at the top of his craft with two decades of experience in the design of cities, urban furniture, tableware, plastic art, commercial architecture, and graphic design. Lahlou, who studied at Paul Cezanne middle school and Lycee Descartes high school in Rabat, found a passion for drawing at a young age which later developed into a love for design.  He later moved to Paris to study at Academie Charpentier in Paris, from which he graduated as interior architect and designer. Five years later, he began to work with Airbus Industrie and Siemens, an industrial manufacturing company. After working with renowned architect Aziz Lazrak, Lahlou created his own architectural collection inspired by Moroccan heritage in 1999, marking the beginning of his career. Lahlou has now marked the four Moroccan bullet train stations of Tangier, Kenitra, Rabat-Agdal, and Casablanca Voyageurs with his signature.  Lahlou and his team planned and designed each of the stations’ interior space decor and furniture including waiting halls or lounges, counters, reading tables, coffee tables, reception desks, armchairs, and integrated screens. The signatures of other talented architects, Omar Kobite, Yassir Khalil, and Youssef Melehi, who worked with Lahlou also made a mark on all the stations except Rabat. Lahlou began working on the stations’ design in March 2016 
with a team of six architects. According to Lahlou, all of the furniture in the stations was made in Morocco. He said: “Most of the pieces in the stations were designed in local industrial workshops by local craftsmen.” Lahlou described the concept of the new station designs as one that is “not scenographic” butt “precedes the expectations of the different travelers who will frequent the [stations’] common spaces.” King Mohammed VI and French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the high speed train on November 15. The large-scale projects cost MAD 10.5 billion.  The new Kenitra train station cost approximately MAD 400 million.  The Casa-Voyageurs train station cost MAD 450 million, and renovation at Tangier-Ville cost MAD 360 million. All the new stations have state-of-the-art technology that meets international standards in terms of safety, comfort, security, and quality of services. Lahlou has represented Morocco and Africa with several masterpieces and design exhibitions abroad, chaired many competitions, and received prestigious awards. One of his noteworthy awards from two years ago was the distinction of Chevalier from the Order of Arts and Letters in France for his contributions to the field of design. Lahlou’s contemporary masterpieces find spaces in international museums such as the Vitra Design Museum in Germany, the Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain, and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London. Lahlou has also worked on big projects for prestigious international brands, such as French interior design DAUM, French Ecart International for furniture design, and Belgian Aquamass Design.

By Amal El Attaq The cigarettes Switzerland makes and sells to Morocco are much stronger, more addictive and more toxic than those sold in Switzerland or France, due to the high proportion of nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide. The organization Public Eye recently published the results of an exclusive investigation which found that “in 2017, 2,900 tonnes of Swiss cigarettes were exported to Morocco, the equivalent of some 3.625 billion ‘ciggies.’” According to the investigation, Switzerland produced approximately 34.6 billion cigarettes, or 2 billion packs, of which only 25 percent were sold on the domestic market in 2016. The Swiss journalists, Marie Maurisse and Gie Goris, who led the investigation analyzed samples of Swiss cigarettes in Morocco and in Europe at the Lausanne Health Institute, a laboratory affiliated with the World Health Organization. The analysis revealed a double standard and found that “Moroccans smoke cigarettes that are more harmful than those smoked by Europeans. For each substance tested, nearly all cigarettes produced in Switzerland and consumed in Morocco contained levels higher than that found in Swiss and French cigarettes.” The researchers reported that Winston cigarettes in Morocco contain “over 16.31 milligrams of full particles per cigarette,” 5.81 more full particles than Winston Classics in Lausanne. For nicotine, the researchers found that “‘Swiss-made” Camels sold in Morocco contained more than 170 percent (1.28 milligrams per cigarette) the nicotine in Camel Filters sold in Switzerland (0.75 milligrams per cigarette). The investigation also reported, shockingly, that “in some cases, the content levels recorded by the Swiss scientists are higher than those stated by the brands on their packaging,” especially for nicotine content. “Winstons contain nearly 1.5 milligrams of nicotine, while the level stated on the packet is 1 milligram.” Japan Tobacco International, which manufactures Winstons and Camels, related that the results are imprecise and that “all tobacco-related products involve health risks.” The company added, “No one can say that one cigarette is less toxic than another in terms of taste.” The investigators reported that the manufacturer would not answer why Moroccan cigarettes contain more particles and nicotine than others. According to “The Tobacco Atlas,” a report by the American Cancer Society, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and the Union for International Cancer Control, more than 17,600 Moroccans die every year because of “tobacco-caused disease.” The Moroccan Ministry of Health has previously stated that 13 percent of Moroccan smokers are under 15 years old, and the proportion of women who smoke is about the same as men.

Rabat – Spain deported Polisario separatist Hussein Bachir Brahim to Morocco on January 17 after rejecting his asylum request. Morocco had issued an arrest warrant for the pro-Polisario separatist for his alleged involvement in the killing of Amazigh (Berber) activist Omar El Khalek, who was beaten to death by pro-Polisario students in January 2016. The Polisario Front condemned the deportation of the separatist to Morocco, claiming that it violates international asylum laws. Spanish news outlets reported Polisario’s condemnation, acknowledging that the separatist fled Moroccan prosecution. EFE spoke with Hamdi Mansor, a Polisario delegate in the Canary Islands, who said that Brahim was a law student at Ibn Zohr University in Agadir. Mansor said that Spanish police transferred the suspect “without complying with the compulsory procedure to present it before the judicial authorities or process his request for political asylum.” The Polisario delegate said that the move is “absolutely opposed to what is established by Spanish norms and international agreements signed by Spain for the protection and asylum of people persecuted for political reasons.” However, suspects with an arrest warrant are traditionally subject to deportation across the globe. After Spain deported Brahim last week to Nador in northeast Morocco, Morocco transferred the suspect to Loudaya prison in Marrakech. He then appeared before the public prosecutor in Marrakech.  In 2017, the Marrakech Criminal Court sentenced five suspects to 10 years in prison and 11 others to three years each for the premeditated murder of the Amazigh activists. Three of the accused received additional charges for carrying weapons without legitimate justification and attacking the property of others. The clashes, which erupted between Sahrawi and Amazigh students at the Faculty of Literature and Human Sciences in 2016 injured five other people. Khalek, also known as “Izem” meaning lion in Tamazight (Berber), was attacked by pro-Polisario students who were armed with knives. Khalek was a native of a village near  Tinghir, southeastern Morocco. The activist died five days after suffering serious injuries.

Rabat – During the World Education Forum in London on January 21, Moroccan Minister of Education Said Amzazi and British Minister of State for the Middle East Alistair Burt discussed the training of Moroccan teachers in the English language. Amzazi and Burt discussed how to train Moroccan teachers in the English language, especially teachers of scientific disciplines such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry, Amzazi told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The director of the British Council in Morocco, John Mitchell, and Moroccan Secretary of State for Vocational Training Mohamed Rherras both attended the meeting. Mitchell, according to MAP, confirmed that the British Council will soon start a language training project to teach English to science teachers who teach in Arabic. Mitchell expects Morocco will adopt a new law on teaching scientific subjects in foreign languages. Amzazi told MAP that three projects will take place in the near future as part of the education cooperation between Morocco and the UK. The first project will establish an English language training program for 20,000 teachers of non-linguistic subjects. The second project will increase the teaching of English in Morocco, especially after the opening of the first British school in Marrakech, scheduled for September this year. For the third project, Amzazi said, presidents of Moroccan universities will visit the UK to update “conventions signed by their predecessors” with British universities. Commenting on Morocco’s presence in the three-day forum, Amzazi said it is “very important for the [education] sector” because it gives ministers the opportunity to debate education. The forum, which is the world’s largest gathering of education and skills ministers, will “help place the Moroccan national system at the heart of major international reform projects,” he added. The Education World Forum took place January 20-23, 2019, under the theme, “What we should do with what we know: Developing education policy for implementation, impact and exponential success.” The forum brought together 1,263 international delegates from 95 countries to discuss education policy and challenges. English important in London, not in Rabat While Amzazi ruled out the possibility that English may soon replace French in schools while speaking in Rabat, he said in London that “the Moroccan school aims to open up to the English model to diversify the national supply in education.” “Everyone knows that science books are currently available in English more than French, and in French more than Arabic. But we teach in the French language,” Amzazi said during a press conference last week in Rabat. “French will remain the second language (after Arabic) in Moroccan public schools, at least throughout the next ten years.” The minister explained in an interview with MAP in London that opening up to English is not a shift away from French but a new orientation of the Moroccan education system “to offer the graduates of Moroccan universities the opportunity to continue their studies in British schools.” Minister Burt had the same view, stressing the need to offer Moroccan students the opportunity to study in the UK and encourage academic exchanges between the two countries. English in Morocco still deficient Apart from the debate on English status in Morocco, the North African country’s English proficiency is considered “very low” despite growing interest that Moroccan youth have shown in English rather than French. Education First’s 2018 English Proficiency Index (EF EPI) ranked Morocco 60th out of 88 countries with a score of 48.10. In a recent interview with Morocco World News, the former head of the English Department at Mohammed V University of Literature and Human Sciences in Rabat, Hassan Belhiah, said he believes that the new students enrolled in English studies “are not as qualified compared to previous cohorts.” “Although most of them seem to speak English fluently and to be digitally literate, they have severe deficiencies in academic skills, especially in reading, writing, analyzing, and synthesizing,” Belhiah explained last week. For Mohamed Bakkas, an English language teaching supervisor at the Ministry of Education, the low proficiency level of English in Morocco is due to lack of listening activities. “The Moroccan educational system is exam-oriented. Since listening is not included in the national exam, it’s not given much importance in the teaching of English,” Bakkas told MWN in November last year. If compared to French, the English language does not receive assiduous attention from the Moroccan government. Unlike Arabic and French, English is not used in Moroccan government media, especially on television and radio. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the state-owned news agency, occasionally publishes some news in English online. The inattention lowers the status of English in Morocco, even though the language is deemed the language of globalization and international communication.

Rabat – Though Morocco has talented artists capable of propelling the country in the highest firmament of global art industries, the North African country’s cultural policies are still wanting in many regards.  “On Moroccan national television, we now watch American movies and Turkish TV series,” the prize-winning Moroccan painter and designer Houda Gueddari recently told Morocco World News at the Fez International Artists Gathering. “Morocco has no policy to promote its own artists. We turn on the TV and there is nothing to stimulate children’s intelligence or make the ordinary Moroccan a more cultured, educated, and informed citizen. Morocco’s political sphere is the first culprit.”  When asked why a country with Morocco’s rich artistic history and cultural heritage still finds it difficult, if not impossible, to claim a front seat in global art industries, Gueddari was anything but political. Like other artists from developing countries and art critics, the Moroccan artist could have pointed an accusatory finger at the irresistible lure of America’s, or in general the West’s, dominant grip on global “cultural industry.”  Media and art juggernauts, it has often been argued, fuel an asymmetric global contest that sustains the West’s socio-cultural hegemony. As a result, countries like Morocco—and most of the developing world, for that matter—find their arts and ways of expressing their unique identities subsumed by an industry that thrives on uniformity.  But Gueddari chooses to aim her wrath at domestic political dynamics, continuously lambasting Moroccan politicians for their “lack of vision” in promoting and selling Moroccan art. As far as she is concerned, this critique of Western cultural hegemony, however accurate, does not help to explain the dearth of cultural capital in the Moroccan public sphere. What, then, can we point out as the reason? Is it only domestic politics? “Yes, obviously,” she replied, chuckling. But she hastened to add a bit of nuance: “I am aware that there are other things at play, such as families, schools, or the outside world. But in Morocco, everything passes through the government. Politicians are the ones with the power to change the course of things.” Even if, at first sight, there is something substantively political about Moroccan art lagging behind in a global market, there is nothing fundamentally political about Gueddari’s “ways of seeing” and thinking about art. True, Gueddari’s rhetoric is punctuated with moments of lamentation about Moroccan politics, but hers is fundamentally a devotion to the beauty and social significance of art, both for herself and Fez, the city where she was born and raised. In addition to supportive government policies, “Good art requires focus and dedication [from the artist],” she explained. Of her activities in Fez, Gueddari said she now deploys the bulk of her artistic talents to ensure continuity and to “tap into the artistic sensibility of people who otherwise would not be interested in art.” Asking “What can we do?” is to her far more effective and urgent than saying, for example, “Can we do it?” For her, art is about carving up universes of possibilities, imaginaries that enable and inspire social change. “We [artists] are constantly dreaming,” she says.  “Art made me who I am,” Gueddari told her audience on January 19 at the fourth International Artists Gathering of Fez. Art, she went on to argue, is about creating or expressing individualities engrained in the wider social context. While artists should not replace politicians, whose “job is to devise solutions to come to terms with social issues,” she suggests that art should create works that address society’s pressing concerns. But art, as Gueddari sees it, is also about creating “art spaces,” places of “freedom, innovation, and inventivity,” as put by cultural theorist Lotte Arndt, one of Gueddari’s co-panelists at the Fez Gathering. Spaces, that is, where art can be felt, lived, and expressed. On that front, too, Gueddari leads by example.  Armed with her growing arsenal of international prizes, Gueddari has opened Fez’s first contemporary art gallery. The gallery is her way of “giving back” to her city. In addition to organizing cultural events such as painting and design workshops, the gallery seeks, according to its official website, “to promote artists of all kinds.”  While international prizes helped her public visibility, and her name has gained traction in the global cultural market, Gueddari’s artistic outlook has not really altered. She has remained the down-to-earth self-taught artist she was before success elevated her to unforeseen heights. “When I paint, I do not try to impress or seduce. Instead, I always seek to reflect my soul and the souls of all the women who inspire me,” she said in an interview with 2M, Morocco’s national television channel.  That was in late 2017, and one of her paintings, “La femme au Chapeau” (The Woman with a Hat), had just been nominated for the Dubai-held prestigious Global Art Awards.  At the prize ceremony in late November of the same year, she was voted among the 10 finalists. That recognition after her first ever attempt at an international contest helped the Moroccan artist stand out from the thousands of contenders from the four corners of the world who annually covet what she describes as “one the most highly regarded art accolades.” Although Gueddari did not win in Dubai, the nomination was enough to kick-start her international career. “The Woman with a Hat” sealed the Fez-born painter’s spot among the world’s most revered painters. While 2017 marked her thunderous entrance into the coveted but very restricted universe of world-famous painters, it was 2018 that really came with a special torrent of accolades.  Between January and April last year, Gueddari’s life became a festival of recognition. On January 20 in Florence, she won the illustrious Leonardo da Vinci Prize International Art Award, arguably the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for painting.  That quintessential coronation as a trend-setting painter was followed by the Venice Biennale in March 2018 and the Fez Gate Prize in the Culture and Woman of the Year categories later in the same year.  Gueddari’s greatest achievement to date, however, is being listed in a booklet last year alongside the most inspiring and original painters of contemporary life. “To see my name alongside luminaries like Picasso and Salvador Dali was so humbling and gratifying,” said an effusive Gueddari at the Fez Artists Gathering. For someone who focused on hard sciences in high school, graduated from university as a dentist, and did not take up painting as a professional endeavor until 2001, Gueddari’s recent deluge of success is not only “totally unexpected,” as she conceded, it is also dizzying. But as fame sinks in, the Moroccan artist strives to stay loyal to her calling: Doing painting that “speaks to the Moroccan experience.” It would be simplistic and unfair to boil Gueddari’s painting down to a particular topic, but it is also accurate to point out that women—or their daily experiences—occupy a prominent spot in her work. In these times of deep political anxiety about gender roles and societal expectations, Gueddari sets out to confront and reassess a number of social codes. As News New York put it  in a short but densely lyrical piece, Gueddari’s work is saturated with bodies of “flourishing and thriving modern women.” Her paintings “[shout] the unspoken, the thirst, the pain, the anger to live freely,” the article added. While that assessment is right, it is, like the lyricism that underpins it, a bit exaggerated. Far from being the paragon of the feisty feminist that many have come to expect from the MENA region’s “educated women,” Gueddari’s politics is more in tune with Saba Mahmood’s pious women’s movements in Cairo, Egypt.  Neither too conciliatory nor too provocative, Gueddari questions, challenges, and deconstructs Moroccan society’s emotions and certainties in her own way. Like herself, her paintings celebrate modernity without denying their underlying, perhaps authentic, “Moroccanness.” Gueddari’s politics, then, is about latent subversiveness.  Though she complains about Moroccan politicians for “stifling the country’s cultural debate” and condoning “dumb TV programs that harm Moroccan children’s creativity and intelligence,” Gueddari charges Moroccan artists with far greater responsibility. As they face ineffective and unsupportive government policies, Moroccan artists should take up the role of promoting their own art.  “Moroccan artists should not think fame and money first. That should be their last concern.  Instead, they need to go out there, participate in cultural events without charging fees. They should go to people and try to establish themselves a base of people who know their art and capability. Everything else should come after that.” Here again, Gueddari is not being a Pharisee; she lives by what she preaches. “When I established my art gallery, it was with the conviction that I would not make any profits in the first five years.”

Rabat – Islamophobia is present in all parts of the world. International news outlets reported on Wednesday that four individuals were planning to bomb a Muslim community in the town of Islamberg, 240 kilometers northwest of New York city. Authorities identified the suspects as Brian Colaneri, Andrew Crysel, Vincent Vetromile, and an unnamed 16-year-old. The first three suspects are aged between 18 and 20. All three adults face conspiracy charges, reported Al Jazeera. The suspects were in possession of  23 rifles and shotguns in addition to home-made explosives. Police opened an investigation after a student made a suspicious comment at school last Friday, according to Greece Police Chief Patrick Phelan. Phelan said that the 16-year-old showed students a picture of another boy on his phone and said: “He looks like the next school shooter, doesn’t he?”  Phelan said that another student who heard the comment reported the 16-year-old. School security services and police summoned students for statements. Then the student told police about the individual’s plot to attack an Islamic community in Delaware county, New York. Quoted by ABC, Phelan said that the bombs were made of black powder, nails, and BB pellets. The 16-year-old has a criminal history and has spent time in a penitentiary. According to a CNN index, there have been over 280 school shootings in the US since 2009. The issue led to an activism movement called  “March For Our Lives,” calling for stricter gun control in the US. The march followed a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that resulted in 17 students’ deaths.

By Zakaria ouadghiri Rabat – A large number of Moroccans, estimated at more than four million, have moved from rural to urban areas since the 1950s. As a result, urban Morocco has struggled with housing and sanitation.  Generally, the quality of market housing rises worldwide as production increases. New homes and flats are larger, use better building materials, and embrace technology. But existing housing is not always able to keep up with the trend. Like people everywhere in the world, Moroccans are demanding better housing. Many developers complain that housing units are completed but unsold. Perhaps those developers built too far from town; failed to build near roads, water, drainage, and power systems; or misjudged how much people could actually afford to pay.  Mounia Tagma, manager of Middle East and Africa projects at the Affordable Housing Institute (AHI), told Morocco World News that she thinks Moroccans know how to design and build and must do better.  Real estate developers must adapt, and the government must support the shift with better urban planning, better infrastructure, and more public transportation services. Tagma first joined the Affordable Housing Institute in 2009 interested in slum rehabilitation and financing. Although she has faced challenges as a Moroccan professional woman, Tagma told MWN that she draws inspiration from other women: “I am inspired by women in my family, by public figures, and women who are colleagues or friends.”  She continued, “he main obstacle is the widespread perception, often subconscious, and even amongst some women, that men actually do a better job. The only way to fight this perception is to prove your capabilities.” According to the Center for Affordable Housing Finance in Africa, the real estate and construction sectors are currently seeing a slowdown but demand for affordable housing is still high, particularly among the low- and middle-income population. This demand, combined with government initiatives and incentives, could continue to provide opportunities for investors. In 1995, the government began a low-cost housing program to tackle substandard housing around major cities, particularly Casablanca and Rabat. Of all urban households, about 43 percent are rented, 41 percent are owner-occupied and 12 percent are occupied rent-free by non-owners.  In 2001, a reported 320,000 households were living in shantytowns. In 2003, the perpetrators of the Casablanca bombing attacks were identified as residents of the city’s slums. Since then, the Moroccan government has doubled down on efforts to eliminate substandard housing, which until then had helped to fill the country’s housing deficit. In 2017, the government pledged to build 800,000 affordable housing units over five years to meet the growing housing demand. According to Mounia Tagma, Morocco succeeded in reducing the housing gap from 1.2 million units in 2002 to 400,000 units in 2018.  However, new housing projects have encountered problems of corruption and other “dysfunctions.” In January 2018, King Mohammed VI appointed four ministers after sacking several high profile officials due to dysfunctions in Al Hoceima development projects since 2015.  Even when most housing is built by the private market, and even when some of that housing is informal, government decisions influence where it is built, how much it costs, how close it is to transportation and public amenities, and its quality.  Most developed nations use both supply-side subsidies, such as waivers or exemption from VAT, and demand-side measures. The US and the UK give rent subsidies to top up what low-income people can afford to pay for rent. According to Tagma, the Moroccan government uses price caps for affordable housing, making it illegal for developers to sell affordable housing units for more than MAD 250,000, excluding VAT.  Beyond the price caps, Morocco also uses a broader range of policy tools, from allocating public land for housing projects to giving tax exemptions to developers who build affordable housing and making credit guarantees for housing loans to people with low to moderate incomes. Like any other product in the marketplace, housing costs respond to the laws of supply and demand. For some time, the production of housing in Morocco was limited by the capacity of private sector developers to keep up with growing demand while operating within legal parameters.  
Now that Morocco has a powerful real estate industry, the supply of affordable homes depends on access to land that is zoned for residential development. It also depends on having the appropriate infrastructure for housing development.  Although Morocco has reduced the housing gap, now the challenge is quality. The market also provides housing that is densely-packed and remote during housing shortages. This less-desirable housing is in demand by renters and buyers because of housing shortages. The housing may be affordable, but it may do damage to children, families, and ultimately, social cohesion.  To provide affordable housing, Moroccans must think beyond the housing unit. Quality housing also means accessibility to transportation and services.  Housing is crucial to the development of any society A common expression in the housing industry is that “housing is where jobs go to sleep at night.”  If people are not housed decently, they cannot be as productive at work. If home is too remote from work, people are spending considerable time and money on their commute at the expense of something else: Both financially and in time spent with family.  In Morocco, the right to decent housing is stated in the 2011 Constitution. Even before that, housing was a national priority.  In 2004, Morocco launched Cities without Slums (“Villes sans bidonvilles”), a project that aimed to eliminate slums in cities by 2010. The program eliminated slums in 59 cities and gave more than 277,000 households decent housing. The challenge of affordable housing persisted, however, partly because the project focused on slums as physical structures, not as visible symptoms of more complicated social challenges.  
According to Tagma, work starts with the government, because no country has ever produced enough affordable housing purely through market mechanisms. Government shapes the enabling environment and it is the only party that can enact laws that can significantly improve housing ecosystems.  The government also has the legitimacy and authority to change legal frameworks and enforce regulations on housing quality and the rights of homeowners or renters. The government also acts as a natural market regulator. Tagma, who has worked for Al Omrane, the Moroccan government’s main housing and urban development agency, believes it is the government’s responsibility to improve the ecosystem so that investment in affordable housing becomes attractive to market players. No government in the world has ever produced all the affordable housing its population needs without a strong working partnership with the private sector, however, she says.  Over the years, many of these private players have developed expertise and a moral commitment to quality affordable housing as a product that does not just make money, it also makes a public good.

Rabat – King Mohammed inaugurated Wednesday the second line of Casablanca Tramway (T2). The T2 line is connected with three T1 transit stations: Abdelmoumen- Anoual, Ibn Tachfine- Mdakra, and Ali Yaata- Carrieres Centrales stations. The new line reaches nine districts in the city, that have a total population of one million. It has 33 stop stations, including 20 new stations. It crosses over 15 kilometres through Sidi Bernoussi, Ain Sbaa, Hay Mohammadi, Derb Sultan, El Fida and Anoual, in addition to the tramway point linking Darb Ghellaf, Beausejour, Casa Finance City, Hay Hassani and Ain Diab. The T2 will consist of 16 coupled carts with a length reaching 64 meters.  The line will ultimately consist of 25 carts and start to gradually shorten travel time from 9 minutes to 6 minutes between stations when the traffic is at its heaviest, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). King Mohammed VI launched the construction works for Casablanca T2 On January 2016.  The project cost MAD 3.7 billion as it also covered rail and infrastructure works maintenance, and a center in Sidi Bernousi district for the storing and repairing of technical equipment. Casablanca tramway network also completed a 2-kilometer rail extension project on the T1, which can now reach all of Laymoun, Florida and Lissasfa neighbourhoods. The extension budget cost MAD 504 million. The Casablanca tramway network also plans to complete T3 and T4 tram lines and two “high-level” bus lines by 2022 to reduce traffic congestion in the country’s economic capital. The new projects will cost MAD 16 billion, said MAP. The T3 line will link the Salmia neighborhood to the Casa-Port area, which are 14 kilometres apart, whereas the T4 line will connect the Attacharouk neighborhood to Mers Sultan, 12 kilometers apart. The T3 and T4 lines will serve more than 700.000 people. On the other hand, the two new bus lines (L1 and L2) will also have stops near the tramway stations. While L1 will connect the Salmia neighborhood to Lissasfa and make it to 20 stop stations, L2 will link Madinat Arrhma to Casablanca, with Ghandi Boulevard zone as their connecting point.

By Carolina McCabe Rabat – In the House of Councilors on Tuesday, the Moroccan Workers’ Union (UMT) raised concerns that fuel prices are rising due to lobbying, speculation, and monopolies. Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi responded that price fluctuations are a result of price freedom and competition.  El Khalfi stated that the government is actively working to increase the purchasing power of Moroccan citizens in various ways. He cited the expansion of the Tayssir program for school enrollment aid, an increase in benefits for widows, vocational training and university scholarships, and aid for poor women.  El Khalfi attributed speculation as a prominent reason for weakened purchasing power of Moroccan citizens. He also stated that the government has been working to prevent speculation to protect consumers. Despite a drop in oil prices in the international market during the final months of 2018, many fuel companies in Morocco did not lower prices according to Moroccans’ expectations. In December, the minister of general affairs and governance, Lahcen Daoudi, called for a cap on fuel prices. The Competition Council is examining a potential fuel price cap and will deliver its opinion on February 14. The proposed price cap would last for a 6 month period. Article 1 of Law 104-12 stipulates, “The prices of goods, products and services are determined by free competition.” However, the government has the power to regulate prices in certain circumstances. Daoudi proposed the temporary price cap because of the significant influence of fuel prices on other market goods and services. Following global trends, fuel prices fluctuated throughout 2018, and high prices angered Moroccan citizens into boycotting a major gas company. The boycott blamed companies for manipulating Morocco’s markets with rising commodity prices.

Rabat – The Polisario Front is attempting to hamper the process of the EU-Morocco agreements. After resorting to the UN Security Council, the Polisario Front is threatening to appeal against the European Parliament’s decision to adopt the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement. The separatist group’s news agency reported on January 21 that the “battle for the preservation of the Sahrawi natural resources will be a decisive factor of pressure” on Morocco. Polisario had already contested the fisheries and agriculture agreement after describing the adoption of the agriculture deal as “illegal.” The Polisario Front also claimed that the EU Parliament has violated EU Court of Justice’s ruling, which decided in February 2018 that the fisheries deal between the EU and Morocco would only be valid if it did not include Western Sahara and its waters. The court also ruled on December 21, 2016, that the previous agreement between EU and Morocco, signed in 2012, on the mutual liberalization of the trade of agricultural and fishing products did not apply to the territory of Western Sahara. Morocco, however, made its position clear that it would not sign an agreement if it excluded its southern provinces from the deals. The Moroccan government says it will not  compromise its sovereignty over the region. The EU adopted the agriculture agreement on January 16, deeming the European court not to have authority over trade agreements. After the adoption of the agriculture deal, the European Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries also adopted the fisheries agreement between Morocco and the EU today. The agreement received 17 votes in favor of the fisheries deal while 7 voted against. Polisario has long claimed that Morocco is “exploiting” natural resources in the regions. Local Sahrawis, however, petitioned against Polisario’s allegations, emphasizing the benefits of the agreement on the development of the region. “The southern provinces are now ranked above the national average for human development indicators,” they wrote in the petition. Morocco’s Minister of Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch said that the deals create 66,000 job opportunities in the southern provinces under the Moroccan Green Plan and the Halieutis plan. In a statement to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), former Ambassador of Morocco to the EU Ahmed Reda Chami said that the vote of the committee “is a logical continuation of recent positive developments in the Morocco-EU partnership.” The former EU official made his remarks today in Brussels.

Rabat – During a four-day official visit, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov will fly to Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia January 23-26. According to Lavrov’s spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, the Russian minister will hold “meetings with representatives of the countries’ top leadership as well as talks with the foreign ministers.” The officials will discuss bilateral relations and share opinions “on key issues of the regional and international situation,” Russian news agency Tass quoted Zakharova as saying on Wednesday. The three Maghreb countries “pursue an active foreign policy, make a substantial contribution to multilateral efforts towards finding the answers to new challenges and threats, including global ones,” Zakharova explained. The spokeswoman noted that Russia has interests in increasing cooperation with the three Maghreb countries. Through the talks, Russia will also focus on coordinating “on the settlement of the problems existing in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as the Sahara-Sahel region,” she added. Morocco and Russia enjoy good relations which go back to the late 1950s. The last meeting between Lavrov and Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita took place in September last year at the 73rd United Nations General Assembly. Trade between the two countries has increased in recent years. The volume of trade increased from approximately $200 million in 2001 to $2.5 billion in 2015. However, in the first seven months of 2018, total trade between Morocco and Russia was down to $900 million. In early October 2018, Russian and Moroccan officials met to discuss business cooperation, especially increasing Morocco’s export of agricultural products. Moroccan Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch said that agricultural products represent 77 percent of Moroccan exports to Russia, estimated at MAD 1.5 billion. Russian Minister of Agriculture Dmitry Patrushev stated that the volume of bilateral trade in agricultural products and food has increased. “Since the beginning of this year, it has amounted to more than $300 million,” Patrushev said. He asserted the figure was a 16 percent increase from the previous year. He also predicted, “The agricultural trade between Russia and Morocco will grow to $500 million.” In October last year, Russian companies Gazprom, Novatek, and Stroytransgaz examined  their options to invest in natural gas projects in Morocco, Patrushev told Russian news agency Sputnik on October 4.

Rabat – The Spanish civil guard have arrested a Moroccan for “internet dissemination of terrorist propaganda” and “self-indoctrination on social media.” Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that Spain arrested the suspect on Tuesday in Getafe, just outside Madrid. Spanish police started investigating the 28-year-old suspect in early 2018.  Security services became alerted to the suspect because of his activities on social media. He had been watching content associated with terror groups, especially ISIS. The suspect was also using several devices to surf the internet. None of the devices were registered under his name. The suspect was using the identities of people around him to obtain the devices. The suspect was radicalized while in prison near Madrid. Spain has strong counterterrorism cooperation with Morocco, and both countries exchange information in the field. In 2018, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said that the two countries have an “exemplary” partnership in the fight against terrorism. He added that their cooperation is “a model of inter-regional cooperation.” In addition to Spain, the US and France also have counterterrorism partnerships with Morocco.

By Carolina McCabe Rabat – The High Commission for Planning (HCP) has released economic data on Morocco’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) and underlying rate of inflation from the final period of 2018. The CPI in December of 2018 was down 0.7 percent from November 2018. Overall, the average annual CPI increased by 1.9 percent in 2018.  CPI, which measures changes in the cost of products and demonstrates the cost of living, is also an indicator of inflation. Over 2018, the food product index rose by 1.3 percent and the non-food product index rose by 1.8 percent. The annual underlying rate of inflation was 0.7 percent over 2018. The underlying rate of inflation measures the inflationary pressures in the economy that are predominantly caused by market forces. The measurement also excludes the prices of volatile products. The 0.7 percent decline in CPI in December came about as a result of a 1.2 percent fall in the food index and a 0.4 percent drop in the non-food index. From November to December of 2018, fruit prices fell by 7.5 percent, seafood by 3.8 percent, oils and fats by 2 percent, and vegetables by 1.7 percent. However, prices of meat increased by 0.3 percent and milk, cheese, and eggs increased by 0.2 percent.  Among non-food products, fuel prices fell significantly, by 8.7 percent, following global trends. The regions with the greatest increases in annual CPI were Dakhla, at 3.0 percent, Laayoune and Safi at 2.7 percent, and Fez and Guelmim at 2.2 percent. The smallest increases were in Settat at 0.6 percent, Beni-Mellal at 1.1 percent, and Rabat at 1.2 percent.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has offered former Moroccan Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane an “exceptional pension” after the former secretary general of the ruling Islamist party, the Justice and Development Party (PJD), experienced financial problems. Benkirane spoke about the pension after he received criticism on social media for receiving an estimated MAD 70,000 monthly under instructions from King Mohammed VI. In an address before his party’s youth in Rabat on Monday, Benkirane said that King Mohammed VI’s senior adviser Fouad Ali El Hamma informed him of the pension, which he started to receive this year. He acknowledged that the King offered him the pension when the King heard the former prime minister had financial problems. “Where is the problem?” Benkirane asked. During the meeting, the former official said that all four of his bank accounts were nearly empty, and he had only MAD 10,000 before the King intervened. “I had MAD 10,000, and I asked my wife to be patient with me until I find a solution, and I did not want to ask for an extraordinary pension, because I have a dignity that I want to preserve.” He said that PJDi ministers helped him to get through his financial crisis. After his dismissal from the government, the prime minister was also looking for a job. He said that some relatives offered him work, but he could not accept it. Benkirane also denied that his car belongs to the state, saying it was a gift from King Mohammed VI. He added that he does not have a “villa nor an apartment.” He explained that he lives in a home that belongs to his wider family. King Mohammed VI dismissed Benkirane in March 2017 after he failed to form a government coalition.

By Amal El Attaq Rabat – The Spanish Service for the Internationalization of Education (SEPIE) announced that it will launch a program, similar to Erasmus, to support Moroccan university students. Moroccan students can go to Spain to pursue postgraduate studies and then return home with academic experience abroad under their belts. In exchange, Morocco has agreed to increase border control by managing the migratory flow towards Europe via Morocco.  Lately, Morocco, not satisfying with the existing EU-Morocco cooperation on migration, requested more compensation from Spain and the European Union in exchange for efforts to control the border, according to Spanish outlet El Pais. Morocco’s list of demands included an Erasmus-like program for Moroccan students. As a result, the project “will also provide training in key sectors of the Moroccan economy such as tourism and health,” EFE reported. “Eighty Moroccan students will benefit from this program, and study their master’s degrees at Spanish universities within two years maximum,” said the director SEPIE, Coral Martinez Iscar, in an interview with EFE. “Financed by the European Funds, the budget dedicated to this project is 2.5 million euros, the goal of this project is not only to cultivate Moroccan university students but to implement projects that will develop economic growth of their country, which is a key partner for Spain,” explained the director. The director also said that “Moroccans are one of the most important non-European inhabitants living in Spain after Latin Americans.” Spain has about 100,000 international students, and 8 percent of its university population is foreign, according to SEPIE statistics reported by EFE. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Moroccans were among 21 percent of the total migrants that arrived irregularly in Spain last year.

Rabat – Police found the body of Ikhlas, 3, in a forested mountain area, not far from her home in the Azlaf commune in Driouch Province in northern Morocco. The story of Ikhlas’ disappearance two weeks ago prompted many Moroccans to share photos and information about her on social media in hopes of finding and returning her to her family. On Tuesday, police and locals found Ikhlas’s body. Authorities have not yet reported details about the child’s death and whether there is suspicion of foul play.  To determine the circumstances of her death, authorities transferred Ikhlas’s body to a local hospital for an autopsy. In recent months, several girls aged five and below have been reported missing. Some were abducted but eventually found and returned safely to their families. In October, the story of a missing 5-year-old girl made headlines.  The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) reported that the kidnapper took the girl from a market in Al-Wifaq in the Hay Al Hassani area of Casablanca and locked her up for days. Another 5-year-old girl, named Khadija, was found after she went missing from a souk in Casablanca in September. Moroccans on social media shared pictures of her to help find her. In May, a 4-year-old named Ghazal from Riad El Oualfa, Diour Nasrani, Casablanca, went missing for 11 days. She was found on May 24. According to witnesses, her parents received a call from a couple in Casablanca who said that they had seen the girl and kept her with them without notifying the police.

Rabat – Israel is seeking $250 billion from Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Yemen, and Iran, for Jewish people who emigrated and left their property in the Muslim countries after the establishment of the Israeli state in 1948. Several Moroccan intellectuals and activists reportedly started a petition to condemn the financial compensation request and Israel’s speculation of “inaccurate historical facts.” Speaking with Morocco World News, Moroccan-French activist Jacob Cohen criticized Israel’s request, describing it as “cynical.” Cohen said that it was the Israeli intelligence service, known as the Mossad, that sent Jewish Moroccans to Israel. The Mossad established a secret network in Morocco in 1956 to smuggle Jews to Israel. Jews began to emigrate secretly after Morocco joined the Arab League in 1959, imposing a ban on the immigration of Jews to Israel.  Cohen mentioned King Mohammed VI’s Jewish advisor, Andre Azoulay, and his promoting of peace and coexistence between Jews and Muslims,  ”While Andre Azoulay, speaks of coexistence, Israel cynically claims billions for its ‘Jewish refugees from Arab countries’ to make them look similar to Palestinian refugees,” Cohen continued. Born in Meknes as a Moroccan Jew in 1944, Cohen is known for his criticism of Zionism. During an interview in 2016, Cohen stated that the Mossad is still “very active” in Morocco. He said: “There is something that is happening at the moment, which is not very known, but it’s starting … the Mossad is actively operating in Amazigh regions.” Earlier in January, at a lecture under the theme “The Holocaust … and the Zionist Agenda” Cohen spoke of the the “evil genius of Zionist” agenda that seeks to “victimize” Jews and show that no one suffered more than them. He referred to the Holocaust as a “new religion” brought up by Zionists to justify the occupation of Palestine. About 250,000 to 350,000 Jewish people lived in Morocco before the establishment of Israel, making it the largest Jewish community in the Muslim world.  Israel estimates the value of Jewish property left behind in Morocco, Egypt, Iran, Syria, Yemen, and Iraq at $200 billion. Israel is also demanding $35 billion from Tunisia and $15 billion from Libya. Israel secretly determined the estimates in the countries throughout 2018, reported the Jerusalem Post.  According to Israeli Minister for Social Equality Gila Gamliel, the Israeli state will take measures to “obtain retribution.” Earlier in January, Gamliel said on Israeli outlet Hadashot News that “the time has come to correct the historic injustice.”  The minister referred to Jewish families who left Arab and Muslim countries as being “expelled” from their homes. Many Moroccans, however, wish to correct the minister’s “historical inaccuracies.”
 Gamliel’s statement gave the impression that Jewish communities were forced to leave their homes and property behind. Moroccans commenting on the situation disagreed, asserting that Moroccan Jews had lived peacefully alongside Moroccan Muslims.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI inaugurated the extension project of Terminal 1 at Casablanca Mohammed V Airport and new air terminals at other domestic airports on Tuesday. The extension project of the new Terminal 1 of Casablanca airport, which covers an area of 76,000 square meters, can receive an annual capacity of 7 million passengers. The almost MAD 1.6 billion project includes “eight new aircraft parking spaces: three for large planes and one for Airbus 380,”  Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. The Terminal 1 extension project will increase the airport’s overall capacity to 14 million passengers a year. In 2018, Casablanca received 9.7 million passengers. The King also launched the new Area Control Center (CCR) of Agadir air navigation safety and new air terminals of the Guelmim, Zagora, and Errachidia airports. The CCR is located near the Agadir Al-Massira Airport over an area of 3 hectares. The National Office of Airports (ONDA) carried out the projects for MAD 647.7 million. The extension project of the new terminal at Guelmim Airport covers an area of ​​7,000 square meters, allowing a capacity of 700,000 passengers per year. The terminal also has 2,000 square meters of administrative and technical buildings and an upgraded aircraft runway and parking space. The Zagora airport extension project has a new terminal with an annual capacity of 250,000 passengers, a surveillance tower, and several technical and administrative buildings. The new terminal at Errachidia Moulay Ali Cherif Airport covers an area of ​​3,500 square meters and is able to receive 300,000 passengers per year.  The extension projects, according to MAP, followed the royal instructions to provide several cities in Morocco with modern airport infrastructure to meet the growing number of passengers at the national airports and “to support the domestic socio-economic and tourism development.” Last year, Moroccan airports received over 22,534,000 passengers, 10 percent more passengers than in 2017, according to the National Office of Airports (ONDA). Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca welcomed 43 percent of Moroccan international air traffic in 2018, receiving 9,732,044 passengers, up 4 percent from the previous year.

Rabat – Spain is determined to help Morocco in its campaign against irregular migration. On Tuesday, Spanish Secretary of State for Migration Consuelo Rumi said that Spain has asked the European Commission to “urgently” release the financial aid it promised Morocco to manage migratory issues and to fight terrorism. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported on statements Rumi gave to Spanish media, in which the Spanish official said that the Spanish government is calling on the European Commission to give Morocco the €140 million it promised before March. Rumi reportedly made the remarks following her two-day visit to Brussels where she met EU officials, including European Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs Dimitris Avramopoulos and European Commissioner for EU Neighborhood Policy Johannes Hahn. According to Rumi, the €140 million is not enough for Morocco as it is adopting several policies against organized trafficking and integration regulations for sub-Saharan migrants. Rumi said that Hahn holds the same point of view that Morocco must be a “strategic partner of the EU not only in the field of migration.” International news outlets reported on January 18 that Morocco had already received the first payment of €30 million. The EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Federica Mogherini said that Morocco will soon receive the remainder of the €140 million fund that the EU allocated for Morocco to tackle irregular migration. The financial aid granted by the EU is part of the fund promised by the European Commission in December 2018. The European Commission pledged €148 million to financially assist Morocco. In a statement, the commission said that it was “intensifying its support to Morocco to address irregular migration in response to increased migratory pressure along the Western Mediterranean Route.” Both Spain and Morocco face pressure due to the flow of migrants who take the sea route or cross the land borders between the two countries to reach Europe. The National Observatory of Migration announced in January that Moroccan police thwarted 88,761 irregular migration attempts in 2018. About 80 percent of the migrants (70,571) were not Moroccans, according to the National Observatory of Migration.

Rabat – Morocco scored another point in international diplomacy when the European Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries adopted the EU-Morocco fisheries deal by a large majority today. Quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), a European parliamentary source in Brussels said that 17 members of the committee voted in favor of the fisheries deal while 7 voted against. Two members were absent. According to the source, the vote reflects the position of the majority of the political groups represented at the European Parliament. The EU and Morocco signed the fisheries deal on January 14 in Brussels. The agreement covers the fishing area from parallel 35 and Cap Spartel in northern Morocco to parallel 22 and Cap Blanc in southern Morocco. The deal specifies the fishing areas and access conditions for European vessels. The EU agreed to pay €52.2 million per year for the privilege of fishing in Moroccan waters, an increase from the previous deal’s €40.0 million per year. The adoption of the fisheries agreement followed the ratification of the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement passed by the European Parliament on January 16. The Moroccan government is satisfied with its partnership with the EU. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said after the adoption of the agriculture agreement that it confirms that Morocco cannot compromise when it comes to its sovereignty and national integrity. He said that the agreements are the fruit of Morocco’s diplomatic efforts and its key role in EU foreign policy. The EU is also happy with its 50-year-old partnership with Morocco. During her visit to Morocco after the adoption of the agreement, EU High Representative Federica Mogherini said that the new partnership will bring Morocco and the EU closer because it forms a measure to continue Morocco’s reform of the 2011 Constitution. The previous EU-Morocco fisheries deal expired in July 2018.

By Amal El Attaq Rabat – Morocco will sign a partnership with Rwanda in the justice sector to implement a digital court program. On Monday, January 21, both Moroccan and Rwandan justice ministers met in Kigali to review the best practices and experiences of the two countries in the justice sector and to discuss how they could enhance bilateral cooperation, according to Rwandan outlet the New Times. “The justice sector in Morocco is developing, it is going through a huge reform, and among the most important elements [is] building digital court programs,” Rwandan Minister of Justice Johnston Busingye told the press. Through digital court programs, Morocco is aiming to simplify judicial administration by abandoning paper methods and implementing of new technologies in the communication process between litigants and citizens in the judicial system. Busingye, while presenting the main justice reforms in Rwanda since the colonial era, said that “the country only relied on manual programmes with a lot of paperwork.” The minister expressed his desire to benefit from the accumulated experience of Morocco in this area. During his official visit to Rwanda, Moroccan Minister of Justice Mohamed Oujar said, “Strategic cooperation with Rwanda is particularly important for the Kingdom.” Talking to media, he also said, “Morocco is strongly interested in South-South cooperation with African countries, under the wise leadership of King Mohammed VI.” According to the New Times, Busingye invited his counterpart to attend the launch of “legal aid week” yesterday in Rwanda’s Southern Province.

Rabat – Morocco received 12.3 million tourists last year, up 8 percent from the previous year, said Adil El Fakir, general director of the Moroccan National Tourist Office (ONMT), on Tuesday. Speaking at a presentation in Casablanca on Moroccan tourism achievements, El Fakir said that tourist arrivals in Morocco totalled 11.3 million in the first 11 months of 2018, an average of one million tourist per month and an increase of 8.5 percent compared to 2017. Between 2000 and 2018, Morocco has averaged an annual growth of 6 percent in tourism arrivals, which is two points higher than global tourism growth, he added. The figures, according to El Fakir, made Morocco the top African tourist destination and the 30th most popular in the world. Chinese tourist arrivals in Morocco grew impressively in just three years after the relaxation of visa requirements. Their arrivals increased tenfold from 10,000 in 2015 to nearly 180,000 last year, according to the ONMT general director. Marrakech, the top Moroccan tourist destination, recorded over 2.4 million tourist arrivals from January to November last year in addition to 2.6 million scheduled hotel stays through the end of 2018, according to Morocco’s Tourism Observatory. Agadir received 1,038,769 tourists in the first 11 months of 2018, up 13 percent from the same period the previous year. The coastal city of Essaouira also received 15 percent more tourists in the first 10 months of 2018 than in the same period in 2017. When it comes to travel safety, Morocco is as safe as most European countries, the US, and Canada, having a low risk level, according to the 2019 Travel Risk Map. Morocco, which maintained this level over the last three years, is the only country to have a low risk level in North Africa. Algeria and Tunisia are medium risk, while Egypt is high risk.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) dismantled a terror cell of 13 members on Wednesday morning in the town of Klaat Sraghna in central Morocco and in three cities on the Atlantic coast: Sale, Mohammedia, and Casablanca. The suspects, whose ages ranged from 22 to 44, include two individuals who had previously been arrested on charges related to the anti-terrorism law. A statement from the Ministry of the Interior said BCIJ seized electronic devices; knives; an allegiance script supporting Abubakr al-Baghdadi, the self-styled caliph of ISIS; and a handwritten letter inciting to terrorism. The ministry added that the suspects had glorified terror attacks and attempted to incite people to commit terror crimes to undermine safety and security of the country. The statement added that the suspects were put in custody for further investigation. In 2018, BCIJ carried out similar anti-terrorism operations across the country. In one of the most recent operations, in December 2018, BCIJ arrested at least 22 suspects for one terrorist attack: The murders of two Scandinavian tourists in the Atlas mountains. On December 7, BCIJ also dismantled a six-member terror cell for their alleged ties with ISIS in Beni Mellal, central Morocco. The first arrest in January was of a mechanic in Tangier. The second arrest was of a three-member ISIS cell in Nador and Driouch, two cities in northeastern Morocco. BCIJ has dismantled 59 terror cells, 51 of which had ties to ISIS, since its creation in 2015, according to the head of the office, Abdelhak El Khiame. El Khiame said that BCIJ is now encountering fewer terror cells thanks to BCIJ’s efforts. As of December 2018, BCIJ had arrested 918 people for terror-related crimes, including 14 women and 29 minors. El Khiame noted that 98 percent of the people arrested in Morocco in terror-related cases are Moroccans.

Rabat – The Moroccan high commissioner for planning (HCP), Ahmed Lahlimi Alami, the deputy resident representative at the UN Development Assistance Framework, Martine Therer, and 10 UN agencies in Morocco signed an agreement in the framework of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)on Tuesday. During a ceremony today at the HCP headquarters in Rabat, the two officials discussed the agreement which is also part of the UNDAF 2017-2021 framework. The agreement will facilitate the tracking of and reporting of SGD progress in the country to better “inform the policymaker and the public on the progress” of sustainable development in their country. The agreement is valid for three years and will focus on the following objectives: “The use of performance and statistical data of the Sustainable Development Goals program, the preparation of periodic reports concerning the progress of these goals on national and regional levels, with the help of consultation mechanisms put by the program and through south-south cooperation networks.” The new agreement followed the 2012-2016 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which HCP, UNDP, and other UN agencies signed in 2012. The 2012 agreement paved the way for the regular reporting on the achievements of the SDGs implementation in Morocco nationally and regionally.  UNDAF seeks to provide “political support for global efforts to end poverty, reduce inequalities and take action to mitigate climate change to ensure prosperity for all.” Morocco has made advances in a significant number of SDGs, according to a report by the Economic Commission for Africa released in November. The report, however, entailed that youth employment, climate change, food security, and industrial transition were some of the complex challenges that Morocco still needs to address.

Rabat – Luigi Di Maio, Italy’s minister of economic development said at a meeting on Saturday in central Italy that France’s policies in its former African colonies are part of the reasons for Europe’s continued migration problems. According to the Italian official, Africa’s “decolonization” has not totally happened because France has not left its African colonies. Paris’ policies continue to have a considerable impact on African politics. He said France’s presence in Africa is “impoverishing” the continent, escalating Europe’s migration problems in the process. “If we have people who are leaving Africa now it’s because some European countries, and France in particular, have never stopped colonizing Africa,” Di Maio said. He added, “The EU should sanction all those countries like France that are impoverishing African countries and are causing those people to leave.”  Reaffirming Italy’s anti-migration stance with a seemingly benevolent spirit, he argued that “Africans’ place is in Africa, not in the depths of the Mediterranean.” Alluding to “Franc CFA,” the common currency in most of France’s former colonies in West and Central Africa currently facing waves of protests across the continent, Di Maio said that France “continues to print colonial currency that helps finance France’s public debt.” He argued the currency deepens Francophone Africa’s poverty and dependency on France. The Italian minister further argued that France owes Africa its current status on the global stage. “If France didn’t have its African colonies, because that’s what they should be called, it would be [only] the 15th largest world economy. Instead, it’s among the first, exactly because of what it is doing in Africa.”  Despite the anti-migration undertone of Di Maio’s statements, a slightly different version of his arguments has been made by pro-migration politicians both in Africa and Europe. Recently speaking in Vienna, where he represented Africa at the Euro-African summit, Rwandan President Paul Kagame said that Europe’s “failed policies” are responsible for the wave of Africans leaving their home countries. Kagame said, “Europe has a migration problem because it failed to address the issue early. Instead of helping Africa, it further impoverished the continent.”  ‘Aggressive and unacceptable’ But the Italian’s comments did not sit well with the French government, which was quick to paint them as “aggressive” and “unacceptable.” Reuters reported yesterday that the French foreign ministry summoned Italian Ambassador Teresa Castaldo to apparently reprimand her about Di Maio’s remarks. “It is not the first time that Italian authorities have made aggressive and unacceptable comments,” the newspaper quoted a French diplomatic source as saying. Meanwhile, echoing President Kagame’s Vienna interview, Di Maio doubled down on his stance. He said Europeans are “hypocrites” when it comes to migration.  He said some European governments always speak about the effects of migration but avoid pointing fingers to the causes. “I’ve stopped being a hypocrite talking only about the effects of immigration and it’s time to talk about the causes.”

Rabat – A Moroccan-Spanish businessman, Marco Yaqout, was shot dead as he was driving his Bentley into his garage at around 3:30 a.m. on Monday morning in Marbella, a city in southern Spain. The 49-year-old businessman, according to international media, owns five famous nightclubs in Puerto Banucs, including Linekers and TIBU. According to Euro Weekly news, the shooting occured after a hitman entered the garage of  the wealthy businessman. El Confidential reported that more than 20 shots were fired. The hitman then escaped the crime scene. TIBU was a favorite of stars in “The Only Way is Essex” (TOWIE) , a British reality television series. Former TOWIE star Mark Wright held a boat party at TIBU in 2014. The marketing manager at Linekers Group, Lina Hodgkins, said that she was shocked when she received the news of Yaqout’s death.  “The phone call at 5 am this morning will stay with me forever,” Lina wrote on Facebook. She added, “My boss of 14 years MARCO was killed. We argued like husband and wife over the years. Today remembering the good times of which there were many! Heartfelt sympathy to all the family. God bless.

Rabat – The prosecutor at the Rabat Court of Appeals issued an international arrest warrant for Egyptian Al Jazeera journalist Ahmed Mansour on Monday.

The Rabat prosecutor’s office is charging Mansour with marriage fraud, customary marriage, and public insults.

Ahmed Mansour reportedly married Karima Fritis, a member of the Justice and Development Party (PJD) party, in 2012.
 
The marriage contract Mansour and Fritis signed, however, is allegedly not recognized in Morocco. Fritis was 26 years old at the time of the wedding. The journalist reportedly paid a brideprice of $9,000.  The couple spent their honeymoon in Turkey. But at the Istanbul airport, the journalist abandoned his new bride, according to her story.

Germany arrested Mansour in 2015 at the request of the Egyptian police. A German court acquitted Mansour on charges of rape, theft, and kidnapping.

Mansour has been hosting Al Jazeera’s “Bela Hodod” talk show since 1999.

By Amal El Attaq The Arab Innovation Academy (AIA) has announced the winning startup team, led by Moroccan student Chaimae El Mahdawi, of the second annual Qatari competition. El Mahdawi’s team won the prize for their “Salamat-e” mobile application on January 15, in Doha. “Salamat-e” gives travelers information about diseases, prevention measures, and relevant vaccinations before travelling. The app includes other health tools like the “Map Clinic,” which connects to a GPS and tracks travelers’ health status. Depending on the country where the traveler is, the app can raise awareness about certain diseases. “When I went to Doha, I only had 10 days to compose a team…. I was very pleased to have a such wonderful team from different countries; two Palestinians, a Russian and a Sudanese joined me to form a start-up,” the student said to Morocco World News. “Working with an international team was a very rich exchange; they were from different cultures but since I was the CEO and the project manager, I had to fit with their language, work methods and rate,” El Mahdawi said. The AIA competition brought together more than 160 participants from 30 different nationalities. Twelve Moroccans took part in this major meeting of innovation. Among them, five participated with their own ideas, including El Mahdawi. The seven other Moroccans joined others’ startup teams. El Mahdawi related how she dealt with lack of sleep, hard work, and time constraints to make the project come to life and win the competition. “During the competition, some of our supervisors told us that they are going to select 20 teams that will benefit from extra training in Europe. Our team had all the criteria to do so, except one: An option on my travel app was not working,” El Mahdawi related. “I started crying, it was my most stressful and worst part of the competition. I could not forget it till now; I had lost hope on winning, and I felt very bad,” said the student. El Mahdawi succeeded in fixing the app’s option with the mentors and benefiting from the training. “When I took part in this competition, I had two goals: to [realize] my idea and to hoist the Moroccan flag high. There was no question that Chaimae El Mahdaoui wins but Morocco wins,” El Mahdawi said. “It’s just amazing, It was a very exceptional feeling when I was ranked in the TOP 10,” said the student. “When I heard the name of my project, I was thrilled, It was my favourite part during the competition,” said El Mahdawi. She added that a researcher from Stanford University told her that he did not know that Morocco had so much potential and that he is starting to think seriously about investing in the kingdom. “At that moment, I had pride for my country,” she said. El Mahdawi emphasized that she was also happy to contribute to improving the image of Moroccan women in the Arab World. The student expressed her willingness to work with Moroccan investors, “in order to keep the Moroccan touch on her project.” She is also planning to go for a training in Silicon Valley in the United States as the prize allows to do so and another one in Europe. “I still didn’t get enough details about this, but this is what I am planning to do. I am more focused now on developing the app,” added the student. El Mahdawi, 22, is a researcher at the Mohammed VI University for Health Sciences in Casablanca, and is currently earning her Master’s degree in cancer biology.  “Art is my escape from the world, when I don’t feel comfortable, I just have to play some piano, and this is what I had done before in a stressful moment during the competition,” El Mahdawi explained. In her spare time, El Mahdawi is a ballet teacher and vlogs about her trips on a YouTube channel. She also aspires to spread positivity on the web and bring peace through her Instagram posts and monthly live videos with people from multiple countries. El Mahdawi is also a project coordinator for Enactus Morocco, for which she has gone on humanitarian trips, particularly to Brazil. She also went to Egypt for the iCancerVive association that helps sick children.     [ First day in @icancervive_asm ] : This picture was taking on my first day volunteering with Icancervive, an organization that is working on the same vision that i have for these heroes 🦸‍♂️ 🦸‍♀️ ! When I arrived to the hospital i didn’t know what to expect, how to communicate or how to draw a smile on their faces, because as u may know this experience was in Egypt ! It’s true that they speak Arabic but it’s not the same jokes, language and as kids they won’t get that I speak a different Arabic. . I saw this kid sitting alone so I went to talk to him, his name is Moataz ! It was like a first date for me 🤭 I was so excited just for him to say hi to me, i tried to explain to him that I came all the way from Morocco to play with him, he smiled and i was dancing of joy in my head. At some point his face started fading..the treatement was taking him down. . Still me and some colleagues in icancervive kept talking to him as trying to drive his attention to us instead of the treatement. We successfully made him enjoy our company. . And this was the beginning of my journey in #Volunteering_In_Egypt. Ps : Can you see how excited i am to take a picture with him 🥰🥰 ! . . #volunteering #icancervive #volunteer #hospital #heroes #good #morocco #moroccan #proud #kids #positivity See you on the next post for the next story 🙏 A post shared by  Chaimae El Mahdaoui 💮 (@chaimaemhd) on Dec 13, 2018 at 11:35am PST

Rabat – On Tuesday, Morocco’s Minister Delegate for National Defense Abdeltif Loudiyi received the secretary general for political affairs and security policy for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Alejandro Alvargonzalez. During the meeting, which is pursuant to the high royal instructions, the two officials discussed measures to increase cooperation between Morocco and NATO, particularly in the areas of defense capacity building, interoperability, cybersecurity, and cyber defense. According to a statement published by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the officials also discussed security issues in the Mediterranean region and the Sahel, where terror networks are active. The meeting took place during a seminar on cooperation between Morocco and NATO. The Moroccan-NATO cooperation is governed by an Individual Partnership and Cooperation Program. It includes the training of military officers and the exchange of expertise as well as regular exchanges of visits by senior officials from both sides. Alvargonzalez also met Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. Following his talk with Bourita, the NATO official said, “What Morocco is doing every day for the security of the people of the Mediterranean basin, and beyond this geographical area, is extremely positive for the stability of all of us.”  He also thanked King Mohammed VI for his leadership and for “the security of Morocco and the security that Morocco extends in the region.” He also expressed gratitude for the country’s “indisputable loyalty to the people of the Mediterranean, Europe, and the Maghreb.” Bourita said that the meeting between Morocco and NATO is part of the “long-standing” relations between the two partners. Morocco “is strengthened in its role of stability provider in the Sahel, the Mediterranean, and North Africa,” Bourita said. Bourita also recalled Morocco’s role in the areas of peacekeeping operations and the fight against terrorism and transnational crime. The role makes Morocco a “valued and sought-after partner,” Bourita concluded.

Rabat – France granted fewer visas to Algerians in 2018 than in 2017, according to a report of the General Directorate of Foreigners in France (DGEF) published on January 15. The French Consul General in Algeria, Marc Sedille, told Algerian state news agency TSA in November that the drop is due to the change of service providers at the beginning of the year and service stopping for almost a month; the introduction of France-Visas, a stricter application system; and the tightening of border controls because of the influx of migrants. The number of visas France granted to Algerian nationals fell from 413,976 in 2017 to 297,104 in 2018, a decrease of 28 percent. In contrast, France granted more visas to Moroccans and Tunisians in 2018 than in 2017, according to the French interior ministry. Moroccan visa approvals increased by 3 percent and Tunisian approvals by 13 percent. The French Ambassador to Algeria Xavier Driencourt told TSA that President Emmanuel Macron’s state visit in 2018 had been cancelled due to the “yellow vests” protests since November.

Driencourt also said that French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe also cancelled a visit to Algeria scheduled for December 2018. “In December, the government had a number of emergencies to deal with.”

Rabat – Mostapha and Wissal, two Moroccan students at Paris Nanterre University, started a hunger strike Monday to demand their “legitimate rights as students.” Mostapha, 23, who arrived in France eight months ago, asked for free French language courses. Since the course is not free, the university asked him to pay €650 for one-semester of study. The second-year student of sociology said he could not afford the courses, French newspaper Le Parisien reported. Mostapha had asked the university’s social assistance service for “help” but his request was refused. Wissal, 20, also complained Nanterre University only offered her distance learning courses. Distant courses will not allow her to obtain a residence permit unlike campus-based learning, the newspaper explained. “I think it’s calling into question my status as a student,” she said. Supported by the Maghreb Students Union of France (UEMF) association, the two students set up a tent on the ground floor of the Pierre Grappin building at the university. “We have nothing to lose. As long as we are not heard, we will not move from here,” Wissal asserted. The university administration, according to Le Parisien, claimed to have “taken into account” the “special cases” of the two students and made every effort to find solutions. Moroccans are a large part of the foreign student community in France. During the 2017/2018 academic year, there were 39,855 Moroccan students enrolled in French higher education institutions, according to Campus France, the French Agency for the Promotion of Higher Education, Hospitality, and International Mobility. In November last year, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced that his country is planning to increase tuition costs for international students, starting from the 2019-2020 academic year. International students at French universities will pay higher enrollment fees, the equivalent of 30 percent of the total cost of their degrees. Education syndicates in France heavily criticized the government move. They argued that many of the concerned international students are not as rich as the prime minister claimed. The reform, according to them, will “reinforce social precarity” for students.

Rabat – On New Year’s Eve, Chafiq’s worst nightmare came true after a minor road accident in Marrakech. He hit a motorcycle driver with his vehicle, but no casualties were reported. A cross-dresser who only wants to be mentioned by his first name, Chafiq’s choice of attire was what caused him issues. After press reports and rumors posted online, Chafiq decided to break his silence to talk about his side of the story in an interview with Morocco World News. The 33-year-old said that he was partying at a hotel in Marrakech. At 2 a.m., Chafiq, who was wearing a blue woman’s robe and a wig, left the hotel. At a traffic light, Chafiq hit a motorcycle. News reports said that Chafiq tried to escape the scene, but the crossdresser said that he was planning to stop. “You know that feeling when you are shocked, you cannot stop immediately after the accident,” Chafiq told MWN. After a while, Chafiq said that he stopped his car, and the crowd started to get bigger.  “A policeman stopped by and asked me to leave the car. I told him that I will give him my car papers and stay inside the car. But he refused and broke my car’s window,” Chafiq said. The incident started to get worse after citizens saw him wearing a dress. “After I left the car, they handcuffed me. It was a minor car accident; they don’t have the right to do that,” Chafiq said. He added that everyone was filming and taking photos of him during his arrest.  “When I went to the police station, some policemen took pictures of me through their personal phones. I did not know why they did that,” Chafiq said. Police also photographed his ID card. After a while, Chafiq was released but was asked to come back to the police station in 48 hours. “I left and I thought that everything will finish after what happened that night, so I just slept. But when I woke up and checked my phone I was shocked to find videos and photos of me posted online. My friends sent them to me, and I was surprised,” Chafiq said. He added that his brother asked him if it was him but he denied it. “I told my brother that it was not me, God creates forty people who look the same,” Chafiq told MWN. But when pictures of his ID were posted online, Chafiq could not deny his sexual orientation or the incident anymore. “I told my brother that it is what it is. My mother fainted when she heard. But what else can I do? This is what it is.” Chafiq’s parents were unaware of his sexual orientation, and after the incident, he has not been in touch with his family, except his brother. In a sad tone, Chafiq said that what the police did was unexpected, especially considering his ID has his home address. “I feel threatened now. Who can tell that I am not a target of someone who would try to harm me?” Chafiq asked. He said that after the incident, a traveler from Oujda visited him at home to ask him how he feels after the controversy. “He had a three day beard, and he said he is from Oujda and he passed by to check how I am after the incident. He also invited me for a coffee. To be honest, I felt scared. I am scared,” Chafiq said. Now, Chafiq is planning to leave the country because he fears for his safety. A spokeswoman for Moroccan NGO Alternative Movement for Individual Freedoms (MALI), Ibtissam Lachgar, said that Chafiq’s case is “complicated.” Lachgar, who is also a clinical psychologist, said that Chafiq is really depressed now.  “We contacted him and received him in Rabat. He was really depressed,” Lachgar told Morocco World News. She added that MALI is now contacting several embassies and associations to assist him in seeking asylum. “It takes time as there are several steps that we should follow,” Lachgar said. She added that MALI will not give up and will knock on every door that might help Chafiq because the process is complicated. She explained that there are more complicated cases than Chafiq’s whose requests for refuge were rejected. Chafiq called on Moroccans to avoid prejudice at the end of the interview. LGBT people in Morocco often  fear unfriendly reactions and keep their sexual orientation secret. Article 489 of Morocco’s Penal Code also stipulates prison periods ranging from six months to three years for “lewd or unnatural acts with an individual of the same sex.” Revealing suspects’ information publicly is also punishable. After the release of the photos, videos, and ID of the cross-dresser, General Director of National Security Abdellatif Hammouchi announced disciplinary sanctions ranging from warnings to temporary suspensions for four policemen in Marrakech. The four policemen were suspended for not preserving Chafiq’s personal and private data. A statement from the General Directorate of the National Security (DGSN) also condemned the lack of policemen’s rigor in preserving the personal data of an individual who is the subject of a judicial investigation. Chafiq’s case generated thousands of reactions, with some saying he  disrespected Moroccan culture and religion and others condemning the sharing of his pictures, calling it a violation of his personal freedom.

Rabat – The Investigative Committee of Russia confirmed on Tuesday that authorities have arrested a passenger suspected of hijacking an airplane. Aeroflot Flight SU1515 landed in Siberia after the suspect demanded the plane change course.

The Russian Counter-Terrorism Committee issued a statement that the aircraft, travelling from Surgut in western Siberia to Moscow, “changed course at the request of one of the passengers.”  According to RT, the drunk passenger tried to break into the cockpit, claiming he was armed and demanded the airplane head for Afghanistan. However, no weapons were found on the passenger. Also today, a Russian combat aircraft crashed while conducting a hard landing on a military airfield in the Murmansk region in northwest Russia, killing two and injuring two soldiers on board, according to Xinhua.

Rabat – At the World Heritage Week Program in Sharjah, UAE, Algerian authorities curiously posed with Marrakech’s iconic Koutoubia mosque. Footage has emerged of some Algerian authorities posing before a miniaturized Koutoubia mosque with “Algerian Cultural Week” captioned in the background.  The Sharjah Institute for Heritage, which organized the World Heritage Week event, did not respond to MWN’s inquiry on the picture. Built in the 12th century, Koutoubia mosque is the tallest mosque in Marrakech, making it an “exceptional” and “amazing” sight that easily stands out in a city already filled with eye-catching sights. Overlooking the city, especially the medina (walled city), with its uniquely shaped minaret, Koutoubia has been reportedly used by millions of tourists visiting Marrakech as a reference point when trying to find their way around the sinuous and confusing avenues of the medina. While Algerian authorities have not explained their reason for seemingly presenting Marrakech’s landmark mosque as “Algerian heritage,” the overall description of the Sharjah event pointed to a perception that Algeria shared a history with the site of the Koutoubia mosque.  According to the event’s organizers, the Algerian heritage week aimed to show “the depth of history” by offering “exclusive insights on Algerian science, knowledge, and civilization.” The mosque has been on UNESCO’s world heritage list since 1985.  Perhaps that is why online responses to circulated footage showing the iconic mosque as part of Algeria tended to concede that, Algeria, not known for its cultural landmarks, borrowed Morocco’s for a week to sell its own cultural image.

Rabat – Speaking with Morocco World News, Achraf El Johari, 22, shared his story of ambition to win the election for youth mayor of Amsterdam. El Johari recently obtained his bachelor’s degree in law studies and is currently pursuing a master’s degree in private law.  To him, most of the problems that young people face in Amsterdam “are not visible on the political agenda because there is no youth representation in politics.” El Johari told MWN that youth in the Netherlands “have little to no interest in local politics.”  However, he said, “young ‘Amsterdammers’ (person from Amsterdam) do not have the privilege to be apolitical.” From here, his youth mayor campaign was born. He wanted “to close the gap of Youth representation in our democracy.” As an “Amsterdammer” whose parents are originally from Driouch near Nador in Morocco’s northern Rif region, El Johari is faced with several “uncertainties.” Among the issues that many of his peers experience, especially from non-Dutch families, is racism. El Johari said: “Young ‘Amsterdammers’ are asked to build their future on a lot of uncertainties: youth wage, flexible contracts, racism, and housing problem.” El Johari explained that Amsterdam, as the busy capital city it is, is “growing fast and gentrification is taking place.” “Because of that,” El Johari continued, “there is no place for young Amsterdammers without a big bag or money. Simply because we cannot afford housing.” El Johari expressed that, unsurprisingly, “12% of the youths between 12 and 25 years old need psychological help.” El Johari is now marching towards his ambition, along with two other youth mayor candidates, Joshua de Roos and Avianka Aventurin.  After the voting period ends on February 15, the city will announce results for the winner on February 18 during an Award Gala at the De Meervaart Theater in Amsterdam.

Rabat – A group of Moroccan activists are condemning discriminatory visa policies in Jordan and Egypt after being denied entrance to the countries.  The mahram (male guardian) law does not seem to be limited only to Saudi Arabia.  In order for Moroccan women between the ages of 18 and 35 to visit Jordan, they need to travel with a mahram.  Mounia Semlali, Kamilia Raouyane, and Asmaa Fakhoury all work for Oxfam, an international organization that says it “mobilizes the power of people against poverty.” The Moroccan women took to social media to voice their frustration and share their concerns when they were denied visas on arrival and prevented from visiting Egypt and Jordan for work. Moroccan human rights activist Ibtissam Lachgar told Morocco World News that she experienced the same treatment in 2012 when she arrived in Jordan at age 37.  After landing, she said that a policeman told her that she could not leave the airport since she did not have a male guardian. The policeman seemed overly concerned that she was Moroccan and did not pay attention to the date of birth on her ID. “I showed him a letter from the Jordanian Ministry of Interior, but they refused to let me in because I look young,” she said. Lachgar, the spokeswoman for Moroccan NGO Alternative Movernment for Individual Freedoms (MALI), said that she had gone to Jordan for an event.  “He did not let me in until he saw my date of birth. The fact that they take into account the age of women is also a problem. If you are above 35 then you are an old woman; they will care less about you,” she said. Semlali also told Morocco World News that the embassy refused her visa request because she was visiting the country without a mahram. “They told me this verbally.” Semlali said that she had been in Jordan twice before, but when she recently submitted a visa application to take part in an event on gender issues for work, her request was rejected. “When I argued on the fact that I need a mahram, they told me that I need an approval from the Ministry of Interior in Jordan.” She also wondered why this requirement had not been mentioned before.  “The visa procedure should be clear. If they asked me to collect more documents prior to the interview like what usually happens in Schengen visa, I would have made all documents ready without any problems,” Semlali explained. On January 18, Semlali posted her experience on Facebook, calling on the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs to intervene against the visa policy targeting Moroccan women.  She told MWN that it is “unfair” for Moroccan women to be singled out. Semlali added that after media reported on their case, she received calls from the Jordanian embassy, who asked her to come back to get her visa. Semlali, however, said it was too late to attend her event. “I was going to discuss gender issues in the country. I will not turn the page [and forget it] easily.”  Semlali added that it is frustrating how they single Moroccan women out as potential prostitutes. “This phenomenon is everywhere.” After her experience, Semlali said she had three questions in mind: “Why must Moroccans between 18 and 35 years old be accompanied by a mahram to have the right of entry in Jordan? Why Moroccans in particular?” She also condemned some countries for lumping all Moroccan women together due to stereotypes. “Do not put everything in the same basket! We are not all prostitutes! And then, the policy must be applied to all countries of the world!” Where is the foreign ministry? Semlali said that she had never experienced such discrimination when she applied for a Schengen visa for Europe. “We submit our files, and we are given a 2-3 year visa with all respect!!!! So?” She then sarcastically wondered of the foreign minister: “Our beloved Morocco, where are you in all of that. Mr. Nasser Bourita, with all my respect, this humiliation of Moroccan women does not bother you??” In a phone call with Morocco World News, the Jordanian embassy  confirmed that Moroccan women under 35 are not allowed to enter the country. But Jordanian diplomats refused to defend or explain the policy of singling out Moroccan women publicly. MWN also contacted Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ask about the department’s response to the policy, but the ministry was unreachable. ‘I always wanted a Moroccan second wife’ Like Semlali and Lachgar, Oxfam employee Fakhoury also recalled an experience in February 2018, when she had an unfriendly conversation with a policeman in the airport of Amman, Jordan. It was 4 a.m. when Fakhoury had a talk with a policeman in the airport who asked her why she had come to Jordan. She said that the policeman asked her about her age. She said that the policeman took her into his office and winked at other policemen who “had nothing to do” and sat in on the interview.  After reading her letter from the Ministry of the Interior, the policeman “pretended to be serious and told me: You are in charge of a program. What is it? A television program? Are you an artist?” She said that she explained that the program focused on economic and social rights for women and youth.  “I will participate in this workshop to discuss unemployment issues in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan and social inequalities and poverty,” she explained. She said that the policeman’s response was provocative. He said that she is a “beautiful young Moroccan woman” there without a mahram. “Do you know what Moroccan [women] do here in Jordan?” he asked, referring to prostitutes. When she said, “Yes,” his colleagues laughed. He then rhetorically asked her: “What do they do?” Fakahory then said that women work in international organizations and run projects and programs aiming to end poverty. “They travel more than 16 hours to attend workshops but they are insulted because they are Moroccans.” Despite her firm words, the policeman laughed and said “I promised myself that my second wife would be a Moroccan. I like wild women.” Fakhoury then condemned the discriminatory visa policies in Egypt and Jordan because they consider any Moroccan women under 35 years as a “prostitute.” Fakhoury commented that she could not attend a meeting in Egypt because the Egyptian embassy refused to give her a visa. She said that she missed an opportunity to feature her project due to the visa denial. Fakhoury then finished her post, which she shared yesterday on Facebook, by calling all activists and journalists to defend the dignity and rights of Moroccans. “Support us because we decided not to remain silent,” she said. Jordan is not the only country that imposes the restriction on Moroccan women. Kuwait will not give Moroccan, Tunisian, and Lebanese women work permits if they are not accompanied by a male relative. The policies reflect Middle Eastern stereotypes of Moroccan women as promiscuous.

By Amal El Attaq Rabat – On the evening of January 17, the Oujda Court sentenced 18 activists to 2-4 years in prison for participating in protests in the mining city of Jerada in north-east Morocco. Police charged protestors with “burning vehicles, obstructing passages, participation in an unauthorized demonstration, possessing weapons, damaging public goods, insulting an officer and using force against him,” according to lawyer Abdelhaq Benkada, a member of the protestors’ defense team in Jerada. “We were shocked by these convictions issued against the detainees,” the lawyer told Reuters. “The harsh and unexpected sentences amounted to about sixty years in total.” The convictions are “severe and catastrophic,” lamented Benkada. He related that one defendant suffering from a mental illness also received a two-year suspended sentence. The lawyer added that “all evidences proved their innocence, and we have highlighted to the court the weakness of the story we received on the record.” He asserted that evidence would contradict the convictions. On December 22, 2017, the death of two men working informally in a closed coal mine in Jerada triggered protests. At least nine deaths of the same type were recorded during 2018. Activists protested their deaths, saying they were working in poor conditions. The protesters demanded social and economic reform for the city’s development and asked for economic alternatives to informal mining. Later, the government promised to open projects to increase employment and provide aid measures against poverty in the region.

Rabat – The head coach of the Moroccan national football team, Herve Renard, said in an interview with Jeune Afrique that Egypt and Senegal teams are the favorites to win the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). Renard, who is famous for his take-nothing-for-granted attitude, said that his team will go with “ambitions, which is normal. But today, there are two great favorites: Egypt of course, and Senegal. Morocco, with Algeria, Tunisia, Cote d’Ivoire and others, is among the outsiders.” He said, however, that Morocco is going to achieve a beautiful performance in the competition. “To say that we will win is something else. We must not forget that nothing is easy during a CAN. We will face highly motivated teams. We will not be at home and we know that playing away, it is always more complicated.” Morocco officially qualified for CAN 2019 after it defeated Cameroon 2-0 last November. Cameroon also qualified as the second-place winner in the group. CAF’s flagship tournament will be held in June and July 2019 in Egypt.  On November 30, 2018, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) stripped the hosting rights of the tournament from Cameroon due to lack of infrastructure. Several news outlets predicted that Morocco would bid to host the tournament. However, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) said that it was not interested in replacing Cameroon. CAF  launched a new bidding process, and Egypt and South Africa applied. Egypt was awarded the hosting rights of the tournament on January 8, 2019. Renard expressed regret over Morocco’s decision not to bid to host the tournament. Africa”When I learned that the CAN 2019 would not take place in Cameroon, I thought that Morocco was one of the rare African countries able to organize it in excellent conditions.” He said that he feels disappointed because a CAN in Morocco “would have been fantastic.” He said during his interview that the Moroccan fans “would also have liked it to happen at home, but it is not me who decides.”

Rabat – Taxi drivers have been protesting since January 17 against the refusal of Fez-Meknes Province to negotiate with taxi drivers’ representatives. On Sunday, taxi drivers parked their cars along Hassan II Avenue in the center of Fez to express their anger at “the miserable situation that the city’s taxi drivers are experiencing,” Moroccan media reported. The drivers are also calling for the province to implement the 2009 Prefectural Decision regulating the circulation of “grand” (shared) taxis in Fez within limited urban areas. The shared taxis, which can carry six passengers and run on specified routes, are invading the urban areas of the city, according to the protestors. In contrast to “grand” taxis, “petit” (regular) taxis charge higher rates using a meter to drop off no more than three passengers at a time at their exact destination. According to a statement published by the taxis’ local coordination group in Fez on January 20, “The strike came after fruitless meetings that have been going on for two years without achieving positive results.” In the statement, the taxi drivers apologized to the city’s inhabitants for the disturbance they caused. They also asserted that they will continue to strike until their demands are met. Meanwhile, several voices in Fez on social media are reportedly calling for customers to boycott taxis in the city. They are also calling on the security services to control the chaos that the taxis are creating in the city and to set a free phone line to report on violations committed by “petit” taxi drivers.

Rabat – A recent poll has found that Moroccans are pessimistic about their financial prospects, given the country’s deepening unemployment and poverty levels. Citing figures from the results of the latest Afrobarometer survey in its January 21 edition, Akhbar Al Yaoum reported that more than 66 percent of Moroccans rated unemployment as the most serious impediment to their own and the country’s economic prospects.  According to the survey, the majority of Moroccans said they have been disappointed by the government’s employment policies, and they think authorities are not doing enough to curb unemployment.  Sixty-six percent of the participants rated the country’s employment issues far above corruption and social exclusion, saying that “unemployment is Morocco’s greatest concern.”  Afrobarometer’s study, which surveyed 1,200 Moroccans, found that only 1 percent considered that the Moroccan government has done enough in recent years to improve employment prospects. In contrast, 87 percent said that authorities “have done nothing” to fight poverty and unemployment.  They said the country’s daily realities are a striking contrast to the government’s repeated promises and much-reported news and images of a rapidly modernizing Morocco.  While Afrobarometer’s sample expressed widespread agreement about labor market uncertainty, opinions were relatively divided when it came to their assessment of the root problems in Morocco.  Whereas 66 percent said that unemployment is the country’s foremost issue, 39 percent said Morocco suffers most from a crumbling health sector, and 38 percent considered that fighting poverty and social exclusion should be Moroccan authorities’ top priority.  Meanwhile, 20 percent spoke of corruption and complacent public services as preventing development the most. They said that curbing widespread corruption would positively impact other sectors, including labor and health. Other surveyed Moroccans mentioned problems including shortage of drinking water, inefficient economic policies, insecurity, public transportation, and lack of sufficient infrastructure. But such issues were globally perceived as part of more important issues, such as corruption and unemployment. Afrobarometer’s findings come amid other reports of increasing financial uncertainties for Moroccans.  A recent study on household confidence indicated that Moroccan families believe it is nearly impossible to save any part of their monthly income. Conducted by Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP), the study found that 82 percent of households said they will not be able to save in 2019.  An official government report has established that 600 engineers leave Morocco annually in search of better employment and financial prospects. The findings of Afrobarometer’s study echoed such sentiments.  According to the study, 36 percent of Moroccans think that leaving their country will improve their financial prospects.  Of those, 7 percent said they have started procedures to leave, including applying for visas and job hunting abroad. Sixty-eight percent said they have not yet thought of a plan to leave the country.

Rabat – The president of the Peruvian Congress, Daniel Salaverry, said Friday that relations between Peru and Morocco “have developed steadily, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields,” Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. “Peru has built diplomatic relations with Morocco for more than fifty years and these ties have continued to develop over and over again with the exchange of visits between the delegations of the two countries,” Salaverry said at an event at the Peruvian Congress in Lima. Peruvian MPs, Morocco’s Ambassador to Peru Youssef Balla, and other diplomats in Lima attended the event. Balla’s statements about the Moroccan-Peruvian relations were reciprocal. He also recognized the Peruvian Congress’s efforts to develop bilateral relations. The president of the Peru-Morocco Parliamentary Friendship Group, Rolando Reategui Flores, said: “The relations between the two countries are good at all levels.” In October 2017, 21 members of the Peruvian Parliament expressed their support for Morocco’s autonomy plan over Western Sahara. The 21 MPs stated their support in a signed letter to Ricardo Luna, Peru’s minister of foreign affairs.

Rabat – The White House dismissed an Israeli channel’s claim that the US wanted to propose creating a Palestinian state on most of the West Bank as “unfounded speculation.” “As in the past, speculations regarding the peace plan are inaccurate. We have no further reaction,” Israeli Channel 13 quoted the White House as saying.

Channel 13 claimed that the Trump administration’s peace initiative would propose establishing a Palestinian state on 85 to 90 percent of the West Bank, with the capital of Palestine being located in “most Arab neighborhoods” in East Jerusalem. 

Tel Aviv-based Peace Now reported that a number of 641 housing unit tenders were made in 2018, a record number since these figures were published online in 2002. Last year saw a total of 3,808 Israeli housing unit tenders throughout the West Bank, compared to 3,154 units in 2017.

Peace Now linked the increase over the past two years to Israeli government pressure for settlement expansion coupled with the silence of the Trump administration.

Israel controls 60 percent of the West Bank, whose Palestinian authority cut ties with the Trump administration after Trump recognized Jerusalem as  Israel’s capital, said Al Jazeera.

Rabat – Moroccan law enforcement has prevented 17 Polisario separatists from traveling to the cities of Bojador and Essamara in Morocco’s southern provinces, Western Sahara. Spanish news outlet EFE reported that among the separatists was Aminatou Haidar, known for her anti-Moroccan sentiment and support for the separatist group. Moroccan authorities also prevented Haidar and her group from visiting Tantan, a region in the extreme south of Morocco. The vice-president of the Collective of Sahrawi Human Rights Defenders (CODESA), Ali Salem Tamek, told EFE that law enforcement prevented the separatist group from filing a complaint “about the restrictions imposed on them by Morocco” to MINURSO in Laayoune. Tamek added that the visits are part of routine trips to “meet with human rights activists and the rest of the Sahrawi citizens in those cities.” Morocco has accused Haidar and Tamek of conducting illegal activities, including the embezzlement of international humanitarian aid intended for the region. A confidential document published by Moroccan media in February 2018 showed that Haidar, Tamek, and other separatists receive €500 monthly to spread separatist ideologies in the region. Another 17 associations active in the southern cities also receive monthly support from the Polisario Front, as well as seven news outlets, according to the same document. The associations support demonstrations in the southern regions. The document said that the separatists receive funds from Omar Boulssen, who lives in Las Palmas, Spain.

Rabat – The volume of fish caught off the coast and in artisanal fisheries in Morocco totaled 1.31 million tons in 2018, the same volume registered in 2017, according to the National Fisheries Office (ONP). In its 2018 statistic note of coastal and artisanal fishing in Morocco, the ONP said that the market value of the fleet landings amounted to over MAD 7.3 billion, up 1 percent from 2017. Vessels entering the Mediterranean ports brought a total of 25,907 tons of coastal and artisanal fish and other products last year, up 4 percent compared to 2017, according to ONP’s note, published by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Meanwhile, coastal and artisanal fishery products in the Atlantic ports remained the same at 1.28 million tons. The ONP’s note stated that the volume of some fishery catches saw decreases of algae (14,411 tons) at 42 percent, cephalopods (38,354 tons; 18 percent), shellfish (869 ton; 10 percent), whitefish (63,786 tons; 7 percent), and crustaceans (4,515 tons; 5 percent). However, pelagic fish catches slightly increased by 2 percent to reach nearly 1.19 million tons. Morocco ranked 13th globally and first in Africa, with 1.4 million tons of fish catches, showing an industry growth of 6 percent over the past two years, according to the latest report from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.

Rabat – An accident took place along the A1 highway between Rabat and Casablanca, killing three women, the youngest 20 and the oldest 44, and injuring one person. The accident’s only survivor was Moroccan singer Hatim Idar, who was seriously injured and immediately taken to a hospital, Moroccan television channel Medi1 TV reported. The accident involved the collision of two cars near the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium. Idar reportedly was driving one of the cars, while the three women killed were in the other car. The civil protection services, police, and local authorities arrived at the scene soon after the accident.  One of the women died in an ambulance before it could reach the hospital.

Rabat – In 2018, almost all of the 3,344 unaccompanied minors from the MENA region who entered the Spanish enclave of Ceuta in northern Morocco were Moroccan. Among the minors who arrived in Ceuta last year, 3,302 were boys and 42 were girls who came from the neighboring cities of Tetouan and Tangier, reported Spanish media outlet Europa Press on Sunday, based on official data from Spanish authorities. Last week alone, 295 Moroccan teenage migrants arrived in Ceuta and were taken to a local juvenile detention center.  The number of unaccompanied and underage migrants from MENA crossing to the Ceuta border increased by over 400 percent compared to in 2017 when 802 arrived in the autonomous city. A Spanish government official told Europa Press that overcrowdedness in the juvenile center prevents professionals from properly caring for the minors and attending to all their needs. The mayor-president of Ceuta, Juan Vivas, told the same source that the influx of migrants is not the fault of Spanish Civil Guards or the national police not doing their job but rather the lack of “technological equipment” and border infrastructure to facilitate the fight against irregular migration. Vivas suggested that both Morocco and Spain should reach a mutual agreement to devise a family reunification plan for the teenage migrants. In December, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced his country’s interest in strengthening and modernizing the Ceuta and Melilla borders with Morocco to combat irregular migration, according to Spanish news agency EFE. The Spanish government reportedly approved a €40 million budget for the communities and the Spanish enclaves. Part of the budget will be allocated to care for the unaccompanied foreign minors received in 2018.

Rabat – While the Moroccan government is positive about human rights in the country, Human Rights Watch listed a series of events that suggested otherwise. Human Rights Watch has released its 2019 report, saying Morocco is growing increasingly intolerant of dissent and listing all the human rights violations it found in Morocco in 2018. The NGO found multiple instances of Moroccan law enforcement using “excessive force in breaking up protests, as well as arrests of peaceful protesters,” noting protests about mining deaths in Morocco’s eastern town of Jerada. HRW also related developments in the case of Hirak Rif activists whom Morocco had detained since protests which took place in the Al Hoceima province in 2016 and 2017 to condemn social disparities. HRW said that the protesters were subject to “unfair trials” before a court in Casablanca handed down sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years in prison. Four leaders of the Hirak Rif protests, including Nasser Zafzafi, received 2o-year prison sentences in June 2018. HRW said that although their staff were “able to operate in Morocco and Western Sahara in a relatively free manner,”authorities obstructed some of the other biggest human rights organizations throughout the year, including the Moroccan Association for Human Rights. Regarding human rights in Western Sahara, HRW focused on three prisoners who requested a prison transfer but were denied. The three were convicted of and sentenced for the murders of 11 Moroccan officers in the 2010 Gdeim Izik incident. According to HRW, they were convicted “in unfair trials in 2013 and 2017.” The three individuals received sentences of 30 years to life in prison. Confessions from the three were the primary source of evidence, although the HRW report says “the defendants repudiated those confessions and said they signed under torture without being permitted to read them.” In 2018, the prisoners conducted hunger strikes from prison in Kenitra, north of Rabat, demanding Moroccan authorities transfer them to prisons near their families in the southern provinces. “The demand was not met at the time of writing,” said Human Rights Watch. The NGO also said that Moroccan authorities in Western Sahara “beat activists and journalists in their custody and on the streets.” While discussing human rights in Western Sahara in the Moroccan report, the NGO’s 2019 report for Algeria did not mention living conditions for Sahrawis in the Tindouf camp. Several reports, including a report from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in 2018, mentioned the lack of nutrition and insufficient international aid for Sahrawis. News outlets also reported the alleged unbearable situation of Sahrawis in Tindouf, and cases of suspicious deaths among Polisario members. Regarding the rights of women and girls, child marriage was a focal point for HRW. According to the NGO, underage marriage is still a major issue in the country although Morocco’s family code sets the minimum age of marriage at 18. The NGO said that judges still allow children to marry below the legal age in certain circumstances. A report issued by Morocco’s High Commission of Planning (HCP) confirmed that cases of child marriage are actually on the rise despite the country’s attempt to end the phenomenon. Child marriage can be legalized if the family gets a waiver for the minor. The number of waiver requests for minors increased to 41,669 in 2015, compared to 38,331 in 2007, according to HCP statistics. HRW report also criticized Morocco’s law criminalizing violence against women for not being effective enough. The law, which took effect in September 2018, does not “set out duties of police, prosecutors, and investigative judges in domestic violence cases, or fund women’s shelters,” according to HRW. Moroccan and international activists agreed with HRW in this issue. Stephanie Willman Bordat, an international human rights lawyer, said the struggle for women’s rights in Morocco does not end with the adoption of Law 103-13 on gender-based discrimination. She told MWN that a reporting procedure for women wishing to file complaints of gender-based discrimination must be facilitated. Despite the government’s attempts to integrate migrants, HRW said that the government has not yet adopted the right to asylum. The NGO said that Morocco gave over a thousand recognized refugees access to “essential public services, such as education and health, but not the right to work.” The NGO also recalled a September report from Amnesty International claiming that the government launched a “large-scale crackdown on thousands of sub-Saharan migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees without due process.” Amnesty International also reported that Moroccan authorities bussed sub-Saharan Africans who were in northern Morocco to cities in the interior and released them there. The Moroccan government responded last year, saying that the migrants should be moved from northern cities like Tangier, Nador, and Tetouan, in order to keep them away from illegal migration networks operating in the region. The government, however, does not allow the involuntary deportation or extradition of migrants to their countries, in accordance with UNHCR standards. Morocco also faced criticism regarding the freedom to express sexual orientation and gender identity.  According to HRW, Morocco’s penal code “still discriminates against LGBT persons.” Article 489 of the Penal Code stipulates prison terms of six months to three years for “lewd or unnatural acts with an individual of the same sex,” as quoted by the NGO. Most LGBT people in Morocco feel coming out is unsafe and fear unfriendly reactions from their relatives and friends. The Moroccan government is expected to get back to HRW on its report in the press briefing on Thursday after the weekly cabinet meeting.

Rabat – The lower house of the German Parliament adopted a controversial bill on Friday to limit asylum applications from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Georgia.

Mostly from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative-central left coalition government, 509 German legislators voted in favor of the bill, while 138 legislators, most of them from the Greens and the Left Party, voted against.

Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer defended the government’s plan, saying that less than 3 percent of asylum applications from the four countries were found credible last year. 
The upper house of the Federal Council has yet to approve the bill. The upper-house Greens and Left opposition plan to block it, reported Info Sur Hoy.

German outlet the Local reported that migrants from the Maghreb were more likely to commit crimes in Germany than immigrants from Iraq and Syria.   Deportations of failed Maghrebi asylum seekers from Germany has increased since 2015. Germany deported 61 Moroccan asylum applicants in 2015, 634 in 2017, and 476 in the first eight months of 2018.

Rabat – For all the apparent optimism and political will from governments involved, the gas pipeline project agreement between Morocco and Nigeria (NMGP) is set to hit significant political and economic hurdles that could cause a massive delay in completion. In a recent analysis, Fitch Solutions highlighted grim prospects for the progress and completion of the Morocco-Nigeria gas pipeline.   Titled “Planned Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline Faces Fundamental Challenges,” the report stressed that political and security concerns in some of the countries concerned with the NMGP will cause delays. Fitch’s report said that “considerable commercial, technical, legal and financial challenges” will make the project “unlikely to materialize in the short or medium-term.”  After Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari visited Morocco in late 2018 to finalize the agreement of the 2016-initiated project, expectations soared. Media reports pointed to the series of bilateral agreements the two countries signed and President Buhari’s and King Mohammed VI’s earnest desire to advance continental autonomy on strategic matters like energy. According to Fitch, though, recommendations from the project’s feasibility studies suggest reasons for a more pessimistic take on the time needed to materialize the commitments. “The envisioned pipeline route is poised to have high exposure to political risks,” the report noted, referring to feasibility studies’ results.  Earlier this year, Nigerian and Moroccan energy authorities green-lighted British engineering company Penspen to “execute phase 1 of the front-end engineering and design (FEED) study for the planned NMGP,” Fitch noted.  Previously, Penspen completed the project’s first feasibility studies in July 2018, and the British company recommended that the NGMP route follow a combined onshore/offshore route for “political, legal, and security reasons.”  Because it will be based on Penspen’s preliminary recommendations, the first phase of the FEED study “will entail an in-depth evaluation of gas demand and supply mechanisms in the West African region, as well as negotiations with countries whose sovereign waters would be crossed by the pipeline.” In total, 13 countries—Nigeria, Benin, Togo, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, the Gambia, Senegal, Mauritania, and Morocco—are concerned with the NMGP. In-depth negotiations with all the governments involved means taking into account each country’s security and socio-political concerns, which will considerably slow progress. “The first and most obvious obstacle lies with the sheer number (thirteen) of countries which would have to agree before the project can move forward,” the report pointed out. To illustrate its pessimism, Fitch referred to the case of the West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP), which involved four countries. Even with “only four countries,” the report explained, it took WAGP 12 years to realize its first gas delivery. As negotiations between four governments took 12 years, the report suggests it is fair to assume that dealing with 13 will take much longer.  “Current timeframes indicate that construction of the pipeline is slated to be phased over a period of 25 years based on increasing needs of the countries crossed and Europe.” But the number of countries may only be the tip of the iceberg because other more structural and geopolitical reasons might prove lethal to NMGP.  Firstly there is the extreme volatility of Nigeria’s gas market. Militant factions in the West African country’s Delta region have destabilized other regional energy projects.  The report said, “The issue of availability of Nigerian gas to make the NMGP commercially viable could also prove problematic; especially when one keeps in mind how supply volatility in Nigeria (vulnerable to militant attacks in the Niger Delta) has negatively impacted pipeline exports through the WAGP.” Trends in the European market add another grim prospect for NMGP.   In addition to supplying the thirteen countries on NMGP’s route, the project seeks to capitalize on financial revenues by exporting natural gas to Europe. But while Europe’s growing gas demand could prove a particularly good market for NMGP, “European customers will likely remain well supplied by Russian and Norwegian gas.” Senegal and Mauritania are currently in the negotiation phase of a similar project, featuring Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea Bissau, and Gambia. The completion of the NMGP might trigger regional rivalry.  Among all the political hurdles, however, developments in Nigeria may prove the deadliest to NMGP’s completion.  The recent rapprochement between Morocco and Nigeria is widely credited to the close friendship between President Buhari and King Mohammed VI.  But Nigerians have been increasingly dissatisfied with President Buhari’s performance.  Polls have indicated Buhari will likely lose to Atiku Abubakar in the coming elections in February. Buhari’s uncertain reelection odds add “a layer of uncertainty” to NMGP, according to Fitch’s report. Fitch concluded, “A change in leadership could see any major project of this kind at risk of being re-evaluated or abandoned.”

Rabat – The adoption of the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement at the European Parliament on Wednesday created panic among the separatist group of the Polisario Front. The blow angered not only the separatist group but also its main supporter Algeria. Pro-Polisario media are mourning the decision of the EU which will strengthen its partnership with Morocco through the adoption of the agriculture and the fisheries agreements. After the EU Parliament verdict, pro-Polisario media criticized the separatists’ “last-minute” diplomatic efforts which resulted in a disappointing failure of its lobbying. The pro-Polisario outlet Futuro Sahara acknowledged the failed policies of the separatist group in recent years in an editorial published on Friday. According to the separatist outlet, the EU’s adoption of the agriculture agreement with Morocco, which includes the southern provinces, “did not come as a surprise to the Sahrawi citizen, who has been traumatized by the failed policies of the Sahrawi regime in recent years.” The outlet also condemned Polisario’s “last minute diplomatic efforts,” acknowledging that the separatists had only been speaking to their contacts just before the Christmas holiday, “an inappropriate  period of time to carry out lobbying campaigns to influence the European decision.” Commenting on the failure, Futuro Sahara said that lobbying campaigns should not have been limited to the EU Parliament but “should be extended to all European capitals” because MEPs are under pressure from their countries. The editorial also said that all Polisario’s “representatives” should have participated in the lobbying campaign, but “unfortunately most of our representatives in European countries preferred to devote time to their personal projects or their family matters.”  Morocco was on the ball The separatist outlet said that Morocco took advantage of Polisario’s absence to mobilize its diplomatic efforts in favor of Moroccan interests.  The representatives of the front will not persuade the EU to abandon its  interests over allegations that Morocco “exploits” the natural resources of Western Sahara. EU representatives have already surveyed the benefits of the agreement for local Sahrawis and the development of the region from income generated from both deals. Sahrawis petitioned in favor of the agreements, emphasizing the importance of the agreements for the development of the southern provinces. In addition to the EU’s approval of the agreement, Morocco has been firm that it will not allow any institution to challenge its sovereignty over Western Sahara. Throughout negotiations, the North African country said it would not sign if the agreement contained unfriendly language about its territorial integrity projects. Futuro Sahara concluded its editorial by urging the front not to limit its “war” against Morocco by complaining about natural resources.  It is a “mistake that has not yet produced tangible results.” Algeria also criticized the EU decision to adopt the agriculture agreement. Algerian state-owned news agency APS quoted an Algerian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, who said that the vote was a “genuine crime.” The Algerian source said that the vote is also a “violation” of the Court of Justice’s ruling, which stated that EU deals with Morocco were invalid if they included Western Sahara.

Rabat – The International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics (IFFHS) has ranked Morocco’s Botola Pro football league the 27th best among world football leagues.  Botola Pro is Morocco’s primary football competition in which 16 teams contest. Raja de Casablanca (RCA) and Wydad de Casablanca (WAC) are the league’s most prominent teams, having won several national and continental titles. In the top 10 rankings, Spain’s La Liga maintained first place for the ninth year in a row, ahead of England’s premier league which stayed in second place. The top 10 was rounded out by the Brazilian league, the Colombian league, the Italian Serie A, the Argentinian league, France’s Ligue 1, Germany’s Bundesliga, the Scottish league, and the Portuguese league.

Rabat – CCTV has captured footage of a malicious attack on Moroccan Muslims on December 30, 2018, near Brussels. The footage shows a middle-aged woman and her daughter, carrying shopping bags and walking down the street when a hooded passerby punches the mother’s face and then flees.  The woman could be seen screaming and falling to the ground in panic until a passing car stopped. The driver checked on the woman, who seemingly started to describe the attack. The Belgian news outlet La Capitale reported that the victim is a 47-year-old woman named Fatiha, of Moroccan origin. Fatiha is now calling on Belgian authorities to find her attacker and bring him to justice.  Fatiha also told La Capitale that her attacker was carrying a taser. Police have yet to find the suspect. The video of the attack has gone viral, sparking anger and condemnation on social media, with commenters  deeming the attack “a shameful act of Islamophobia.” Brussels has become notorious for Islamophobic attacks, especially against Muslim women who wear headscarves. In 2017, 76 percent of Islamophobic attacks in Belgium targeted women, according to data gathered from victims by a local anti-Islamophobia association. One of the most disturbing manifestations of Islamophobia in Europe emerged in March 2018, when hundreds of letters were anonymously sent to citizens in the UK, calling for “Punish a Muslim Day.” The identical letters encouraged people to carry out violence against Muslims.  After a long investigation, police determined the letters came from David Parnham, a UK national, whom police arrested in June. Police found Parnham’s fingerprints on the letters. The letters were part of a larger campaign carried out over two years in which Parham also orchestrated a bomb threat and mailed white powder, treated as a poisonous substance, to public figures, such as Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Theresa May.

Rabat – After failing to secure enough votes in the European Parliament to cancel the EU-Morocco fisheries and agriculture agreements, the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) has resorted to the Security Council. The official news agency of the separatist group reported that the self-styled Polisario representative to the UN, Sidi Mohammed Ammar, sent a letter to “Ambassador José Singer Weisinger, Special Envoy of the Dominican Republic to the Security Council, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the Council for this month.” The separatist group said that the letter aims to “draw the attention of the members of the United Nations Security Council to the serious threat posed by the EU’s attempts” to include the southern provinces in the agreements. The front claimed that the agreements might hinder the UN-led political process to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara conflict. In a post published after the adoption of the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement, the front described the EU decision as “illegal.” The EU decided to approve the inclusion of Western Sahara in both agreements, frustrating Polisario and its supporter Algeria.  The EU approved the agreements after a series of negotiations between Brussels and Rabat.  Polisario’s letter to the Security Council is not a surprise to Morocco because Polisario has previously filed several complaints at the European Court of Justice (EJC). The EJC ruled in February 2018 that the fisheries deal between the EU and Morocco is valid as long as does not include Western Sahara and its waters. The Moroccan government, however, responded that Morocco would not cooperate with Brussels if the agreements did not include the region. In an interview with Moroccan television channel 2M  last year, Morocco’s Minister of Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch said that the government is ready to suspend the agreements if the ECJ’s verdict affected Morocco’s sovereignty. “Morocco does not need the €40 million that the European Union would pay to Morocco in exchange for allowing European fishermen [to operate in Moroccan waters]. There are agreements amounting to €35 billion, all of which are in favor of the EU,” the official said. Akhannouch reiterated Morocco’s sovereignty, saying if the EU offered a “positive interaction that meets Morocco’s conditions, we will work together, if not, we will abandon the agreement without any problem.” The European Union adopted the agriculture agreement on January 16, deeming the ECJ not to have authority over trade agreements. After the adoption, the EU’s High Representative Federica Mogherini arrived in Morocco to meet Moroccan senior officials.  Mogherini also met King Mohammed VI. During her meeting with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, Mogherini said that Rabat and Brussels are aspiring to make a qualitative leap in their ties to build a regional partnership, particularly in the Mediterranean, the Arab world, and Africa. She added that Morocco has been a “strategic partner of the EU for 50 years.”

Rabat – A terrorist attack against the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) killed 10 Chadian “blue helmet” peacekeepers on Sunday in the mission’s camp in Aguelhok, northern Mali, UN News reported. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack which killed 10 and injured at least 25 others, in a statement his spokesperson gave on January 20. “MINUSMA forces responded robustly and a number of assailants were killed,” reads the statement. Guterres expressed “his heartfelt condolences to the Government of Chad, and the families and loved ones of the deceased.” The Secretary-General “wishes a swift recovery to the injured and pays tribute to the dedication and courage of the men and women serving in MINUSMA at great personal risk and sacrifice.”  Je condamne l’attaque contre @UN_MINUSMA à Aguelhok, #Kidal. 10 casques bleus tchadiens ont été tués et &gt;25 blessés. Sincères condoléances au Gouv. du #Tchad et aux familles des victimes. Les auteurs répondront devant la justice. Nous continuerons à soutenir la paix au #Mali. https://t.co/BnpPUf4K6h — Jean-Pierre Lacroix (@Lacroix_UN) January 20, 2019 
MINUSMA is considered the UN’s most dangerous peacekeeping mission. The UN established MINUSMA in April 2013 to stabilize Mali after Tuareg rebels attempted a coup in 2012. Over 170 “blue helmets”  have died during the mission out of a force of 15,000. Following the Sunday attack, Guterres called on the Malian authorities and the signatory armed groups to the peace agreement to “spare no effort in identifying the perpetrators.” The UN Security Council also condemned the attack and called on the Malian government to investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice.  The members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest terms the attack against the camp of MINUSMA in #Aguelhok, which resulted in 10 peacekeepers from #Chad killed and several others injured, in spite of the robust response from MINUSMA 👉https://t.co/oAKsSvXuRY pic.twitter.com/hc6AMHGGhJ — MINUSMA (@UN_MINUSMA) January 20, 2019   Recalling that attacks targeting the UN peacekeepers “may constitute war crimes under international law,” the UN Secretary-General affirmed that “such acts will not diminish the resolve of the United Nations to continue supporting the people and Government of Mali in their efforts to build peace and stability in the country.” The MINUSMA chief, Mahamat Saleh Annadif, strongly denounced the attack, saying, “This complex and cowardly attack shows how determined terrorists are to sow chaos.” The attack, added Annadif, “requires a robust, immediate and coordinated response from all the forces to destroy the threat of terrorism in the Sahel.” In addition to MINUSMA, two European Union missions, EUCAP Sahel Mali and EUTM Mali, are also undertaking peace operations in Mali.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch spoke at the Global Forum for Food and Agriculture (GFFA) on Saturday in Berlin about the potential of digitizing Moroccan agriculture.

Akhannouch said Morocco has made progress, including using satellite imagery, the internet, and mobile phones in agriculture. Morocco’s agricultural products are sold in France and elsewhere but “Morocco should double down on efforts to promote them in the demanding German market,” he added. 
Agriculture digitization is a priority in the Ministry of Agriculture’s strategy, he said, citing the 2017 World Bank study on farming digitization in Morocco as supporting this trend.   Fruits and vegetables make up 90% of Moroccan agricultural exports, according to the agriculture ministry. The European Parliament passed the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement on January 16. 
The 11th GFFA took place in Berlin from January 17 to 19 and discussed the subject “Agriculture goes digital – Smart solutions for future farming.”

Rabat – The Danish Skako Vibration company concluded a deal to supply Morocco’s OCP, one of the world’s largest phosphate producers and exporters, with a “line of scrubbing equipment for a phosphate mining plant in Morocco.” The order is worth more than $3.8 million and “includes a large drum washer and a big dewatering vibratory screen to dilute and clean phosphate slurry which is transported by pipeline from the mining site to the port of shipment,” Skako said in a statement January 21. The Denmark-based company also provided OCP with such machines two years ago. The managing director of SKAKO Vibration, Lionel Girieud, said the type of rotating drum washer OCP will receive “is one of the largest drums of its category in the world.” “I am very happy that OCP has chosen to renew their cooperation with SKAKO once again. This project is included in OCP’s investment plan to increase its production.” According to Girieud, OCP will purchase two other scrubbing lines and install them at the same mining site in upcoming  years. Skako Vibration has a “strong focus on expanding in Morocco to support our significant growth within supplying to the phosphate mining sector,” according to the statement. Skako Vibration is one of the two divisions in the SKAKO Group, a Danish company founded in 1963..  Skako Vibration is a leading European producer of vibratory feeding, conveying, and screening equipment with main markets in the EU and North Africa. It operates in the automotive, the mining and the phosphate mining sectors and has its production facilities based in Faaborg in Denmark and Strasbourg in France.  Morocco’s OCP Group is a state-owned company which holds 75 percent of the world’s phosphate reserves. The company develops precision agriculture techniques to help farmers improve the quality and yield of their crops.

Rabat – The US Meat Export Federation (USMEF) is inspecting the Moroccan market after the Moroccan government decided to allow US beef imports. According to Feedstuffs, US export companies are already starting to explore the market. The USMEF representative in Africa, Monty Brown, visited Morocco in mid-December to meet with various companies in the Moroccan beef market. “We had meetings in Casablanca and Rabat with seven different companies, and the initial reaction from the majority of the buyers is that they are very interested in U.S. beef,” the representative said. Brown also said that “the outlook for U.S. beef and beef variety meat in Morocco is exciting. They are open to all products, and there’s a willingness to do business there. We saw a strong level of genuine commercial interest.” He added that the US export federation will “be able to do a lot more volume with Choice cuts because of the price differential they will offer. We know that Choice beef offers a superb eating experience, and we expect strong interest once it is introduced to more consumers in Morocco.” Brown said that more than 6,660 metric tons of US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Prime and Choice beef can be sold in Morocco at zero duty in accordance with the 2019 high-quality beef quota. In December,  Representative of the US Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer said, “new access to the Moroccan market for beef and beef products is an important step in ensuring that American farmers and ranchers can continue to expand their exports of U.S. agricultural products.”  US Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue asserted, “American beef is the best in the world, and once Moroccans get a taste of it, they’ll surely want more.”  The USDA announced in December that Moroccan imports of agricultural products from the US exceeded $512 million as of November last year. The Trump administration estimates the North African country will  represent an $80 million market for US beef and beef products.

US President Donald Trump told the 100th Annual Convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation on January 14 that three countries have opened their markets to new US exports. “India and Morocco have opened their markets to our poultry exports. We do so much for them, it’s incredible,” Trump said. “Japan opened its market to US exports of potatoes from Idaho and lamb from the great State of Texas,” he added.

“[Argentina] needed something. I said, ‘You have to open it up to pork,’ and they said, ‘Okay.’ I said, ‘Why didn’t you do it before?’ They said, ‘Nobody ever asked us.’ A lot of it is that. You would be amazed. Nobody ever asked us,” the US president narrated.    The poultry agreement reverses Morocco’s previous ban on US poultry for “food safety concerns,” although the two countries have a Free Trade Agreement.  The Morocco-US Free Trade Agreement (USMFTA), which applied to agriculture and related products, came into force in January 2006.  
In December, the US Department of Agriculture and the Office of the US TradeRepresentative said Morocco was open to US beef exports for the first time.

Last week, Moroccan High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) Ahmed Lahlimi Alami advised Moroccans to consume more domestic products, expecting economic stagnation in 2019. Lahlimi invited Morocco to find inspiration in Donald Trump’s economic policies and “patriotism.”

Rabat – Moroccan-Dutch footballer Ismail H’Maidat has been acquitted of five robbery charges after spending nine months behind bars. A Dutch court initially sentenced H’Maidat to 3 years and 10 months in prison. The prosecutor charged the 23-year-old with carrying out five armed robberies near Turnhout, Belgium, on December 31, 2017 and on January 6, 2018. H’Maidat and his accomplice allegedly stole cash from betting shops, a supermarket, and a gas station. On March 13, police arrested him after tracing CCTV footage, using license plate recognition, and searching phone records. A Court of Appeals in Belgium since cleared H’Maidat from robbery charges, setting him free. The news broke via the player’s Instagram account two days ago.  H’Maidat begin his senior football career with Anderlecht in 2014 before heading to Italy to sign with Brescia the following year and then with Roma in 2016. Since then, he transferred to two Italian clubs while on loan before joining Portuguese club Olhanense. The footballer is a notorious troublemaker.

Rabat – Spanish Minister of Agriculture Luis Planas said that the recent adoption of the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement by the European Parliament demonstrates “the desire to build strong and stable relations between the two parties.” He added that the agreement is a “very” important action that is “a green light for the marketing of agricultural products. Planas commented on the agriculture agreement at the International Forum on Food and Agriculture as part of the International Green Week in Berlin. Planas said that the adoption was “very positive.” He said he hopes that the new fisheries agreement between Morocco and the EU will “follow the same path in the weeks or months to come.” He also expressed hope that the EU-Morocco fisheries committees would finalize the fisheries agreement in the coming weeks or months. On Monday, Morocco and the EU signed an agreement setting out the conditions of access for European vessels in Moroccan waters and laying down requirements for sustainable fishing. In November 2018, Planas met with Spanish MEPs and the European Parliament’s Agriculture and Fisheries Commissions to ask them to speed up the ratification of the agreement so that it could be approved in the first quarter of 2019 to allow Spanish fishermen into Moroccan waters. The minister told the press he received “positive responses” from the MEPs concerning the implementation of the agreement.Several members of the European Parliament sought to oppose the adoption of the agreements, including Paloma Lopez, an MEP from Spain’s Izquierda Unida (United Left) Party and a vocal pro-Polisario voice. The MEP was reportedly leading a campaign to hamper the signing of the finalization phase of the agreements. Lopez also asked for support from other MEPs to stand in the way of “direct adoption” of the agreement when the EU Parliament met last week to vote on the issue.

Rabat – A year after Morocco adopted the flexible exchange rate for dirham currency, the government is planning to stop the system this year due to the economic crisis resulting in public debt. Bloomberg quoted two officials saying that the government is likely to wait until “at least 2020 before considering further easing their hold on the currency.” Speaking on the condition of anonymity, one official said that the system might result in further crisis as it might hurt foreign currency reserves due to an “unpredictable global trade environment and no expected pick-up commerce with major partners in Europe.” Debt is becoming a major issue in Morocco. Several officials and reports warned the government that debt is  weighing down Morocco’s economic growth. A report from the Department of Treasury and External Finances (DTFE) in December 2018 said that the treasury debt had reached MAD 715 billion by the end of September 2018, up 4.6 percent from September 2017. The president of Morocco’s Court of Auditors, Driss Jettou,  also expressed concern about the Treasury’s debt. In a parliamentary meeting held in October 2018, Jettou said that the Treasury’s debt reached MAD 692 billion at the end of 2017. Recent statements from the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) also shared not so reassuring statistics about Morocco’s Gross Domestic Growth (GDP) and public debts. President of HCP Ahmed Lahlimi said that Morocco’s economy will experience a slowdown in growth as the economy is expected to grow at 2.9 percent in 2019.   Commenting on public debt, Lahlimi also said that Morocco’s economy will be weighed down by debt in 2019. Lahlimi said that the overall public debt of the economy will increase to 82.5 percent of GDP, slightly up from 82.2 percent in 2018.

Rabat – French-Moroccan Nordine Oubaali defeated his opponent Rau’Shee Warren on Sunday, winning the WBC World Bantamweight title. The 32-year-old of Moroccan descent was explosive starting from the second round when his constant feints and lunges allowed him to advance on Warren in term of points. Although Oubaali’s aggressive style but counters from Warren badly hurt him. The end of the seventh round saw intense punches exchange from both boxers. But, Oubaali’s punches were better, making it hard for Warren to get back in the game. For Warren, the Las Vegas game was an opportunity to get revenge on Oubaali. The two boxers already fought six-and-a-half-years ago at the 2012 Summer Olympics.   Through this win, Oubaali, who turned pro in 2014, adds another achievement to his undefeated professional boxing record of 15 fights, including 11 knockouts.

Rabat  – High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) Ahmed Lahlimi Alami stated that Morocco’s economy will experience stagnation due to declining investment, a decrease in employment opportunities, and a lower national saving rate in 2019. According to the official, Morocco’s economic growth will stand at 2.9 percent this year, against an expected  3 percent in 2018. At  a press conference held in Casablanca on January 16, Lahlimi warned that debt is still a major issue in the country. He said that debt is becoming heavier, emphasizing that the country must try to “increase national savings through good support and a good distribution of household income, support for the activities of SMES (small business and medium-sized enterprises).” The official also advised Moroccans to consume more domestic products, inviting Moroccan investors to invest more in Morocco and to value Morocco’s investments in infrastructure. Prior to the press conference, HCP issued a statement raising  concerns regarding the financial situation of Moroccan families, unemployment, and families’ abilities to save their finances. HCP said that only 4.44 percent of Moroccans can save part of their income. To prevail through the economic crisis, Lahlimi suggests that Morocco should be inspired by Trump’s economic policies and “patriotism.” According to Lahlimi, US President Donald Trump  and his economic policies “gives us a good example in terms of economic patriotism.” He said that the example should inspire Morocco for the sake of its national economy. Despite the economic crisis this year, the African Development Bank (AfDB), forcasts  a growth of Morocco’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2020. AfDB said that Morocco’s GDP will grow by 4 percent in 2020. The medium-term economic outlook projects a continuing decline in real GDP growth, to 2.9 percent in 2019, before a rebound to 4.0 percent in 2020. The projected slowdown in 2019 is attributable to a slight decline in primary sector value added [production],” said a report by the bank on the “African Economic Outlook – 2019” presented on Thursday in Abidjan.

Rabat – A boat carrying 53 irregular migrants has gone missing somewhere in the Mediterranean sea between Morocco and Spain. The boat carried initially 54 migrants and went off from Morocco’s northern city of Nador towards the Andalusian coast on Sunday, January 12, Spanish media reported yesterday.

Rabat – The European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development Phil Hogan celebrated the adoption of the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement during his participation in the Berlin International Green on January 18. During the inauguration of the Moroccan Pavilion, Hogan said,  “I am delighted to be at the Moroccan pavilion with the Moroccan Minister of Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries  , Aziz Akhannouch, to celebrate the excellent result obtained following the adoption by the European Parliament this week of the agricultural agreement between Morocco and the EU.” He added that the agreement is able to inject a new dynamic into the bilateral partnership between the two parties. On Wednesday, the agreement received 444 votes at the European Union. After his talks with Akhannouch,  Hogan said that the EU aspires “to maintain very good relations with Morocco in other areas in the years to come.” Following the adoption of the agreement, the EU High Representative Federica Mogherini said that the new partnership will bring Morocco and the EU closer because it forms a measure to continue Morocco’s reform of the 2011 Constitution. In addition to benefiting both parties, the agreement also deterred Polisario’s allegations that Morocco “exploit natural resources” in the region. Morocco and the EU also signed the fisheries agreement on Monday

Rabat – The Moroccan Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (MACBI), a boycott movement, has called for the boycott of French singer Enrico Macias’s concert in Casablanca scheduled for next month.  In a statement on January 13, the MACBI described Macias’s presence on stage at Megarama on February 14 a “shame and an insult to the Casablanca public.” The French singer of Algerian Jewish descent who “likes to present himself as an artist for peace” is “in fact a strong defender” of the Israeli occupation of Palestine and especially the Israeli defense army, Tsahal, reads the statement. In 1980, former UN secretary-general Kurt Waldheim Macias’s named Macias “Singer of Peace” after he donated one of his songs’ proceeds to the UNICEF. 
MACBI stated that Macias is giving his blood, sweat and tears to the association Migdal, which supports the the Israel border police, Magav. Magav, according to boycott movement, is “known for its war crimes against the civilian population.” The MACAB’s statement, which the Moroccan-Jewish human rights activist Sion Assidon published on his Facebook page, cited some of Macias pro-Israeli statement he gave in French more than 10 years ago. “From the beginning of my life, I have always devoted my body and soul to the State of Israel but primarily to Tsahal, but now to Magav … I do not do this neither for my advertisement, nor for my career, nor anything at all … I always gave for the State of Israel, for Tsahal, Magav, and for Migdal. Believe me, that’s the miracle of Israel.”  The Israeli defense ministry decorated Macias in 2006 for “his support for the State of Israel and its army throughout his career,” noted MACAB. Macias’s real name is Gaston Ghrenassia. He is a songwriter and musician who was born in December 1938 in Constantine. Macias left Algeria with his wife in July 1961 to live in France. His most well-known songs are “J’ai quitté mon pays” (I left my country) and “Les filles de mon pays” (Girls of my country), which he sang in the 1960s.

Two weeks after the US House of Representatives adopted a Morocco-hostile budget bill, American lawmakers in both house of Congress moved to water down the first draft’s language, making the latest bill lean more towards traditional US-Morocco relations. In an unprecedented move that made waves in Washington-Rabat policy circles earlier this month, the US House of representative opted for a 2019 budget bill that considered Western Sahara as a separate political entity in terms of US financial aids. Overtly separating the Morocco and Western Sahara sections in what used to combined sections in previous budget years, the draft bill was interpreted as a diplomatic victory for Algeria and the Polisario Front. But that first draft had to be adopted by both houses of Congress. And now both the Senate and the House have chosen to considerably alter the language adopted a fortnight ago, tacitly reaffirming Washington’s support to its Moroccan ally. In the latest version, which was obtained by Morocco World News, Western Sahara is an integral part of US aids to Morocco, suggesting a reversal in diplomatic gains in what may have boiled down to two weeks of relentless back-door negotiations between US and Moroccan diplomats. Just a week after news emerged of the House of Representatives’ unprecedented move, Moustapha El Khalfi, the spokesperson of the Moroccan government, held a press conference in Rabat to “clarify” and “reassure,” referring to Morocco’s position. Like Morocco’s permanent ambassador to the UN, Omar Hilale, El Khalfi said that Morocco was clear in its commitment to its strategic partnership with the US. Section (g) of the latest bill, referring to Morocco, reads from page 737-738: “Funds appropriated under title III of this Act shall be made available for assistance for the Western Sahara: Provided, that not later than 90 days after enactments of this Act and prior to the obligation of such funds, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the USAID Administrator, shall consult with the Committees on Appropriations on the proposed use of such funds.” But the bill’s more Morocco-leaning language came in section (h), page 738, which dealt with “refugee assistance in North Africa.” While the passage made no overt mention of the Tindouf camps, its description of the situation of “North Africa’s refugees” in terms of food and financial assistance implicitly echoed Morocco’s position on international humanitarian aids to refugees in the Tindouf camps. In recent months and years, Morocco has strenuously maintained that Algeria and the Polisario front “manipulate” the international opinion on the Western Sahara issue by “concealing the reality” in Tindouf camps and holding back “real statistics” regarding the use of humanitarian assistance. A number of reports have buttressed Rabat’s claims by accusing the Polisario Front’s leadership of embezzlement and mismanagement of aid funds and humanitarian assistance to the Tindouf camps refugees. However, Washington has traditionally steered clear of taking an official stance on the embezzlement controversies. But the latest 2019 budget plan clearly mentions that the US Secretary of State should consult with relevant authorities’ to ensure that aids and humanitarian assistance reach their rightful recipients. “Not later than 45 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, after consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Executive Director of the Word Food Program, shall submit a report to the committees on Appropriations describing steps taken to monitor delivery of humanitarian assistance provided for refugees in North Africa, including any steps taken to ensure that all vulnerable refugees are receiving that assistance,” the section read. The bill is set to be a breath of fresh air in Moroccan diplomatic circles, having registered another morale boost this week. Earlier this week, the European Parliament adopted the Morocco-EU agriculture agreement in spite of loud protestations from pro-Polisario circles within the European body.

Rabat – Moroccan passport holders are now exempt from getting a visa beforehand in 67 countries.

Rabat – Speaker of the House of Representatives Habib El Malki represented King Mohammed VI at the inauguration ceremony of the new Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina, today. The King expressed his congratulations to Rajoelina and best wishes for success in fulfilling his mission, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. “I remember the visit that I made, in November 2016, to your beautiful country, where a warm welcome was extended to me,” the King said. The visit, added the monarch, was an opportunity to meet a “brotherly people closely linked to the history of the Royal family and the Moroccan people.” Madagascar was the in-exile home for the Moroccan royal family in the 1950s when Sultan Mohammed V, the King’s grandfather, was forced out of Morocco by French colonial rulers. The sultan spent two years in Madagascar with his family, including King Mohammed VI’s father, King Hassan II. Rajoelina took the oath of office today in Antananarivo before nine judges of the High Constitutional Court, Africa News reported. “This is a new page in the nation’s history and it is hoped that in five years’ time, national unity will be strengthened,” said Court President Jean Eric Rakotoarisoa. For the first time in the island’s history, a transfer of power was made Friday between  Madagascar’s outgoing president Hery Rajaonarimampianina and Rajoelina. Both presidents had a fierce struggle in the second round of the presidential election held on December 19 last year.

Rabat – President Emmanuel Macron has proposed Roch-Olivier Maistre, a senior civil servant and magistrate at the Court of Auditors, to head the High Audiovisual Council (CSA), Macron’s office announced on Friday.

The Elysee chose Maistre, the former cultural adviser to President Jacques Chirac, to succeed Olivier Schrameck.

Maistre, a former student of the National Administration School (ENA), was born in Meknes, Morocco, in November 1955. He is a magistrate at the Court of Auditors. 
Maistre is a “media and culture connoisseur,” according to Le Figaro.

According to a survey by the French Institute of Public Opinion, there were 3.2 million people of French North African ancestry, or “pieds-noirs” like Maistre, in 2012. 

The name “pieds-noirs” refers to the French from Algeria and, by extension, the French of European descent who settled or were born in French North Africa before independence.

By Adil Bentahar Rabat – The Moroccan Center for Civic Education will host the 33rd International Congress for School Effectiveness and Improvement (ICSEI) in Marrakech next year, January 6-10. The Moroccan delegation rejoiced at receiving the honor of hosting the world-class educational event when the closing ceremony of the 32nd ICSEI announced it in Stavanger, Norway on January 12. The first event of its kind in the MENA region and Africa, ICSEI will be hosted in partnership with the Ministry of Education and the Council of the Marrakech-Safi region.  ICSEI brings together educational experts, policy makers, researchers, and practitioners from the five major continents to learn from each other about practices and success stories that could benefit students all over the world. The Marrakech ICSEI will focus on “Education, Youth Empowerment, and Sustainable Development: Collaboration between the Global North and South   to Improve Education Quality.” After gathering 836 participants from 85 countries in Norway, ICSEI-Morocco is expected to host about 1,000 participants during the second week of 2020. ICSEI 2020 opportunely coincides with Morocco’s 2015-2030 Strategic Vision. The organizers hope that the event will encourage stakeholders to reflect on their current practices to improve learning conditions and form strong collaborations between the Global North and South.  Hosting the 33rd ICSEI in Morocco may turn over a new leaf in the history of educational relations among the countries of the North and the South. ICSEI-Morocco could serve as a unique opportunity for the kingdom and the Global South to engage in new conversations on school improvement that leverage the communication tools of the 21st century. It will also expand the conversations between industrialized nations and developing countries on what it means to provide high quality education that promotes cognitive skills as well as socio-emotional competencies.   Having previously met the ICSEI 2020 team and shown tremendous support for the event, the Moroccan Minister of Education Said Amzazi, in a video recording, delivered a speech welcoming ICSEI to Morocco. He described Morocco as a land for quality dialogue. The vice-president of the council of the Marrakech-Safi region delivered a similar speech highlighting the imperative of educational reform and welcoming delegates to Marrakech.  ICSEI Morocco will enable participants to interact by offering translations in French and Arabic and inviting Arabic and French speakers to submit papers in their languages.

Rabat – Morocco “is betting on digital transformation to achieve a qualitative leap in economic and social development,” Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said Friday in Rabat. El Othmani, who was chairing the second board of directors of the digital development agency, said King Mohammed VI has kept insisting through his speeches on the need to take advantage of information technology to accelerate reaching national development goals, according to a statement El Othmani’s department issued after the meeting. The meeting aimed to evaluate the digital development agency’s work a year after its launch and discuss the agency’s future contribution to the national digital agenda. The head of government stressed that “Morocco needs, more than ever, an integrated vision that reflects the envisaged digital transformation in the country, guarantees the maximum use of digital technologies, and offers more comfort to citizens in their relations with the public administration.” The digital transformation will increase the competitiveness of companies especially in the field of the digital economy, he added. El Othmani mentioned some important achievements of the government in the digital sector such as electronic tax reporting for large and medium-sized businesses, the digitization of customs procedures, and mobile payment through a public-private partnership. The government official emphasized the need for an “updated and integrated digital strategy” by developing digital infrastructure, a training program for human resources in the digital sector, and adequate legal texts. At the end of the meeting, the board adopted the agency’s action plan and its 2019 budget, approved by the audit committee and the investment committee. Several ministers attended the agency’s meeting, including the education minister, the industry minister, the delegate minister in charge of the national defense administration, and the delegate minister to the interior minister.  The secretaries general of the relevant sectors, directors of public institutions and companies, and some private sector representatives also took part in the meeting.

Rabat – The Moroccan Coalition Against the Death Penalty has reiterated its call to the government to remove the death penalty from the country’s Penal Code.  During a meeting with his general assembly on Friday in Rabat in the presence of justice minister Mohamed Aujjar, the coalition’s coordinator, Abderrahim El Jamii, stressed the need to“fight” for human rights and abolish the death penalty. El Jamii urged Aujjar to join the Moroccans calling for abolition, while emphasizing that the minister’s attendance at the meeting gave hope and opened a new “political and human rights chapter.” El Jamii, on behalf of the coalition, pointed out the incompatibility between Article 20 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to life to all human beings and the Penal Code, which allows the death penalty. Although still an option, Morocco has maintained a de facto moratorium on the death penalty since 1993. The new president of the National Council of Human Rights (CNDH), Amina Bouayach, strongly criticized the government’s “indecisiveness” towards abolishing the death penalty.  She said that “there is a big hesitation” on the state’s part to abolish the penalty and called for “a national dialogue” to make a final decision. Morocco had six chances prior to 2018 to join the UN moratorium banning the practice, but each time the country chose to abstain from the vote, adding to activists’ frustration. For his part, Aujjar revealed that the state is gradually showing an inclination toward ending the death penalty. “Morocco is not far from joining the growing global initiatives to abolish the death penalty,” he stated. Calls for the death penalty for Imlil murder suspects Ahmed Chaouki Benyoub, the minister delegate at the National Council of Human Rights, drew attention to the case of the murder of two Scandinavian tourists in Morocco in December. Benyoub said that in the wake of the terror attack against the tourists, very few people would be against giving the murderers the death penalty, if the government were to take an opinion poll. However, Benyoub expressed his readiness for inclusive dialogue on abolition. Following the brutal murder of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway, in the Atlas Mountains near Mount Toubkal, at the hands of radicalized terror suspects, many Moroccans called for the death penalty. The Moroccan Organization of Human Rights (OMDH) and the World Coalition Against the Death Penalty (WCADP) have been urging Morocco to join an international agreement ending capital punishment. Moreover, the Swedish and Norwegian ambassadors to Morocco conveyed their full support for the coalition’s efforts to abolish the death penalty, which “does not only violate human rights but also the individual’s dignity.”

Rabat – US lawmakers are pushing for Washington to take a firmer stance on China’s controversial treatment of Uighur Muslims. Rabat – Rekindling debates on a damning bill for Beijing, the US Senate on Thursday put on the floor a bill that would see Washington impose a host of sanctions on Beijing over its “discriminatory” measures against Chinese Muslims.  The Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, as the bill is called, entails “creation of positions within the State Department, FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies to study issues related to the ongoing internment program,” the Washington Post reported yesterday.  While the move comes amid tense China-US relations, particularly in the domains of trade, technology, and security intelligence, the bill is not without precedence. According to the Post’s report, a similar move was initiated in November amid global outcry over China’s crackdown on Uighur Muslims in the country’s Xinjiang region. But that first move did not succeed because the bill “was not taken in the Senate before the congressional session ran out.” While “pressuring” China toward more decent treatment of Xinjiang’s Uighurs, the move also entails monitoring by the FBI of US-residing Chinese Muslims.  The goal is to investigate China’s “intimidation” outreach in the US and assess whether and how Uighurs living in the US have been “intimidated… [by China’s] globe-spanning efforts over the last two years to repatriate them for indoctrination.” Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Robert Menendez of New Jersey are the two driving forces behind the revival of the bill. Both senators said it is about the US holding China more accountable for its numerous breaches of geopolitical norms, especially on trade and human rights. “The time to act is now,” said Rubio. Also included in the bill are proposals to issue travel and financial bans on Chinese officials linked to the Uighur detention centers. Senator Menendez said the US has a solemn obligation to stand up to China’s “autocratic regime.” He said, “I am proud to help lead this important effort so we don’t abandon our values and simply turn a blind eye as a million Muslims are unjustly imprisoned and forced into labor camps by an autocratic Chinese regime.” Making Islam compatible with Chinese identity Since August 2018, China has faced global outcry for rounding up over a million Uighurs and detaining them in what the Chinese regime calls “counter-extremism centers” or “political reeducation camps.” The UN has denounced Beijing’s “arbitrary” and “mass detention” of thousands on the basis that their religion makes them “enemies of the state.”  Some critics went as far as suggesting that China was “treating Islam like a mental illness.” Such criticism pointed out the Chinese regime’s “official” take on religion—especially Islam—as a venue for extremism and anti-communist indoctrination. Meanwhile, Beijing has constantly sniffed at the outcry. China says the condemnations of its move are “biased” and stem from a West-driven “hysteria” only seeking to interfere with the country’s internal affairs.  Beijing maintains that what the UN’s and other equally “biased” reports have called a crackdown or mass detention are in fact “education camps” for Uighurs to make their religion “more compatible” with Chinese identity.  Earlier this month, China passed a law that sought to make Islam more Chinese. According to Chinese officials, the law envisions “guiding Islam” by rethinking how it is practiced in a Chinese context and making it “more compatible with socialism.”

Rabat – Having arrived in Marrakesh on Tuesday, Gianni Infantino said that the verdict regarding a joint bid between Spain, Portugal, and Morocco for the 2030 World Cup will be announced in four years. On the sidelines of the FIFA Football Summit held in Marrakech between 15  and 17 of January, Infantino said that FIFA has certainly opened the door to multiple requests as one country cannot host the event. Quoted by Moroccan television channel Arryadia, Infantino said that he is not aware of a trio bid between Spain, Portugal and Morocco. He said that the bodies of the international football organization are totally focusing on the 2020 World Cup in Qatar. Infantino said that the FIFA congress in Marrakech was an opportunity to discuss major topics related to international football, including the video assistant referee (VAR), the 20222 World Cup and women’s football.  Infantino also commended Morocco’s efforts to develop African football. Morocco is yet revealed whether it will bid for the 2030 World Cup in a solo document or a joint bid. Spain, however, proposed a possible cross-federation bid between Africa and Europe. During his first official visit to Morocco in November 2018, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez said, “We are launching a joint message, which is that this will be a bid between two continents. The King of Morocco is receptive and we’re going to work on it with Portugal. We are very excited about it.”  He said that the Moroccan government and King Mohammed VI welcomed the idea. Morocco announced its determination to bid for the 2030 World Cup after its defeat last summer against the US-Canada-Mexico United 2026 bid.  This will be Morocco’s sixth attempt to host the competition.

Rabat – French cold chain logistics network Sofrilog will settle in Casablanca through a construction of a tri-temperature platform in the region by 2020, the company announced in a statement January 15. After its success as a recognized national network of supply chain professionals, Sofrilog network chose Morocco as its first international location, the statement said.

Rabat – A French court in Nanterre, near Paris, has said that a French company did not make its case against the late Saudi Prince Saud Al Faisal. The company, Atyla, accused Al Faisal of commissioning adult movies without paying for them. The court ruled that Atyla did not prove the presence of a contract with SCI Bugeaud, owned by several members of the Saudi royal family. Al Faisal, who died in 2015, had served as foreign minister of Saudi Arabia. Quoting the court’s decision, AFP reported that Atyla “does not produce any contractual document justifying that the late Saudi Prince ordered services of a pornographic nature and in particular the realization of a film of this nature.” The court sentenced Atyla to pay €5,000 in damages to SCI for reputational loss. During the trial, Atyla’s lawyer asserted that the Saudi prince asked the company to film three pornographic videos of his alleged Moroccan girlfriend. EuroNews reported that the sudden death of the prince in 2015 following a heart attack prevented payment of the dues. Atyla then asked Al Faisal’s daughters and relatives of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to pay the fees. The company accused the late prince of owing them more than €90,000. Newsweek reported in April 2018 that the only evidence of the scandal was email and mobile messages between Boyle Antolin Dugenian, an alleged personal assistant of the late prince, and Atyla’s manager, Marc Paulay. The messages about the film  include discussing the date and location of shooting and scripts. “He does not like blindfold and being tied. Make a new one,” Dugenia wrote in an alleged email “in response to a script describing the female character, played by the prince’s Moroccan friend, being tied up and blindfolded,” according to Newsweek.

“On behalf of myself and the Malaysian people, it is a great honor to award the title of Datuk to someone who has done an outstanding job for the citizens of Malaysia,” Tuanku Munawir reportedly said.

”This honour is a tribute to the special status of Mr. Hassan Ammari in the hearts of Malaysian citizens, government and people, including Moroccan students, and to the great recognition of Malaysia’s government and rulers,” a Malaysian government official reportedly said.

Rabat – During a meeting with the National Commission on Narcotic Drugs on Wednesday, Moroccan health minister Anas Doukkali said that addiction treatment units are operating in several rehabilitation centers in the nine cities of Casablanca, Rabat, Tangier, Tetouan, Marrakech, Oujda, Agadir, Fez, and Meknes. The centers have treated 27,620 drug addicts and given methadone maintenance treatment to 1,629 others dependent on heroin. The health minister did not relate the period of time in which the centers treated the individuals, but the National Program to Fight Drug Addiction was launched in 2010. There are 15 outpatient clinics for addiction treatment across the nine cities, where people addicted to various drugs can receive care, according to Doukkali. The centers also work to prevent injection drug users from transmitting diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. Doukkali emphasized that Morocco is committed, on an international level, to the fight against drug use, drug trafficking, money laundering, and terrorism.  Morocco is running the risk of becoming a “transit country for hard drugs.” Doukkali said that the role of Moroccan customs is essential in the fight against drug trafficking. In terms of drug addiction, Morocco introduced the 2025 Action Plan to make treatment equally accessible for all citizens. According to a 2017 study conducted by the Biochemistry, Nutrition and Cellular Biology Group in partnership with Casablanca’s Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, approximately 600,000 Moroccans are addicted to drugs. As many as 16,000 are addicted to hard drugs like heroin and cocaine. Drug addiction is especially prevalent among 18 to 28-year-olds. The other most common addiction is alcoholism, according to a report by the National Observatory of Drugs and Addictions (ONDA).

Rabat – The Moroccan government adopted Draft Decree 2.18.638 for applying the value added tax in the general tax code during a meeting on Thursday, according to Mustapha El Khalfi, the government spokesman. The draft law aims to speed up the processing of cases concerning the refund of value added tax by creating a simplified way to file applications for tax-exempt or suspended transactions. Article 103 of the tax code provides for the exemptions, El Khalfi added in a statement read at the end of the meeting. 
In October, the government approved the 2019 Finance Bill which reduced taxes by 2.5 percent on companies whose profits range from MAD 300 million to MAD 1 billion.

In 2017, Oxfam launched a tax justice program in an attempt to achieve just distribution of resources and fiscal transparency in Morocco.

Rabat – According to the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) Ahmed Lahlimi Alami, Morocco’s economy will be weighed down by debt in 2019. Lahlimi said that the overall public debt of the economy will increase to 82.5 percent of GDP, slightly up from 82.2 percent in 2018. According to Lahlimi, “Debt is becoming heavier and we must try to increase national savings through good support and a good distribution of household income, support for the activities of SMES (small business and medium-sized enterprises).” He added that the situation also requires the further mobilization of both Moroccan capital, administration, consumers, civil society, and businesses. Lahlimi said that Moroccans should consume more products made in Morocco. He also invited Moroccan investors to invest more in Morocco and to value Morocco’s investments in infrastructure, which increase Morocco’s attractiveness for investment. In his remarks shared on Wednesday in a press conference in Casablanca, Lahlimi predicted that the global economic situation would be marked by a slowdown in growth, investment, and demand. He foresaw instability in the capital markets in commodity prices, especially in oil, due to anticipated increases in production. According to Lahlimi, Morocco’s agricultural harvest in 2018 was bountiful, thanks to rainfall. The current season, however, has not been as auspicious after a very wet start.  “But this generous rainfall has been negatively impacted” by temperatures that were too cold and dry in December, Lahlimi said. Lahlimi added that over the past 30 years, agriculture seasons have tended to start under the same very wet conditions. He noted that HCP assumes in the projected economic 2019 budget that winter rainfall will return according to a normal season.  Lahlimi said that non-agricultural activities will continue to grow at the same pace. Inflation will be reduced to 1.2 percent from 1.7 percent in 2018, Lahlimi was quoted as saying by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). GDP growth of 2.9 percent will be driven by domestic demand, Lahlimi asserted, despite a slight downturn compared to 2018 growth. Lahlimi also expects the impact of external demand on GDP growth to remain negative, decreasing from 1 percent in 2018 to -0.8 percent in 2019 due to the gap between the growth rate of imports versus exports. HCP also estimates that the national savings will be 27.7 percent of GDP in 2019, down from 28 percent in 2018 as investments slow from 32.4 percent of GDP in 2018 to 32 percent in 2019. According to the African Development Bank (AfDB), Morocco’s GDP will grow by 4 percent in 2020. “The medium-term economic outlook projects a continuing decline in real GDP growth, to 2.9% in 2019, before a rebound to 4.0% in 2020. The projected slowdown in 2019 is attributable to a slight decline in primary sector value added [production],” said a report by the bank on the “African Economic Outlook – 2019” presented on Thursday in Abidjan. According to the report, Morocco’s economy continues to show resilience as the government’s annual“fiscal deficit, an estimated 3.9% of GDP in 2018, up from 3.7% in 2017, is expected to gradually shrink under fiscal consolidation, tax reform, the rationalization of public expenditure, and more effective collection of tax revenues.” According to the bank, Morocco has achieved remarkable economic performance over the past decade. AfDB added that “the deficit reflects primarily a rise in imports of oil and capital goods, while alleviated by tourism receipts and remittances.” The report also mentioned that Morocco’s industrial activities, including the automotive, aeronautics, and electronics industries, are contributing to Morocco’s economic growth.

Rabat – “French will remain the second language (after Arabic) in Moroccan public schools, at least throughout the next ten years,” said the country’s minister of education, Said Amzazi. During a press conference on Thursday in Rabat, Amzazi ruled out the possibility that English may soon replace French in schools. He said: “Everyone knows that science books are currently available in English more than French, and in French more than Arabic. But we teach in the French language.” Amzazi argued that if Morocco decides to embrace English textbooks while the country “possesses a human capital of teachers competent in French, it will face a shortage in qualified human capital that could not be alleviated for at least ten years from now.” Inevitably, criticism followed Amzazi’s statements, as Moroccans took to social media to argue that English should be integrated into school curricula as the first foreign language because it is viewed as the “language of globalization.” French remains the dominant foreign language, owing to 44 years of French rule from 1912 to 1956. Many Moroccans believe that the dominance of the French language in Morocco is an unwanted leftover from French colonization, demanding a change. The two official languages in Morocco are Arabic and Tamazight (Berber). More Moroccan university students want to major in English The new generation of Moroccan youth, however, are showing more interest in English than French, evident by the number of students enrolling in the English department at Moroccan universities. The former head of the English Department at Mohammed V University of Literature and Human Sciences in Rabat, Hassan Belhiah, told Morocco World News that more students seek English degrees than any other at the humanities faculty.  “We are the number one sought major. Because of that, we hold one or more diagnostic tests to select a reasonable number of students taking into consideration faculty-student ratio, class size, and available human resources,” he said. Belhiah said that in 2017, the faculty “administered two diagnostic tests to more than 1,000 students and selected 420.” Those not selected could choose another major. On the other hand, Belhiah believes that the new students’ mastery of English is not as adequate as that of students from previous generations. “I believe that the new students are not as qualified compared to previous cohorts. Although most of them seem to speak English fluently and to be digitally literate, they have severe deficiencies in academic skills, especially in reading, writing, analyzing, and synthesizing,” he explained. Belhiah’s statements reflect a study by Education First’s (EF) 2018 English Proficiency Index, which indicated that Morocco’s proficiency is considered “very low.” The country ranked 60th out of 88 countries with a score of 48.10. ‘Free education’ in Morocco equates fees In regards to free education, Amzazi explained that the government guarantees “free education throughout compulsory school years.” However, the draft law only refers to  “free registration,” for primary, secondary, and high school. “Tuition fees” for university are not included. “Our goal is to help families with limited income with the registration fees which costs MAD 100 at the beginning of the school year.” “Inscription fees will be instilled in some majors of higher public education institutions,” an official at the Ministry of Education told Morocco World News. The payment may also include other costs in universities  and other establishments of higher education, as well as “qualifying teaching” in high schools. Amzazi revealed that the government’s new “emergency program” has improved the situation in some Moroccan universities by “enabling the expansion of university spaces to alleviate crowdedness.”

Rabat – The European Union High Representative for Foreign Policy Federica Mogherini announced that Morocco will soon receive €110 million, the remainder of the €140 million fund that the EU allocated for Morocco to tackle irregular migration and to improve the management of EU-Moroccan borders in December. International news outlets quoted Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, who co-chaired a press conference with Mogherini, saying that Morocco already received the first payment of €30 million. According to Deutsche Welle, Bourita said that the EU’s financial support is “part of a global Moroccan strategy, including the fight against irregular migration.” Mogherini announced, “The EU is ready to support the kingdom, especially in terms of national security.” The EU official also praised Morocco’s efforts against irregular migration, saying that more discussions should be had to allow the EU to benefit from Morocco’s expertise and experience in the field. The Moroccan government came under pressure throughout 2018 due to irregular migration. Morocco called for more aid from the EU, and Spain supported the request in the EU parliament. In December, the European Commission pledged €148 million to financially assist Morocco on the migration front, saying it was  “intensifying its support to Morocco to address irregular migration in response to increased migratory pressure along the Western Mediterranean Route.”. According to the  National Observatory of Migration,  Moroccan authorities thwarted 88,761 irregular migration attempts in 2018. Nearly 80 percent of the migrants (70,571) were not Moroccan.

Rabat – Moroccan authorities thwarted 88,761 irregular migration attempts in 2018. Nearly 80 percent of the migrants (70,571) were foreigners, according to the National Observatory of Migration. The number represents a 37 percent increase from the previous year, according to a statement issued after a migration observatory meeting on Thursday, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. The observatory, which is affiliated with the interior ministry, said that Morocco dismantled 229 trafficking networks last year. Morocco rescued 29,715 irregular migrants at sea while 5,608 chose to voluntary return to their home countries, according the statement. Last year Moroccan police police arrested 603 organizers of irregular migration networks, a sharp increase from their arrest of 294 organizers in 2017.  In July 2018, Morocco received €30 million of a €55 million fund approved by the EU to assist Tunisia and Morocco to tackle migration and border issues. In October, Spanish news outlet El Pais reported that Morocco and Spain would receive €70 million in aid by the end of 2018 “mainly for the purchase of border control equipment.” The European Commission’s website announced last month that the European body pledged a further €148 million to financially assist Morocco on the migration front by the end of month.  The EU will deliver an additional €110 million in the coming months, the EU’s foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said Thursday during a visit to Morocco.  The North African country has already received €30 million of the fund, according to Euronews. During the first 13 days of 2019, at least 2,200 irregular migrants arrived in Europe via Spain, Italy, Greece, Cyprus, and Malta across the Mediterranean, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Over 1,600 irregular migrants arrived in Spain by January 13, accounting for 73 percent of the total irregular migrants entering Europe via the sea. By December 18 last year, Europe received 111,558 migrants across the Mediterranean in 2018, according to IOM. Arrivals in Spain accounted for 50 percent of all European ports of entry. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 31 percent of those who entered Spain irregularly last year were from Morocco, 20 percent from Guinea, and 16 percent from Mali. Last year, over 2,242 irregular migrants died on migratory routes in the Mediterranean, including 769 using the western Mediterranean route from Morocco to Spain.

Rabat – Morocco intends to bid for hosting rights of the 2019 and 2020 FIFA Club World Cup. During the 3rd FIFA executive football summit held in Marrakech January 15-17, Morocco informed FIFA President Gianni Infantino of its interest in bidding to host the Club World Cup for two consecutive years, 2019 and 2020. Infantino passionately welcomed Morocco’s proposition, because he considers it to have the right human capacity, logistics, and sports facilities to ensure the smooth running of the competition, reported daily newspaper Assabah today. The FIFA summit also served as a platform to review the possible joint 2030 World Cup bid of Morocco, Portugal, and Spain. Morocco expressed determination to host the 2030 World Cup but remains undecided whether it will submit a joint or a solo bid. Morocco hosted the 2013-2014 Club World Cup events. Bayern Munich won the 2013 title for the first time after defeating Morocco’s Raja de Casablanca (RCA) 2-0 in the final match of the seven-team tournament. Real Madrid won the 2014 title after taking down Argentina’s San Lorenzo 2-0 in the final match. The Merengues also won the 2017 and 2018 tournaments which the United Arab Emirates organized.

By Zakaria ouadghiri Rabat – Morocco’s spending on research and development (R &amp; D) constituted 0.8 percent of Gross Domestic Product in 2017, said Said Amzazi, the minister of national education, vocational training, higher education, and scientific research, on Tuesday in Casablanca.

“Even if the budget earmarked for scientific and technical research in Morocco is just 0.8 percent of GDP, the problem is really the procedures for disbursing this funding,” he commented. He said that while the rate is low compared to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries (2.3 percent), it is still higher than it was in 2016 (0.3 percent). 
Moroccan universities do not use “considerable sums” because the procedures are “complex and slow” while R &amp; D requires flexibility and a rapid response, he explained in a speech delivered at the 8th annual Colloque X-Maroc event. The event’s theme was “Research &amp; Development as a Lever for Growth.”

According to the latest UNESCO report on countries’ investment in R&amp;D, Morocco ranks third in Africa, after Egypt and South Africa. Morocco spends MAD 14 billion for research.

Approximately 8,000 skilled Moroccans, including 600 engineers, leave the country each year, according to Salwa Belkeziz-Karkari, the president of the Moroccan Federation of Information Technologies. Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi recently said that brain drain is an “international phenomenon” resulting from the desire of graduate students to look for more favorable working conditions. According to the minister, Morocco does not provide incentives to attract educated Moroccans across the world. If Moroccan researchers return to Morocco from Europe, they start at the lowest administrative rank, an unacceptable demotion for university researchers, Amzazi continued.

Rabat – Qatar triumphed over Saudi Arabia in the much-anticipated “blockade derby,” giving the Qataris the upper hand, in the football sphere at least, in its regional rivalry with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt.  Even if both federations said prior to the game that they would not allow the countries’ geopolitical rivalry to factor in the game, politics always have their ways of sneaking in. And so the Abu Dhabi game was as geopolitical as it was about sport.  Almoez Ali, Qatar’s talismanic striker who scored four goals in his team’s 6-0 thrashing of North Korea last weekend, may not have minded Saudi Arabia’s ongoing blockade of his country when he surprised the Saudis with two goals.  Both teams, having won their two previous matches, already qualified for the second round of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. But victory was important. And for Qatar, it was bound to be about that in the end: A morale-boosting affirmation in the face of regional rivals.  Ali scored a goal in each half, helping his team win its third consecutive Asian Cup match.  Ali surprised the Saudis in the first half, opening the score shortly before half time. Saudi Arabia’s goalkeeper Mohammed Al Owais made a save, keeping out a penalty by Qatari captain Hasan Al Haydos three minutes before half-time. The referee ruled out a goal by Qatar before Ali struck again in the 80th minute, making it harder for the Saudis to come back in the game. Saudi fans were still singing during the last minutes of the game. Qatar has won three games out of three so far at this year’s tournament. It will play next against Iraq. Saudi Arabia will play Japan. Tonight’s match took place in the UAE, which is part of the political conflict alongside Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Egypt. The diplomatic spat has impacted travel and the economy in the Gulf region for over a year. The four countries are imposing a land, air, and sea blockade on Qatar, accusing it of financing terrorism and destabilizing the Gulf region. Doha’s officials firmly deny the allegations.

Rabat – Many shops, groceries, bakeries, butcheries, and service providers are closed in Rabat today. Some people struggled to even find bread this morning, city residents told Morocco World News. Only supermarkets are open. Trade unions and associations representing merchants are demanding the repeal of Article 145 of the General Code of Taxes on electronic billing and the business identification number, which stipulates that merchants have to use electronic billing for commercial transactions. On Tuesday, Minister of Trade and Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy met with the chambers of commerce and industry, customs, the General Directorate of Taxes (DGI), and merchants’ representatives to discuss electronic billing and merchants’ demands. During the meeting, trade unions and the DGI and customs signed an agreement to meet the merchants’ demands and end planned strikes. The agreement stipulated that merchants subject to the lump sum system are exempt from the electronic billing system and the business identification number. The text also specified that the implementation of the new measures on electronic invoicing will be suspended. The development of the organic law regarding electronic billing, according to the agreement, will involve the input of professional bodies “in the context of a participatory approach.” The new tax measures, which recently sparked an uproar among merchants, stipulate that merchants should use an electronic system to issue invoices. To do this, merchants must have billing software approved by tax authorities and an information system allowing a common database with the tax authorities. On January 3, many wholesalers in Casablanca closed their shops and held a sit-in at La Victoire Place protesting the new tax law. The protesting merchants were from Derb Omar, Allal Garage Allal, Korea, and Bayada, the main commercial sites in Casablanca. Last week, trade minister Elalamy, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, Government Spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi, and the General Directorate of Taxes (DGI) all reacted to the new tax measures on the use of electronic invoicing. On Monday, economy minister Mohamed Benchaaboun also responded to the issue. Last week, El Othmani announced that the government will suspend the implementation of the new tax measures using electronic invoicing, planned to come into force in early 2019 to fight tax fraud.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said during Thursday’s weekly cabinet meeting that the agriculture agreement with the EU “is the fruit of a long struggle of nearly two years.” During the meeting, El Othmani said that the agreement confirms that Morocco cannot compromise when it comes to its sovereignty and national integrity. The head of government said that “one of the lessons learned from the European Parliament’s decision is Morocco’s insistence on preserving its rights and sovereignty over all its territory.” He also emphasized the importance of Morocco’s diplomacy and its key role in all agreements. The agreement, according to El Othmani, will positively affect a number of future agreements. Moroccan expert on Western Sahara Abdelfettah Elfattihi told Morocco World News today that “the adoption of the agriculture agreement reflects a strengthening of the partnership between the two parties.” استقبل رئيس الحكومة الدكتور #سعدالدين_العثماني صباح اليوم بمقر رئاسة الحكومة السيدة Federica Mogherini الممثلة العليا للاتحاد الأوروبي للشؤون الخارجية والسياسة الأمنية. وتباحثا مختلف أوجه التعاون المغربي الأوروبي، خاصة في إطار الإصلاحات الكبرى التي تباشرها الحكومة المغربية. pic.twitter.com/3pOcIi0qYx — رئيس الحكومة -المغرب (@ChefGov_ma) January 17, 2019    He added that the EU decision will create a “legal structure that would facilitate many economic and development activities and opens the way for arranging other cooperation aspects between the two parties.” El Othmani also criticized Polisario’s maneuvers against Morocco, saying that they are “confronted by the appropriate legal and political means” to preserve Morocco’s sovereignty without any leniency or compromise. Yesterday, 444 EU parliamentarians voted in favor of the agriculture agreement. The vote followed the signing of the fisheries agreement between Morocco and the EU on Monday. El Othmani also met with EU High Representative Federica Mogherini, who began her two-day visit to Morocco on Wednesday evening and already met Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. El Othmani met with the EU official this morning.  According to El Othmani, the meeting was to praise the quality of the Moroccan-EU partnership and the level of continuous coordination between them. The two parties also commended the promising prospects for the partnership, especially after the adoption of the agriculture agreement. In a press conference co-chaired with Bourita, Mogherini said that the new partnership will also bring Morocco and the EU closer because it forms a measure to continue Morocco’s reform of the 2011 Constitution.

The National Institute of Geophysics (ING) announced Thursday that an earthquake measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale hit Driouch province in northern Morocco. The earthquake’s epicenter was in Tazaghine town in Driouch. It occured at 11:56 a.m., according to ING. The latest quake to hit region came just a few weeks ago, reaching a magnitude of 3.5. The region is especially earthquake-prone, according to a study by Moroccan researchers. The study indicated that “a significant percentage of the buildings of Al Hoceima have a high seismic vulnerability,” putting the city at risk should it experience another major earthquake. One of the deadliest earthquakes to hit Morocco occurred in 2004, near Ait Kamra in the Al Hoceima province. The quake leveled nearly 2,600 houses and killed approximately 630 people.

Rabat – Qatar will play Saudi Arabia at the 2019 AFC Asian Cup on Thursday, the first meeting since their diplomatic crisis in June 2017. The match will be played in the United Arab Emirates, which is part of the regional political conflict alongside Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Egypt.  The game will kick off at 8 p.m. local time (4:00 p.m. GMT). The four countries are imposing a land, air, and sea blockade on Qatar, accusing it of financing terrorism and destabilizing the Gulf region. Doha’s officials firmly deny the allegations. Qatar views the blockade as an attempt by the Gulf powers and Egypt to punish them for pursuing an independent foreign policy. Qatar Football Association’s (QFA) media officer Ali Al Salat says it is time for the two nations to put their conflict aside and focus on the tournament. “We want to win this match, not because of the political matters but to get to the top of the table,” Al Jazeera quoted Ali Al Salat as saying. He stressed that there is no need to mix political issues with sports. Air blockade on Qatar Since the four countries imposed an air blockade on Doha, the 25-person Qatar-squad had to fly to the UAE via Kuwait. Qatar will now play without fans because they are banned from entering the country. In the UAE, it is illegal to show any kind of support or sympathy with Qatar. Any support is punishable by up to 15 years in jail. Qatar-based channel beIN Sports is the exclusive broadcaster of the competition in the MENA region.  About 20 beIN Sports’ journalists are currently in the UAE to cover the tournament. However, some Doha journalists were barred from entering the country despite holding valid accreditation.

By Zakaria Ouadghiri Rabat – The population of Casablanca makes 7.8 million daily transits, according to a study introduced at “Casablanca’s Urban Travel Plan: First Results and Horizons” event on Wednesday in Casablanca.

The Household Travel Survey (EMD) found that 62 percent of trips are made on foot, 13 percent by public transport, 12 percent by personal vehicle, 9 percent by taxi, 3 percent by bicycle, and 1 percent by car.

The study also shows that women are more likely to walk (76 percent versus 57 percent for men) but men use public transport and cars more. The survey estimates that over 46 percent of all trips are taken by people returning home, while the most frequent reasons for travel are for study (18 percent) and work (16 percent). The survey aims to inform stakeholders about the travel practices of residents in the Casablanca area 

         According to the study, 5 percent of trips are made for shopping; 5 percent for leisure, social, and cultural activities; 3 percent for personal errands like visiting the doctor or going to the bank; and 3 percent for visiting friends and family. There are only 113 cars per 1,000 people, according to EMD.

Rabat – Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba is back in Morocco to continue his recovery after spending only one day in his country. Anadolu Agency quoted presidential sources who said that Bongo is back in Morocco for medical treatment. Bongo left Morocco for Gabon on Monday. During his visit, Bongo chaired a ceremony of the new government’s swearing-in. On January 13, Bongo, acting from Rabat, appointed Julien Nkoghe Bekale as prime minister. Bongo’s trip to Gabon followed a failed a coup attempt. On January 7, a group of soldiers seized a state broadcaster and announced their plans against Ondimba. Law enforcement intervened and two rebels were killed while the military retook the national radio office. Ondimba arrived in Morocco first in November 2018 at the invitation of King Mohammed VI after he suffered a stroke in October in Saudi Arabia.

Rabat – During his Friday sermon on December 28 in Chouhada Mosque in Rabat, an imam stated that celebrating the New Year is sinful and haram (forbidden in Islam), “because it is a Christian holiday.” The remarks earned him a ban from preaching by the Moroccan Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs. The imam, like many Muslim scholars, stressed that Muslims should only celebrate the Islamic holidays, Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, and Eid al-Adha, the feast of sacrifice. Although the imam reportedly sent a message to the ministry arguing that his sermon was founded on hadiths (stories about the prophet) and sermons by major religious scholars, the Islamic affairs minister, Ahmed Taoufiq, insisted that it was incompatible with Moroccan and Islamic principles of tolerance and cohabitation between religions. The topic of whether it is haram to celebrate the Gregorian New Year has regularly been a subject of debate in the Muslim world, especially when New Year’s Eve approaches A few days before New Year’s Eve a similar controversy emerged in Morocco. Moroccans on social media criticized a bakery owner and called him an “extremist” for deciding not to make or sell Christmas and New Year’s cakes. Adding to the controversy, the bakery, called “Rayhana,” wrote a post on its Facebook page: “We do not celebrate the Christian holidays.” Many social media users reminded others of the Qur’anic surah, al-Mumtahanah (60:8) which reads: “Allah does not forbid you (as regards) the ones who have not fought you on account of the religion and have not driven you out of your residences that you should be benign to them and be equitable towards them; surely Allah loves the equitable.”

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani declared that 10 percent of RAMED’s beneficiaries are not the most disadvantaged. During the House of Councilors monthly session, dedicated to general politics, El Othmani acknowledged that 10 percent of RAMED card holders are far from being poor. El Othmani pointed out that the executive established a system to define RAMED beneficiaries in a fair and efficient manner. The objective of the system is to guarantee better quality of services for the most disadvantaged financially. The government plans to cover 90 percent of the Moroccan population with health insurance by 2021. However, as of November 2018, only 16.2 million of Morocco’s 34.8 million people have healthcare coverage. RAMED, which has been in place since 2012, along with Compulsory Health Insurance (AMO), covers only 60 percent of Moroccans. More than 25 percent of Moroccans (8.5 million) do not have medical care, especially the poor who live in rural areas, according to the World Bank 2017 Economic Memorandum. Quality of healthcare in Morocco is also affected by the many qualified doctors who emigrate because of the lack of proper infrastructure.

Rabat – After failing to hinder the EU-Morocco negotiations regarding the fisheries and agriculture agreements, Polisario has described the agreements as “illegal.” Through its official news agency, the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) said that the Polisario “condemns the illegal and short-sighted decision by the EU Parliament to extend the EU-Morocco trade deal.” Despite Polisario’s lobbying in the EU Parliament, Morocco and the EU adopted the agriculture agreement and signed the fisheries deal to extend trade. Both agreements included Morocco’s southern provinces in Western Sahara, frustrating the separatist group. “The Frente Polisario, acting on behalf of the people of Western Sahara, will pursue every legal avenue to reverse today’s illegal decision,” added the front. While claiming legitimacy over Sahrawis in Western Sahara, the Moroccan government finds the separatist group unqualified to represent all Sahrawis. One reason Morocco takes the position is the petition signed by a group of local residents in the natural resource-rich regions of Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab and Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra. In the petition, Sahrawis acknowledged the fast development in the region because of the earlier fisheries and agriculture deals, which benefit the region.  The petitioners called on European decision-makers to adopt the agreements, given the “tangible” impact that previous versions have had in the lives of locals in the southern provinces. “The southern provinces are now ranked above the national average for human development indicators,” they wrote. After the adoption of the agriculture agreement, Morocco’s Minister of Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch said that the deals create 66,000 job opportunities in the southern provinces under the Moroccan Green Plan and the Halieutis plan. Akhannouch recalled the visit of EU officials to the region. He said the visit enabled the parliamentarians to be informed on the situation in these regions and the development projects there. Polisario has long claimed that Morocco has been “exploiting the natural resources” of the region. But for Morocco’s government, the agreements discredit Polisario’s allegations. The conclusion of the agriculture agreement also angered Polisario’s main supporter, Algeria. Algerian state-owned news agency APS quoted an anonymous Algerian source who said that the vote was a “genuine crime.” The source said that the vote also constitutes a “violation” of the Court of Justice’s ruling, which stated that EU deals with Morocco were invalid if they included Western Sahara. Quoted from Brussels, the source said that the vote was a “real ugliness committed” in the EU Parliament.

Rabat – At least 2,200 undocumented migrants arrived in Europe via  Spain, Italy, Greece, Cyprus, and Malta across the Mediterranean during the first 13 days of 2019, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported on January 15. The figure represents a slight increase compared to the 1,915 migrants and refugees who entered Europe by sea during the same period last year. By December 2018, Europe had received 113,145 migrants across the Mediterranean in 2018. Arrivals in Spain accounted for 50 percent of all European ports of entry. Spain received 57,250 irregular migrants who crossed the Mediterranean in 2018 up to December 26. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 31 percent of those who entered Spain irregularly last year were from Morocco, 20 percent from Guinea, and 16 percent from Mali. The western-Mediterranean route via Spain has become the most used one by irregular migrants. On January 1, Spanish rescue services assisted 111 migrants traveling on three boats in the early hours of the day, according to El Pais. IOM Spain’s Ana Dodevska reported that “1,609 men, women and children have arrived as irregular migrants” to Spain by January 13, accounting for 73 percent of the total undocumented migrants entering Europe via the sea. The arrivals are “more than the 1,400 arriving through all of January last year” in Spain, added Dodevska. During the two last weeks, at least 16 people died across the three Mediterranean sea routes, according to IOM. The total number is very low compared with the 194 deaths recorded during the same period in 2018, which, according to IOM, “was due to a spate of shipwrecks off Libya.” “At this point in 2017 a total of 1,159 irregular migrants or refugees had landed in either Greece, Spain or Italy after crossing the Mediterranean, and IOM had recorded a total of 12 deaths,” said IOM. Last year, over 2,242 undocumented migrants died on migratory routes in the Mediterranean, including 769 using the western Mediterranean route from Morocco to Spain. The 769 deaths represents over three times the recorded deaths using the same route in 2017.

Rabat – Moroccan authorities prevented Luis Mangrane, a Spanish jurist, from entering Laayoune on January 14. Spanish news outlets reported that Mangrane aimed to attend the January 16 trial of Brahim Dehani as an international human rights observer. The news outlets claimed that Dehani was arrested on December 4 while covering a demonstration in the region. Earlier this month, Moroccan law enforcement in Laayoune also expelled two Spanish pro-Polisario activists who claimed they were there for New Year’s Eve. Patricia Ibanez and Irati Tobar were found at the house of Hassana Aalia, who is living in exile in Spain. Aalia received a life sentence in absentia for his involvement in the Gdeim Izik incident, when Sahrawis at a camp near Laayoune clashed with Moroccan police resulting in the death of at least 11 Moroccan officers and the injury of 70 others in 2010. Authorities expelled the Spanish activists to Agadir, explaining that they could visit Laayoune but “not staying with a family.” “We tried to talk to them and explain, but there was no way,” Ibanez said.

Rabat –Morocco’s High Authority of Audiovisual Communication (HACA) has installed a center for monitoring and control of audiovisual media in Bamako, Mali. The inauguration of the center took place Tuesday in the Malian capital. On the occasion, HACA Director Benaissa Asloun said that the founding of the center reflects the “convergence” between HACA and Mali’s High Authority for Communication (HAC) as independent institutions that strive to secure citizens’ rights to a free and ethical audio-visual communication that also respects political, social, and religious values and diversity. The new monitoring center is equipped with state-of-the-art technology developed by HACA engineers, which will enable HAC to monitor and archive all radio and television programs broadcast in Mali. The contract between HACA and HAC, signed in Rabat in 2018, includes the training of monitoring officers and the installation of a technical room to record 36 FM radio services and 24 television services, Asloun told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).  The Moroccan ambassador in Bamako, Hassan Naciri, said that the launch of the center will enable HAC to ensure fair access to audiovisual media in the country.  He added that the launch is the fruit of King Mohammed VI’s and Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita’s dedication to a “mutually beneficial cooperation.”

Rabat – The managing director of OCP Africa Fertilisers Nigeria, Mohamed Hettiti, said in Lagos that OCP will build two industrial fertilizer plants in Nigeria, the Nigerian outlet Vanguard reported Wednesday. Speaking at a recent press meeting in Lagos, Hettiti said that the plants will “help to boost local production, create permanent jobs and facilitate export opportunities,” according to Vanguard. The plants, according to Hettiri, will also ensure a decrease in Nigerian imports of NPK fertilizers, which combine three macronutrients: Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. At the end of last year, OCP Group announced plans to triple its production of fertilizer for other African countries through its “Africa Fertilizer Complex.” The unit produces nearly 1 million tons of fertilizer a year for Africa. “We have an objective to balance the trade between Morocco and Nigeria. We do not want only importation into Nigeria. Nigeria is importing DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphorous) fertiliser from Morocco,” the Nigerian magazine quoted Hettiti as saying. “We want to leverage on the local raw material that is abundant in Nigeria which is ammonia,” he stressed. The planned plant, whose location has not been finalized yet, will produce ammonia, according to Hettiti, that can be exported to Morocco. For this reason, “We are investing that amount to build a DAP plant.” The managing director pointed out that OCP’s subsidiary in Nigeria is currently importing DAP fertilizer, including phosphate and ammonia. “But with the plant here, only phosphate will be imported from Morocco, then we blend here and even export.” Through the plants, OCP Africa has set ambitious goals to reach more farmers in Nigeria by the end of this year. “We have reached out to 10,000 farmers in Kaduna and Gombe states,” Hettiti said. “In 2018, we targeted 70,000 but as at November, we have done 67,600 in Kaduna, Katsina, Bauchi and Kano states. In 2019, we have proposed to reach out to 100,000,” Hettiti continued. Nigeria and other neighboring countries will be the industrial plants’ main market. Africa Fertilisers Nigeria is one of the networks of OCP Africa, a subsidiary of Morocco’s OCP Group. Created in 2016, OCP Africa is an execution of OCP’s partnerships in Nigeria and other African countries. OCP Group, which holds 75 percent of the world’s phosphate reserves, is one of the leading exporters and producers of raw phosphate, phosphate-based fertilizers, and phosphoric acid in the world. The company develops precision agriculture techniques to help farmers improve the quality and yield of their crops.

Rabat – The High Representative of the European Union Federica Mogherini has commended the signing of the fisheries and agriculture agreements between the EU and Morocco. Mogherini is currently on a two-day visit to Morocco to discuss the agreements with senior Moroccan officials. Mogherini started her visit with a meeting co-chaired by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita.  During a press conference, Mogherini said that Morocco has been a“strategic partner of the EU for 50 years.” She added that the two partners are aspiring to make a qualitative leap in their ties to build a regional partnership, particularly in the Mediterranean, the Arab world, and Africa. The partnership aims to meet the expectations of citizens on both sides of the Mediterranean and to achieve the common objectives of both parties, according to the EU official. Mogherini said that the new partnership will also bring Morocco and the EU closer because it forms a measure to continue Morocco’s reform of the 2011 Constitution. The EU to support Moroccan security “The EU is ready to support the kingdom, especially in terms of national security,” she was quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Mogherini noted the instructions of King Mohammed VI regarding including youth, employment, and vocational training. She also spoke of Morocco’s efforts against irregular migration, saying that more discussions should be had to allow the EU to benefit from Morocco’s expertise and experience in these fields. During the press conference, Bourita said that adopting the [agriculture] agreement further proves the importance of the partnership between the EU and Morocco. It also takes into account the “supreme interests of the kingdom.”  “Our partnership has demonstrated, during this period, its resilience to attacks, maneuvers and all the actions that [attempted] to torpedo it and create a crisis between Morocco and the EU,” Bourita added. Bourita added that the agreement will reactivate all the mechanisms of cooperation and partnership that have been broken since 2016. Bourita also spoke about Morocco’s key role in the Arab and African world, making  the country an ideal partner for the EU. “The adoption by the European Parliament of the agricultural agreement is a clear vote in favor of the strategic approach adopted by Morocco in partnership with the EU.” Commenting on the EU Parliament vote on the agriculture agreement, Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch said: “This is a very positive vote that meets the expectations of Morocco,” in a statement to the press. He noted that the agreement will “allow populations in the southern provinces to export their products in the best conditions and to deal freely with the European Union.” The EU-Morocco agreements, according to Akhannouch, create around 66,000 jobs in the southern provinces.

Rabat – Mohamed Bachir Rachdi, the newly-appointed head of the National Commission for Probity and the Fight Against Corruption, has said that King Mohammed VI urged him to “go far with the fight against corruption.” Rachdi said the King’s direct request on the day of his appointment inspired him to work harder. One of the founders of the anti-corruption organization, Transparency Maroc, Rachdi pledged to use an in-depth approach that reflects the national Strategy Against Corruption adopted in 2015. Rachdi, whose appointment marks a new era in Morocco’s path toward effective governance, hopes to “be part of an era of real and irreversible changes.” Corruption, as the Moroccan justice minister, Mohamed Aujjar, described it, is “a plague” that needs to be exterminated. The country annually loses 2 percent of its economic growth due to corruption, according to Lahcen Daoudi, minister delegate to the head of government in charge of general affairs and governance. Corruption, in its different forms—abuse of power, public funds mismanagement, or administrative corruption—wastes approximately 7 percent of Morocco’s GDP every year, according to Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani’s speech in July 2018. Referring to the government’s national plan to end all forms of corruption by 2050, El Othmani said that the most effective way to deal with Morocco’s enduring economic and social problems is to fight corruption in public administration.

Washington D.C. – In an article published on January 15, the Francophone website Algerie Patriotique accused American Ambassador to Algeria John Desrocher of “plotting” with opposition parties to destabilize the current regime and “turn Algeria into a new Syria.” The article went on to question the real motives behind the American diplomat’s extensive travels around the country and the purpose of his invitations for young Algerians to “undergo” American NGO training on democracy. The pro-establishment website indicated that the ambassador held secret meetings with opposition groups to encourage them “to carry out actions of subversion.” It suggests that Washington’s top diplomat’s actions and activities are suspect and amount to “political activism” against the Algerian state. Furthermore, Algerie Patriotique accused, in the same article, Ambassador William J. Burns, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former US deputy secretary of state under President Obama, of conspiring with the Moroccan monarchy to subvert Algeria. However, the more troubling element in this hard-to-fact-check article is Algerie Patriotique’s comparison of Ambassador Desrocher to his predecessor, “the unmistakable Robert Ford who, in the 1990s, had turned his office of adviser to the US embassy in El-Biar into a headquarters for extremists of the FIS and the armed arm, the GIA,” according to the website. It is startling to see a pro-government media site accuse past and current American diplomats stationed in Algeria of associating with terrorist groups and plotting to change the government by force. Algerie Patriotique would never have published such an account without the direction and approval of top intelligence officers. In fact, Algeria’s notorious Military Intelligence manufactures these “type” of stories and feeds them to their social media mouthpieces. The hope is to cast doubt about the allegiance and patriotism of opposition groups fighting for democracy and human rights. In provoking Ambassador Desrocher, the Algerian government tries to portray the opposition as agents of the American government leading some activists to distance themselves from the work of Western NGOs. While Algeria is not innately anti-American, it is suspicious of the work of US pro-democracy organizations. The government fears that democracy-building activities are a threat to its rule. For some independent political observers, Ambassador Desrocher is collateral damage in the larger smear campaign directed by the military to de-legitimize members of a coalition of independent organizations fighting to stop a fifth term for President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Nevertheless, accusations of “acts of subversion” against US diplomats are serious and a breach in protocol.  Since Algerie Patriotique conveys the position of the powerful military establishment that controls the country, the Algerian government must give some clarifications regarding the publication of such false allegations.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement to express satisfaction with the agreements linking Morocco and the European Union. Today, the European Union adopted the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement by a vast majority, with 444 votes in favor of the deal The ministry said that the agreements signed between the EU and Morocco confirms “that any agreement covering the Moroccan Sahara can only be negotiated and signed by the Kingdom of Morocco in the exercise of its full sovereignty over this part of its territory.” Commenting on the adoption of the agriculture agreement, the ministry said that the vote “by an overwhelming majority, marks the culmination of a long process of technical negotiations, political consultations and legal validations between Morocco and the EU.”  The ministry’s statement shared on Facebook said that throughout the process of negotiations, Morocco was firm on three principles: The non-negotiable defense of its territorial integrity and the fundamentals of its position with regard to the Moroccan Sahara, the preservation of its economic interests in an important sector with a privileged business partner, and its sincere commitment to the multidimensional and profound partnership with the EU. The ministry also expressed satisfaction with EU actions against “attacks and maneuvers” led by Polisario and Algeria against this “secular partnership.” The statement was referring to Polisario’s allegations that Morocco was “exploiting the natural resources” of the region. According to the ministry Morocco “considers that the adoption of this agreement provides a solid basis for a full revival of its partnership with the EU in order to jointly address the challenges facing the region and seize its opportunities, in a spirit of clarity, responsibility, and ambition.” On January 14, the EU and Morocco also signed the fisheries agreement, which includes the waters off of Morocco’s southern provinces.

By Carolina McCabe Rabat – Between Tuesday afternoon and the early hours of Wednesday, armed men attacked the DusitD2 Hotel complex in i, Kenya. The attack, which the Somali Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for, used a set of explosions and gunfire to target civilians. Among the victims, 11 were Kenyan, 1 was British, 1 was American, and the other 2 remain unidentified. The attack lasted for hours in the DusitD2 complex, which contains upmarket shops, bars, restaurants, offices, banks, and hotel facilities. A standoff ensued through the night, which trapped people in the buildings of the complex. Authorities evacuated over 700 people to safety, according to Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. “The security operation at Dusit complex is over, and all the terrorists eliminated,” Kenyatta told reporters. “Innocent lives were lost through the hands of these murderers, terrorists,” he continued. While the number of gunmen remains unknown, it is reported there were at least four attackers. A source familiar with the situation told CNN they expect the death toll to rise and described the number of 15 dead as “conservative.” One of the victims identified is American, Jason Spindler. Spindler was a survivor of the 9/11 attacks and the co-founder and managing director of I-DEV International. His mother confirmed his death, describing him as a “bright young person.” Spindler had received grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Clinton Foundation. Luke Potter, a British development professional, had recently moved to Nairobi to work for Gatsby Africa as the head of their forestry and tea portfolio. “I am very sad to confirm that we believe that at least one British national has been killed in the attack,” said Nic Hailey, the UK high commissioner to Kenya. Two of the victims, Abdalla Dahir and Feisal Ahmed, were Kenyan development professionals who worked for the consulting firm, Adam Smith International. The two worked on economic programs benefiting Somalia. Ahmed left behind a widow who is seven months pregnant. The Red Cross in Nairobi responded by launching a blood drive to support the victims and urging people in the region to donate. The organization also created a support line, which provides resources to connect people searching for their loved ones as well as counseling. Many Kenyans used Twitter in response to the tragedy, using the hashtag #WeShallOvercome to send messages of solidarity. Tweets highlighted the efforts of ordinary people in response to the tragedy.

Kenyans are also donating blood all over. Terrorism will never triumph! pic.twitter.com/rMPBIyie1i — Donald L. Agwenge (@DonaldAgwenge) January 16, 2019  In a statement, the European Union offered its condolences to those injured or affected by the attack and affirmed it will be at the side of the Kenyan government and its citizens. “Kenya’s stand against terrorism, at home and abroad, is a necessary fight against a challenge that we all face – being it in Africa, in Europe or in the rest of the world – which will contribute to bringing peace, stability and prosperity to the country, the region and beyond,” said the statement. How the attack happened The attack began with an explosion in a bank parking lot, followed by a suicide blast in the lobby of the Dusit Hotel. The explosions were followed by gunfire. “As we were leaving, there were gunshots all over the place,” said Evans Ng’ong’a, who was at the site of the attack. “Attackers jumped over the fence and started shooting after the explosion.” The interior ministry released a statement early Wednesday, stating, “No further threat to public exists,” and claiming, “All buildings and surrounding area secure.” However, over 16 hours after the attack began, gunfire and explosions continued in the area. Wednesday morning, Joseph Boinnet, the Kenyan police chief, reported that an evacuation was ongoing, contradicting the interior ministry’s assurances. Previous attacks by al-Shabab militants  against Kenya The attack comes exactly three years to the day after al-Shabab killed dozens of soldiers in an attack on a Kenyan military base in Somalia.  Since Kenya launched a military operation in Somalia in 2011, Kenya has faced various attacks attributed to al-Shabab. The group has carried out at least five major attacks since 2013. In 2013, the militant group attacked the Westgate shopping center, holding the mall hostage for several days and killing 67 people. The attack on Tuesday was about two miles from Westgate. In April of 2015, al-Shabab militants attacked Garissa University College in Kenya, killing 148 people, mainly students.

Rabat – Enterprise Florida (EFI), the state’s principal economic development organization, “will lead a business delegation of small and mid-sized Florida manufacturers and services providers on an export sales mission to Casablanca,” EFI said in a press release on January 10. The trade mission is scheduled for April 14-18 with the aim to facilitate business cooperation between the Florida delegates and their counterparts in Morocco. “Morocco has become a top destination for foreign investments and trade,” said Manny Mencia, senior vice president of international trade and development for EFI. “Morocco has increased investment in its port, transportation, and industrial infrastructure to position itself as a center for business throughout Africa. Florida companies in industries like energy, infrastructure, agricultural equipment, and healthcare can find great new opportunities there.” The EFI, which is a public-private partnership between Floridian business and government leaders, touted Morocco’s strategic location and favorable business environment. “With a total population of 35 million people and having the sixth-largest economy in Africa, Morocco is seen as the gateway to sub-Saharan Africa with its developed trade environment.” The organization also noted the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed between Morocco and the US in 2006, “the only U.S. FTA with an African nation.” The FTA eliminated a 95 percent tariff on traded consumer and industrial goods exported to Morocco. Florida companies’ high-quality goods and services, said EFI, “have a significant competitive advantage and are well-suited for the types of industries being pursued by businesses in Morocco.” As part of the export sales mission, EFI will set up “pre-screened, one-on-one Gold Key meetings” with interested Moroccan companies, in coordination with the US Commercial Service. Based on a first-come, first-served rule, the organization will select only 12 small and mid-sized Florida companies for the Gold Key package. Other companies may qualify for a Gold Key Grant.

Rabat – On Tuesday night, a massive fire broke out inside a wholesale fruit and vegetable market in Sidi Othmane, Casablanca, destroying many shops. Police have not yet reported the cause of the fire as investigations are still ongoing. Photos and videos of the incident show many citizens gathered near the market while firefighters try to put out the fire.  
That same day, a bus caught fire at the intersection of Boulevard Mohamed Zerktouni and Boulevard Anfa in the economic hub. The bus belonged to M’dina Bus, a company Moroccans say should be replaced. The company came under fire in November, after a video spread online showing one of its bus drivers using an umbrella to take shelter from rain leaking through the roof of the bus.  The driver was reportedly fired because the video went viral, adding to the anger of many Moroccans on social media condemning the poor conditions of the company’s buses.

Rabat – Polisario military member Ammar Ould Ayanne died under unknown circumstances in the Tindouf camps, according to a statement received by Morocco World News from Tindouf’s Autonomy Support Forum (FORSATIN). The family of Ayanne is conducting a series of sit-ins, calling on the front to reveal the circumstances under which their relative died. FORSATIN also shared a recording made by Ayanne’s sister with Morocco World News, in which she condemned the death of her brother. The sister also said that her brother suffered a “minor health issue.” Ayanne’s sister said that her brother’s health deteriorated due to neglect. In a statement, FORSATIN said that there is “panic” and “frustration” among the Polisario Front after the deaths of some of its members. Sources of the forum said that families of the Polisario military members are under pressure. According to the statement, Ayanne’s health deteriorated after Polisario members argued “that there was no ambulance. After being transported in a civilian car, he did not get the necessary care.” The statement added that the deceased had transferred from one hospital to another in Algeria until his death. According to the statement, the death was not the first of its kind and “will not be the last.” The statement noted that the most recent case was of a young man born in his late thirties, who died under “mysterious circumstances.” FORSATIN was not the only voice condemning the alleged unbearable living situation in the Tindouf camps. Earlier this month, former Polisario member Mustafa Salma Ouled Sidi Mouloud condemned the kidnapping and death of Ahmed El Khalil. According to Mustafa Salma, El Khalil was kidnapped by Algerian intelligence agents over 9 years ago. Like Ayanne’s family, the family of El Khalil also pressured the Polisario and called on the United Nations to pressure Algeria and the separatist group to reveal El Khalil’s fate. The statement also said that there is a long list of members who are “facing the death penalty” due to their opposition.

Rabat – Tunisian media have hit back at Abdelilah Benkirane’s “insulting comments,” telling the former Moroccan prime minister to “shut up” and mind his own business. Yesterday, a number of Tunisian radio stations ran programs that reacted to Benkirane’s recent comments about Tunisia, responding to what they called “an insult to the country’s pride and image.” Benkirane made his remarks on Sunday, January 13, while speaking to members of Morocco’s ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD).  “Tunisia is an undisciplined country, even if its democracy is better [than Morocco’s],” Benkirane told fellow PJD members at his Rabat home.  “When I visit the country, I find general strikes, dirt, and disorder. I have the feeling that some parties want to go back to dictatorship…. Tunisia is socially unstable,” Benkirane said. The former PJD boss, apparently comparing the Moroccan and Tunisian political experience, added: “Morocco is probably the best Arab country.” The Tunisian media’s response came on Tuesday, after waiting for two days for an official response from the government. Wondering what could have motivated the PJD official’s jibe at a neighboring country, Nessma TV called his remarks “a violation of all international and diplomatic norms.” Mosaique Radio followed suit, although uninterested in the reasons. The comments were sufficient proof that Benkirane has no “regard for Tunisia.” The radio noted on its website that Benkirane “did not mince his words about Tunisia. His remarks breach all diplomatic rules and are insulting to our country’s image.” However, in addition to rebuking Benkirane, the Tunisian radio wondered why government officials have said nothing so far. “The remarks were made days ago, and there has so far been no reaction from the Tunisian authorities.” Tunisia is widely considered one of the MENA region’s best democracies.  “Democracy Index 2018,” a recent report by Britain’s the Economist on the state of democracy in the world, ranked Tunisia first in the Arab world in terms of democratic experience. Morocco, said to be oscillating between “authoritarianism” and “flawed democracy,” came second in the Arab world.

Rabat – The British Parliament has voted 432 to 202 to reject the deal that Prime Minister Theresa May proposed on the terms for the UK’s exit from the EU.

Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn called for a vote of no confidence in the government. A general election could result from the vote of confidence set for Wednesday evening.

May has spent two years working on a deal with the EU. The plan was to secure an easy Brexit on March 29 and to put in place a 21-month transition period to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement.  
The vote was originally supposed to take place in December, but May postponed the vote to try to win more support from MPs.

MPs are divided between those who want a new referendum on leaving the EU, a softer version of May’s Brexit deal similar to the European Union Association Agreement, calling off Brexit completely, or leaving without a deal.

Rabat – This past Saturday was yet another day of horrible urban riots in Paris and major French cities. The French people, represented by protesters bearing high-visibility fluorescent jackets and calling themselves the “yellow vest” movement, do not want Macron and his economic policies. They want him out of office and into oblivion. On placards and on the back of their vests, the demonstrators inscribed a clear message: “Macron demissionne” and, at other times, abrupt wording: “Macron degage.” The word “degage” is reminiscent of the beginning of demonstrations of the Arab Spring and was meant, initially, for the dictator Ben Ali in Tunisia in 2010. It has been used as a lead message by all Arab uprisings to get rid of their corrupt and patriarchal leaders.  Macron is no dictator, whatsoever. He was elected to the office by the majority of French people on May 7, 2017, and today they want him to go. Why is that? Macron came to politics from business circles, the Rothschild investment bank to be precise, which he joined in 2008 at the age of 30. In many ways he is bewitched by the American economic model. For some of his enemies he is no more than a puppet of the powerful Rothschild business dynasty.  His undeclared objective is to dismantle the French welfare system and, most importantly, the French “Etat de providence.” He is eyeing eagerly, also, the privatization of the railroad company SNCF and later on all other state conglomerates.  He has initiated, willingly, the end of free tertiary education to boost and modernize this sector, according to him. In the same line, he has increased university fees astronomically, obliging thousands of foreign students, mostly from former colonies, to seek other educational horizons. At the beginning of the “Yellow Revolution” on November 7, 2018, he swore to stay his course and not budge, but as the successive Saturdays became violent and the “yellow vests” proved to be more determined to fight to the last drop, Macron, like most medieval kings, retired to his dungeon. Macron kept mum while trying to use political parties, NGOs, trade unions, etc., to negotiate on his behalf, one way or the other. At the end, realizing that the “yellow vests” would not change course, he backtracked on his increase of energy taxes. Nevertheless, the yellow vests continued, increasing their demands and vowing to continue the protests until spring, if need be, or the end of Macron’s presidency.  What is more, now they are demanding a referendum on the whole French political system. Indeed, many of the “yellow vests” who hit the streets again on Saturday wielded signs with the acronym RIC–for “Citizens’ Initiative Referendum”–insisting popular votes be held to allow citizens to vet government policy proposals. Is this the second French Revolution? The demonstrations are reminiscent of the May 1968 protests that led to the departure of the charismatic Charles de Gaulle from power, after the majority of the French people rejected his austere ruling philosophy and approach. The “yellow vests” movement is more like a “Second French Revolution” in the making. It is aiming to change the French Model that has past its expiration date, according to many analysts and experts, but in their own way: Since coming to power one year ago, Macron has tried to Americanize the French economy by increasing taxes in areas that hurt mostly the “petit peuple” and taxing less big fortunes. This has increased the gap between the poor and the rich. His avowed aim, apparently, is to attract more investments into the French economy to create more jobs and, therefore, better life prospects for the French nation. Now Macron’s choices are very hard: Give up his economic model altogether to keep his seat or leave office. Chances are that he will not leave power but try to get a new virginity (nouvelle virginite) to continue until the end of his term. However, whatever route he will take, he will be a weakened president, and his party will go on until the end of this term and then, probably, disintegrate, because it is so unpopular at the time being.  Indeed, two cars of a female deputy from Macron’s party were burned down one night by unknown arsonists to express their dislike of him and his model of governance. Many other deputies received death threats and graffiti was inscribed on the front walls of their residences. After the fourth violent Saturday that took place in most major cities, Macron, on counsel from his inner circle, came down from his ivory tower and spoke to the French people on Monday, December 10, 2018.  In his speech, he expressed his willingness not only to dismantle all the energy taxes he planned for 2019, but, also, to respond favorably to most of the demands put forward by the “yellow vests.” Mainly, he will: In addition, he asked all employers to grant their employees a Christmas bonus. He also pressed banks to review their charges on customer accounts. So, Macron is probably not going to Americanize the French culture and economy. After all, it was an approach that Margaret Thatcher undertook in the late 1970s, with much pain, saving the United Kingdom from bankruptcy and making it among the strongest economies of the 21st century. France is a Latin country, and it is not going to go the American way; it will remain Latin by popular choice. What consequences for Macron? Macron, who was buoyed by his almost landslide victory in the presidential elections of 2017 with his new party “La Republique en Marche,” is facing dire prospects today. The party he created will, undoubtedly, be buried with him at the end of his term. Already, Francois Holland, who handpicked Macron to succeed him, is criticizing Macron for his policies and is preparing his probable triumphant political comeback. One of the last straws of the ailing Macron administration is the national debate. Macron, in person, officially launched the debate with the mayors of France in the northern provincial town of Grand Bourgtheroulde in Normandy on January 15, 2019. The initiative was intended to address a long list of grievances of the “yellow vests” and to soothe their ongoing protests. But from the start, the debate that was supposed to assuage the anger of the protesters ran aground when Macron sparked new outrage by stigmatizing the poor when he said that they are “screwing around.”  Is this a pure political faux-pas or another way of settling scores with the people who are  openly rejecting his presidency and asking him to leave? Prior to launching the debate, Macron wrote in a 2,330-word open letter: “For me, there is no banned issue.” He went on to say: “We won’t agree on everything, which is normal in a democracy. But at least we’ll show we’re a people which is not afraid of talking, exchanging, and debating.” France never wanted the American model that has been established in the United Kingdom after downsizing the trade unions and vanquishing their radical leaders. France wants a mixture of a liberal economy with a social welfare state and not just a total liberal economy.  The “uberization” of the economy of this country that has happened in several other countries around the world will not occur in France, in the near future, because the majority of the people want to keep France French, in soul and philosophy. Whether they succeed in that objective or not, only time will show.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Gendarmerie has decided to use helicopters with surveillance technology to pursue drug traffickers after a significant police chase. Daily newspaper Al Massae reported today that the royal gendarmerie will set up several special forces to watch the northern coasts and intercept drug trafficking attempts. The decision came after royal gendarmes  came under gunfire in a recent police chase, according to Al Massae. A drug trafficker managed to escape the gendarmes with nine boats loaded with drugs. The boats were allegedly escaping from Sidi Yahya to Zaer, two inland regions near Rabat. For the first time, the royal gendarmerie used several helicopters equipped with the latest surveillance technology to pursue drug traffickers.  Gendarmes hope that the helicopters will enable them in the future to get high resolution pictures and find drug lords. In a separate incident, on December 8, gendarmes in Jorf Lasfar found a boat in El Jadida port belonging to an international drug network after they had been searching for it for almost two weeks.

Rabat – At the nurses’ fifth hearing this week, the court decided to temporarily release the nurses on bail of MAD 6,000. The nurses had spent nearly four weeks in prison, since December 20, on charges of negligence and premeditated murder.   The Moroccan Association of Nursing Sciences and Sanitary Techniques noted that the nurses had been working in “the absence of specialists, pediatrician or pharmacist, and amid a severe shortage of human resources in the hospital.” The nurses’ arrest came amid allegations that the newborn’s death and the deterioration of the health of five other babies were caused by “poor vaccine quality.” The nurses’ friends and family shared videos of their release on social media, although they had hoped for them to be released on New Year’s. However, the nurses association announced in a Facebook post on Monday that the nurses’ final release is still pending.   Last month at the House of Representatives, Morocco’s health minister, Anas Doukkali, denied that a vaccine was to blame for the newborn’s death. Based on investigations into the infants’ care, Doukkali confirmed that the maternity hospital uses the same vaccine as all other hospitals in Morocco, and there were no other complications recorded. Doukkali said that the medical staff at the hospital were quick to react and immediately transfer the infants to the hospital’s intensive care unit. The infants reportedly experienced breathing problems.

Rabat – The European Parliament has voted on the agriculture agreement between Morocco and the European Union, passing it by a large majority. The agreement was voted on in a plenary session in Strasbourg today. The agreement received 444 votes in favor of the agriculture deal. The deal aims to extend the agriculture trade between Morocco and the EU partners. On January 14, the EU and Morocco signed the fisheries agreement, which includes the waters off of Morocco’s southern provinces. The EU decision to adopt the agreement is a further rebuttal of Polisario’s allegations that Morocco “exploits the natural resources” of the region. Last week, a group of Sahrawis urged the EU to adopt the agreements, saying they are beneficial for the development of the region. In a petition, the group of Sahrawis wrote: “Since our country completed its territorial integrity by recovering its southern provinces, it has made significant efforts towards their sustainable development. Noticeable progress made in our southern provinces as the result of our country’s efforts to make development, both at large and in our regions, our top priority.” The group said that Morocco’s commitment to the development of the region is “well established.” “The southern provinces are now ranked above the national average for human development indicators.”

Rabat – Despite an overall stable economy and positive scores in a number of international reports on economic performance, Morocco is still in need of “more decisive structural reforms” to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth. The lukewarm assessment comes from a recent Global Risk Insights report.  Compiling a number of recent reports—including from the World Bank—the Global Risk Insights article considered Morocco as taking considerable steps in the right direction but in need of internal reforms to avoid derailing.  From pioneering a more inclusive education system to investing more in improving the lot of scores of unemployed young Moroccans, the North African kingdom “will need to grapple with some deeply rooted challenges before reaching its full potential as a regional powerhouse and premiere African hub for international investment,” according to the report. Morocco’s strengths include its robust presence in international affairs, especially its assertive and growing presence in African affairs, its trade and security partnerships with Europe, its new but promising partnership with China, and its longstanding alliance with the US.  While indispensable for the EU (on migration, for example) and strategic for the US (on counterterrorism efforts), Rabat is “becoming a media darling in China,” enticing Chinese investors and tourists.  Continuing setbacks include poor public investment management, corruption, human and minority rights, poor record on tax payments, and economic dependence on the external world.   “Despite spending on flashy infrastructure projects, like deals on bullet trains and founding new cities, many basic infrastructure and development needs around the country are not being met,” the report said.  The suggestion, as many critics of Morocco’s new high speed train have recently pointed out, is that the majority of the country’s high scale investments have been aimed at collecting “national prestige” or pride rather than practically impacting the socio-economic outcomes of millions of poor and low-income Moroccan families. While foreign investments fly into the country and infrastructure projects proliferate, sizable local needs remain unmet, keeping internal economic dynamics in a “fragile” and “vulnerable” state. As Morocco improves its global outreach and diversifies its trade and strategic partnerships, the report suggested, “certain key social and economic issues, including treatment of vulnerable populations, will present an important test as to whether Morocco will emerge in the future as a strong, inclusive economy.” It concluded, “In order to secure its place as a regional hub for growth and progress, internal reforms will be absolutely critical.”

Rabat – Morocco produced 6.6 billion eggs in 2018, 5.8 billion of which were produced in the formal sector, the National Association of Egg Producers (ANPO) has announced in Casablanca. The average egg consumption per person per year, according to ANPO Vice President Abdellatif Ezzaim, significantly increased between 2010 and 2018, from 138 to 185 eggs. However, the consumption level remains very low compared to global figures. Morocco produced sufficient eggs for the Moroccan market’s demand, creating a surplus to be exported to other African countries, Ezzaim said Tuesday at a press briefing on National Egg Day. In April last year, Ukraine’s state food service announced that the Moroccan government gave the green light to open the Moroccan market to Ukrainian chicken and meat. Although local production met Morocco’s demand for eggs, in December, the two countries agreed on a veterinary certificate to  allow Morocco to import egg products from Ukraine. Morocco observed the 11th National Egg Day under the theme “the Importance of the Egg in the Diet” this year. The objective, explained Ezzaim, is to encourage people to consume eggs by increasing consumers’ awareness of the benefits of eggs as a nutritious and balanced daily food. Egg Day also sought to counter misconceptions about egg consumption. Ezzaim added that the egg production sector has received an estimated cumulative investment of MAD 3.4 billion, and annual revenue in the sector is MAD 8.6 billion. The vice president of ANPO pointed out that the egg sector employs 23,000 people directly and nearly 34,000 people indirectly in marketing and distribution channels. Morocco has 3 approved hatcheries producing 15 million chicks, 252 farms authorized to rear laying hens, 5 approved packaging centers, and 3 egg processing units, according to 2016 statistics. ANPO is a professional non-profit organization founded in 1995. It is a founding member of Morocco’s Interprofessional Federation of the Poultry Sector (FISA). ANPO’s purpose is to show the economic benefits of the egg sector and to study measures to improve the sector’s organization, its distribution, marketing methods, and adaptations to the market’s demands.

Rabat – A married woman has lost her appeals case after the Court of Cassation in Bouleman in the Atlas Mountains sentenced her to adultery for kissing a man. According to Legal-Agenda, the defense said the court’s decision had no basis.  The woman’s lawyers appealed the court’s initial ruling, but they failed to change the court’s decision.  The court had sentenced the woman to four months in prison and imposed a fee of MAD 5,000 on her. For the court, the woman’s confession to the judicial police was sufficient to prove infidelity, leading to her sentence in accordance to Article 493 of the criminal code. Article 493 of the penal code says that “evidence of offences under articles 490 and 491 may be established either by a record prepared by a judicial police officer certifying violation of the offence, by confession in letters or documents by the accused or by a legal confession (Morocco 1963).” “It is clear from the provisions of the contested decision that the court’s decision was based on the right to convict the appellant for the crime of infidelity as she confessed in her statement to the judicial police that she exchanged kisses with a strange man,” the Court of Appeals said. The court defined the act as an “act of marital infidelity against the husband and a betrayal of the marital relationship and loyalty and trust between the spouses.”

Rabat – The Tramway Company of Rabat-Sale (STRS) has shared an update on the progress of extension works for Rabat tramway’s Line 2. The extension will allow the tramway to carry an additional 40,000 passengers per day, bringing the passenger capacity up to 150,000 per day. The extension works of Line 2, which cost MAD 1.7 billion, is 90 percent complete in Rabat and 40 percent in Sale, STRS President Said Zarrou told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) Tuesday. Two tram lines, Line 1 and 2, currently connect the sister cities of Rabat and Sale. The current 2.4 kilometer-long extension of Line 2 in Rabat will add 4 stations serving the 135,000 inhabitants of the Yacoub Al Mansour neighborhood. The four new stops on the line in Rabat will link the Moulay Youssef Hospital terminus to Alkifah Avenue, through Essalam Avenue. As part of the extension, said Zarrou, three green spaces will be created in the Yacoub Al Mansour neighborhood and local parks will be developed. The new stops are expected to begin service in February. The current extension works of Line 2 in Sale are expected to be completed in July. The 4.6-kilometer-long extension will add 8 stations serving the 265,000-habitant neighborhoods of Moulay Ismail and Al Quaria. Earlier this month, local authorities approved a new Rabat Tramway extension project to Temara, 15 kilometers south of Rabat, and to Sale Al Jadida, 10 kilometers east of Rabat. The extension will cost MAD 4.5 billion. The central government and local authorities will contribute 50 percent of the total budget. On October 24, 2017, King Mohammed VI launched the 7-kilometer extension works of Line 2 of the Rabat-Sale tramway. The Rabat-Sale tramway began operating on May 23, 2011. The network covers 19.5 kilometers with 31 stops.

Rabat – Pro-Polisario associations, who describe themselves as “representatives of Sahrawi civil society in Morocco and in the Tindouf camps,” have petitioned against the continuation of Morocco-EU trade agreements. Challenging Rabat’s legitimacy in the southern territories, the group is demanding that the European Union review the terms of its trade deals with Morocco. The group outlined its position in a letter they sent late last week to European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation, and Customs Pierre Moscovici. In the letter, they expressed “deep concern” about the completed and ongoing negotiations between Rabat and Brussels to renew trade agreements—especially fisheries and agriculture—including Western Sahara. They “firmly” opposed “any agreement with Morocco including Western Sahara,” according to pro-Polisario outlets. The challenge comes amid a flurry of EU-Morocco activities in recent weeks to finalize months of Rabat-Brussels negotiations to renew the fisheries and agriculture agreements. Despite usual challenges from pro-separatist circles, the fisheries deal was struck earlier this week, while the agriculture agreement is set to pass through an EU Parliament vote tomorrow, January 16. Opposing petitions As a counter-petition calling for the EU to call off its deals with an “occupying force,” the letter also comes in direct response to a recent petition by pro-Rabat Sahrawis who called for the renewal of the agreements. Referring to Morocco as a “motherland,” the pro-Morocco petition said that Rabat’s numerous development investments in the southern provinces in recent years showcase its attachment to improving living standards and employment prospects for the disputed region. “Since our country completed its territorial integrity by recovering its southern provinces, it has made significant efforts towards their sustainable development. Noticeable progress made in our southern provinces as the result of our country’s efforts to make development, both at large and in our regions, our top priority,” the pro-Morocco petition read. It argued that Morocco’s commitment to its southern provinces is “well-established.” “The theory that the Fisheries Agreement and the Agricultural Agreement do not benefit the local population concerned is not valid … To oppose these two agreements would put at risk the thousands of families who are financially dependent on maritime and agricultural activities in our southern provinces.” Despite such impassioned local support for Morocco’s position, the pro-separatist letter maintained that renewing EU-Morocco deals would be “in violation” of the EU commission’s “good administrative behavior.” Although recent developments, including the EU Commission’s reiteration of its support for Morocco’s position that locals benefit from the agreements’ financial returns, suggest the renewal of the agriculture deal, the pro-Polisario challenge is nothing to sniff at. Last week, pro-Polisario European MP Paloma Lopez launched a parliamentary “battle” with the aim of challenging the legal foundations of the Morocco-EU agriculture agreement. An established “Sahrawi independence” supporter, Lopez seeks to “collect the 76 signatures required for a resolution proposal” to delay the EU Parliament’s vote.

Rabat – Spanish sports news outlet AS said that FIFA chairman Gianni Infantino is “willing to support” a joint 2030 World Cup bid between Morocco and EU countries. The news site said that Infantino recalled that the Fifa  status does not prohibit a cross-confederation between European countries and an African country. Infantino came to Morocco to take place at FIFA’s Executive Football Summit in Marrakech from January 15-17. Upon his arrival, President of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation Fouzi Lekjaa and President of the Confederation of African Football Ahmad Ahmad received Infantino. “I am happy to be here in Marrakech,” Infantino told reporters. During the event, FIFA President will review the possible joint bid between Morocco, Spain, and Portugal. The event agenda also includes the discussion of strategic football issues and discussing the best practices between the leaders of member associations in open and constructive debates. FIFA will also discuss its future competitions, and the development of Women’s in particular, as well as the Video Assistant Referee (VAR). This meeting will be marked by the examination of proposals from FIFA’s national member associations to increase the number of teams qualified for the World Cup from the next edition scheduled for 2022 in Qatar. Infantino already showed his respect towards joint bids for the World Cup, during the 2026 competition between Morocco and Canada-Mexico-US bid. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced his idea of a cross-confederation bid during his visit to Morocco in November 2018. “We are launching a joint message, which is that this will be a bid between two continents. The King of Morocco is receptive and we’re going to work on it with Portugal. We are very excited about it,” said Sanchez.  He also told the press that Morocco’s government welcomed the idea of a joint bid. Morocco, which is determined to submit a bid again for the 2030 World Cup, did not comment on Spain’s offer. Although FIFA said that its status does not prevent a cross confederation bid for the massive tournament, the President of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Aleksander Ceferin said that he is completely against the joint bid between Africa and EU. “Someone should say once to the politicians it’s not up to them to speak if they will be hosts of the Euros or the World Cup or not,” said the UEFA president. This will be Morocco’s sixth attempt to host the competition.

Rabat – Belgian employment organizations Voka and Agoria have started a pilot project to bring Moroccan computer scientists to Flanders, the Flemish region in northern Belgium, the Belgian magazine the Brussels Times reported Monday. In collaboration with the Flemish Service for Employment and Vocational Training (VDAB), Voka and Agoria plan to receive the first employees in the second half of 2019. It is the first time that VDAB and the Belgian employment organizations are searching for professionals outside Europe, according to the magazine. Through the pilot project, Belgian employers decided to attract 30 Moroccan IT specialists over a period of 18 months after Belgium recognized a serious labor shortage in IT jobs. According to the Brussels Times, there were only 900 qualified job-seekers for 4,000  “analyst developer” vacancies in Flanders last year. “This is a pilot project. If this works well, we can scale it up quickly,” the Belgian magazine quoted Bert Mons, director of Voka West-Flanders. Explaining why they chose Morocco, the Belgian Development Agency, Enabel, said that the North African country is considered a partner to Belgium and provides high-quality IT training courses. Once vacancies are determined, the Brussels Times explained, Morocco’s national recruitment agency will select suitable IT students. Flemish companies will then recruit the Moroccan IT professionals with contracts ranging from six months to one year with a possibility to sign permanent contracts afterwards.  The Moroccan employees “will receive a competitive salary, which should help them find housing on the rental market,” Enabel said. The magazine quoted Tom Meulenbergs, spokesperson of the Belgian minister of development cooperation, saying that “Belgium attracts the most low-skilled migrants of all Europe.” “It is clear that our migration policy must become much more selective, as is the case in Canada and Australia, for example. We need to be much more self-determining about which profiles come here. This pilot project is a start.”  The president of the Flemish Brabant chapter, Jean-Paul Van Avermaet, has criticized the plan to bring Moroccan IT professionals to work in Flanders, the Brussels Times reported in a second article today. “Instead of doing as we did in the 1960s and importing workers from Morocco, we should be looking inside our own ranks,” Van Avermaet said at Voka’s new year reception Monday evening. The official referred to a time when Belgium’s integration policy failed to control labor migration and large numbers of industry and coal mine workers arrived. “At the moment the rate of employment is only 70%. Of the remaining 30%, only 5% are looking for work. We need to make an effort towards that group,”  Van Avermaet asserted. However, the Brussels Times pointed out that Van Avermaet’s figures refer to the overall labor market. “The tech sector is experiencing a critical shortage of qualified applicants for the many vacancies which remain chronically open.” Van Avermaet cited some alternative solutions to the IT job crisis in Flanders, including “investment in digitalisation and allowing people to work for longer,” according to the Belgian magazine. The official also mentioned the higher number of retired people compared to those who enter the workforce. “The average retirement age in this country is 61, somewhat lower than in the EU as a whole.”

Rabat – The jailed Hirak Rif leader Nasser Zefzafi abstained from attending an appeal hearing on Monday at the Casablanca Court of Appeals, due to what he calls the “absence of fair trial conditions.” Zefzafi’s father, Ahmed Zefzafi, shared his son’s statement on Facebook yesterday, announcing that his boycott is irrevocable. As quoted by his father, Zefzafi said that the trial “is but a stage play by the judicial institution … Therefore, I declare to the local, national and international public that I am boycotting this trial, in which the most basic conditions of fairness do not exist.” 
 
The appeal hearing of Hirak detainees was initially scheduled for January 7 but the court postponed it to Monday, January 14. The court did not report the reasons for the delay. Eight days after being sentenced to 20 years in June 2018, Zefzafi refused to appeal his sentences. Along with other detained Hirak activists, Zefzafi started a series of hunger strikes to protest alleged torture and harassment, and ask, according to his father, “for the rights that other prisoners enjoy: that he be taken out of isolation in a solitary cell and put him in a dignified cell where he can see and talk.” Eventually, Zefzafi decided to appeal in July. The court handed down sentences varying from 1 to 20 years to 54 Hirak activists for participating in the “unauthorized” Hirak protests. The Hirak movement began in October 2016 after the death of Mohcine Fikri, an Al Hoceima fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities. The incident angered many, causing protests across the country, especially in Al Hoceima province, which condemned Fikri’s death and social disparities in Morocco. Police arrested an estimated 400 activists and protesters involved in the protests in 2016 and 2017.

By zakaria Ouadghiri Rabat – Moroccan-American rapper French Montana told TMZ on Saturday that artists like R. Kelly have received unfair treatment in the music industry because of their personal issues. “All the greats went down like that,” Montana said. “Let somebody enjoy their legacy. Whatever happened, happened.” He later tweeted, “Let me be clear. My heart is with the victims.”

The documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly,” broadcast recently on the US channel Lifetime, has re-ignited public debate on the allegations facing R. Kelly. The series looks back at years of accusations of statutory rape, physical violence, and kidnapping involving the American singer. 
Moroccan-American rapper Kevin Gates and his wife Dreka parodied the documentary. A video shows the couple inside a car joking about artists who have been sexually assaulting underage girls “for years.”

Kanye West made similar comments. “If we’re gonna tear down artists, let’s go ahead and take da Vinci out the Louvre. Let’s take down all the art.” DJ Paul of Southern hip hop group Three 6 Mafia sided with Montana and West. “You know he got talent, his personal life shouldn’t have nothing to do with that.”

Celine Dion is reportedly pulling her 1998 duet “I’m Your Angel” with Kelly from all streaming services. Lady Gaga also removed her collaboration with Kelly “Do What U Want (With My Body)” from streaming platforms, sharing a statement that she supports Kelly’s alleged victims.

Kelly is currently under investigation in both Georgia and Illinois regarding his alleged sex crimes.

Rabat – Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba left Morocco on Monday for Libreville,  to chair a ceremony of the new government’s swearing-in. Ondimba had appointed a new prime minister from Rabat. On January 13, Ondimba appointed Julien Nkoghe Bekale as a prime minister, replacing Emmanuel Issoze Ngondet after a thwarted coup attempt. AFP quoted a source close to the president saying that “doctors have estimated that this trip poses no danger to his health.” Gabon faced a coup attempt on January 7, when a group of soldiers seized a state broadcaster and announced their plans  against Ondimba. Authorities intervened and two rebels were killed while the military retook the national radio office. The Gabonese president promised his citizens that he would return to the country after recovering, promising people “ a new day.” “It is true that I have been through a difficult period, as sometimes happens in life,” he said. “Today, as you can see, I am better and I am preparing to meet you again soon,” he added.

Rabat – Spanish law enforcement have arrested a 27-year-old Moroccan suspect for alleged ties to ISIS. According to a statement quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), police arrested the Moroccan man in Manvila in southern Spain. According to the investigation, the suspect was promoting terrorism on social networks. Through the internet, the suspect “maintained contacts with ISIS terrorists in the Syrian zone controlled by the terrorist organization, to whom he reportedly expressed his willingness to join them and fight alongside them.” The suspect, according to the investigation, was unable to travel to Syria “because of the current difficulties faced by the terrorist organization in that country and the lack of financial resources.” The statement added that the suspect was planning to commit a terrorist attack anywhere he was able. In December 2018, the head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ),  Abdelhak Khiame, said that the defeat of ISIS in the Middle East does not mean the end of the war against the terrorist organization. He added that social media helps terrorists to spread their ideologies easily. Khiame said that “many people adopted this ISIS ideology” and are waiting for an opportunity to wage terror attacks. He said that some of these people use ISIS’s lone wolf strategy, which has occurred in several European countries, including Spain. Recently, ISIS suspects targeted Spain. Terrorists carried out attacks using knives and vehicle ramming, driving into people deliberately. Morocco and Spain are partnering against terror through the exchange of information.

Rabat – A group of Moroccan pedagogical inspectors gathered on Thursday, January 10, at the National Union of the Moroccan Press in Rabat to discuss the country’s education system, from pedagogy to human resources. The meeting, attended by Morocco World News, voiced concern for the fate of the Moroccan educational system because it still suffers from deficiencies and poor infrastructure. It starts with teaching methods. In 2000, Morocco decided to move from a system of “pedagogical goals” to “competency-based learning.” The approach of pedagogical goals is more traditional, relying on a general subject rather than objective teaching. It also focuses on discipline and what students will learn from specific lessons at a specific period of time rather than students’ creative abilities. Meanwhile, competency-based learning focuses on each student’s learning abilities, considers the pace by which a student can learn, and encourages more interactions between the student and teacher to develop critical, creative thinking, and argumentative skills. However, according to the Association of Pedagogical Inspectors, Moroccan schools continue to rely on pedagogical goals rather than the competency-based learning method when it comes to exams,creating confusion for students. While school curricula and class activities may rely on the competency-based learning method, tests and exams may, for example, require answers that are heavily focused on memorization. The association presented reports on the situation, which also reflect a recent World Bank report titled “Expectations and Aspirations: A new framework for education.” According to the report, Morocco and other MENA countries’ curricula rely heavily on rote learning, memorization, and repetition, an educational system that focuses on “passive learning” and “violent discipline.” The research found 60 percent of eighth-grade students in Morocco are required to memorize facts, mathematics and science rules, and the “procedures” of most lessons, if not all. Deficiencies in the country’s educational system is not news to Moroccans. The association criticized some school administrators and teachers, especially those working in primary education.  The association also noted that primary school children have poor knowledge accumulation which could also be blamed on teacher absenteeism.  When it comes to infrastructure, the association noted based on a number of reports by pedagogical inspectors in Morocco, that many schools with 700 or 800 students have only two or three toilets. Students have no choice but to take turns. It is especially hard for girls, who often drop out due to the poor infrastructure. Meanwhile, ironically, other educational institutions in Morocco are over-equipped, for example having 24 restrooms for 25 students. Similarly, in August, Morocco’s Court of Auditors identified serious deficiencies in public and private schools regarding infrastructure, reception capacity, and the number of teachers. In its 2016-2017 annual report, the Court of Auditors noted deficits in the basic facilities of some schools, such as connections to drinking water, electricity, and sewage. Some other schools did not have basic infrastructure such as fences, sanitary units, sports fields, multimedia rooms, libraries, internet connections, and teaching materials. The report also cited the lack of pedagogical inspectors’ supervision of teachers, especially through continuous training.

Rabat – A bus belonging to the M’dina bus company caught fire at midday at the intersection of Boulevard Mohamed Zerktouni and Boulevard Anfa in Casablanca.

Firefighters brought the fire under control after a few minutes of intervention. Africa Intelligence reported in January that efforts to replace Casablanca’s bus operator M’Dina Bus are getting bogged down. 
In November, a video of a bus driver working for M’dina Bus went viral. The video shows the bus driver using his umbrella to protect himself from rain that was coming through a leak in the roof of the bus. While the company has held a contract with Casablanca since 2004, due to “the poor condition of the city buses and the fact that the company did not comply with most of its investment program,” Casablanca will not renew the contract when it expires this year.

Rabat – British cyclist Robert Adams, 15, recently won the Morocco Desert Challenge in the E-Bike 25 class. Adams told CNN he relied on his father’s tips and GPS tracking to find his way to victory. Alone for much of the race, the teenager finished 30 minutes ahead of his closest competitor. “The navigation is a skill in itself. I think that’s what makes this event so unique,” Adams told CNN. “You could be the fastest rider there but if your navigation isn’t up to scratch, you’re not going to do well.”  “The further you go from the big cities the friendlier and more interesting the people seemed to become,” added Adams. 
E-Bike Desert Challenge requires cyclists to cross the desert of southern Morocco by bike for five days. Adams competed in the 25-class category, which uses bikes with 250-watt electric motors that can go up to 25 kilometers per hour.  Further showing the potential of electric power in Morocco, the second race of the new Formula E season took place Saturday at the Marrakech ePrix. Morocco is moving forward with electric energy. The country boasts the world’s largest concentrated solar energy farm, the Noor complex, which is expected to provide electricity to over one million people when it is complete. After Libya and Tunisia, the rally arrived in Morocco in 2013. Belgium’s Gert Duson, the race director, and Elisabeth Haldermans organized Roc Du Maroc, an extreme mountain-bike endurance challenge, and the Togo Jungle Challenge.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi spoke about his strategy to reform Morocco’s education system and vocational training. Amzazi recognized the deficiencies in the job market, emphasizing that more than 600 engineers leave the country to look for better opportunities abroad every year. Amzazi, however, argued that brain drain is an “international phenomenon.” He added that it is the result of graduate students desire to look for more “favorable working conditions.” The official said that educated people also leave because of technological transformations and the appeal of international laboratories. He acknowledged that Morocco does not provide incentives to attract educated Moroccans across the world. He noted that if Moroccan researchers return to Morocco from Europe, they start at the lowest administrative rank, an unacceptable demotion for university researchers. Amzazi emphasized the importance of creating new positions to ensure that returning Moroccans maintain their higher levels in Moroccan universities and institutes if they decide to return. In an October 2018 speech, King Mohammed VI urged the government to create more job opportunities for Moroccan youth. Regarding brain drain, the King said,  “There are tempting incentives which induce some students to remain abroad after completing their studies.” A recent Gallup report showed that Morocco would lose 19 percent of its adult population and 29 percent of its 15 to 19-year-olds if migration were free. Another survey from Moroccan marketing agency Sunergia showed that the most common reasons that Moroccans give for emigrating are “lack of trust in the Moroccan government” and “the high unemployment rate.” A 2018 report from ReKrute showed that 91 percent of Moroccan professionals aged 35 and below are tempted to move abroad in search of better work conditions and quality of life, which includes health care and comfort. Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) said in November 2018 that theunemployment rate fell slightly from 10.6 percent to 10 percent between the third quarters of 2017 and 2018. The government now is attempting to increase employment by introducing vocational training programs under the instructions of King Mohammed VI. The monarch also ordered the government to create a committee to give specific solutions to curb youth unemployment. The minister said that his department continues to implement a strategic vision for education in training. “The next phase will be characterized by the implementation of major structural reform and the strengthening of human resources engagement.” After his appointment as minister of education, Amzazi announced a reform proposal for Moroccan education and vocational training centers. Amzazi also seeks to reduce the rate of school dropouts from 6 percent in rural primary schools to 1 percent by 2024-2025. The minister also promised a decrease in the rate of dropouts in secondary schools from 12 to 3 percent, in both rural and urban areas, by the 2024-2025 school year.

Rabat – Africa, Europe, and North and South America will witness a total lunar eclipse on January 20-21, the last of its kind until 2021. The moon will appear a red-orange color, a phenomenon known as the Blood Moon. “What a lunar eclipse displays is the color of all of Earth’s sunrises and sunsets reaching the moon,” NASA scientist Noah Petro told Space.com. People in Europe and Africa will see the eclipse shortly before sunrise, whereas those in North and South America will be able to see the eclipse by midnight.  The total lunar eclipse will last about an hour, according to NASA. The next total eclipse will occur on May 26, 2021, and will be visible over the Pacific Ocean.  The last total eclipse occurred on July 27, 2018. It was visible in central Asia and Africa. The last supermoon occurred on January 31, 2018. An earlier supermoon was seen on the first day of the same month.  In the last three months of 2016, earth witnessed three supermoons in a row. November 30’s supermoon was the closest supermoon, at a distance of 356,508 kilometers from earth. The supermoon was the closest full moon to earth in 69 years, according to Space.com.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun has said that merchants and craftsmen subject to the lump sum system are exempt from electronic billing under tax law, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. Last week, Minister of Trade and Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy  Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, Government Spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi, and the General Directorate of Taxes (DGI), all reacted to the new tax measures on the use of electronic invoicing.   The tax situation of merchants and service providers subject to the lump sum system has not changed, Benchaaboun affirmed in response to a question in the House of Representatives on Monday in Rabat. The minister noted that there was a misunderstanding of the new provisions of the 2018 Finance Law regarding the new tax measures using electronic invoicing. The new tax measures, which recently sparked an uproar among merchants, stipulate that merchants should use an electronic system to issue invoices. To do this, merchants must have billing software approved by tax authorities and an information system allowing a common database with the tax authorities. Last week, El Othmani announced that the government will suspend the implementation of the new tax measures using electronic invoicing, planned to come into force in early 2019 to fight tax fraud. Benchaaboun reiterated Monday that the electronic invoicing system concerns only professionals subject to financial control. No one has the right to demand or impose electronic invoicing in commercial transactions “in the absence of an organic law governing the modalities of its implementation,” he stressed. The minister added that the development of the organic law regarding electronic billing will inevitably involve the input of those concerned and professional associations, taking into account the specificities of each commercial activity. Meeting the demands of small merchants and craftsmen, Benchaaboun said that professional associations will take part in the upcoming conferences on national tax with the aim to start broad debate on how to define a legal framework for local commerce. El Khalfi said Thursday that the new measures “will not be applied until an agreement between all parties is reached.” Trade minister Elalamy announced last week he will meet with the chambers of commerce and industry, customs, and merchants’ representatives tomorrow to discuss electronic billing and merchants’ demands.

Rabat – The European Parliament has announced a meeting for January 23 to conclude the EU-Morocco fisheries deal. On its agenda, the Parliament said that the meeting will be on the “conclusion of the partnership agreement in the field of sustainable fisheries between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco, its implementing protocol and an exchange of letters.” On Monday, the EU and Morocco signed a new fisheries deal replacing one that expired in July 2018. The fisheries deal includes the waters off of Western Sahara despite allegations from Polisario. The separatist group has been claiming that Morocco is “exploiting” the natural resources of the region. With the conclusion of the agreement, the EU has not responded favorably to Polisario’s allegations. The agreement covers the Atlantic ocean from parallel 35 to parallel 22, from Cap Spartel in northern Morocco to Cap Blanc in southern Morocco, including the waters off the southern provinces. Rebutting Polisario’s claims, a group of Sahrawis from the Laayoune-Sakia, El Hamra, and Dakhla-Oued Ed Dahab regions urged EU and Morocco to renew the agreement in a petition. The group argued that Morocco has been making efforts to ensure sustainable development in the region. “Noticeable progress made in our southern provinces as the result of our country’s efforts to make development, both at large and in our regions, is our top priority,” reads the petition. Spain has also supported the renewal of the agreement. In an interview with Agrosfera program, Spanish Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Luis Planas said he hoped that the agreement between the two parties “is approved before March.” After the fisheries deal, Morocco and the EU are now working to renew their agriculture deal.

Rabat – Several news outlets have speculated that the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) will announce the country’s intent to compete for the hosting rights of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN).  While some quoted sources from the Moroccan government saying that Morocco will compete for CAN 2025, others quoted sources from FRMF emphasizing that Morocco is not interested in bidding for the African tournament. The same scenario played out when the Confederation of African Football (CAF) stripped Cameroon of the hosting rights for the 2019 CAN, due to lack of infrastructure, in November 2018. Several sports experts predicted that Morocco would take over, suggesting that the North African country might be CAF’s preference if it decided to bid. Moroccan officials, however, denied that Morocco wanted to take over hosting CAN. When CAF opened bids for the tournament, Morocco shocked all when it did not show interest in hosting the tournament. South Africa and Egypt both competed, and Egypt won the hosting rights. South Africa was not satisfied with the decision, claiming that CAF held the poll 24 hours earlier than expected without informing its delegation of the change. A South African official also implied that Morocco had lobbied against it in favor of the Egyptian bid. Morocco is now mobilizing its assets to clinch the hosting rights of the 2030 World Cup tournament after six failed attempts to host.  Morocco’s chances, however, may increase because Spain is interested in a cross-confederation bid with Morocco and Portugal. The possible joint bid is expected to be one of the topics that FRMF will discuss during the ongoing FIFA executive summit in Marrakech January 15-17. The president of FIFA, Gianni Infantino, arrived in Marrakech to participate in the event.

Rabat – On Monday, King Mohammed VI visited several projects of the Rabat medina rehabilitation, part of a national plan to renovate and restore Morocco’s medinas (walled cities). The King visited the Bab Chellah and the souk Essabat streets in Rabat. The monarch also visited the restoration sites of El Mellah square and Sabbaghine street. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), projects in the sites are 75 percent complete. The King launched the renovation program in May 2018 to improve access to the old medina and enhance its attractiveness. The program also includes the development of the Tamejajet sports complex, improving the surroundings of medina walls, and street paving. In addition, the streets, alleys, and small squares will get addresses, and workers will install information markers. Other projects are also underway in Rabat, including an underground parking project at the Bab El Had entrance to the medina. Rabat has completed several projects, including development projects in Lagza street, the renovation of the wall around the Kasbah of the Oudayas, the revamping of El Marsa avenue, the development of community sport fields in Bab Chellah, the building of a shopping arcade, and the consolidation of the El Mellah cliff.  Construction continues on other projects, including the restoration of the wall from Bab Laalou to Bab El Had. In addition to Rabat, the project also includes Sale, Meknes, Tetouan, Marrakech and Essaouira. In October, Morocco’s Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit announced an MAD 2.35 billion budget for the renovation programs. The Hassan II Fund for Economic and Social Development will contribute approximately 40 percent of the budget.

Rabat – Morocco has sent a delegation to Accra, Ghana, to investigate a sexual assault allegation against the country’s ambassador to Ghana, Mohamed Farahat. Jemimah Flinthood-Brace, a local agent at the embassy, says Ambassador Farahat tried to “abuse her on two occasions” when she entered his office for work. In her resignation letter, a copy of which Morocco World News received, Brace said she had to resign from her post at the embassy because she could not deal with the psychological toll of her boss’s sexual harassment.  “This letter is to inform you that I am forced to resign from my position as local agent at the embassy of the kingdom of Morocco in Accra, Ghana. The resignation is the result of a sexual harassment I have endured for the past few weeks.” According to Brace’s letter, Ambassador Farahat made sexual advances on her on two occasions in early and late December. “On two separate occasions I have [been] sexually harassed by you. Fist (sic) on 11th December where you groped me in your office after I had served coffee and gain in your office on 20th December where you told me to turn around so you could clap my buttocks.” “It is rather unfortunate that the person we should be able to seek refuge in when we are harassed sexually by our colleagues at the Embassy is the one who is involved in such an unprincipled act. I will not allow the stress that comes with being sexually harassed [to] be a part of my life. Nothing is worth more than my mental wellbeing and peace of mind.” On the same day she resigned from her position at the embassy, January 4, Brace addressed a formal complaint to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rabat.  The complaint letter, which Morocco World News received, gave details of the allegations, recounting the two incidents that the resignation letter had briefly mentioned. According to Brace, the ambassador tried to buy her silence by promising her better prospects for her career at the embassy. “He told me he would sponsor a month–long internship for me at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in Rabat, but first he had to make sure I was courageous enough to earn it.” Brace then detailed how the ambassador began to sexually assault her. She concluded, “I managed to break free and told him if that was a test of my courage, then I was timid.” Farahat has been Morocco’s ambassador to Ghana since April 2018. Prior to that, the 60-year-old diplomat, a graduate of several political science and international relations programs in Morocco and France, including the prestigious National School of Administration (ENA) in Paris, held a number of high-profile positions in Morocco’s foreign ministry. His previous posts include chief of the foreign ministry’s cultural section, chief of the ministry’s international cooperation and regional partnerships office, and head of mission at the Moroccan embassy in China.  Morocco is investigating to “determine what really happened” and inflict relevant punishments, according to an official statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Rabat – Police at Mohammed V Airport in Casablanca have arrested a Nigerian national for attempting to smuggle 5.13 kilograms of cocaine. The 36-year-old Nigerian national concealed the cocaine in his personal luggage, according to a statement from the General Directorate of National Police (DGSN). Police put the suspect in custody for further investigation under the supervision of the public prosecutor. The operation follows a similar arrest at Mohammed V International Airport. Police arrested a Nigerian traveler with 72 capsules of cocaine inside his stomach on January 1. Police seized 1.65 tons of cocaine in 2018. Among other drugs seized were 1.5 million psychotropic and ecstasy pills and 52 tons of cannabis resin. The spokesperson of the Moroccan government, Mustapha El Khalfi, said in December 2018 that Morocco has adopted a “multidimensional national strategy to fight illegal drugs.” According to El Khalfi, the danger of the drug trafficking phenomenon is “increasing because these networks developed their methods to produce and promote new dangerous and cheap pills which quickly destroy young people’s lives.”

Rabat – Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) has introduced a training program in three foreign languages, French, English, and Spanish, so that police can smoothly communicate with foreigners. The program seeks to enable police officers to aid foreign residents and tourists visiting Morocco.  The language program is part of an initiative to modernize and positively transform Morocco’s security services. Trainees at the Royal Institute of Police will reportedly be the first to benefit from the program before its full integration in the pedagogical training program. Arabic and Tamazight (Berber) are the two official languages in Morocco, whereas French is the most common foreign language in the country.  The program is within the framework of DGSN’s goal to include modern technology in its training programs to improve security. Statistics show Morocco is already generally a safe country. The US Department of State ranked Morocco among the world’s least dangerous countries in its January 2018 report. The global risk expert International SOS also launched the 2019 Travel Risk Map showing Morocco as a country with “low” risk, as safe as most European countries, the US, and Canada. The study takes into account “the travel security risk rating” which is based on threats posed to travelers by political violence, terrorism, social unrest, and crime.

Rabat – Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) has issued a statement on the results of Morocco’s household survey for the fourth quarter of 2018. The reported raised concerns regarding the financial situation of Moroccan families, unemployment, and families’ abilities to save their finances. HCP said that 62.8 percent of families have  incomes that cover their expenses, while 38.8 percent go into debt or use their savings. (The HCP figures, which add up to 101.6 percent, indicate a miscalculation but suggest Moroccans’ salaries on the whole are unequal to their spending.) Only 4.4 percent are saving part of their income. During the fourth quarter of 2018, 90.4 percent of families said that food prices had increased over the last 12 months, while only 0.1 percent believed the opposite. HCP said that more Moroccans had a negative financial outlook than previously. The balance of the index “stabilized at a negative level of – 90.3 points instead of – 88.1 points during the previous quarter and – 88.5 points during the same period last year.” Moroccan families also expect an increase in food prices over the next 12 months. About 86.7 percent of families expect that food prices will increase, compared to 0.3 percent who expect food prices will go down. HCP said that 78.8 percent of families expect a rise in unemployment, while only 8.8 percent expect the opposite over the next 12 months. “The balance of opinion thus remained negative at least 70 points,” the statement added. The Moroccan government is still trying to find solutions for the high unemployment rate. King Mohammed VI called on the government to open more vocational training centers.  The monarch also ordered the government to create a committee to elaborate specific solutions to curb youth unemployment. Only 19.9 percent of Moroccan families saw an improvement in the quality of education services, compared to 45 percent who believe that education quality is continuously deteriorating.  A recent report from Morocco’s Court of Auditors shed light on the major deficiencies in the implementation of the 2009-2012 education program to reform education. The report follows another survey from the court, identifying serious issues in public and private schools regarding infrastructure, reception capacity, and the number of teachers. With respect to human rights, some Moroccans feel “acute deterioration,” while others see improvement. HCP’s statement reported that 33.1 percent of families believe that the human rights situation in Morocco has improved while 19.9 percent believe that it has deteriorated. Moroccans also commented on the quality of administrative services. In the statement of HCP, 53.5 percent of families say they have not seen an improvement in the quality of administrative services during 2018.

Rabat – The spokesperson of the UN Secretary-General, Stephane Dujarric, confirmed that Morocco sent the UN a letter condemning Polisario’s provocative maneuvers east of Morocco’s defense wall and in the Guerguerat buffer zone in Western Sahara. In a press conference on January 11, Dujarric said: “I can confirm that we’ve received the letter from Morocco alleging violations of the ceasefire and related agreements in Western Sahara.” The official also briefed reporters about the procedure that the UN takes when it receives letters regarding violations. “There is an established procedure for assessing such allegations by either party undertaken by the UN Mission on the ground, based on the impartial monitoring and observation functions of our colleagues in Western Sahara,” said Dujarric. The UN official said that MINURSO was present at both of these “alleged incidents and did not observe anything amounting to a violation under the terms of applicable agreements.” He added that such violations are also “reported to the Security Council as part of the Mission’s normal reporting procedures.” Will Dujarric have to backtrack? In past statements, the UN spokesperson has denied Polisario’s violations of the ceasefire to only later admit them. Such missteps underscores the difficulty MINURSO has in monitoring the vast area east of Morocco’s defense wall and calls into question the veracity and accuracy of reports it submits to the UN Secretariat.  Morocco’s reports to the UN Secretariat and Security Council are based on satellite images that cannot be challenged. Meanwhile, MINURSO has at its disposal as little as two helicopters to monitor the whole east of the berm. In paragraph 56 of his annual report submitted to the Security Council last April, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, “Ground patrols east of the berm are limited in range during the day and do not operate at night. Logistics convoys are vulnerable and depend upon prior aerial reconnaissance of routes. Aerial patrols will become more available thanks to a third helicopter, but will remain limited to daylight hours.”  In paragraph 58, he added: “In Guerguerat, MINURSO observers remained limited in their ability to observe the area outside of the well-travelled portion of the road due to safety concerns, in particular, landmines and explosive remnants of war. Therefore, observations on the ground continued to require the support of helicopter reconnaissance.”   Paradoxically, Polisario admitted to its presence east of Morocco’s defense wall in the town of Mehriz, where Polisario conducted military actions and inaugurated “administration” facilities in the past few weeks. On January 6, the Polisario Front conducted military actions with heavy equipment. On January 7, the separatist group inaugurated facilities in the presence of Polisario leader Ibrahim Ghali. On behalf of the Moroccan government, Morocco’s Permanent Ambassador to the UN Omar Hilale said that two Polisario vehicles violated the UN restriction in the buffer zone of Guerguerat on January 8. It is not the first time that the UN spokesperson has not confirmed violations from the Polisario Front only to backtrack later. In April 2018, Dujarric said that MINURSO had not “observed any military elements in the northeast territory” amid Morocco’s anger over the separatists’ presence in buffer zones of the region. Nearly two weeks later, Dujarric reported that a MINURSO patrol unit was intercepted and faced Polisario gunfire on April 16, 2018. “MINURSO has informed the UN Security Council that on April 16, in the Tifariti area, MINURSO observers were intercepted by Polisario elements, who then proceeded to fire warning [shots],” the official said. Polisario’s actions might result in escalation because they are violations of UN Resolution 2414 and Resolution 2440, which urged Polisario not to return to the buffer zone of Guerguerat, nor relocate any structure to the east of the defense wall.

Rabat – The American business magazine Forbes published this month its list of richest billionaires in Africa. The 2019 Africa’s Billionaires list included Aziz Akhannouch, the Moroccan minister of agriculture and fisheries, ranked 13th and Othman Benjelloun, the CEO of BMCE Bank of Africa, ranked 15th. Africa’s richest man is Aliko Dangote of Nigeria for the eighth year in a row with an estimated $10.3 billion net worth. Fellow Nigerian Mike Adenuga is the continent’s second richest billionaire with an estimated $9.2 billion of wealth. South Africa’s diamond heir Nicky Oppenheimer is the third richest man in Africa with a current estimated $7.3 billion net worth, down from $7.7 billion the previous year. The number of African billionaires for this year reduced to only 20, down from 23 last year due to “plunging stock prices and weaker currencies,” according to Forbes.  “Four people fell off Forbes’ annual list of the continent’s richest since last year while one returned to the ranks after a four-year absence. All but four members of the list have smaller fortunes than a year ago.” Akhannouch, who is also the president of the Moroccan political party National Rally of Independence (RNI), has an estimated net wealth of $2.1 billion, and a $2.3 billion real-time net worth. Akhannouch’s main source of wealth is petroleum, according to Forbes. The 58-year-old billionaire is the majority owner of Akwa Group, a multibillion-dollar conglomerate company operating mainly in the oil and gas industry. His father Ahmed Ouldhadj Akhannouch founded the company in 1932, along with his partner Ahmed Wakrim. Akwa Group’s leading petrol subsidiaries include: Afriquia Gaz, a liquid petroleum gas distributor; Maghreb Oxygene, a provider of industrial and medical gases; and Afriquia SMDC, a filling station operator with over 400 Afriquia Gaz stations. Akwa also operates in the telecommunications, tourism, hotels, and real estate sectors. Benjelloun, the CEO of one of Morocco’s largest banks, BMCE Bank of Africa, has an estimated net worth of $1.7 billion. BMCE has branches in over 20 African countries, including Senegal, Kenya, and Congo. Banking and insurance are Benjelloun’s main source of wealth. The 86-year-old businessman took over insurance company RMA Watanya in 1988 and turned it into a leading insurer. His father was a large shareholder in the company.  Benjelloun also acquired a stake in French telecommunications firm Orange, one of the three leading telecommunication companies in Morocco. He acquired the stake through his holding company FinanceCom which operates through its subsidiaries in financial, transport, technology, industrial, insurance, and telecommunications sectors. According to Forbes, “FinanceCom is part of a project to develop a multibillion-dollar tech city in Tangiers that is expected to host 200 Chinese companies.” Benjelloun’s BMCE bank is sponsoring the construction of what is set to be the tallest building in Africa, “Mohammed VI Tower,” in Sale, near Rabat. The 250-meter tower will have 55 floors and will cost an estimated MAD 4 billion. On November 1, 2018, King Mohammed VI inaugurated the launch ceremony of the tower’s construction.

Rabat – South Africa’s football governing body, SAFA, has expressed disappointment over the voting process for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations  (CAN), calling the vote “unfair” and “unprocedural.” On November 30, CAF stripped Cameroon of the CAN 2019 hosting rights, pointing to “serious delays” in completing the required infrastructure and security concerns in the proximity of two planned venues.  CAF immediately called for tenders to replace Cameroon. And while many had expected Morocco to be part of the contest, the North African country chose not to run, leaving Egypt and South Africa as the only two last-minute contenders. “Without being arrogant, there is no other country on this continent that can display the facilities, infrastructure, and capacity that we have,” Russell Paul, SAFA’s chair, said right after the vote on January 8 in Dakar. Paul went on to lament that influence-peddling and politics played more of a role than sports-related criteria. According to the South African official, the Confederation of African Football (CAF), the governing body of African football, held the vote 24 hours earlier than expected without informing the South African delegation of the change in schedule. The episode reinforced SAFA’s suspicions that politics, not football-related technical matters, influenced the voting. “There was no inspection team. There was never an inspection team that arrived in South Africa‚ or that requested to come to South Africa. So‚ that gives an indication of: on what basis did they evaluate‚ by their own procedures? There was a company hired to evaluate. That company also did not send an inspection team…. The other aspect is that we don’t know‚ up until now‚ the reason for the move [of the vote] from the 9th to the 8th.” Moroccan lobbying? As criticism hit CAF after the vote, with many pointing the body’s favoritism toward Morocco, CAF President Ahmad Ahmad responded earlier last week. Without referring to voting or South Africa’s accusations, the Malagasy admitted his “love” and “admiration” for Morocco.  “I really like this country,” Ahmad said of the Maghreb country, explaining that Rabat’s South-South agenda and its genuine interest in advancing African football should inspire other African governments.  For critics, Morocco refrained from bidding because a Moroccan victory would have confirmed rumors about CAF supporting Rabat. Instead, Rabat reportedly threw its weight behind Cairo, coordinating with Egypt to prevent a successful South African bid. A letter SAFA sent to CAF after the vote complained that South Africa’s delegation was preparing to fly to Dakar “to make a bidding presentation” about the country’s technical merits, only to learn that the schedule had changed and Egypt’s delegation was already in Senegal.  Of the 17 CAF executive officials who decided on the fate of CAN 2019, only one voted for South Africa’s bid. With 16-1 in favor of Egypt, SAFA’s suspicions grew. Without naming Morocco, SAFA officials hinted late last week that Rabat coordinated with CAF and Egypt. ‘Punishing’ South Africa Meanwhile, CAF has not entirely dismissed South Africa’s accusations.  While the body has not directly addressed SAFA’s suspicions, a number of CAF sources who spoke to news outlets days after the Dakar episode hinted at the possibility of “punishment.” While the Morocco-Egypt coordination has not been proven, a CAF official told AFP that the result of the January 8 vote was more about “punishing South Africa for not voting for Morocco 2026.” In June 2018, Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup registered an overwhelming defeat at the hands of the North American bid (the US, Canada, and Mexico). Despite CAF’s incessant calls that “all African countries vote for Morocco,” South Africa was among the handful of African countries that chose to vote for the North American bid. In addition to ditching Morocco’s bid, however, Pretoria even tried to convince a number of other African countries—including Namibia—to vote for the North American trio. “South Africa’s choice to vote for the US, especially after President Trump called the continent ‘shithole’, was considered [within CAF] as anti-African,” the CAF source said.  “We knew that Egypt was the favorite, but we did not expect such difference in votes,” the source added.  While CAF sources and concerned countries’ officials are refraining from naming names at this point, the tussle between Pretoria and Rabat continues to be felt far from football stadiums.   Recently voted as a non-permanent member at the UN Security Council, South Africa has announced that it plans to use its two-year mandate to “support Western Sahara’s rights to self-determination.”  “The struggle of the Sahrawi people for freedom and independence is our struggle,” South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a speech last week.

Rabat – The Moroccan National Health Insurance Agency (ANAM) has denied  allegations that it applied an MAD 480 fee to each beneficiary of the Medical Assistance Plan (RAMED). ANAM affirmed that the procedures have not changed since RAMED started in 2008.

There is also no direct relationship between the agency and the beneficiaries. The agency has never sent any mail to the beneficiaries with regard to RAMED, ANAM said.

Beneficiaries’ financial contributions are set based on the decisions of the permanent local commissions, which include representatives of various ministries.  These commissions divide the beneficiaries into two categories: low-income people and people living in precarious circumstances. 
Low-income people are further divided into those who pay and those who do not. Paying low-income beneficiaries must pay MAD 120 per person per year. Local communities pay MAD 40 for non-paying low-income beneficiaries per year.  The contribution of each member of a household in precarious circumstances is MAD 120 per year, with a maximum threshold of MAD 600 per year for each household.  RAMED started as a pilot project in the Tadla-Azilal region in 2008 and became fully operational in 2012, ANAM assured Moroccans in a statement. 
Launched in 2012, RAMED extends basic medical coverage and seeks to improve access to basic services to millions of disadvantaged citizens.

Rabat – With his new song, “Roi” (King), French-Moroccan Bilal Hassani ranked first place in France’s selection competition’s semi-finals on Saturday, January 12, outperforming the other three semi-finalists. Hassani was ahead of French singer of Algerian descent Chimene Badi, Silvan Areg, and Aysat. It is all thanks to Hassani’s song that promotes love and tolerance and rejects hate and homophobia. Although the 19-year-old singer continues to receive harsh criticism online, mainly due to his sexual orientation, he performed with exceptional confidence at the contest. In the second week after its release, Hassani’s song Roi has already become a hit with more than 3 million views on YouTube.  Roi depicts Hassani’s love for singing from a very young age. Its music video features clips from his childhood, teenagehood, and from his life now. As a gay person, Hassani felt alienated and looked down on by society. However, he still decided to pursue his dreams. The young singer, who said, “I’ve always been who I am” in his new song, came out as gay to his followers at age 17. Hassani is already known for his participation in the second season of the Voice Kids, the French music talent show for children aged 6 to 15. Eurovision, a contest held since 1956, asks each participating country to submit an original song which determines whether the candidates will make it through the contest, which aims to support youth’s musical careers. This year, 42 countries will participate in the contest in Tel Aviv May 14-18. Bilal Hassani is competing to represent France.

Rabat – On Saturday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen attended the funeral of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, who was killed with her friend Maren Ueland near Mount Toubkal in Morocco in December 2018. Quoted by Danish outlet the Local, the prime minister said that “though the pain is unbearable, we must not succumb. We must remember who we are, what we are made of, and what we stand for.” Hundreds of people also attended Jespersen’s funeral. Earlier this month, hundreds of people observed two minutes of silence at Bo University in Norway, where the women studied. “It is very difficult for all of us, especially for the students who lived and studied with them,” university director Annette Bischoff told AFP. At least 22 suspects have been arrested in connection to the double murder. Authorities found the bodies of the victims on December 17, 2018. Fifteen suspects appeared before the investigating judge on December 29. Seven other suspects appeared before the judge on January 3. The public prosecution called on the investigating judge to file multiple charges against the detainees, including the formation of a gang to prepare and commit acts of terrorism, deliberately ending the lives of individuals, and participating in the terrorist attack against the Scandinavian tourists.

Rabat – Morocco’s Prince Moulay Rachid represented King Mohammed VI at the official opening of the 2019 Abu Dhabi Sustainability (ADSW) Week Monday in Dubai,, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. Many presidents of African countries also attended the ceremony, such as the leaders of Mauritania, Angola, Mali, Rwanda, and Namibia. Abu Dhabi’s renewable energy company Masdar holds ADSW each year in January. The sustainability gathering is considered the largest in the Middle East. ADSW 2019 is being held January 12-19 under the theme  “Industry Convergence: Accelerating Sustainable Development.” The meeting “will explore how industries are responding to the digital transformation underway in the global economy, which in turn is giving rise to new opportunities to address global sustainability challenges.” ADSW brings together policy makers, industry specialists, and technology and sustainability leaders from all over the world. According to ADSW’s website, “Participants will explore ways that businesses, governments and researchers can unlock the potential of industry and technology convergence to achieve a more inclusive, secure, and sustainable world.” Last year’s ADSW hosted 38,000 attendees from 175 countries and 850 exhibiting companies. Over $15 billion worth of deals were announced during the event. Moulay Rachid, King Mohammed VI’s brother, also represented the King at the 11th Sheikh Zayed Sustainability Prize event, held Monday. The Sheikh Zayed Sustainability Prize, formerly the Zayed Future Energy Prize, “is an annual award that rewards companies and organisations that demonstrate a tangible, positive impact through sustainable solutions.”

Rabat – A star of the television show the Royals, Elizabeth Hurley, spent last weekend in Marrakech at an auto racing event, the ABB FIA Formula E Championship, where she boasted two elegant looks. At midday, the 53-year-old actress wore a white midi dress and nude high heels. But it was her V-neck evening dress that stole the show and made her social media followers gush. The actress posted two photos of herself at the event on Instagram, captioning one of them with “A brilliant weekend in #Marrakesh.”  The January 12 event ended with the victory of Belgian competitor Jerome d’Ambrosio, who won the Marrakesh ePrix and the competition for the third time. The international ABB FIA Formula E Championship, created in 2011, took place in New York last year. Marrakech welcomed other stars and public personalities recently, especially over the New Year.      A brilliant weekend in #Marrakesh Thank you @fiaformulae @giorgioveroni @alejandroformulae and all the gorgeous drivers 😉 A post shared by  Elizabeth Hurley (@elizabethhurley1) on Jan 13, 2019 at 2:51am PST  Real Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas and his family spent New Year’s Eve in the lively city and shared pictures of his stay on social media.

Rabat – Morocco and the European Union signed the fisheries agreement today in Brussels. The agreement, which replaces one that expired in July 2018, sets out the conditions of access for EU vessels in Moroccan waters and lays down requirements for sustainable fishing. Permanent Representative of Romania to the EU Luminita Teodora Odobescu signed the agreement in Brussels today in her role as head of the EU presidency for Romania and on behalf of Joao Aguiar Machado, the director general of the European Commission’s Directorate General for Maritime Affairs. Moroccan Secretary-General of the Maritime Fisheries Department Zakia Driouch also attended the signing ceremony of the agreement, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The agreement covers the fishing area from parallel 35 to parallel 22, from Cap Spartel in northern Morocco to Cap Blanc in southern Morocco, including the waters off Western Sahara. The agreement specifies the fishing areas and access conditions for EU vessels, increasing the EU’s financial contribution from the previous agreement’s annual average of €40.0 million to €52.2 million. The deal also contains provisions that aim to maximize benefits for local populations in nearby areas. The agreement follows several months of negotiations between the EU’s departments.  In 2018, the European Council urged that the scope of the fisheries deal between the two parties be “defined so as to include the waters adjacent to the territory of Western Sahara” in southern Morocco. Responding to Polisario’s claims that Morocco “exploits” the resources of the region, locals from Western Sahara petitioned for the renewal of both agriculture and fisheries agreements. The petition, launched by Sahrawis, explained Morocco’s increased efforts to develop the southern provinces. After the fisheries deal, Morocco and the EU are also set to renew their agriculture agreement. Several EU departments, including the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs, adopted the EU-Morocco agriculture deal.

Rabat – Europa Press has reported that the Ceuta government is urging the regulation of the status of Moroccan domestic workers who cross the Spanish-Moroccan border daily to work. The Spanish news outlet noted that only 1,300 people are “registered as contributors, a third of their actual total.” The news site added that the Spanish government delegate in Ceuta, Salvadora Mateos, will meet with interior minister Fernando Grande Marlaska on Monday to discuss the situation of the Ceuta border as a “priority.” The border between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta has been a concern for both the Moroccan and the Spanish government because many violent stampedes have killed Moroccans in recent years. In 2018, two Moroccan women known as “human mules” died while several others suffered injuries at a stampede at the Ceuta border. In 2017, several incidents were reported. Thousands of Moroccan women cross the border post every day to make a living selling Spanish goods in Morocco. According to Europa Press, the regional government said that about 8,500 Moroccans enter Ceuta daily to “carry out activities with impact on the local economy.” “Approximately half are women who work in Ceuta housing,” according to Europa press. The news outlet added that the government is demanding the regularization of their status. In December 2018, Materos asserted the need to regulate the situation of domestic workers. In a statement to the press, Mateos said that the new restriction requires locals to provide proof of work or residence and does not violate the Schengen visa agreement, which allows domestic workers and Moroccans who live less than 40 kilometers from Ceuta to enter the city without restriction. In 2017, 197 domestic workers regularized their status, and 286 did in the first 11 months of 2018.

Rabat –  “The struggle of  the Sahrawi people for freedom and independence is our struggle,” said President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa. During a speech on the 107th anniversary of the founding of the African National Congress (ANC), President Ramaphosa showed full support for the Polisario Front. The president said that his country stands “alongside the Polisario Front and the leaders of the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic in their struggle for full sovereignty over all their territory.” He also reiterated support for the AU and the UN to “end the last colony on the African continent.” Ramaphosa’s controversial statement might increase diplomatic tension between Rabat and Pretoria. The unfriendly relationship between the two countries dates back to 2004 when Morocco’s ambassador to South Africa left the country when Pretoria recognized the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Ever since, South Africa has been one of the most vocal supporters of Polisario. Pretoria has joined forces with Algeria to thwart all Moroccan efforts to reach a mutually accepted political solution to the conflict in line with the UN-led political process initiated in April 2007.  After more than 13 years of tension, the two countries agreed to end their diplomatic tension after King Mohammed VI met former South African President Jacob Zuma, and have both expressed desires to build a more prosperous and interdependent Africa. When King Mohammed VI received then President Zuma at the fifth African Union-European Union summit in November 2017, analysts hoped the meeting would end the animosity between the two countries.  Those hopes, however, were dashed with the election of Cyril Ramaphosa, a long-time Polisario supporter.  Rabat has not responded to a request from Pretoria to accept a South African ambassador. In November 2018, the South African government said that it is up to Morocco to appoint an ambassador, saying that Rabat has not yet responded to an agreement request to exchange new ambassadors made years ago. In the 2026 World Cup bid, South Africa showed anti-Moroccan sentiment when a politician said that her country would not vote for Morocco’s bid due to its political agenda. South Africa broke the African consensus around the Moroccan bid and voted in favor of the US-Canada-Mexico bid last June.

Rabat – Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi spoke out about the alleged unbearable living conditions in Tindouf camps under which thousands of Sahrawis live in Algeria. El Khalfi made his remarks at the screening of “Life Rubbing Shoulders with Death” or “Vie Cotoyant la Mort” in French, a Moroccan documentary depicting the situation of Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps. El Khalfi told reporters at the movie screening that what Sahrawis are exposed to “requires us to work on and to sensitize [people about it] as an integral part of our memory.” He added that the work and research of Moroccan youth is “evidence of the cultural attachment to defend the issue of territorial integrity.” El Khalfi added that Western Sahara, referred to in Morocco as the national cause, “does not need permission to defend it, it is an issue of cultural depth for all Moroccans.” The documentary was screened for the first time on Saturday in Rabat. The documentary won a prize on December 23, 2018, at the closing ceremony of Laayoune’s fourth Festival of Sahrawi-Hassani Culture, History, and Environment. The 90-minute film was directed by Moroccan Lahcen Majid. It tells the story of six Moroccans, five men and one woman, who recount the suffering they experienced at the hands of the Polisario Front in the Tindouf camps in the Algerian desert and how they managed to escape. The documentary is based on testimonies from former detainees who say they were constantly tortured.

Rabat – Kuwaiti journalist Fajr El Saeed has criticized Miss Algeria Khadija Ben Hammou, who received racial abuse because of her dark skin color. “They voted for her as a result of their strong anger over the political situation of the country,”  she said. “You are in a beauty pageant competition… I don’t know why they choose you,” added the journalist as she addressed Miss Algeria in a television broadcast.  After winning the competition, Ben Hammou said that the pageant’s selection criteria were based on “benevolence, manners, education, intelligence, and humanitarian spirit.” In response, the Kuwaiti journalist said: “You are not participating in a folklore contest.” El Saeed added that the contest is a beauty pageant competition, and “therefore the winner needs to be beautiful.” Throughout the week, some Algerian social media users attacked Khadija’s appearance, mainly her skin color. El Saeed also believes that Algeria “deserves  better.” Throughout the week, some Algerian social media users attacked Khadija’s appearance, mainly her skin color. In response to the racially abusive comments, Ben Hammou told Algerian news outlet TSA that she was honored to achieve her dream. “I am honored by the state of Adrar where I come from.” She added that she will not “back down because of the people who criticized her.” Khadija Ben Hammou outperformed 16 other finalists in the beauty pageant on January 4.

Rabat – Abderrazak Makri, the leader of Algeria’s Movement of Society for Peace (MSP) political party, warned of an unprecedented crisis that Algeria may experience beginning in late 2019. Starting from late 2019 until 2022, “we will experience unprecedented lean years. They will be difficult for Algeria and the ordinary citizen will feel the burden more than others,” Makri wrote on his Facebook page on January 11. The politician, who is pleading for the postponement of the Algerian presidential election of April 2019, lamented that “the struggle for power and money dominates the political scene” in Algeria. Few Algerians, according to Makri, “are worried about the economic and social risks that will make Algeria very vulnerable to regional and international threats in the short term.”  Makri warned at the end of his post, “I fear that when all Algerians recognize those who warn and advise from those who deceit and betray, it will be too late.” A few days before Makri’s warning, a former Algerian prime minister, Ahmed Benbitour, said that Algeria is going through a deep political crisis due to the “autocratic and paternalistic” regime. Benbitour, who is also an economist, stressed that there should be mobilization to make the current regime relinquish its hold on power and the country’s resources, to help save from political failure and economic crisis. For Benbitour, Algeria’s “responsible elites” have to assess the situation, inform the population of the dire state of the country, and force a “peaceful” regime change. “Our country is governed by an authoritarian, paternalistic, and patrimonialist regime that thrives on rent-seeking and economic predation,” Benbitour said Monday in Algiers at a conference on “the Mission of Elites in Saving the Country.” “A regime change is the key to solving all of our other governance-linked issues,” he added.

Rabat – Spanish-Moroccan forward Munir El Haddadi left Barcelona to join Seville for a fee of €1.05 million. The forward’s contract with Barcelona was due to expire next June. FC Barcelona announced the signing of the agreement on January 11. “The Club would like to thank Munir El Haddadi for his dedication and commitment and wishes him all the best for the future,” wrote the football giant. El Haddadi made his official debut with FC Barcelona at the age of 18. He made 18 appearances in his first year there under Luis Enrique. “A star of the U19 side that won the UEFA Youth League title in 2013/14, Munir made a total of 56 appearances for F.C. Barcelona and won the league twice, the Copa del Rey twice, a Champions League, a FIFA Club World Cup, a UEFA Super Cup, and two Spanish Super Cups. The striker also scored 12 goals for the Barca first team in official competition,” added the football team. El Haddadi was desperate to join the Atlas Lions, especially after the Moroccan national team qualified for the 2018 World Cup. He also urged the Moroccan Football Federation to support his petition to FIFA to allow him to play with Morocco in the 2018 World Cup. A brief appearance at an international game with the Spanish national team against Macedonia in 2014 ruined his chances to represent the Moroccan football team according to FIFA rules for switching national teams. During his youth, the Moroccan-Spanish footballer also played for several Spanish clubs, including Atletico Madrid and Rayo Majadahonda. He also joined Alaves on loan for the 2017-2018 season.

Rabat – Gabonese President Ali Bongo announced a new government from Rabat, where he is recovering from a stroke. The president appointed a new prime minister Saturday after a thwarted coup attempt. The secretary-general of the presidency, Jean-Yves Teal, on Saturday announced Julien Nkoghe Bekale as a prime minister, replacing Emmanuel Issoze-Ngondet. On January 7, a group of soldiers seized a state broadcaster in Gabon and announced their plans to establish a National Restoration Council. “If you are eating, stop; if you are having a drink, stop; if you are sleeping, wake up. Wake up your neighbors…. rise up as one and take control of the street,” said a person who identified himself as Lieutenant Ondo Obiang Kelly. According to the BBC, security officers killed two rebels while retaking the national radio office. Over the new year, the President of Gabon acknowledged the political unrest in his country in a message he recorded from Morocco. “It is true that I have been through a difficult period, as sometimes happens in life,” he said but promised his citizens of a new day. “Today, as you can see, I am better and I am preparing to meet you again soon,” he added. The Gabonese president arrived in Rabat in November 2018 after suffering a stroke in Saudi Arabia in October.

Rabat – The US Consular Affairs Office issued a report on statistics of citizens from across the world who registered for the 2018 US Diversity Visa Lottery program. A total of 293,708 Moroccans registered for the program, representing a noticeable increase from the two past years. In 2016, 201,964 Moroccans registered for the program and in 2017, 286,421 did. The number of Algerians seeking a green card in 2018 surpassed Moroccans. In 2018, 342,857 Algerians registered for the Diversity Visa Program, a sharp increase compared to 252,733 in 2017. Tunisians account for 25,587 in 2017, compared to 24,446 in 2016. The number of Ukrainians registered for the 2018 Diversity VISA program is 1,450,487, down from 1,470,250 in 2017. From Uzbekistan, 2,114,446 people registered for the lottery program in 2018. The US Department of State announced the opening of the registration period in October 2017. The US grants 50,000 immigrant visas through the diversity visa lottery each year to foreign citizens of eligible countries, including Morocco. Although thousands of Moroccans apply annually for the program,  only 900-1,000 of those selected receive permanent residence visas.

Rabat – The Washington Post announced plans on January 10 to launch an Arabic language editorial page, vowing to honor the legacy of murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Before his murder on October 2 in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Khashoggi, who was on self-imposed exile in the US, wrote columns for the American newspaper, covering Saudi Arabian politics and wider geopolitical issues in the Arab world. Khashoggi was a strong critic of the Saudi regime, calling out its repressive politics. The Post’s statement noted that while the newspaper’s move is meant to broaden their outreach, the outlet also felt a sense of responsibility to continue Khashoggi’s legacy. Part of the statement read, “This page will make it easier for more readers to access free and independent commentary about the cultural and political topics that most impact them. The importance of this has become more evident since the murder of our own colleague Jamal Khashoggi, who saw very clearly the need for a forum such as this.” While Saudi Arabia has always had dubious human rights records, with a number advocacy groups reporting on Riyadh’s crackdown on dissent and freedom of expression, the death of Khashoggi brought an unprecedented global focus on Saudi actions. Following Khashoggi’s murder, numerous voices called for a diplomatic boycott of Saudi Arabia. One important post-Khashoggi development has been the increasing isolation of Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, who is reported to have sponsored the “hit-and-dispose” crew which flew in Istanbul to kill the journalist. The Post said its move aims to bring together different voices and perspectives on “the most pressing issues” affecting the region.

Rabat – Two Moroccan nationals were wounded in the explosion that occurred Saturday morning in a bakery in the 9th arrondissement of Paris. A Moroccan diplomatic source in the French capital reported the information, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The wounded Moroccans, both on a sightseeing tour in Paris, have been evacuated to Pitie Salpetriere University Hospital, where one of them is expected to undergo surgery. Their condition is not serious, the diplomatic source added. The Moroccan consular officials visited the two wounded Moroccans and are staying in constant contact with the medical services. The two Moroccans, one of whom was accompanied by his wife and child, were staying in a hotel opposite the bakery. According to media reports, three people died in the blast, a Spanish national and two firefighters. Ten others were seriously injured and 37 were slightly injured.

Rabat – In response to claims questioning the legitimacy of EU-Morocco fisheries and agriculture agreements on the grounds that they include Western Sahara, locals from the concerned regions have petitioned for the renewal of the agreements. Coming just days after news emerged of pro-Polisario maneuvers to “disturb” the normal proceeding of the final vote for the Morocco-EU agriculture agreement, the petition set out to squarely dismiss what it describes as maneuvers to separate locals from their “homeland.” Morocco, according to petitioners, is “the only legitimate representative of our interests and of our will.” The petition explained Morocco’s increased efforts to invest and accelerate development in the southern provinces: “Since our country completed its territorial integrity by recovering its southern provinces, it has made significant efforts towards their sustainable development. Noticeable progress made in our southern provinces as the result of our country’s efforts to make development, both at large and in our regions, our top priority.” In recent years, the regions of Laayoune-Sakia, El Hamra, and Dakhla-Oued Ed Dahab have been dubbed by international observers—including diplomats and businessmen—as a beacon of socio-economic developments and an “ideal hub” for investments. Recently, a group of African leaders who visited Laayoune said they were “shocked” by the “rapid transformations” the region has witnessed in recent years because of King Mohammed VI’s “personal commitment and political will.” The ambassadors stressed that Rabat’s development efforts in the region should be emulated in other African countries. But such Morocco-friendly observations have also come from non-African visitors of the region, including French and American observers. Even the UN Secretary-General’s latest annual report on Western Sahara drew particular attention to Morocco’s investments in infrastructure and employment prospects, albeit in a diplomatic and balanced language that sought to avoid accusations of pro-Morocco bias. Drawing on such international acknowledgment of Rabat’s “genuine” interest in and attachment to the southern provinces, the petitioners called on European policymakers to take into account the “tangible” positive impact that their agreements with Morocco have had in the lives of locals in the southern provinces. “The benefits from our country’s commitment to the development of our southern provinces are well established. The southern provinces are now ranked above the national average for human development indicators. “Since 2015, they benefit from a new development model mobilizing 77 billion dirhams and resulting in many projects impacting tourism, employment, the environment, culture, handicrafts, education, health, urban planning, roads, water, renewable energies, agriculture, transport and fisheries.” An oft-repeated claim in Morocco-hostile circles is that the agreements between Rabat and its international partners “do not benefit locals.” According to petitioners, however, the people in the concerned areas “need” and “demand” the agreements because “they contribute to economic growth and job creation in our region.” Most importantly perhaps, the petition pointed out that not renewing the agreements would do more harm than good to the region’s economy, as many families’ livelihood is directly dependent on activities generated as a result of the EU-Morocco partnerships. “The theory that the Fisheries Agreement and the Agricultural Agreement do not benefit the local population concerned is not valid … To oppose these two Agreements would put at risk the thousands of families who are financially dependent on maritime and agricultural activities in our southern provinces,” the petition hammered.

Rabat – The 2018 fall-winter citrus harvest made records in some regions of Morocco, but some producers had to dispose of surplus fruits because they did not have cold storage capacity and marketing channels. Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch held a meeting on January 9 in Rabat with agricultural interprofessional organizations to discuss the citrus sector in Morocco. Read Also: USDA Report: Morocco Expects Record in Citrus Production in 2018-2019 During the meeting, Akhannouch said that citrus production made records this season in some regions, especially in Berkane, in eastern Morocco, with a 25 percent increase and Beni Mellal, in central Morocco, with an 18 percent increase. However, weather conditions last year delayed the ripening of the citrus fruits and production accumulation, according to a ministry statement. Last month, many videos circulated social media showing trucks throwing out a large quantity of mandarins and oranges in a deserted area in what was believed to be Berkane or Agadir region.   The ministry noted that quality variation in citrus production also affected the criteria for export. Akhannouch’s meeting was an opportunity to take stock of citrus marketing in Morocco and internationally. During the meeting, industry professionals discussed some of the constraints in citrus marketing. Citrus producers faced limitations in cold storage capacity, packaging stations, internal sales, and marketing channels.

Rabat – Political parties from Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia have expressed their desire to work together toward peace and socio-economic integration in the region, ending decades of cold relations and political rivalry. In a joint statement published on January 8, Algeria, Algeria’s Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD) announced their intention, along with leftist political formations from Tunisia and Libya, of “resurrecting” the United Maghreb dream. The statement put forward theses of common socio-economic challenges, shared history and culture, as well as the “historical responsibility” of working together to promote peace and stability for the whole region. The statement, pioneered by Algeria’s RCD, called on “Moroccan friends,” especially the leftist Party of Socialism and Progress (PPS), and spoke of a conference to be organized in Morocco in late January to debate the fundamentals of the prospective “resurrection” of the unified Maghreb platform. “We have formed a political coalition while waiting to expand our reach to other political associations,” read the note. It invited “Moroccan political forces” to attend the late January meeting. “We think that your presence at the meeting will be an opportunity to foster cooperation and impulse a new dynamic [for the region].” The idea of a unified Maghreb emerged in Tangier in 1958 in the early years of independence for some, Tunisia and Morocco, and independence struggle, for Algeria, which obtained its sovereignty from France only in 1962. The pan-Magrhebi ideal was to draw on cultural similarities and social bonds across the region to build a common political future. But emerging political challenges in the first decades of independence quickly dissipated pan-Maghrebi sentiments, with national interests and questions of national identity scrapping the regional dream. The political divorce was especially accentuated in the late 1970s through the 1990s, with the rift between Algiers and Rabat on the Western Sahara question and other security and border-line disputes. The 1994 closed-border policy between the two neighbors was the last straw, burying prospects of a unified Maghreb. Despite the region’s conflict-riddled history and current crises, however, the group is confident that leaders can find common ground to ease diplomatic cooperation and gradually become politically and economically integrated. After decades of “costly” and “ineffective” hostilities, they argued, it is time to “rise above political and economic fragmentations that have kept the North-African sub-continent in a state of immobility.” Their statement added, “The geography as well as the historical and civilizational links between the peoples of North of Africa compel economic, political, and cultural cooperation for the benefit of the whole region.”

Rabat – The Islamic Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (ISESCO) plans to create a virtual museum of the ksour and kasbahs in Morocco, as part of celebrating the Year of Heritage in the Islamic World in 2019, a statement by ISESCO says. A ksar (plural ksour) is a fortified village that may include a kasbah, which is a fortified center or citadel. Such villages are found in Arabia, North Africa, and Iberia. The Moroccan city of Ksar El Kebir and the Kasbah of the Oudayas neighborhood in Rabat were named after historical villages. ISESCO is also planning 37 activities to promote, protect, and digitize Islamic heritage and monuments, as well as restore manuscripts. These activities will take place throughout 2019 at ISESCO’s headquarters and in Palestine, Iraq, Jordan, Tunisia, Qatar, Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, Brunei Darussalam, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, and Uzbekistan. ISESCO will organize activities to support cultural institutions in Jerusalem, as part of celebrating the Holy City as the 2019 Capital of Islamic Culture. ISESCO will produce a documentary film on Palestinian crafts, a guide to Palestinian proverbs and folk tales, a documentary study on the Jerusalem libraries looted in 1948, and a workshop on protecting Palestinian national heritage. In 1979, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation founded ISESCO, one of the largest international Islamic organizations specializing in education, science, and culture.

Rabat – Today, January 12, North African countries, Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and parts of Egypt, are celebrating Yennayer, the Amazigh (Berber) New Year 2,969.  Joyous Amazigh festivities have begun in Algeria. People have taken to the street to dance, serve traditional food, play traditional music, and share happy moments. Videos and pictures of raised Amazigh flags and people in colorful traditional outfits amid festive celebrations are circulating on social media.   The Yennayer celebrations are especially resonant in Algeria because the country officially recognizes it as a national holiday. On December 27, 2017, Algeria’s President Abdelaziz Bouteflika recognized the Amazigh New Year as an official public holiday in a decree. Despite the recent fatwa by Algerian Islamic scholars deeming Yennayer celebrations as “haram” (forbidden in Islam), celebrations are booming in the country. In Morocco, people are holding parties and, as every year, Amazigh families in several regions of the country prepare special dishes including couscous and tagola, the famous Amazigh dish served on Yennayer. Tagola is a delightful dish made of corn kernels, argan oil, ghee, and honey cooked and mixed with butter. Another dish named orikmen is also exclusively eaten on the first day of the Amazigh New Year. It is a thick soup made of wheat and dry fava beans. The history of Yennayer goes back to 950 BC, when the Amazigh army lead by the Berber king “Sheshonq,” also spelled “Chichnaq,” defeated the pharaoh’s army and conquered Egypt. The Amazigh nation established a new monarchy that ruled from Libya to Egypt, which marked the beginning of the Amazigh calendar. Moroccans are still hoping and calling for the government to make Yennayer a national and public holiday.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of Energy, Mines, and Sustainable Development Aziz Rabbah said that Morocco has earmarked $14 billion of investment for the energy sector between 2017 and 2023. The projects are underway and concern mainly renewable energy, Rabbah said at the ninth General Assembly of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Friday in Abu Dhabi. Major companies from Asia, Europe, the US, and the Arab world, in addition to Moroccan companies are carrying out the energy projects, which indicates the attractiveness of the Moroccan market, Rabbah added. Rabbah also emphasized that Morocco’s renewable energy strategy was launched by King Mohammed VI to meet national needs and commitment to global efforts to combat climate change and promote the use of clean energy. The strategy, continued the minister, aims to enhance security in the energy sector in Morocco and to respond to the increasing demand for energy. “We have an annual energy demand increase of 2 to 4 percent, and more than 93 percent of Morocco’s energy needs are imported, compared to 98 percent in 2008,” he added. Speaking to the Emirates News Agency (WAM), the minister said: “Our energy strategy targets increasing use of renewable energy to 52 percent by 2030, while reducing consumption of conventional energy sources by 15 percent.” The energy minister also recognized the UAE’s support of the Moroccan renewable energy sector.  Abu Dhabi’s renewable energy company Masdar “had successfully installed an off-grid solar power project that extends energy access to 19,438 homes in more than 1,000 villages in Morocco,” he told WAM. The three-day IRENA assembly brought together heads of state and over 120 ministers and government representatives from 160 countries around the world. IRENA was created on January 26, 2009, in Bonn, Germany, after 75 countries signed the organization’s statutes. The UAE became a permanent headquarters during IRENA’s first General Assembly in 2011.

Rabat – The Ministry of National Education has “categorically denied” on Friday that a recognized schoolbook included a map that does not show Palestine. In a statement quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the ministry categorically denied that an approved schoolbook would contain a map without Palestine. The Moroccan government has long supported the Palestinian cause. Moroccans on social media found it surprising that a Moroccan schoolbook would contain a map without Palestine. The Moroccan Anti-Normalization Center shared a post about the book on its official Facebook page, pointing out the danger of “normalizing” the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The center called for the government to open an investigation into the book. King Mohammed VI was among the international leaders who condemned Donald Trump’s decision to announce Jerusalem as the Israeli capital in December 2017.

Rabat – Canadian company Maya Gold &amp; Silver announced it reached commercial production at its Zgounder silver mine in central Morocco on January 1, the company said in a statement January 9. With the installation of a three-fold effect milling capacity and output at Zgounder, Maya said it “reached an important milestone.” The Montreal-based company completed the commissioning and testing phase of its 500 ton-per-day flotation mill, located at about 260 kilometers east of the port city of Agadir. Maya CEO and President Noureddine Mokaddem said, “Achieving commercial production at Zgounder, Maya’s flagship project marks another major milestone.” During a 28-day period, Maya processed 4,622 tons of low-grade ore at an average silver grade of 157 grams per ton. “The overall silver recovery with flotation followed by cyanidation of the flotation concentrate” achieved 80.3 percent which is, according to the miner, “better than expected for the testing phase.” “The flotation mill produced 321 tonnes of concentrate at a grade of 1,861 [grams per ton of silver] for a 7% weight recovery.” “Our team’s execution capabilities delivered the mine on schedule and in line with our expectations. As demonstrated by its very low cash cost of below $6.37 [per ounce], the Zgounder silver mine is expected to immediately start contributing to Maya’s free cash flow,” said Mokaddem. Maya holds an exploitation license which covers 16 square kilometers at the Zgounder silver mine. Mining installations include a cyanidation plant with a 300 ton-per-day capacity, a chemical analysis laboratory, a crusher plant with a capacity of 300 tons per hour, a compressor station, an electrical power station, and a machine shop.  Maya Gold &amp; Silver is a public Canadian mining company focused on the exploration and development of gold and silver deposits in Morocco. The company produced 277,277 ounces of silver in Zgounder mine in the fourth quarter of 2018 with over $4.97 million in revenue from silver at the end of September 2018. Maya owns 85 percent of the Zgounder mine and its subsidiary, ZMSM, while Morocco’s National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONHYM) owns 15 percent.   The miner’s portfolio includes “the Boumadine polymetallic deposit located in the Anti-Atlas Mountains of Eastern Morocco. The property is a joint venture with ONHYM whereby Maya retains an 85% ownership.” The Canadian mining company also owns a 100-square-kilometer historical mining district in Amizmiz and Azegour, near Marrakech. The area contains gold, tungsten, molybdenum, and copper deposits.

Rabat – Danish news outlet B.T. reported that a group of Danish people collected money for Said El Ossoul and a fellow vendor, who allegedly contributed to the arrest of suspects in the murder of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland near Imlil in the Atlas Mountains in December. Said El Ossoul, who works as a merchant next to a Marrakech bus station, told B.T. that he is not asking for anything in return for reporting the suspects, who were attempting to escape from Marrakech after the killing of the Scandinavian tourists. “I am Moroccan, and my country means a lot to me. When I found out what they had done to the two girls, it hurt me in the heart. I could not sleep at all afterwards,” he said. Ossoul said that he is also “afraid.” “You never know what sympathizers the terrorists can think of. I just hope the police are looking after me and my family, ” he added. Ossoul said that he will use the money collected for him to repair his house. “You have seen how my roof is falling together. When it rains, I and my family live in the middle of the water inside the house.” He added that he will also take care of his father and mother “who are both sick.” B.T. reported that a Danish individual named Tina Flensborg Jensen started  the initiative to collect money for Ossoul, and that 106 people donated. “I had no imagination at all to think that so many people would be involved. I just think I would do something for this poor man and his colleague,” Jensen said. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested three of the four main suspects on December 20. The first suspect was arrested on December 18. The spokesperson of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), Boubkar Sabik, commented on the alleged contribution of the two vendors, saying that the arrest was purely conducted in collaboration among Morocco’s security services. In his interview with Moroccan television channel 2M, Sabik denied that the men helped security services to arrest the suspects. He said that the police had specific information about the identities of the suspects before their arrest. However, he expressed gratitude to the men who believe that they have contributed to the arrest of the suspects, emphasizing the importance of collaboration between citizens and security agencies.

Rabat – A delegation from Mississippi State University (MSU) recently came to Morocco to develop relations with the International University of Rabat (UIR).  The MSU delegation, representing the Office of the Provost, the political science and public administration department, and the anthropology and Middle Eastern cultures department, met Morocco’s Minister of Culture and Communication Mohamed Laaraj and officials of the UIR to explore academic partnerships.

MSU and UIR are developing a study abroad program in which students spend a month working on digs, cultural integration, and language immersion, according to Peter Ryan, MSU’s associate provost. MSU’s Associate Vice-President of International Programs Julie Jordan said, “We are especially excited to expand the academic collaboration to include archeology, anthropology, and Middle Eastern cultures with Morocco’s UIR and Archeology and Heritage National Institute (INSAP).”

“Morocco’s rich history and culture makes it an exceptional place for our students to explore some of the oldest civilizations in the world,” added Jordan. The 2017 archaeological discovery of 300,000-year-old Homo sapiens remains gave a new impetus to archeology in Morocco.

MSU and UIR launched a program in 2015 that allows Moroccan students to study in MSU to obtain a UIR engineering degree and a MSU master’s degree.

Rabat – According to a report by the High Commission for Planning (HCP) published on January 7, based on a 2016 study on “the perception of the reality of the environment in Morocco,” 93 percent of Moroccans noted changes in climate. The percentage of Moroccans who noted the negative changes in the past few years was only a fraction of a percent difference between those who live in urban versus rural areas. Of urban Moroccans, 92.5  perceived changes, compared to 92.4 percent who live in rural areas. Thirty-seven percent of the study’s interviewees noticed a significant rise in temperatures, with 32 percent noting shifting seasons such as early springs and shorter winters, and 25 percent noting recurring droughts. The study results reflect a 2014 study by the Ministry of Energy, Mines, Water, and Environment which indicated that the North African country’s regions known for their “semi-arid” climate regressed to an “arid” climate. “Morocco is distinguished by four types of climate: Humid, sub-humid, semi-arid and arid,” the study emphasized. Morocco is making progressive efforts to limit the effects of global warming. The Climate Action Tracker (CAT) recently assessed 32 countries and listed Morocco among the countries that invested “impressive” efforts and made “clear progress” in curbing the damaging effects of climate change. Second only to Sweden, the North African country also became the best-performing country in the 2019 Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI). Morocco has the world’s largest solar project, the “Noor Solar Project” which consists of four solar plants: Noor I, Noor II, Noor III, and Noor IV. The Noor I plant “is expected to offset 240,000 [tons] a year of CO2 emissions,” while “the Noor II and Noor III plants combined will help offset 533,000 [tons] of CO2 emissions a year,” according to Power Technology.

Rabat – Islamist MP Amina Maelainine has acknowledged the authenticity of widely-circulated pictures of her without a hijab, compelling a u-turn move from Morocco’s Islamist establishment. When pictures emerged weeks ago depicting Morocco’sJustice and Development Party  (PJD) MP Amina Maelainine in jeans and T-shirt and without her hijab in front of Le Moulin Rouge, a Parisian cabaret, the Islamist MP was adamant that the photographs were “fake” and “fabricated.” Maelainine said the pictures were a montage from Islamism-hostile circles that wanted to defame her, harm her public image, and ruin her political career. According to a recent report from Moroccan outlet Le 360, however, the Islamist MP “has been compelled to recognize that the pictures were real.”  Without giving details about what made Maelainine back down from her denials, the newspaper suggested that the controversy had reached a point where both the party and the MP opted for damage control instead of continued denials.  Despite the MP’s threats of suing her most vocal “defamers,” critics were adamant that the pictures were real, suggesting that they were ready to go to any length to prove the PJD’s and Maelainine’s “hypocrisy” and “fraud.” So she had to mitigate the damage or get caught in a dispute that would have cost her and the party more than a slightly bruised public image, Le 360 suggested. But even while “confessing,” Maelainine did not bow to critics’ “intrusion” into her private life. Like in her denial post a week ago, she suggested that her public actions as an MP should not interfere with her personal tastes or choices. “Having suffered all these attacks and having seen the robust means deployed to harm my reputation, I am more than ever convinced that the path to militancy must be followed with determination and commitment. The battle should be fought in Morocco or abroad, with or without a veil, for the sake of democracy, freedom, justice, and human rights.” Both Maelainine’s acknowledgment of the pictures’ authenticity and her defense of her politics and convictions have raised eyebrows in Morocco’s secular and Islamist circles.  While secularists tend to feel satisfaction at unearthing the “contradictions of the Islamists,” Islamists are having a hard time processing Maelainine’s latest position. Condemning “extravagant” and “suggestive” clothing is part of Islamist ideology, blending the personal and the public expression of selfhood in one single basket of “virtue” and “religiosity.” But such ideological reckoning was not the most interesting part of the latest developments in the Maelainine affair. The interesting part, should Le 360’s report be confirmed, is the u-turn that the MP’s “confession” has provoked in the PJD establishment. Maelainine is considered to be close to Abdelilah Benkirane, the former head of government and PJD leader who is still a party mogul. According to the newspaper, Benkirane spoke to his protege in the heat of the controversies about her Parisian adventure. “Before anything else, I blame you for failing to come to me first for advice as soon as the scandal broke out,” the PJD mogul reportedly told the MP. Had Maelainine spoken to him first, Benkirane went on, he would have told her that “the choice to veil or not was hers alone.” Whether the pictures were real or not, the former PJD boss elaborated, Maelainine should have responded to her “detractors” that her choice to take off the veil abroad was “no one’s business.”  He added: “Tell them that, if your husband does not like that choice, he should ask for divorce; if you owe anyone anything, they should come and claim it; if you violate the law, let them punish you; if you do not respect a party commitment, let them challenge you. But since putting on the veil has nothing to do with any of those, it is a personal matter that depends on you alone.” The “unlikely” support from Benkirane, the newspaper argued, boosted Maelainine’s morale, resulting in the defying militancy and conviction-riddled statement she went on to post on her Facebook.  The Maelainine case is hardly the first time that Moroccans have called out PJD politicians for hypocrisy. In September 2018, interior minister and PJD member Mohamed Yatim came under criticism when he appeared on a Paris street with a young woman.  Yatim said the woman was his fiancee, but critics were unimpressed. The PJD minister received backlash for his party’s “bogus” and “self-righteous” platform thriving on “moralization” and “profiteering.” In addition to rising to Maelainine’s defense in their reported meeting aimed at calming the controversy tides, Benkirane tried to minimize the probability of such occurrences in the future.  “If my daughter tells me she wants to take off her hijab, I will tell her that the choice is all hers…. I have often said that wearing the hijab is no precondition for being a PJD member. We have even tried to have unveiled female candidates run in elections,” Benkirane said, apparently departing from the morality-obsessed party that the PJD has traditionally been. But as PJD’s endorsement of autonomous choices comes amid controversies targeting “important” party members, it is questionable whether critics were listening. The PJD has generally been unapologetic with Moroccan leftists’ lifestyle. And as PJD now calibrates its platform, the country’s leftists are laughing off the party’s “liberal-clothed” statements, reinforcing perception of the Islamist party as “hypocritical.” Nabila Mounib, general secretary of the Unified Socialist Party, said at a party meeting  in Tangier on Wednesday that she was “intrigued” to know what Islamic tenet accepts that women be free in Paris but “wear a bag” in Morocco.  “Hypocrites will burn in the ninth chamber of hell,” Mounib said, apparently using PJD’s own reference points to lambast it. “It has become necessary to denounce Islamists’ contradictions. Religion is no one’s property and we cannot accept … that our society be Islamized.”

Rabat – The head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) has denied the arrest of a British-Swiss national with alleged ties to ISIS. Khiame told Moroccan television channel 2M that BCIJ members did not make any arrests on Thursday. Several news outlets linked the alleged arrest on Thursday to the arrest of another Swiss national for his connection with the suspects involved in the double murder in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains. The BCIJ arrested the first Swiss suspect on December 29, after the Judicial Office found that the suspect had connections to the main suspects involved in the murders. At least 22 suspects have been arrested in connection to the killing of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland. Authorities found the victims’ bodies on December 17. Fifteen suspects appeared before the investigating judge on December 29. The other seven suspects appeared before the judge on January 3. The public prosecution called on the investigating judge to file a number of charges against the detainees, including the formation of a gang to prepare and commit acts of terrorism, deliberately ending the lives of individuals, and participating in the terrorist attack against the Scandinavian tourists.

Rabat – Security services at the Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca have arrested a Nigerian with 1.325 kilograms of cocaine inside his stomach. The passenger was arrested on January 1 at Mohammed V Airport when he arrived on a flight from Sao Paulo, Brazil, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said in a statement on Wednesday. The suspect was carrying 72 capsules of cocaine in his stomach.  Police transported the suspect to Ibn Rochd University Hospital Center in Casablanca to remove the cocaine from his stomach. He is currently in custody for further investigation under the supervision of the prosecutor’s office, according to DGSN’s statement. The arrest came a week after security services at the Mohammed V International Airport caught a South African traveler and a Namibian traveler with 3.7 kilograms of cocaine inside their stomachs. On December 17, Casablanca airport police arrested a sub-Saharan passenger with nearly 2 kilograms of cocaine in 131 capsules of cocaine concealed inside her stomach. All three passengers arrested also arrived on flights from Sao Paulo. In 2018, police seized 1.65 tons of cocaine, over 1.3 million psychotropic and ecstasy pills (up 43 percent over 2017), 52 tons of cannabis resin, and 693 kilograms of cannabis.

Rabat – Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN Omar Hilale has counted off Polisario’s provocative actions conducted in restricted areas in Western Sahara. Hilale recalled that Polisario conducted military maneuvers with heavy equipment and live ammunition in the town of Mehriz on January 6.  The following day, Polisario moved an “administrative structure” to the same town and claimed it a “liberated zone.” On January 8, the Polisario also deployed two military vehicles in the buffer zone of Guerguerat, according to Hilale. The diplomat said that Morocco was concerned by Polisario’s acts, which could destabilize the region and “dangerously threaten the ceasefire.” Hilale addressed two letters to the Security Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres. “On the behalf of the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco, I would like to bring to your attention that the Polisario persists in its violations and provocations in the Guerguerat buffer zone, as well as in the east of the defense system in the Moroccan Sahara,” Hilale’s letters read. Hilale added that the actions constitute a “flagrant violation of the provisions of Resolution 2414 of April 27, 2018, in which the Security Council ordered the Polisario to withdraw immediately from the Gurgeurat buffer zone and ordered it not to engage in destabilizing acts of relocation of administrative structures to the east of the defense system in the Moroccan Sahara.” The letters also said that Polisario’s acts represent a “reprehensible denial of the commitments of the Polisario not to return to the buffer zone of Guerguerat, nor transfer any structure to the east of the defense wall.” Polisario’s actions do not violate only Resolution 2414, but also the recently adopted Resolution 2440, which clearly urged Polisario not to conduct any action that might change the status quo of the region.

Rabat – Rabat’s first Korean cultural center, the Maru Culture Center, opened last week with Korean song and dance performances. Located in Rabat’s Youssoufia neighborhood, the center offers Moroccans a window into Korean culture and gives foreigners an introduction to Moroccan culture. Two Korean couples, Jin Tae-sang and Chung Hyunhui and Park Seup and Park Seon-young, founded the center. The couples have a combined 32 years of experience living in Morocco. Director Chung Hyunhui told Morocco World News, “Maru Culture Center wants to help people know people through cultural activities. To understand other cultures more, we should know their languages first.” The center offers lessons in four languages from French and Darija (Moroccan Arabic) for foreigners to Korean and English for Moroccans. Beyond language lessons, Chung said, the center will host “music concerts, cooking classes, and speech competitions in Korean.”  While there are several Korean culture centers around Morocco, Maru is the first of its kind in Rabat.  The name Maru, which comes from the Korean word for sky, reflects the center’s goal to be a place of “unending possibilities.” “We want to know people more and give more opportunities for them to enhance their lives,” Chung told MWN. The center is inclusive of all age groups, and even has young children coming to learn Darija. “There is no age limit here.” With a staff of eight Koreans and Moroccans and four volunteers, Chung said the center is looking to expand its reach with more English volunteer teachers. Chung, Jin, and the Parks see their role as helping bridge culture gaps. “In Maru center we want to help expats merge into the Moroccan context, and on the other hand help Moroccans know more about Korea and its very rich culture.”

Rabat – Minister of Energy and Mines Aziz Rabbah announced Wednesday that authorities closed 2,000 “abandoned and illicitly exploited” mineshafts in Jerada, eastern Morocco. Rabbah promised to close the 1,500 remaining shafts by the end of 2019, AFP reported. Jerada, an impoverished city, witnessed multiple informal miners’ deaths and accidents during the last two years. In two separate mine accidents, four informal miners died in December 2017. Two of them were crushed while mining underground at an abandoned mineshaft in Jerada. Another miner died while extracting coal from an illegal mine near the city when the walls of the mine collapsed and killed him on February 1, 2018. The death of miners sparked a wave of protests denouncing social inequality and unemployment. The protests also led to several arrests. A court handed down the first sentences for protesters on November 8 last year. Nine people received three to five years in prison. Early last year, the government promised to shut abandoned shafts, stop illegal mining in the region, and offer in return economic opportunities for the local population. The government said in February 2018 it would launch an industrial zone for Jerada to “provide young entrepreneurs in several business sectors with the opportunity to carry out their projects. However, the city’s informal miners have continued to venture into abandoned mineshafts and sell coal to local brokers, to earn a living. Due to lack of safety precautions, at least eight more accidental deaths occurred last year, including five in November alone. Minister Rabbah said Wednesday that Morocco granted 26 mining permits in 2018 to young miners in the region “attached to special cooperatives,” according to AFP. The state will invest $95 million in industry and agriculture projects by 2020, Rabbah added. In 1998, the government closed a coal mine employing 9,000 workers leading to a collapse in the city’s main industry. The mine, according to AFP, was judged uneconomical.

Ayoub Mabrouk, a 21-year-old Moroccan kick-boxing champion who drowned off the coast of Spain while trying to irregularly migrate, was buried in Sale, Rabat’s twin city, on Wednesday. Mabrouk’s close friends, relatives, and Moroccan social media users lamented his early death driven by his dream to migrate. Mabrouk’s coach, Noureddine Belmalha, shared old pictures of them and of Mabrouk’s coffin during his funeral.  Spain repatriated Mabrouk’s body which arrived on Tuesday, January 8. He was buried in Sidi Daoui cemetery in his home city, Sale. Mabrouk drowned last November off the coast of Cadiz in southern Spain while he and other Moroccans tried to immigrate from Tangier. After their boat wrecked near Los Canos de Meca beach, 18 of 23 migrants on board died, Mabrouk included, according to Spanish news outlet Europa Press. Five of the victims were buried in December in Kenitra, north of Sale, and the other  13 were buried in Meknes and Sale. A fan of Moroccan-Dutch super heavyweight kickboxer, Badr Hari, Mabrouk was a three-time kick-boxing champion in national competitions. Mabrouk was one of many young Moroccans who attempt to leave the country in search of better living circumstances. In November 2018, hundreds of African migrants, including Moroccans, died crossing the Mediterranean. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), by November, as many as 631 African migrants had died in 2018 while trying to cross to Spain. About 120 migrants from Africa arrived in the country daily in the same month.

The 75th anniversary of Morocco’s Manifesto of Independence is today. Like this day on January 11 in 1944, Moroccans show commitment towards their country. Determined to make Morocco free, 67 members of Morocco’s national movement signed the Manifesto of Independence in January 1944. The document was then handed over to the colonial authorities and representations of three powers, the US, Great Britain, and the former Soviet Union.  The Independence Manifesto, in which Morocco demanded freedom, expressed the categorical refusal of Moroccans to continue to live under the protectorate of colonizers. The document included general policy demands, including full independence, and Morocco’s territorial integrity under the auspices of the sultan. The commemoration of such events builds national pride and commemorates the sacrifice and determination that was needed to recover complete territorial integrity and full independence. Moroccans of all ages contributed to Morocco’s independence. The anniversary of the event is an annual opportunity to pay tribute to the men and women of the national resistance and liberation movement who fought for independence and to preserve national dignity. The writing of the manifesto is not the only historic era when Moroccans acted heroically towards their country; there is a long history of Morocco fighting back against colonization. All Moroccans remember the battles led by Moroccan heroes, such as the iconic free leader of the Battle of Annual, Abd El Krim Khattabi, who led a strong movement against Spanish and French colonizers. Moroccans defeated the plans of colonizers who spared no effort to control the country from the south to the north a century ago. The leadership of Sultan Mohammed V, later King Mohammed V, contributed to the complete independence of the country. The late monarch seized an opportunity at the Anfa conference, which took place in January 1943, to discuss Moroccan independence. The sultan’s strategy helped Morocco gain support from powerful world leaders such as American President Franklin Roosevelt. Morocco obtained its complete freedom from the French colonial rule in March 1956, and freed itself from the Spaniards just a month later. The late King struggled against colonizers when tension broke out in August 1953, and colonial powers decided to exile Sultan Mohammed V and the rest of the royal family, including late King Hassan II, who was crown prince of Morocco at the time. The decision resulted in a revolution from the Moroccan resistance and liberation army who fought for Morocco’s territorial integrity on behalf of the beloved sultan. After three years in exile, the royal family came home in 1955 when Sultan Mohammed V successfully negotiated Morocco’s independence with France and Spain.

Rabat – After Morocco’s interior minister Abdelouafi Laftit finished his round of meetings with trade unions, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani decided on Thursday that Laftit would take over his own meetings with the trade unions.

Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi  said that the decision to designate the interior minister to continue negotiations with trade union leaders followed a meeting between Othmani and several government officials involved in the “social dialogue.”
 
At the press conference following the weekly cabinet meeting on Thursday, El Khalfi said that Laftit would hold a second meeting with trade union leaders, but in return stressed that any agreement with them would be reached with El Othmani’s approval.

The head of government decided to charge Laftit with the social dialogue after he himself failed to convince the trade union representatives of reaching a compromise on wage increases.

This week, the interior minister met with the Moroccan Trade Union Confederation of Labor, the Democratic Confederation of Labor, the General Federation of Moroccan Workers, and the National Labor Union of Morocco.

Public health officials and the Ministry of Health recently reached common ground on raising Moroccan doctors’ working standards, especially wage raises, leave, and retirement, easing tensions in a sector that threatened to go on strike by mid-January.

Rabat – A children’s educational book called “L’atlas du Monde,” distributed by a Casablanca publishing house, showed a map of the Middle East with a blank space instead of the names Palestine or Israel. Only the flag of Israel is seen, which stirred uproar among Moroccans who support the Palestinian cause. The Moroccan Anti-Normalization Center shared a post about the book on its official Facebook page, pointing out the danger of “normalizing” the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The center called for the government to open an investigation into the book. The book, which teaches children about different cultures in the world, also shows a map with countries like Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Iran, Kuwait, and Jordan. Controversially, the book mentions Israel instead of Palestine. The French description next to a picture of the  Dome of the Rock reads: “Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. It is a sacred city for Jews.” “Let’s say that a book excluded Western Sahara from the Moroccan map, would we still be silent and nonchalant?” the same post questioned.   
It was only in mid-December that the Moroccan transport company CTM allegedly excluded Western Sahara from the Moroccan map in an advertisement and angered Moroccans who defended the country’s territorial integrity. CTM later denied they had created the advertisement. US President Donald Trump formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on December 6, 2017. While Trump’s move was warmly welcomed by Israel, it was strongly condemned by Arab leaders. King Mohammed VI, King Abdullah of Jordan, and King Salman of Saudi Arabia attempted to stop Trump from making the decision.

Rabat –Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita, received the Tunisian secretary of state for foreign affairs, Sabri Bachtobji, an envoy of Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi, on Thursday in Rabat. Bachtobji brought a message to King Mohammed VI.

Bachtobji told the press that he delivered an invitation from Essebsi to King Mohammed VI to attend the Arab League Summit in Tunis at the end of March. King Mohammed VI has not attended an Arab League Summit since 2005 in Algiers. In 2016, the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on Morocco’s non-attendance at the summit, saying “given the absence of important concrete initiatives which could be submitted to Arab Heads of State, this summit will only be an occasion to take ordinary resolutions and deliver speeches which pretend to give a false impression of unity and solidarity between Arab States.” 
He added that his discussions with Bourita focused on ways to strengthen bilateral relations following the decisions made at the 19th session of the Moroccan-Tunisian High Joint Commission, in June 2017. “Several ideas, projects and initiatives from both sides are under way,” Bachtobji said. The Tunisian official also stated that the next Arab Summit’s main objective will be to give a new start to joint Arab action and solidarity. Nasser Bourita met with the Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit, on Tuesday in Cairo to discuss ways to strengthen joint Arab action.

Washington D.C. – The New Yorker magazine’s unflattering article “Is One of Africa’s Oldest Conflicts Finally Nearing Its End?,” John Bolton’s speech at the Heritage Foundation, and the House bill excluding the Western Sahara from US economic assistance to Morocco gave the jitters to weary Moroccan officials. Many question how, as the most dependable American ally in the region, Morocco has found itself in this predicament. For years, Moroccan officials in Washington, and in some Anglo-Saxon capitals, have shunned journalists, academics, and NGO activists who may hold pro-Algeria secessionist views on Western Sahara. Avoiding unfriendly journalists working for major media organizations or denying entry to researchers from known organizations is a misguided policy that cost Morocco a load of bad press and unnecessary diplomatic headaches. In denying access to journalists like the New Yorker’s Nicolas Niarchos, Rabat weakens its arguments. In keeping silent about Bolton’s comments on Western Sahara, Morocco allows its opponents to define and control the message in Washington. Morocco needs Moroccan foreign policy professionals familiar with the American political system, media, and academia who can engage American professionals to explain, defend, and advocate for Moroccan issues. It is time for Moroccan officials to realize that their strategy of cajoling former US government officials into writing friendly news articles is not a substitute for a long-term plan to influence foreign policy community members through sustained and well-organized visits to Western Sahara. Despite heavily investing in lobbying and public relations efforts in Washington, the kingdom has fallen short of garnering solid and consistent political and diplomatic support among leading think tanks, academic institutions, major news outfits, and independent political analysts who greatly influence the media and government officials. The kingdom should do a better job in sending competent and informed academics who can plead their nation’s case in front of journalists, lawmakers, and human rights advocates in the United States. Moroccan officials rarely engage influential intellectuals and historians who can inform and educate the American public and the decision makers of Rabat’s rightful positions in Western Sahara. Because of a lack of trained and well-informed Moroccan public relations professionals, most of the high value events of recent years supporting Rabat’s agenda have gone unnoticed in the American media. Furthermore, Moroccan politicians and diplomats rarely follow up or nurture on-going relations with leading American intellectuals who guide the Washington establishment. Even when American think tanks issue pro-Morocco papers, Rabat fails to capitalize on the results and fumbles in disseminating such useful literature. Morocco’s struggles to thrust its agenda into the spotlight in Washington are not new. Notwithstanding articles written by pro-Morocco authors and circulated in conservative publications with limited reach, Rabat could not find high profile voices in the United States despite its extended presence and financial power. Moroccan media portrays the United States as a dedicated and strong ally, yet Washington never recognized the Sahara as Moroccan. In a few instances, the US State Department issued statements supporting Morocco’s local autonomy plan as a viable solution, but never pushed for a census of Sahrawi refugees in Algeria or called for an investigation into reported cases of Polisario guerrilla leadership’s embezzlement of international aid. Washington’s position in Western Sahara has been a balance between keeping Rabat happy and not angering Algiers. A cautious position, which continues today under Trump, is a statement to the limits and shortcomings of Morocco’s over-reliance on lobbyists to do all the diplomatic work. Rabat’s persistent refusal to review its public relations approach in Washington stems from officials’ failure to engage in a conscientious and candid self-examination of the limited long-term successes of Morocco’s expensive lobbying efforts in the United States. With a Democratic House, powerful US senators pushing the Algerian agenda, John Bolton as national security adviser to President Trump, and a new US ambassador to the UN, Washington is growing into a frosty city for Moroccans. It is now up to Rabat to redraw a fresh PR strategy and adopt a new diplomatic culture to adjust to this new reality.

Rabat – Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani announced Thursday that the government will suspend the implementation of the new tax measures using electronic invoicing which recently sparked uproar among merchants. Speaking at the weekly Government Council meeting, El Othmani said he seeks to communicate with concerned government sectors and merchants’ representatives “to review the difficulties encountered and find appropriate solutions,” according to a statement released after the meeting. The new tax measures, introduced in the 2018 Finance Law, stipulate that merchants should use an electronic system to issue invoices. To do this, merchants must have billing software approved by tax authorities and an information system allowing a common database with the tax authorities. The measures were expected to come into force in early 2019 with the aim to fight tax fraud. After the the General Directorate of Taxes (DGI) announced the implementation the tax law earlier this month, many wholesalers in Casablanca closed their shops and held a sit-in at La Victoire Place protesting the new tax law. El Othmani said Thursday that he is closely following the situation along with trade and interior ministers. He also expressed his willingness to “intervene and find a solution to any unacceptable transgression”. The head of government said that the DGI and customs will hold a meeting on January 14 with merchants’ representatives to discuss the issue. Two days after, Moroccan Minister of Trade and Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy will also meet with the chambers of commerce and industry, Customs, and merchants’ representatives for the same purpose. El Othmani affirmed that his government will examine all the proposals that some associations, organizations and trade unions submitted to “achieve balanced solutions that take into account the interests of merchants, businesses, and the national economy, through a frank and constructive dialogue.” The head of government reiterated that small merchants and service providers subject to the the lump sum system are not concerned by the electronic billing system. “We devote special attention to merchants and professionals due to the important role they play in the national economy,” El Othmani said. Following the merchants’ demonstrations, the DGI announced that some media reported false explanations and interpretations of the electronic billing system.   The tax authority denied the explanations, saying they are “completely unfounded” and “indicate a misunderstanding of the new provisions of the 2018 Finance Law,” in a statement on January 8. Speaking at a press briefing after the weekly Government Council meeting, the Government Spokesman to Mustapha El Khalfi said that the new measures “will not be applied until an agreement between all parties is reached.”

Rabat – In response to his “detractors” about his growing closeness to Morocco, Ahmad Ahmad said that Morocco’s commitment to African football’s advancement compels love and admiration. “My strong friendship, affection, and numerous trips to Morocco are not well received in some quarters,” Ahmad conceded in a Radio interview, according to the January 10 edition of the Al Akhbar newspaper. But Ahmad’s acknowledgement of his “controversial” and so-called love affair with Morocco is no renunciation. Rather, he suggested his critics are envious to such a degree that “they are sometimes driven sick” to see him support and regularly visit “a country that is Africa’s friend.” “To those people [critics], I say that I am not interested in what they think. I really like this country,” Ahmad said of Morocco. He went on to explain his “love” by pointing out that Morocco is “a friend of Africa that has shouldered its responsibility toward the continent whenever need arose.” Pointing to the organization of the 2018 CHAN, which Morocco hosted and Ahmad had called the “most successful CHAN” ever organized, the Malagasy said that Morocco stepped in for African football time and time again when it came to hosting tournaments or sponsoring other football events on the continent. “Morocco has on many occasions come to the rescue of African football…. That’s exactly what others have declined to do and that’s why I’m proud of my friendship with a kingdom that has done so much for continental football,” hammered a sentimental Ahmad. While this is the first time Ahmad squarely speaks of his love for and attachment to Morocco, his admiration for Moroccan football is no news to African football watchers. The Malagasy is an admirer of Morocco’s South-South agenda and has been an established pro-Morocco voice in Africa football’s governing body. Is Ahmad’s CAF more supportive of Morocco than it should be? Until this interview, however, Ahmad’s public support for Morocco was couched in cautious language that pointed more to the country’s “advanced infrastructure” and “commitment to pan-African agendas” than his own “affection” and admiration for the North African country. In the build-up to the voting process of the 2026 World Cup hosting rights, Ahmad Ahmad constantly defied FIFA’s “biased and partial” impartiality pleas. The Malagasy on many occasions called on all African countries to cast their votes for Morocco. He argued that Morocco’s victory would be synonymous with Africa’s victory. Most recently, Morocco surprisingly ruled itself out of the late-minute contest for the CAN 2019 hosting rights. When CAF stripped Cameroon of the right to host the continent’s most celebrated football event for being “technically unfit and unprepared,” many expected that Morocco would step in as a last-minute candidate and would get the tacit approval of CAF, regardless of who the other candidates were. But Morocco ditched those expectations. Morocco’s football authorities said that CAN 2019 was not part of their agenda. Critics, however, remain convinced that Rabat simply did not intend to add insult to injury given the widely-circulating rumors that CAF would have backed its bid. Whether critics were wrong, we will never know. Meanwhile, Ahmad Ahmad is adamant about Morocco being a “role model” and an “inspiration” for African football. Like Morocco, African countries need to invest more in infrastructure and show genuine political will to support the advancement of football in their respective countries and at the continental level, Ahmad concluded.

By Zakaria ouadghiri Rabat – Morocco ranks 100th out of 165 countries, with 4.99 points out of 10, in the Democracy Index 2018 by the Economist Intelligence Unit.

Morocco, ranked third in the MENA region after Israel and Tunisia, falls into the category of hybrid systems between “authoritarian regimes” and “flawed democracies.” The report categorized Algeria and Egypt (9th and 10th in MENA) as authoritarian regimes. The report noted Morocco’s “political and business elites continue to be challenged by a nationwide surge in discontent over the rising cost of living, exacerbated by a successful social media campaign calling on ordinary Moroccans to boycott several consumer products.” Morocco’s score has consistently improved since 2006, when it scored 3.90. The Economist, however, predicted Morocco would continue to struggle with social unrest. “It is unlikely that the underlying causes of the [Rif] unrest (such as the entanglement of politics and big business and widespread inequality) will be fully addressed in the near term.” 

Mauritius, Cape Verde, Botswana, South Africa, Lesotho, Ghana, and Tunisia topped the index in Africa. Mauritius is the only African country that has achieved “full democracy” according to the report.

The major changes in 2018 are the transition from a flawed to a full democracy in Costa Rica, and from a flawed democracy to an authoritarian regime in Nicaragua.

Norway heads the world list and North Korea came at the bottom. The US and France rank as flawed democracies. Compared to 2017, the total score fell in 42 countries and improved in 48 countries.

The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index has been providing an overview of democracy in the world since 2006. The index is based on five criteria: the electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, the functioning of government, political participation, and political culture.

Rabat – According to a study by the High Commission for Planning (HCP) based on interviews with Moroccan households, 82 percent of households said that they will be unable to save in the next twelve months. Describing households who do not expect to save as “pessimistic” about their financial situation, HCP showed the balance of opinion between households who expressed negative opinions versus the ones who expressed positive opinions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the balance of opinion was –63 points, slightly better than the -65 points in the quarter before it, but worse than the -59 points a year earlier. The rate of households who reported that food prices increased in the last twelve months was 90.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018. As few as 0.1 percent of households believe that food prices decreased. The balance of opinion on food prices remained negative at -88 points in the previous quarter and -89 points a year before. For the next twelve months, 86.9 percent of households think that food prices will continue to rise, but only 0.3 percent believe the prices will decrease. The perceptions of Moroccan households regarding the rise of food prices is not a surprise.  In the beginning of 2018, only 21 percent of households expected to save money in the coming year, whereas 79 percent said that they would be unable to save, according to HCP. Last year, households anticipated higher food prices, deterioration of their living standards, and inability to save money and purchase durable goods. The households’ predictions played out in the April 2018 boycott that targeted three major companies, Afriquia gasoline, Centrale Danone (dairy products), and Sidi Ali (mineral water), due to high prices. The boycott campaign was a way for Moroccans to say that the daily living expenses weighed on their shoulders.

By Carolina McCaber Rabat – In the December regional elections, Spain’s Vox party won parliamentary seats in Andalusia for the first time. The party caters to Spain’s far-right through anti-immigrant, nationalist, and anti-feminist policies. The party advocates for increased border security and hopes to add a large wall to the already existing barriers surrounding the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. Some immigrants crossing from Morocco to Spain try to enter the Spanish enclaves by scaling the fences that mark the border. Spain relies on the efforts of Moroccan authorities to stop migrants from traveling to Spain either through Ceuta and Melilla or crossing the Strait of Gibraltar. However, the number of migrants arriving to Spain continues to increase. According to the International Organization for Migration, in 2017, the number of migrants reaching Spain almost tripled to nearly 22,000 and the number of drownings off the coast of Spain almost doubled. Spain received the most migrants by sea of all European countries in 2018. Most of the migrants landed in Spain’s southern region of Andalusia. The increased number of migrant arrivals in the region led to greater anti-immigrant sentiment. The Vox party desires to protect and defend Spain from immigrants, Catalan and Basque nationalists, and the European Union. ‘100 measures to keep Spain alive’ In October, the Vox party released its “100 measures to keep Spain alive,” which in part rejected immigration. Vox advocates for the deportation of migrants who entered Spain illegally, permanent entry bans, and a policy which conditions aid to other countries on their acceptance of repatriated immigrants with criminal records. In addition to the policy changes, the party prioritizes a wall along the borders of the Spanish exclaves and wishes to strengthen Spanish armed forces. The party wants country immigration quotas favoring nationalities who speak Spanish and share “significant cultural and friendship ties with Spain.” Additionally, Vox plans to control the flow of immigration depending on economic needs and the adaptability and integration of new arrivals. For immigrants who enter Spain illegally, Vox wants them to “be permanently ineligible for legal status, and thus ineligible for any form of state aid.” In addition to an anti-immigrant rhetoric, the party is against Islamic fundamentalism. Vox hopes to “shut down fundamentalist mosques” and to “arrest and deport extremist imams.” The party also calls for Spain to return to centralized political control. The desired change in political control would revoke the administrative autonomy of the country’s 17 regions. Citing weak leadership in the Popular party, some supporters have found the competitive leadership they desire in Vox’s leader, Santiago Abascal. Yet, some analysts believe Vox’s anti-immigrant rhetoric may not resonate with voters from outside the region of Andalusia, where Vox gained its parliamentary seats.

Rabat – Pharmastudents.com, a Facebook page, has condemned what it calls increasing violence against Moroccan students in Ukraine. The Facebook page shared pictures yesterday of a Moroccan medical student beaten by Ukrainian police last year. The post tells how Moroccan medical student Saad Ghazi was subjected to violence from “a special unit of Ukrainian police who tried to extort money from him.” When Ghazi refused to give them money, the police roughed him up. “Thursday, December 20, he found those same policemen trying to extort money from another Moroccan.” Ghazi then tried to “defend his Moroccan fellow.” The police asked Ghazi to leave, but he refused. “Or what? Are you going to hit me?” he asked the police. Saad Ghazi’s father, Mustapha Ghazi, was quoted by Pharmastudents as saying, “He was furious to see that they were attacking a fellow Moroccan.”  Mustapha also said that the police hit his son’s face while Saad was on the ground. A video circulating on media shows the incident. “We filed a complaint, because Saad did not do anything. They tried to scare us by saying that the police could turn the incident against him, but if he was guilty, they would have come looking for him,” the father added. Photos circulating on media show the student’s face covered in blood and with bruised eyes. Mustapha told Pharmastudents.com that the Moroccan embassy in Ukraine did not support his son. According to the Facebook page, in 2017, a Moroccan student was found killed in Kharkov. Police said that the man’s body was found with knife wounds.

Rabat – Morocco produced 35 percent of its electricity output from renewable energy sources by the end of 2018 with an installed capacity of about 3,000 megawatts, Minister of Energy, Mining, and Sustainable Development Aziz Rabbah said Wednesday in Rabat at the ministry’s media day. The kingdom aims to produce 52 percent of its electricity mix from renewable sources by 2030. The ministry set ambitious objectives to expand its renewable energy capacity to 10,000 megawatts by 2030. The additional capacity includes 4,500 megawatts of solar energy, 4,200 megawatts of wind energy, and 1,300 megawatts of hydroelectric energy, Rabbah added. To achieve its objectives, the ministry, along with energy sector partners, has developed an energy strategy including programs and reforms, the minister explained. In October 2018, Rabbah said that the state will invest over $40 billion in the energy sector by 2030, including in a liquefied natural gas project. The government will allocate $30 billion of the total amount to renewable energy projects. Rabbah emphasized at the Wednesday media day that Morocco is engaged in an energy transition which brought about a “very satisfactory” electricity reserve margin. Renewable energies have reduced Morocco’s energy dependence from 98 percent in 2008 to 93 percent currently, mainly due to a rise in renewable energy, according to the minister. Morocco spent MAD 69 billion on imported energy in 2017. However, Rabbah said that energy demand has been continuously growing over the last ten years at an annual rate of 4 percent. The national energy strategy, which focuses on developing renewable energy sources, will help meet the constraints of growing internal energy demand and reduce the country’s external energy dependence. Morocco’s main energy consumers are the transport sector at 38 percent, followed by the construction sector at 33 percent, and the industrial sector at 21 percent, the minister said. Morocco’s overall consumption of primary energy amounted to 20.8 million tons in 2017, including oil (56 percent) and coal (26 percent). Rabbah mentioned Morocco’s energy efficiency project to “achieve an energy saving of around 20 percent by 2030, targeting the biggest energy consuming sectors.” The Government Council reviewed the project in June 2017. The first phase of the study of the energy efficiency project in public administrations and buildings is expected to be completed this year. A German-Moroccan cooperation financed the study for MAD 3 million.

Rabat – The Moroccan government has responded to Polisario’s escalating actions after the separatist group conducted military maneuvers east of Morocco’s defense wall earlier this week. The government turned to the United Nations Security Council, which had previously firmly warned Polisario against any action that might escalate tension or change the status quo in Western Sahara. The government sent the Security Council a dossier documenting Polisario’s actions in Mehriz, a town east of the berm. Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said Morocco’s reporting on Polsiario’s maneuvers is continuous and constant. El Khalfi told reporters after the weekly cabinet meeting Thursday that when UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issues his annual report on Western Sahara, it will show the number of reports Morocco makes about Polisario’s maneuvers in the region in order for the UN to bear its responsibility in responding to the violations. He added that the provocative actions of Polisario put the separatist group in confrontation with the UN and not Morocco. Resolution 2440 was a blow for Polisario because it clearly warned against any actions in the buffer zone as well as in towns east of Morocco’s defense wall, a region claimed as a “liberated zone” by Polisario. Morocco documented the “provocative” actions through its new satellite, Mohammed VI-B, which it launched in November 2018. Morocco’s Permanent Ambassador to the UN Omar Hilale also sent messages to the UN Secretary-General and the Security Council to warn them of the “provocative” actions of the Polisario Front. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita also called the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Kohler regarding Polisario’s maneuvers. Bourita reportedly also called US National Security Adviser John Bolton to warn him of the effect of the maneuvers on the series of roundtable talks launched in Geneva in December. The Security Council will meet on January 29 to consult on the peacekeeping operation in Western Sahara known as MINURSO.  Polisario has been defying UN restrictions recently. On January 7, the separatist group inaugurated facilities in Mehriz after conducting military maneuvers. The inauguration of the facilities and the military actions in Mehriz are a violation of the 1991 ceasefire agreement and UN resolutions, including Resolution 2440 adopted in October 2018.

Rabat – As the European Parliament prepares to deliver its final vote on the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement, some pro-Polisario forces from within the European body are again challenging the validity of the agreement. Paloma Lopez, a member of the European Parliament from Spain’s Izquierda Unida (United Left) Party and a vocal pro Polisario voice, is reportedly leading a “final battle” to “complicate” and question the legal foundations of the agriculture deal between Rabat and Brussels. According to some reports, the Spanish MP is seeking to mobilize support from other MEPs to stand in the way of “direct adoption” of the agreement when the EU Parliament meets in a week’s time to deliver on the issue. Challenging the “legitimacy” of Rabat-Brussels agreements in the agriculture and food sector has become a norm. In February last year, the first blow to Morocco-EU deals came when Polisario’s lobbying efforts succeeded in creating a debate about the legitimacy of the Morocco-EU fisheries deal.  The European Court of Justice ruled in favor of Polisario, but the EU Commission and Parliament sided with Rabat. That agreement was only renewed last summer, after months of discussions about the deal’s “political bases” and financial returns for both Rabat and Brussels. In a written note asking for support from MEPs to challenge the agriculture agreement, Lopez wrote, “The EU Commission’s trade department has adopted an agreement that includes the occupied territories of Western Sahara.”  Lopez explained in the letter that she was seeking to “collect the 76 signatures required for a resolution proposal.” If Lopez convinces as many as 76 MEPs, she will have license to ask for the ECJ’s legal opinion before the final vote, which will delay the agreement’s adoption timeframe. The agreement, which like a number of other Morocco-EU deals went through a cycle of controversies from pro-Polisario circles, was formally adopted on December 10 after the European Commission’s department of international trade voted to renew the deal.  Back then, the crushing majority of the European body pointed to the advantages of the agreement for Europe, as well as Morocco’s “committed” and “strategic” alliance with the EU on an array of policy issues. But while Morocco-supporting MEPs have downplayed the “seriousness” of the recent challenge from Lopez and her cohort of like-minded MEPs, they are concerned about time constraints.  However minor the challenge that Lopez’s actions pose to a deal “that is sure to pass the vote” of the Parliament, “it might disturb the general climate of the normal voting procedure,” according to sources from the European Parliament quoted by Moroccan outlet Le 360. The EU Parliament will convene on January 16 to deliver its final verdict on the adoption of the agreement.

Rabat – Days before the Amazigh (Berber) New Year celebrations begin in Algeria, Algerian Muslim scholars have argued that celebrating it is haram (forbidden in Islam), dividing Algerian public opinion. The Algerian Fatwa Commission at the Association of the Algerian Muslim Ulema has presented a controversial “fatwa,” religious ruling, regarding the celebrations. The fatwa asserts that the new year is not permissible because it originated in the pagan pre-Islamic era, the epitome of “ignorance.” The president of the commission, El Abidine Ben Hanafia, emphasized that the festivities of the January 12 new year, known as Yennayer in Tamazight (Berber), would compete with and “hurt” the major Islamic holidays. Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan and Eid al-Adha is celebrated two months later as the feast of sacrifice.  An Algerian researcher and author, Mohamed Arezki Ferrad, argued back in a statement to Algerian news outlet, Rai Alyaoum, that celebrating the Amazigh New Year is necessary to engender love for Algerian values, culture, and history. The fatwa has also angered some Algerians on social media who stated that their country is trying to “make everything haram.” Algeria’s President Abdelaziz Bouteflika recognized the Amazigh New Year as an official public holiday in a decree on December 27, 2017. On Saturday, the country will welcome the year 2,969. In Morocco, activists are still calling for the government to make Yennayer a national and public holiday. The Amazigh youth organization “Tamesna” will organize demonstrations outside Parliament in Rabat on Yennayer for the sixth year in a row. Mentioning Morocco’s 2011 Constitution, which recognized Tamazight  as an official language alongside Arabic, the president of the Moroccan news outlet, “Alalam Al Amazighi,” (Amazigh World), Amina Ben Sheikh recently sent a petition to King Mohammed VI to recognize Yennayer as a public holiday. Ben Sheikh thinks that “recognizing the Amazigh New Year as an official national holiday side by side with the other national holidays would restore the spirit and philosophy of the Constitution.”

Rabat – Moroccan and Belgian officials took part in a ceremony in memory of Moroccan soldiers who fought alongside the Allies in World War II, on Wednesday at the French national military necropolis in Chastre, near Brussels.  The ceremony commemorated the Moroccan soldiers who fought in the Battle of Gembloux between French and German forces in May 1940.

The Belgian minister of state, Andre Flahaut, told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that the ceremony symbolizes the “very strong ties” between Morocco and Belgium. Flahaut commended the bravery of Moroccan soldiers in defending freedom, solidarity, and coexistence.  The Moroccan deputy minister in charge of administrative and civil service reform, Mohamed Ben Abdelkader, attended the event.

On May 14, 1940, soldiers of the 7th Moroccan Rifle Regiment, part of France’s Army of Africa, reached Gembloux after two days of marching, clashing with Nazi troops.

Belgium also held a ceremony on the 78th anniversary of the Battle of Gembloux in memory of the Moroccan soldiers last May in Chastre.

The Moroccan skirmishers who fought in World War II are also remembered for having liberated Corsica from German and Italian occupation, leading to its independence in 1943.

Rabat – A statement published by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) showed international car manufacturer Renault continues to dominate Moroccan car sales. A statement from the Renault Group said that its market share increased to 42.5 percent in 2018 from 41.8 percent in 2017. In 2018, Renault subsidiary Dacia launched the new Dacia Duster. The Dacia Duster had the fifth best sales of all Renault Group car models in 2018 with cumulative deliveries exceeding 8,000 units in just 8 months. Renault Morocco also said that its car sales grew 7 percent over 2017 while the automotive market overall grew 5 percent. The Renault and Dacia makes remain key market leaders in number of cars sold, according to the statement. “Dacia has consolidated its leading position in the passenger vehicle and commercialCARvehicle market with cumulative market shares ranging from 27.8% in 2017 to 28.0% in 2018.” The press release added that Dacia sold a record 49,649 cars in 2018, up from 46,851 in 2017. In 2017, Renault sold 27,769 vehicles and increased its market share from 14.1 percent in 2017 to 14.5 percent in 2018. The increase confirms the company’s position as the second most popular make in the Moroccan market. Six of the group’s models made the top ten best selling models in Morocco in 2018, including the Dacia Logan, Renault Clio, Dacia Dokker, Dacia Sandero Dacia Duster, and Renault Kangoo. The Association of Importers of Vehicles in Morocco announced an increase in Moroccan automotive sales overall in 2018. Moroccans bought 177,400 cars in 2018, compared to 168,136 vehicles in 2017, up by 5 percent.

Rabat – Polisario leading member Ahmed El Khalil, who was “kidnapped” by Algerian intelligence agents over 9 years ago, died on Wednesday, according to former Polisario officer Mustapha Salma Oueld Sidi Mouloud. “Paradoxically, the deceased was arrested after his appointment in charge of the human rights file under the Polisario Front,” Mustafa Salma wrote on his Facebook. Polsiario tasked El Khalil with human rights in the Tindouf camps in Algeria in 2009. Mustafa Salma, an anti-Polisario activist, said that he knew El Khalil well in the early 1990s when Salma was a general manager of the judicial police in the Tindouf camps. Mustafa Salma described receiving instructions from the Polisario presidency to arrest El Khalil. “I knew that the detainee had been jailed and hidden by the [Algerian] intelligence services for almost a month after I consulted [El Khalil’s] case.” He added that the Polisario’s charges against El Khalil could not be proven, “and I suggested that he should be released.” Mustafa Salma said that Polisario “insisted on turning him into the [Algerian] police.” He also recalled that an Algerian intelligence vehicle brought El Khalil to Polisario after he had spent a month in detention. “I summoned [El Khalil] to my office and I handed him the charge sheet against him signed by the Polisario presidency, and I told him that I was ordered to keep him with us and that we had nothing to do with his case,” Mustafa Salma wrote.
 He added that two months later, Polisario asked the judicial police to “release him after a settlement between the elders of the tribe and the Polisario presidency.” Shortly after, Algerian intelligence services kidnapped El Khalil. In 2017, the family of El Khalil called on the United Nations to pressure Algeria and the separatist group to reveal El Khalil’s fate. Mustafa Salma, a former Polisario commanding officer, has been criticizing Polisario and Algeria for the situation in Western Sahara. He also expressed satisfaction with the UN Resolution 2440 adopted on October 31. He said that the resolution “condoned everything Morocco is doing in the Saharan regions west of the berm.”  Despite the firm language of the resolution, Polisario has conducted provocative maneuvers again, defying calls from both Morocco and the UN against any change to the status quo in the region. It is not the first time Polisario has been accused of provocative actions or kidnapping. In 2018, Spanish news outlet El Confidencial said that Polisario members were involved in the kidnappings of Spanish citizens working in the Phosboucraa site, Laayoune, in 1974.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of Trade and Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy will meet with the chambers of commerce and industry on January 16 following merchants’ strikes against the new electronic invoicing, the industry ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. Early this month, the General Directorate of Taxes (DGI) announced the implementation of new tax measures using electronic invoicing. The measures stipulate that merchants should use an electronic system to issue invoices. To do this, merchants must have billing software approved by tax authorities and an information system allowing a common database with the tax authorities. The government introduced the measures in the 2018 Finance Law at the end of 2017 and were expected to come into force in early 2019. The new measures sparked uproar among merchants. On January 3, many wholesalers in Casablanca closed their shops and held a sit-in at La Victoire Place protesting the new tax law. The protesting merchants were from Derb Omar, Allal Garage Allal, Korea, and Bayada, the main commercial sites in Casablanca. On January 4, Elalamy called on merchants to present their demands in an organized manner through the chambers of commerce and industry. Following the merchants’ demonstrations, the DGI announced that some media reported false explanations and interpretations of the electronic billing system.   The tax authority denied the explanations, saying they are “completely unfounded” and “indicate a misunderstanding of the new provisions of the 2018 Finance Law.” The DGI explained that the electronic billing system “concerns only professionals subject to financial control and does not apply to merchants and service providers subject to the lump sum system,” in a statement on January 8. “The new billing system provisions have not yet entered into force and will only be implemented after the publication of the law.” In the January 16 meeting, Minister Elalamy will discuss the merchants’ demands with their representatives. Members of the DGI and customs will also attend the meeting.

Rabat – The prefectural service of the Tangier Judicial Police seized 15 tons and 244 kilograms of cannabis resin Wednesday, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said Thursday.

The police found the drugs in a hollowed-out section specially designed for drug trafficking on a Morocco-registered truck in Tangier’s Bukhalef district, according to the DGSN statement.

Preliminary evidence leads police to believe that a cross-border criminal network is involved in trafficking the large quantities of drugs. The network allegedly created shell companies as a cover for illicit activities and maintained links with criminal networks in Morocco or Europe. 
The confiscation was part of the police department’s ongoing investigation which led to the discovery last Saturday of the first cargo of 13 tons and 750 kilograms at the Tangiers-Med Port. 
Tangier’s Prefectural Police Department arrested two French nationals of Tunisian and Moroccan origins on Friday suspected of storing and trafficking cannabis and psychotropic drugs. Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces (FAR) seized 3.7 tons of cannabis resin when it foiled a drug trafficking operation in Guelta Zemmour west of the Sahara berm.

Rabat – A former high-ranking Algerian official has said that Algeria is doomed to political failure and economic crisis unless there is mobilization to make the current regime relinquish its hold on power and the country’s resources. According to economist Ahmed Benbitour, who led the Algerian government as prime minister from 1999 to 2000, Algeria is going through a deep political crisis due to the “autocratic and paternalistic” regime.  Benbitour said Algeria’s “responsible elites” have to assess the situation, inform the population of the dire state, and force a “peaceful” regime change. Benbitour made his remarks in Algiers on Monday this week while speaking at a conference on “The Mission of Elites in Saving the Country.”  “Our country is governed by an authoritarian, paternalistic, and patrimonialist regime that thrives on rent-seeking and economic predation,” Benbitour said. “A regime change is the key to solving all of our other governance-linked issues.”  Algeria is an energy-rich country, with considerable reserves of oil and natural gas. According to Benbitour, however, “irresponsible” spending and “the lack of vision” of the ruling class have put the country in a situation where its economy depends entirely on external rents. So “lacking” is Algeria’s economic model that it cannot meet the minimum requirements of the government’s budget. “The disintegration is characterized by the institutionalization of ignorance and stagnation, morothe personality cult, the institutionalization of corruption, the replacement of qualified state institutions with a restricted circle of people, and the transformation of state power into clans of authority.” He explained that the fierce power struggle between sub-clans in the presidential circle deeply impacts the lives of citizens whose daily struggles to make ends meet are ignored by “the corrupt and detached ruling elite.” The political crisis and the “lack of planning” coming from the regime’s highest places have a perceptible impact on the country’s political culture, Benbitour argued.  As government corruption and “irresponsibility” leaves little room to escape from the country’s woes, Algerian society finds itself mired in “generalized corruption, fatalism, and individualism.” In such a context, “violence becomes the only legitimate means to resolve conflicts between people.” Already suffering from over-dependence on oil, the Algerian economy is now “volatile, vulnerable, and totally dependent on foreign money.” Benbitour foresaw more troubles for the Algerian economy because the value of imports far outweighs export revenues.  With such bleak comments on Algeria’s political prospects, Benbitour has joined a chorus of political commentators, researchers, and politicians who agree that the Bouteflika regime has reached a point where it causes more harm than good for Algeria.  As the ailing 82-year-old president prepares to bid for another term in the upcoming election in April, many Algerians and foreign observers have questioned the president’s ability to govern the country. “An invisible hand is governing Algeria… The invisible hand astonishes everyone and is the source of all the obstructions facing investments in the country. I don’t think President Bouteflika knows about this obstruction…. The economic situation is untenable,” an Algerian CEO said recently, doubting whether President Bouteflika is in command of the government.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) arrested an English-Swiss suspect for alleged ties with ISIS in Temara,  a city 15 kilometers south of Rabat, on Thursday, a source told Morocco World News. The suspect has alleged contacts with ISIS fighters, said the source. The suspect is the second foreign dual national Morocco has arrested in the last month. Morocco arrested a Swiss-Spanish suspect in connection to the double murder of two Scandinavian tourists killed near Imlil in the Atlas Mountains. The suspect was arrested on December 28 in Morocco. He faces heavy charges, including teaching the main suspects how to commit crimes. The bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Uland were found on December 17, 2018. Police have arrested 23 suspects in connection with the murders. Suspects convicted of terror-related crimes typically receive 10- to 15-year prison sentences.

Rabat – The Moroccan cross-dresser arrested on New Year’s Day for a hit-and-run accident expressed his desire to leave Morocco after the insults he received from Moroccans for cross-dressing. During his hearing at a court in Marrakech on Tuesday, the man reportedly announced that he was planning to seek asylum abroad. The man also presented a medical certificate to the court, indicating the deterioration of his psychological health following the incident. Police arrested the cross-dresser in Marrakech after he hit a motorcycle driver with hs vehicle and attempted to run away. The moment passersby and witnesses caught a glimpse of the man’s appearance—wearing makeup, a wig, and a dress—they attacked him with insults. Videos and pictures of the incident have been widely shared on social media networks.  Many Moroccans slurred the man for disrespecting Moroccan culture and society, calling him “immoral” and “effeminate.”  Others condemned the sharing of pictures and videos as “disrespectful” and “a violation” of his personal freedom. After pictures and videos showing the man’s face leaked online,  the director general of National Security, Abdellatif Hammouchi, ordered the general inspection commission to investigate whether any police were behind the leaks. Hammouchi sanctioned four policemen for not preserving the personal and private data of the individual, promising disciplinary sanctions ranging from warnings to temporary suspensions for them.

Rabat – In 2012, Moroccans dedicated 6 hours and 40 minutes of their day to free time. Activities like surfing the internet and watching television took up the most time, according to a survey by Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP). The survey reveals how Moroccans spend their free time. The study, conducted between 2011 and 2012, shows that Moroccans spend 84 percent of their free time doing six principal practices: Watching television (2 hours 14 minutes), religious practices (59 minutes), napping (43 minutes), idleness (38 minutes), discussions (37 minutes), and hosting or visiting (26 minutes). Moroccans aged 15 and above spend on average 2 hours and 14 minutes watching television, or 33.6 percent of their free time. They only spend 2 minutes in practicing sports or reading. Children devote 3 hours daily to watching television, an average of 43.6 percent of their free time. However, they only spend 2 minutes practicing sports and one minute reading. Social media networks are the main platforms children use on the internet, while they only devote 5 percent of their internet usage to educational research. Children spend more time browsing, an average of 12 minutes daily, surpassing adults whose daily average browsing is 4 minutes. Television, radio, and internet are the youth’s major means of opening up to the rest of the world. Sixty-eight percent of youth stated they watch television or listen to the radio on a regular basis. Internet use was moderate among youth in 2012. As many as 61.8 percent of men never used it, compared to 77.8 percent of women.

Rabat – Saudi football clubs and Monaco are interested in hiring the Moroccan international footballer Younes Belhanda, according to Turkish news outlets. Belhanda, however, told Yahoo Sports that he is not thinking of leaving his Turkish football team Galatasaray. When asked about his situation, Belhanda said that his situation is “very simple.” “I have two years and a half contract with Galatasaray. I was injured,  I am well taken care of, and I cannot wait to get back to the competition.” Belhanda said that his name is mentioned in several Mercato, which makes him feel happy. “It is my pleasure that they think of me. Today it is simple: I am not negotiating with anyone,” said Belhanda. He added that he had never “asked to leave” his club.  “ I am under contract and good here!” Belhanda concluded. The 29-year old footballer was also linked to English premier league in 2018. Crystal Palace reportedly proposed £5.3 million transfer fee to secure the services of the former midfielder. Belhanda was part of Herve Renard’s selection for the 2018 World Cup, in which the Atlas Lions received worldwide plaudits.  Belhanda joined the Turkish football team from Ukraine’s Dynamo Kyiv in 2017. He is under contract with the Turkish team until 2021.

Rabat – Huawei, a Chinese company specializing in multinational networking and telecommunications equipment and services, allegedly used a picture by a Moroccan photographer without his consent to promote its Android smartphone, “Huawei Y5 Lite.”  On January 2, the company posted a colorful picture showing the silhouette of a man wearing a djellaba, a traditional Moroccan garment, in the sunset at a beach. Next to the picture, it reads: “Get great shots with the 8 MP Camera of the Huawei Y5 Lite.” The Moroccan photographer, Aziz Acharki, is suing the company for using his photograph without asking his permission or using copyright. The page responded to the accusations, saying that it took the picture from “www.unsplash.com,” a website  “where several photographers share their shots.” The page administrators said that the company is not “obliged to credit the author or pay him, according to the rules of Unsplash.” Huawei provides products and services to more than 170 countries. As of 2011, it served 45 of the 50 largest telecom operators. In 2012, Huawei became the second largest smartphone manufacturer in the world, behind Samsung Electronics.

Rabat – Moroccan Ambassador to Norway Lamia Radi told Norway’s NRK television channel that the four main suspects involved in murdering Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland near Imlil were radicalized “so quickly.” The rapidity prevented Moroccan intelligence services from arresting the suspects before the attack. Radi said that the suspects were radicalized in less than a week, and the killings seemed “improvised.” The Moroccan diplomat added that Morocco’s security services are “currently investigating whether some of the 15 people arrested in the case have fought for Islamic State (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria.” Quoted by television station TV2 Nyheder, the Norwegian Defense Research Institute’s Thomas Hegghammer said that the suspects were not asked by ISIS to commit the crime. He also believes that the double murder of the tourists seemed “improvised and opportunistic.” Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested 23 suspects in connection to the double murder. Morocco’s law enforcement found the bodies of the two Scandinavian tourists on December 17, 2018. All suspects have appeared before the court. Convicted terrorists in Morocco typically receive sentences ranging from 10 to 20 years in prison.

Rabat – Morocco’s Court of Auditors issued a report on Monday heavily criticizing the state-owned financial institution Deposit and Management Fund (CDG), known by its French name Caisse de Depot et de Gestion. CDG is the legal depository of the National Social Security Fund (CNSS) and the national savings bank (CEN). It also manages the National Pension and Insurance Fund (CNRA) and the Collective Retirement Benefit Scheme (RCAR). CDG is a major institutional investor in Morocco and was established as a public entity by decree in 1959. It is mainly responsible for managing savings funds which require special protection. In its latest report, the Court of Auditors uncovered many irregularities in CDG’s institutional governance policy, strategic management, and investment policy. The decree that founded CDG granted its general manager extensive management powers. The general manager can decide on operations related to investment, recruitment and appointments, as well as the creation and removal of structures. According to the court, “This concentration of power extended into the hands of one person is not in line with universally accepted rules of good governance.” “It does not promote the establishment of risk control which is essential to securing resources entrusted to the institution.” The court emphasized that CDG Group’s strategic vision has changed over the years from a “collector of savings and investor in Treasury bills to an active investor in riskier activities.” While reviewing CDG’s strategic planning and steering system of its subsidiaries and holdings, the court found that the institution has no assessment for objective achievements and has a general lack of monitoring mechanisms and management control. One of the CDG’s major irregularities is that CDG made equity investments in some of its own subsidiaries and holdings and created some non-systematically authorized subsidiaries. The court found that the institution did not obtain prior obligatory permission from the head of government to do so, as required by Law 39.89 on the transfer of public companies into the private sector.  The court cited CG Parking, Immolog, Med Resort, and Arribat Center as examples of CDG subsidiaries either created without authorization or in which CDG made equity investments. In the case of Arribat Center in Rabat, the company promised to become a “multifunctional complex in the heart of the Agdal neighborhood,” but construction has stalled. Between 2006 and 2007, CDG made some equity investments in foreign companies including France’s Club Mediterranee and Vivendi, and Germany’s TUI AG for a total of MAD 6.5 billion. The CDG’s decision to acquire stakes in the international market, according the court, lacks a strategic vision which does not take into account the institution’s constraints, particularly the securing of its funds. The security of CDG’s funds did not previously define an appropriate investment model due to the lack of “in-depth studies that take into account the overall allocation of its assets and prudent investment rules,” explained the report. The court report showed that CDG concentrates its investments in a limited number of subsidiaries and holdings. At the end of 2017, nine subsidiaries and holdings dominated CDG’s portfolio out of 70 subsidiaries and holdings. The nine subsidiaries received 76 percent (approximately MAD 31.4 million) of the portfolio’s book value of MAD 42.2 million, according to the court’s report. According to the court’s statistics, the number of CDG’s subsidiaries and holdings increased from 80 in 2007 to 143 in 2017. They operate in various business sectors from retail banking and finance to real estate, tourism, and insurance. The report added that between 2006 and 2017 the institution allocated 90 percent of its additional investments, amounting to MAD 26.8 billion, to eight subsidiaries and holdings whose outstanding balance increased from MAD 6 billion to MAD 32.7 billion.  In 2017, CDG’s “subsidiaries and holdings made up 79% of the total equity portfolio, compared to 52% at the end of 2007,” the report noted. At the end of its report, the Court of Auditors recommended that authorities should “recast the legal and institutional framework governing CDG to comply with corporate governance best practices.” The court also called on CDG to “improve its internal control system and set up a risk management system at the group level.” CDG Group should bring “unauthorized” subsidiaries and holdings into compliance with the law, the court stressed.  The court added that the Ministry of the Economy and Finance, in its capacity as the supervising authority of CDG, should ensure that CDG “respects the commitments and objectives” set for the authorizing of equity investments and creation of some subsidiaries and holdings. CDG should “formalize rules governing the management of the portfolio of direct holdings regarding investment concentration,” the court emphasized.

Rabat – The participants of the Africa Eco Race have passed through Guerguerat safely to Mauritania despite continued threats from the Polisario Front. One of the race’s stages, however, has been canceled due to weather.   “Unfortunately, we could not anticipate the lack of visibility over Dakhla, which didn’t allow the three helicopters, dedicated to the security of the race, to take off,” reads a statement from Africa Eco Race. Helicopters supervise the race and ensure security for participants.  “Therefore, the decision was then taken to cancel the special stage. The competitors therefore joined the Chami bivouac by the road.” Africa Eco Race added that the racers returned to the track on the following day for a “100% sandy stage with several dunes … which will be challenging for some.” Pro-Polisario news outlet Futurosahara reported that the race was justifying its cancellation of the stage by citing weather, suggesting young Sahrawis prevented the race by threatening to hamper the race. Participants of the rally, however, passed the Guerguerat stage safely. Earlier this month, Polisario threatened to repeat maneuvers to disturb the participants of the Monaco-Dakar rally. The same pro-Polisario news outlet reported that the “Monaco-Dakar Rally organizers ignore the Sahrawi authorities’ warnings for the second year in a row.” In January 2018,  Polisario’s “civilian police” sent two vehicles to the race and intercepted two participants. Polisario continues its provocative actions, despite the warnings of Morocco and the United Nations on the buffer zones and areas east of Morocco’s defense wall. On Monday, Polisario inaugurated facilities in Mehriz, an area east of Morocco’s defense wall claimed as a “liberated zone” by the separatist group. The inauguration of the facilities in Western Sahara came after military maneuvers held in the same region by the front’s militia.

Rabat – France is holding its competitions to select its representative at the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest May 14-18 in Tel Aviv, Israel. Among the competitors is Moroccan-born Bilal Hassani. The 19-year-old artist’s new song, “Roi” (King) released on January 4 has already become a hit, scoring over 1 million views on YouTube. 
Roi’s music video features clips from Hassani’s childhood until now, depicting his blossoming love for music and telling how society alienated him as a gay person.  Hassani is outspoken in his songs about his personal experiences, mainly about his experience as a member of the LGBTQ community. Hassani’s life reached a turning point when his parents found out his sexual orientation when he was in middle school.  Hassani recounted how his school expelled him in a YouTube video titled “Expelled from my middle school because I’m gay,” in French. Despite all, the young singer who said “I’ve always been who I am” in his new song, came out as gay to his followers at age 17. The singer was already known for his participation in the second season of the Voice Kids, the French music talent show for children aged 6 to 15. Eurovision, a contest held since 1956, asks each participating country to submit “an original song” which will determine whether the candidates will make it to the contest which aims to support youth’s musical careers. This year, 42 countries are participating in the contest.

Rabat – Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces (FAR) have seized 3,700 kilograms of cannabis resin when it foiled a drug trafficking operation in Guelta Zemmour west of Morocco’s defense wall. Thes army fired warning shots on two vehicles to stop the operation. In December 2018, Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) located a farm suspected of storing and trafficking cocaine in Boujdour, a city in the Laayoune-Sakia el Hamra region.

Rabat – Moroccan football is “ambitious” and now has the squad it has been asking for for years. The upbeat assessment came from an equally upbeat Fouzi Lekjaa, president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation. Lekjaa was speaking to Moroccan Radio Mars just hours after winning the title of the best African football federation president. In the radio interview, Lekjaa laid out Morocco’s ambitions as its Atlas Lions grow in confidence and beauty.  Despite early elimination at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, Morocco’s national team won plaudits for the quality of their game, especially the attacking philosophy they have been displaying under the guidance of coach Herve Renard.  Based on the team’s World Cup quality and recent displays in the CAN qualifiers, Lekjaa argued, “it would be natural if Morocco won this year’s Africa Cup of Nations (CAN).” Despite being generally voted among Africa’s best football teams, the Atlas Lions’ history is still wanting. The country only has one continental crown to its name.  Morocco won the 10th CAN in 1976 in Ethiopia. The closest the country came to reliving that 1976 glory was in 2003, when hosts Tunisia beat Morocco 2-1 in the final. Since then, continental glory has eluded Morocco’s team, with the squad struggling to even reach the semi-final stages. While Moroccan clubs—mainly Wydad and Raja—have been performing well at the continental level, it will take a CAN victory to usher Morocco into a position of continental prominence in football. For Lekjaa, the current quality suggests that Renard and his renaissance boys can right decades of trophy drought. He suggested that Morocco’s “ambition to win is legitimate given the quality of their game.” CAN 2019 will be held in Egypt from June 15 to July 13. The continental showpiece will this year count 24 teams, up from 16 in past tournaments.

Rabat – In the wake of the raqi (exorcist) of Berkane’s case, Minister of Endowment and Islamic Affairs Ahmed Taoufiq said at the House of representatives on Tuesday that Morocco must distinguish between the practice of ruqyah as a whole and the swindlers who abuse it. Addressing the calls of citizens to banish the practice of ruqyah in Morocco, Taoufiq emphasized that “it is a phenomenon that was known to the ancient generations as a sunnah and only became known as ‘ruqyah sharia’ [Islamic law] in modern day.” Ruqyah, also known as “ruqyah sharia” is the act of reciting verses from the Qur’an or praying du’aa, a form of supplication, to exorcise demons from oneself or another person, to cure the “ayn” evil eye, or to counter magic. Rakis say the words over water, which the “patient” then drinks. The practice, once purely derived from the sunnah, the sayings and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, has become almost synonymous with exploitation. Some raqis claim to provide psychological treatment or healing from diseases such as cancer. The case of the Berkane raqi which made headlines in Morocco last month has only blown the lid off of already existing ruqyah frauds. Taoufiq stressed that scholars alone can determine the legality of ruqyah, which bears spiritual weight, in the country by presenting their religious ruling, known as a “fatwa,” based on Islamic scriptures.  In 2018, the Ministry of Justice detained 116 self-proclaimed imams who had committed multiple “offences.” The raqi of Berkane, a city in northeast Morocco, who also called himself an imam, had used ruqyah to sexually exploit his clients. Police arrested the raqi after a sexual video of him and a young woman went viral on social media. Police also found other videos, saved on his computer, of him engaging in sexual acts with female ruqyah clients, including married women. If convicted, the raqi will face up to 20 years in prison on charges of charlatanism, adultery, and blackmail. A Moroccan imam who has practiced ruqyah, Mohammed Saghiri, told Morocco World News that ruqyah should not be made a “profession.” “There are those who call themselves raqis and charge people with money, either asking for MAD 50 or MAD 100, as if they were doctors. Ruqyah is done either on oneself after [ablutions] or voluntarily for other people for the sake of God,” he said.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita held talks with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry on Tuesday in Cairo. Following the meeting, both officials co-chaired a press conference where Shoukry emphasized the convergence of views between Cairo and Rabat on many regional issues. “There is consensus and convergence of views between Egypt and Morocco on several regional issues, notably the Palestinian question in the light of HM King Mohammed VI’s chairmanship of the Al-Quds Committee of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, as well as the situation in Syria, Libya and Yemen,” said Shoukry. However, on the issue of Syria, only Shoukry spoke of normalizing the situation in Syria. Commenting on the conflict, Shoukry called on Syrian President Bashar Al Assad to return to the Arab League. “There’s a need to get out of the current crisis in Syria through the political framework sponsored by the UN envoy in Geneva,”  said Shoukry, pointing out that the Syrian regime has not made any progress on the crisis. On Moroccan-Egyptian relations, he added that both countries are working to “revitalize the mechanisms of bilateral cooperation in order to reap the benefits and tackle shortcomings in the service of our common interests.” Shoukry described the joint Moroccan-Egyptian commission as “very important,” because it aims to develop bilateral ties and achieve“concrete objectives in the interest of the two brotherly peoples.” He added that preparations for a joint commision are underway, asserting that the date for the meeting will be announced after considering mechanisms at the ministerial and technical levels, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Bourita emphasized the importance of solidifying coordination between Cairo and Rabat on regional matters, congratulating Egypt for chairing the African Union in 2019. Bourita also saluted Egypt’s efforts to preserve security and economic stability. During his visit in Cairo, Bourita also met with the secretary general of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit. During the meeting, the two officials consulted on the latest developments in regional crises, including the conflicts in Syria, Libya, and Yemen.

Washington D.C – Polisario has conducted military exercises east of Morocco’s defense wall included in the 1991 ceasefire agreement in a flagrant violation of Security Council Resolutions 2414 and 2440. In the two resolutions, the Security Council expressed its concern about the presence of Polisario forces in Guerguerat, calling on the breakaway movement to refrain from any destabilizing measures in the buffer zone and along the Moroccan defense wall, including in Bir Lahlou and Tifariti. Such provocations by Polisario could undermine the credibility of the Security Council. The Security Council’s resolutions and the ceasefire agreement are clear and leave no room for debate or interpretation. When Morocco withdrew its military forces from the buffer zone as a result of the 1991 settlement agreement, it did not do so to allow the Polisario to take control of the region or to claim it is part of its “liberated territory.” Morocco’s move was made in good faith to pave the way for the UN political process to be initiated. Polisario’s uncalculated move will undermine the cautious optimism that emerged from the roundtable in Geneva in early December and reduce the chances of enabling the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy to achieve a breakthrough in the political process. Polisario’s maneuvering in the area will most likely dash any hopes of building confidence between the parties to the conflict and doom it to a more prolonged stalemate. Without building confidence between the parties, it will be impossible to achieve any tangible progress in the political process. Polisario should not be fooled by Bolton Algeria and Polisario would be mistaken and misguided to believe that Morocco will budge an inch in its efforts to defend its sovereignty over the territory. They would also be misguided to think that their maneuver will put the referendum of self-determination back on the table. The recent statements of US National Security Advisor John Bolton, a proponent of holding a referendum in Western Sahara, has likely emboldened Algeria and Polisario and encouraged them to escalate tension in the region. Perhaps Polisario and Algeria believe that with the presence of Bolton in the US government, they have free reign to advance their agenda in the region and upend the political process initiated in 2007. Such short-sighted reading overlooks the fact that the United States is not a banana republic where decisions on questions of national interest are made on a whim without checks and balances from other branches of government and other influential members of the Trump administration. However influential Bolton may be in the Trump administration and however strong his position on Western Sahara may be, if push comes to shove, Morocco can resort to its friends in Washington to avoid any decision that endangers the traditional alliance between the Morocco and the US. In addition, in the remote possibility that the US repudiates its positive neutrality in the conflict and tilts in favor of Algeria and Polisario, other members of the Security Council—especially France—will step in to keep the political process on the right track and prevent any escalation that might undermine the stability and security of the region. UN must act to save political process Algeria and Polisario’s disregard of Security Council resolutions is worrisome and should be addressed firmly. Such provocations put Polisario in direct confrontation with the Security Council, which must step in to assert its authority and discharge its responsibility in preserving international peace and security. The latest Security Council resolutions, like the previous ones, called for a climate of trust between the two parties and to avoid any escalation that could threaten the region or undermine the political process. Recent events, however, suggest Polisario is uninterested in reaching a political solution in accordance with UN resolutions and the spirit of the political process that started with the adoption of Resolution 1754 in 2007. In the event the Security Council does not address this recent escalation in the meeting on the conflict on January 29, the second round of talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General’s personal envoy to Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, set for March, will have zero chances of yielding progress. Meanwhile, in keeping with its sincere desire to reach a mutually acceptable political solution, Morocco has reacted responsibly to Polisario’s provocations, calling on the United Nations to respond firmly to the violations. In light of Polisario’s continuing violations of the resolutions, the members of the Security Council must act more firmly than ever. Firm action would prevent such maneuvers from threatening regional security and stability. The Security Council and the UN Secretary-General should, therefore, send a clear message to Polisario that it has no sovereignty over the buffer zone and that any violation of the red lines as set out in Resolutions 2414 and 2440 could have serious consequences for them and put the political process in jeopardy.

Rabat – The African Union will unveil a unique African passport in February, lifting travel barriers and fulfilling an important part of the organization’s cherished pan-African ambitions. While there has always been overwhelming agreement among Africans for greater African unity and regional integration, national differences have traditionally stood in the way, making pan-Africanism a much harder vision to realize. But AU Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat is confident that the African passport move will succeed. He said that details about implementation will be announced at the 32nd summit of the AU in February when the prototype will be unveiled. “I am pleased to stress that, in February 2019, in Addis Ababa, at the 32nd Summit of our Union, the Commission will present, for adoption, guidelines on the design, production and issuance of the African passport, the materialization of which will take us one step closer to the long-held dream of complete free movement across the continent,” Mahamat said in a statement. Like Mahamat, a number of AU leaders, including Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, the AU’s current chair, hope that giving the document an actual shape and color will boost the pan-African mood and accelerate the process of full implementation. Initiated in July 2016, the African passport project has reignited a pan-African sentiment similar to the one that followed the independence of African states. A number of observers and African citizens have spoken in support of the move, hinting at the necessity of “African Unity.”  Once fully implemented, the African passport will first be delivered to African presidents and senior officials, including foreign ministers and diplomats. Only after that will it be generalized to other officials and the general population.  Conditions on how to proceed are set to be announced in February together with the unveiling of the prototype. The move comes months after 32 African countries signed a Free Trade Agreement to further the continent’s economic and socio-political integration. The long-term goal of the agreement is to create an integrated African market that lifts existing barriers to the free movement of people and goods. There are also talks of a common African currency.  As part of the much-reported Africa 2063 vision, both the unique passport and African Free Trade Agreement are aimed to “unify all Africans,” according to AU officials. Mahamat, speaking in defense of the moves, argued, “Integration is for the development of the continent and the fulfillment of its people’s aspirations to wellbeing.” Only two African countries, the Seychelles and Benin, offer visa-free travel to all African countries. But once the new passport is issued, Mahamat hopes, barriers will be lifted and Africans will be able to freely travel across the continent.

Rabat – The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) designated an agricultural system based on argan in Morocco as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) site, in November. The decision came following a proposal by Morocco’s Oasis and Argan Zones National Agency (ANDZOA).

The agro-forest-pastoral system of Ait Souab-Ait Mansour, in the southern Chtouka Ait Baha province, relies on the “metfia,” a rainwater reservoir dug into a rock. Locals have been cultivating argan trees in the region for centuries.  
FAO previously designated as GIAHS another site in Morocco, the oases system in Imilchil-Amellago, in the central Midelt Province. The system uses the “khettara” technique to drain groundwater through tunnels by gravity.

FAO’s World Agricultural Heritage Network includes 57 sites in 21 countries. The GIAHS Scientific Advisory Group designates sites based on global significance, public good, agricultural biodiversity, knowledge systems, adaptive technologies, and outstanding landscapes.

Rabat – Child marriage continues to be an issue in Morocco despite the country’s attempt to curb underage marriage, especially for girls, by raising the legal marriage age from 16 to 18 in Article 20 of the 2004 Mudawana (Family Code). Child marriages can be legalized if the family gets a waiver for the minor. The number of waiver requests for minors increased to 41,669 in 2015, compared to 38,331 in 2007, according to the Moroccan High Commission of Planning (HCP). Ninety-nine percent of the requests were for female minors. Among the requests made, adouls (notaries) accepted 85 percent and rejected 15 percent.  The “Droit &amp; Justice,” an organization specializing in promoting “Rule of Law” in Morocco found that 30,000 female minors get married each year in Morocco. The organization revealed that of the 33,253 marriage contracts in 2009 and 35,152 in 2013 in Morocco, a total of 30,000 involved females under the age of eighteen.
 The study suggested that the increase in marriages of minors in Morocco goes back to the influence of traditional customs and to a crisis of deteriorated values. While some families may instill the desire for early marriage in their children at a young age, others may pressure their daughters or sons into marrying young. According to the 2018 global estimates of child marriages by UNICEF, the practice of child marriage has continued to decline in the past 10 years as 25 million child marriages have been prevented. “The global number of child brides is now estimated at 650 million. 12 million is the number of girls married in childhood each year, according to the latest prevalence and population figures,” wrote UNICEF. The average marriage age for women in Morocco is 25.  The HCP report noted that between 2004 and 2014, the average marriage age for females dropped from 26 to 25. Meanwhile for men, it has increased from the age of 30 to 31 between 1994 and 2014. Regionally, the Guelmim-Oued Noun region in southern Morocco has the oldest average age for marriage. Women marry in their late 20s and men in their early 30s in the region. Women mostly marry in their early 20s and men in their 30s in the regions of Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab and Draa-Tafilalet. While the report stated that the statistics did not observe the fertility rate for women in Morocco, it indicated that  67 percent of women were using birth control in 2011. The celibacy rate has risen in Morocco in the past two decades, particularly in cities.  The rate of people who prefer to stay single throughout their lives increased from 2.9 percent in 1994 to 5.1 percent in 2014 for men and from 0.8 percent to 6.7 percent for women. In urban areas, it has increased to 5.9 percent for men and 8 percent for women. Despite the 2004 Mudawana’s Article 20 that criminalizes the marriage of Moroccan citizens under the age of 18, child marriage is increasing.

Rabat – The House of Councillors at The Moroccan Parliament passed Law 44.18 on mandatory military service on Tuesday. The online news outlet for the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD)  announced that the council approved the draft law that was written according to constitutional principles. The project, added PJD, aims to strengthen national codes and social cohesion among Moroccans who will be selected to perform the 12-month military service. Mandatory service will also be an opportunity to integrate Moroccan youth into professional and social life by providing military training and educating conscripts to have discipline and courage. The lower house of the Moroccan Parliament approved the law on December 27. During a plenary session at the House of Representatives, the delegate minister in charge of the National Defense Administration, Abdellatif Loudiyi, said that the service will “promote the spirit of sacrifice and self denial.” The reintroduction of the obligatory military service came under the King’s orders. It is also in line with the provisions of Article 38 of the Constitution, which emphasizes that all citizens should contribute to the defense of the homeland and its territorial integrity. Men and women between the ages of 19 and 25 will be subject to a 12-month military service. People with financial dependents or disabilities will be exempted from the military service. However, people over the age of 25 who were previously exempted can still be called up until the age of 40 if the reason for their exemption is no longer relevant. After the ministerial council first introduced the military bill in August 2018, some Moroccans expressed concerns that only lower and middle class people would be subject to military service. King Mohammed VI, however, rejected the claims in October 2018,  emphasizing that no social class will be exempt from mandatory military service. “With regard to performing military service, it must be emphasized that all the Moroccan citizens concerned–without exception–are equal, regardless of social background, diploma or education,” said the King. In 1966, Moroccans were subject to 18-month military service in accordance with Royal Decree 137-66. The decree said that military service enables youth to “contribute effectively and in all circumstances to the defense of their homeland.” In 1999, Morocco reduced the length of service to 12 months and abolished mandatory service completely in 2006.

Rabat – Spanish news outlet El Mundo has shed light on the life of the Swiss-Spanish suspect arrested in connection to the murder of  Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Uland near Imlil in the Atlas Mountains. Gema, the mother of the 25-year old dual national, said that all allegations against her son are a “lie.” Gema, who lives in Spain, claimed that her son was with family in Geneva when the double murder was committed on December 17. The suspect’s legal name is Kevin Zoller Guervos. However, the suspect calls himself Abdellah after converting to Islam in 2011. On December 28, Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) announced the arrest of Guervos in connection to the murder. The head of BCIJ, Abdelhak Khiame, said that the suspect was not directly involved in the murder, but he knew the suspects. Guervos trained some of the other arrested suspects in shooting, according to BCIJ. He also recruited sub-Saharans with whom he planned to join ISIS in northern Mali. Guervos was in contact with ISIS members in Syria through Telegram messaging. Quoted by El Mundo, Gema acknowledged that her son had experienced a difficult adolescence after his father’s death when Guervos’ was just 15. She said that her son “smoked a lot of joints, burned cars and had committed a number of robberies.” A Swiss official had previously said that Guervos had a criminal record in Geneva. One of his friends said that Guervos believed that he had “demons in his head that told him what he had to do, and that thanks to the Qur’an he had finally learned to control them.” The suspect was also receiving Swiss disability benefits for a mental disorder. He came to Morocco for marriage Gema said that between the Bible and the Qur’an, Guervos chose the Islamic holy book, which helped him to realize all his mistakes. She added that he converted to Islam after reading the Qur’an and has been praying daily asking for forgiveness for his previous mistakes. “He told me he was going to Morocco to marry what he called a clean woman [virgin]. Two years ago he found her and now they have a son,” she recalled. The suspect arrived in Morocco in 2015 and moved to Marrakech, where he met the self-styled “emir” of the jihadist cell involved in the murder of the Scandinavian tourists. The self-styled emir is the same person who decapitated one of the two victims. The Swiss suspect also participated “in several secret meetings with the members” of the cell, according to Khiame. Now, 23 suspects are facing terror-related charges in connection to the double murder. All of the suspects have appeared before the court. Convicted terrorists typically receive sentences ranging from 10 to 20 years in prison.

Rabat – The Vatican has chosen a logo for Pope Francis’s upcoming visit to Morocco scheduled for March 30-31. The visit came at the request of King Mohammed VI. The pope will visit Rabat and Casablanca on his 26th visit outside Italy.  The Vatican chose “Servant of Hope” as the motto of the pope’s upcoming visit to Morocco because he “is known as the Servant of the Servants of God,” Vatican News reported January 8. The motto is shown under Pope Francis’ name The Vatican selected the logo out of 50 logos in a competition. The logo features symbols of “a cross and a crescent” representing Christianity and Islam. It highlights “the interreligious relations between Christians and Muslims.” The logo has the colors red and green which symbolizes Morocco’s flag and yellow and white as background colors for the Vatican. It also shows the name “Morocco” written in Arabic as an honor to the Arabic-speaking country for hosting the pope. Prior to his two-day visit to Morocco, the pope plans to visit the UAE February 3-5.  In an address to diplomats on Monday in the Vatican, Pope Francis said that his visits to the UAE and Morocco “represent two important opportunities to advance interreligious dialogue and mutual understanding between the followers of both religions.” In November 2018, Rabat’s Archbishop Cristobal Lopez wrote a letter to Christians in Morocco on Pope Francis’s visit to Morocco. Lopez explained that the pope wants to meet the people of Morocco and “His Majesty the King, in the spirit of an interreligious Islam-Christian dialogue,” which both sides seek to promote. The pope’s visit will be the second of its kind from a pope to Morocco after the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1985. King Hassan II invited Pope John Paul II as an opportunity to build a bridge between Muslims and Christians.

Rabat  – The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Tuesday morning that ISIS waged a counterattack in eastern Syria, killing at least 30 individuals. The NGO added that about 10 ISIS fighters also died. The NGO also expects the death toll to rise because some fighters are critically injured. “Using kamikazes, the ISIS launched deadly counter-attacks against SDF on three axes, especially in the villages of Soussa and al-Chafaa,” according to the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdel Rahmane. The counterattack followed an arrest operation conducted by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) on Sunday. The clashes between  and ISIS members comes amid  Trump’s announcement that US troops will withdraw after the alleged ISIS defeat in Syria. The terrorist group was planning to “attack the civilians who were trying to get out of the war zone in masses.” The SDF arrested suspects originally from the US, Ireland, and Pakistan. In December 2018, Trump ordered the withdrawal of US troops from Syria, a conflict zone since 2011.  The conflict has resulted in more than 360,000 deaths and millions of refugees. “We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,” Trump wrote on his Twitter. Trump received backlash from security officials, including Pentagon Chief of Staff KevinSweeney and  defence secretary James Mattis, who both announced their resignation after the US exit from Syria. Pentagon officials argued that the move betrayed Kurdish allies. They also emphasized that abandoning Kurdish allies could inhibit future efforts to regain the trust of local fighters, such as those in Afghanistan, Somalia, and Yemen. On Sunday, Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton told reporters in Israel that US troops would not leave Syria until they completely end terror threats in the conflict zone. While Trump believes that the US and its allies defeated ISIS in Syria, the Moroccan government said that ISIS still poses a threat to every country.  Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) head, Abdelhak Khiame, said, “No one should say that the ISIS threat has ended.” He added that the war against ISIS will take a long time.

Rabat – Following a failed coup d’etat attempt in Gabon against President Ali Bongo on Monday, some media raised speculations over the presence of Moroccan military in Libreville. However, Morocco denied any presence of its military in Gabon. Expressing his astonishment at the rumors, an authorized source from the Moroccan government told Morocco World News that “there is no Moroccan military presence” in Gabon. The speculations came as King Mohammed VI was in Gabon during the new year’s holidays. Gabonese authorities thwarted the coup d’etat staged by four Gabonese military members who seized a state broadcaster and announced their plans to establish a National Restoration Council. Gabonese Government Spokesperson Guy-Bertrand said on Monday that the country is “under control,” adding that the government had arrested the four military ringleaders. Soldiers, according to international news, said that they were not satisfied with the recent speech Bongo gave from Morocco. After seizing the broadcaster, Ondo Obiang, who identified himself as a lieutenant, delivered a speech on air to inform Gabonese people of the military’s intention. “We cannot abandon our homeland,” Obiang said, calling on young Gabonese forces to mobilize for “defense and security and Gabonese people to join us.” Addressing his fellow citizens from Morocco over the New Year, Bongo acknowledged the precarious situation of his country. “It is true that I have been through a difficult period, as sometimes happens in life,” he said but promised his citizens of a new day. “Today, as you can see, I am better and I am preparing to meet you again soon,” he added. At the invitation of King Mohammed VI, the Gabonese president arrived in Rabat in November 2018 to continue his recovery after suffering a stroke in Saudi Arabia in October. Until the moment, Bongo’s date of return to Gabon is still unknown.

Rabat – Videos and photos showing black crickets swarming the holy space circulated on social media since Monday night. 
Viewers spread the images and videos with the hashtag #crickets (in Arabic) on Twitter, expressing disgust at the sight of crickets clinging to pilgrims’ outfits and covering the walls and floors of mosque, and they demand an explanation as to where the invasive insects came from. The Emirate Of Makkah Province released a statement on Twitter, announcing that 22 teams of 138 members were mobilized to exterminate the insects, “bearing in mind the safety and comfort of pilgrims.” #أمانة_العاصمة_المقدسة:

The incident is reminiscent of strong storm that swept Mecca last August causing slight damage to nearby tents of pilgrims and removing the “Kiswa,” the embroidered cloth covering the Kaaba, cube-shaped building at the center of the mosque.

Rabat – As diplomats and international observers put all their Western Sahara hopes in the basket of the Horst Kohler-led settlement process, recent reports indicate defiant military maneuverings from Polisario militias. Coupling PR returns with military provocations Algeria’s official news agency APS reported late last week that the Polisario Front, under the supervision of “President” Ibrahim Ghali, deployed military convoys in Mehriz, east of the Moroccan defense wall. With no reference to Algiers-Polisario ties, APS simply cited pro-Polisario media reports, explaining that the deployment was a military exercise. While the move is set to sound alarm bells in Rabat, it may come across in the wider international community more as a surprise than an ill-timed provocation.  Just a month ago, the four parties concerned with the Sahara dispute—Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and the Polisario Front—met at a round table of peace talks held in Geneva. And although fears of escalation never fully vanished, partly due to the perception that the Geneva meeting was not conclusive, there were high hopes that the regained diplomatic momentum under Horst Kohler would prevent another decades-long standoff and lead to substantive diplomatic overtures.  For Moroccan outlet Al Ahdath, however, the front is setting out to blatantly challenge the UN-imposed status-quo, and there is more to its recent moves than mere surprise. The separatist group’s actions are “well-prepared” provocations meant to exert more influence on the coming agendas in the ongoing settlement discussions, the paper elaborated.  As the news comes just a few months away from both the second Geneva meeting and the UN-Security Council’s meeting on the Sahara affair, the provocations are meant to drag Rabat into a military, hawkish confrontation. In doing so, the front will prove its most important selling point to the international community: Rabat is not interested in brokering a lasting and mutually acceptable settlement. Having made Rabat relatively uneasy with Algeria-sponsored assertive PR campaigns and an arguably Morocco-defying US foreign policy establishment, the front is seizing its chances to make Rabat lose its composure, Al Ahdath suggested. Should Rabat join the front in beating the war drums, it may undermine its recent diplomatic gains. Waiting for Morocco But until when will Rabat play along? Moroccan surveillance and security services intercepted images of the front’s “provocative military actions” in the buffer zones.  Images from Morocco’s surveillance satellite, coupled with “reinforced personnel” in the southern provinces facilitated the interception of Polisario’s moves, Al Massae noted. Like Al Ahdath, Al Massae suggested that the strategic depth of the front’s move is to reinforce the perception that Morocco, with a stronger military, is poised to respond to minor provocations with a heavy-handed display of its military might.  That perception, the report maintained, would play in favor of the separatist front’s occupier-victims narrative which wipes Algeria out of the picture and only presents Morocco as confronting a weaker foe.  The paper reported, however, that Morocco has been deploying a number of military materials, including armored vehicles, jet fighters, and tanks in the vicinity of the airport in Dakhla, where Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces are preparing for “important military exercises” scheduled for the coming weeks.

Rabat – Texan Sheriff Parnell McNamara spoke with a reporter from US television channel KWTX News 10 on the arrest of Amber Michelle Parker, the American teacher who attempted to traffic her relative to Morocco for sex. The KWTX reporter said that both Sheriffs McNamara and Jeremy Shipley warned that “this case, which has garnered attention from around the globe, should open people’s eyes to the sad reality, that not everyone is safe, that danger lies everywhere even in school even within your own home.” Referring to human trafficking, Sheriff Shipley said, “The state should be aware that this is happening, it is real.” In a Facebook post that KWTX displayed, one man under the name of YRider Joe defended Parker, claiming she was innocent and her visit to Morocco was only for love and pleasure. “Hello..I am the man that Amber Parker visited in Morocco, I am going to tell to everyone that Amber Michelle is innocent, she visited me last week, we spent good time, i showed her my city, my life and introduced her to my family..we enjoyed time together,” reads the Facebook post. Parker’s husband declared that she had been chatting with strange people on the internet. Morocco World News contacted the US embassy in Rabat to ask whether the Facebook user, who claimed to know Amber, is also under investigation. The embassy said it had no information on the subject. US police arrested the former teacher on January 3. She is accused of trying to sell an underage family member online for sex with the intent to bring the minor to Morocco.  The arrest came after other family members contacted police, doubting Parker’s intentions with the girl.

Rabat – Morocco’s Mohammed VI-B surveillance satellite detected Polisario’s provocative maneuvers on Sunday, January 6, in Mehriz, a town east of Morocco’s defense wall in Western Sahara. On Sunday, Polisario’s “army” carried out a military maneuver in the restricted region. The move will escalate tension between the front and Morocco. The United Nations is also expected to release a statement to express concerns over Polisario’s violation of the ceasefire agreement signed between the two parties in 1991. In addition to the military maneuvers, Polisario’s self-styled President Ibrahim Ghali also inaugurated facilities east of Morocco’s defense wall. The news agency of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR)reported that Ghali chaired a ceremony on Monday to inaugurate an “administrative complex in the fourth military region” in Mehriz. After reporting on the inauguration ceremony, the separatist news agency deleted the publication; the article’s page now reads “Unfound Page.” The inauguration of the facilities is a blatant violation of UN resolutions which strongly warned against any action in buffer strips and the region east of Morocco’s defense wall. The violations came two months after the adoption of Resolution 2440 which clearly calls on Polisario to adhere to its commitments to the UN with respect to all restricted regions in Western Sahara.  This is not the first time Moroccan military surveillance has detected Polisario’s provocative maneuvers in the region. In 2018, Morocco’s Mohammed VI-A satellite tracked Polisario’s movement and allegedly captured images of collusion between Polisario and Hezbollah. Morocco then cut diplomatic ties with Iran in May 2018. Launched in 2017, the Mohammed VI-A satellite is capable of taking 500 images daily.

Rabat – According to the US congressional record for January 4, the Senate has returned the nomination of David T. Fischer as ambassador to Morocco back to US President Donald Trump. Fischer’s was one of several nominations returned to Trump because the Senate failed to be confirmed before the Senate adjourned sine die—without setting another meeting. Trump nominated Fischer as ambassador to Morocco in November, 2017. Fischer began his confirmation hearings in the US Senate’s Foreign Affairs Committee in August 2018. According to the Congressional Research Service, nominations “that are pending when the Senate adjourns sine die or recesses for more than 30 days are returned to the President unless the Senate, by unanimous consent, waives the rule requiring their return.” It remains to be seen whether Trump will choose to re-nominate Fischer or submit a new nomination. Traditionally, Congress scraps pending nominations before a new Congress convenes. Fischer, who contributed to Trump’s inauguration fund, was nominated nine months after Ambassador to Morocco Dwight Bush left in 2017. The US Senate Foreign Affairs Committee waited nearly 10 months to hold a hearing on Fischer after his nomination. Moroccan analysts translated Trump’s initial delay in appointing a US ambassador to Rabat the result of possible tension, especially when Trump’s administration had nominated an ambassador to Algeria in July 2017. In Fischer’s August 2018 hearing, however, the nominee said that Morocco and the US enjoy healthy relations. He also said that Morocco is one of the US’s “oldest allies.”

Rabat – Gasoline and diesel prices in Morocco during 2018 remained high until mid-December, according to Global Petrol Prices. Between October 1, 2018 and January 7, 2019, the average gasoline price per liter  in Morocco was MAD 11.05. The lowest price, MAD 10.21, was recorded on December 17 and the highest price, MAD 11.46, on October 1.  However, Morocco’s average price of gasoline has been lower than the average world price of MAD 14.57 per liter during the same period.  Diesel prices saw similar changes. The average diesel price was MAD 9.76 per liter. The lowest price, MAD 9.41, was recorded on December 17 and the highest, MAD 9.99, on October 1. The average world price of diesel was MAD 13.32 per liter during the same period. Gasoline and diesel prices have remained low into the first week of January.  The Ministry in Charge of Public Affairs and Governance decided to implement a fuel price cap on December 12. The ministry’s decision came because a number of companies did not reduce fuel prices following the drop in oil prices in the international market. According to Global Petrol Prices, Morocco, an oil importer, has much higher prices of gasoline than 13 countries in the Middle East and North Africa, largely oil-exporting countries. During the last week, Iran had the lowest gasoline price per liter in the Middle East at $0.29, followed by Kuwait ($0.34) and Qatar ($0.43).  Sudan’s gasoline prices per liter are the lowest in North Africa $0.13, followed by Algeria at $0.35, Egypt ($0.43), Tunisia ($0.86), and Morocco ($1.07). Sudan has the second lowest gasoline price in the world after Venezuela ($0.08). When it comes to diesel prices, Morocco registered $0.99 per liter during the last week, a price much higher than Algeria ($0.19), Egypt (0.31), and Tunisia ($0.60). Three MENA countries, Jordan, Yemen, and Israel, all have higher gasoline prices than Morocco. Morocco also has lower gasoline prices per liter compared to the closest European countries, such as Spain ($1.33), Portugal ($1.58), and France ($1.60). The same applies for diesel prices, which cost $1.28 per liter in Spain, $1.47 in Portugal, and $1.57 in France.

Rabat – This is the second time the Qatari capital is host to FIFA’s football summit. The symposium will continue until January 13 before moving to Marrakech on January 15. Football experts will convene in Marrakech January 15-17. According to Moroccan channel 2M, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) confirmed the participation of FIFA’s President Gianni Infantino. The event aims to foster dialogue between world football associations, according to Infantino. “Through the FIFA Executive Football Summits, we can tackle global football matters while considering the local issues facing those running football in the member associations around the world,” he said. The event also serves as a platform to review the possible joint 2030 World Cup bid of Morocco, Portugal, and Spain. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced his country’s interest in a cross-confederation bid between the European countries and Morocco during his visit to Morocco in November 2018. “We are launching a joint message, which is that this will be a bid between two continents. The King of Morocco is receptive and we’re going to work on it with Portugal. We are very excited about it,” said Sanchez. Morocco showed determination to host the 2030 World Cup but remains undecided whether it will submit a joint or a solo bid. Several countries have shown an interest in bidding to host the global tournament, including four Balkan countries, England, and three South American countries: Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay, in a joint bid. In December, the president of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), Aleksander Ceferin, said that he is not “in favor of cross-confederation bids.” “Someone should say once to the politicians it’s not up to them to speak if they will be hosts of the Euros or the World Cup or not,” said the UEFA president.

Rabat – A Spanish Court has ruled against granting citizenship to a Moroccan-born woman residing in the Spanish enclave of Ceuta because she lacks basic knowledge about Spain. The woman, who is married to a Spanish citizen and has lived in the country for nine years, does not have enough knowledge about Spain’s geography, customs, culture, and history, reported Spanish outlet El Faro de Ceuta on January 5. The outlet stated that although the 36-year-old woman is a mother and has lived in Spain for years, her poor mastery of the Spanish language and lack of integration was not “acceptable.” Late in December, Spain refused a Moroccan resident citizenship for similar reasons, such as “fundamental institutional and cultural ignorance,” and only maintaining relationships with people from his own culture. The Moroccan man born in Ceuta, married with children, had lived in other regions of Spain as well for years. In August 2018, the Spanish National Court’s Chamber also denied citizenship to a Moroccan resident because he did not know the president of Catalonia or the typical dance of the region.

Rabat – The Moroccan National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONHYM) shared its annual activities of 2018 during the 15th meeting of its board of directors in Rabat Monday. Thirteen partners invested MAD 1.41 million in petroleum exploration in Morocco , and ONHYM invested MAD 31 million. In the first 11 months of 2018, investors were exploring an area of ​​127,000 square kilometers, ONHYM wrote in a statement following the board meeting. Morocco granted 28 onshore exploration permits and 42 offshore permits in 2018. ONHYM received 17 of the permits. Morocco also signed one reconnaissance license and 10 exploitation concessions, giving one to ONHYM. In 2018, investors drilled seven wells in Morocco, including five in the Gharb Basin in western Morocco, one in greater Tendrara in eastern Morocco, and one offshore, according to ONHYM. Morocco signed three new oil agreements including two with Repsol and Shell in the Tanfit Zone, and one agreement with Sound Energy for Sidi Moktar Onshore in the Marrakech region and for Greater Tendrara. Mining exploration had 49 targets According to ONHYM’s statement, mining exploration in Morocco focused on 49 targets in the most promising areas of the country last year.

Rabat –  European MP, addressing the European commission in a written note, has said that Europe would benefit more from increased economic integration with Morocco than from only negotiating on select topics. Winning Morocco’s heart Inmaculada Rodriguez-Piniero Fernandez of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party said in her remarks to the EU commission that a number of Europe’s policy successes will need Morocco’s full cooperation.  To ensure that the North African country is fully committed to its engagements with Europe, the EU should make bolder political moves in favor of Rabat. Fernandez suggested that Europe would gain stronger support and political will from its non-European neighbors should it succeed in demonstrating how sincerely committed it is to its own “good neighborhood” agenda. Noting the Euro-Mediterranean integration process launched in 2000, the Spanish MP urged Europe to create resources and opportunities through “sincere cooperation.”  As far as Morocco is concerned, Fernandez proposed that Brussels pushes for further integration into the EU Single Market.  Managing migration through opportunities In addition to bolstering Brussels-Rabat ties on a host of issues—mainly security, migration, agriculture, and food—accepting Rabat in the European common market would create more opportunities and development impetus in Morocco, Fernandez argued.  Fernandez hopes that increased integration, including “legislative convergence,” economic integration, and strategic security cooperation, will be more effective in curbing irregular migration than tough policies operating solely on securing borders. Opportunities in migrants’ home countries or continent, not heavy-handed border policies, will convince more migrants to stay, Fernandez suggested. A strong EU and Spanish ally, Morocco has been an important partner for the European political club on migration and security issues. To seal their partnership and bring it to a higher dimension, Brussels and Rabat launched negotiations in March 2013 to “accelerate” economic integration.  The goal was for Morocco to join the EU’s Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area.  “The overall goal of the negotiations is to create new trade and investment opportunities and ensure a better integration of Morocco’s economy into the EU single market. The DCFTA also aims at supporting ongoing economic reforms in Morocco and at bringing the Moroccan legislation closer to that of the EU in trade-related areas,” according to the EU commission. Negotiations are still ongoing. Fernandez’s call comes as Morocco pushes to get more benefits from its cooperation with Europe. Last week, Spanish media reported that, in addition to the financial and logistic support the EU promised Morocco on migration, the North African country is demanding cooperation on education. El Pais reported that Rabat sent Madrid “a list of demands in exchange for intensifying border control.” “In addition to the 140 million Euros the EU has promised Morocco, the Maghreb country is demanding aid to train workers in key sectors such as tourism and health,” the report explained.

Rabat – Oman announced full support for Morocco’s territorial integrity in a joint statement issued at the end of the 5th Moroccan-Omani joint commission on Monday in Muscat. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and his counterpart Yousef Bin Alawi co-chaired the commission. The joint statement also commended the “wisdom of the Moroccan leadership committed to a peaceful solution to the question of the Moroccan Sahara.” Bin Alawi also saluted King Mohammed VI’s efforts to consolidate peace and stability internationally. Bourita said that Morocco is a credible and serious partner of Oman. He emphasized that bilateral trade between the two countries has more than doubled over the last five years, from MAD 207 million to 532 million. Bourita also recalled the launch of a direct flight between Muscat and Casablanca in July 2018. Bourita also expressed hope that bilateral trade and tourism  will increase because of the direct flight. “The distance separating the two countries has not slowed down communication between the two peoples,” Bourita said. He added that 181 Omani students are pursuing their studies in Moroccan universities and institutions. Nearly 4,500 Moroccans are living in Oman. “Morocco is following the Omani policy under the enlightened leadership of Sultan Qaboos bin Said, which is based on respect for the sovereignty of States and their territorial integrity and the promotion of dialogue and peaceful options for the settlement of crises and conflicts,” the official noted. The minister also welcomed the commission, which is a “major mechanism to open up new prospects for bilateral cooperation in the economic, technical, cultural and social areas and give new impetus to bilateral cooperation.” The Commission held its last session in December 2010, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).

Rabat – On Monday, hundreds of people observed two minutes of silence at Bo University in Norway, where the women were studying. Moroccan authorities found the bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland on December 17, 2018, near Imlil in the Atlas Mountains. “It is very difficult for all of us, especially for the students who lived and studied with them,” university director Annette Bischoff told AFP. The university’s memorial followed rallies carried out by Moroccans to honor the victims in December. Moroccans gathered in front of the Danish and Norwegian embassies in Rabat to condemn the terror attack. Before the memorial sit ins, Moroccans displayed many gestures of sympathy toward the murdered Scandinavian tourists. Moroccans started by sharing the hashtag “#sorry” and commenting on a statement that went viral. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested 23 suspects in connection to the double murders. Four of the suspects appeared in a video pledging allegiance to the self-styled caliph of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. BCIJ, however, said that the suspects did not commit the crime in coordination with ISIS. The last suspect BCIJ arrested in the case was a Swiss-Spaniard on December 29. The head of BCIJ, Abdelhak Khiame, said that the Swiss-Spanish suspect was not “directly involved in the assassination of the two students, but he knew the perpetrators.” Khiame added that the suspects had viewed ISIS propaganda films.  The suspects appeared before an investigating judge pending their trial after BCIJ finalized the investigation. Suspects involved in terror crimes typically receive sentences ranging from 10 to 20 years in prison.

Rabat – As governments struggle to curb radicalization, an international study has established that curing social exclusion is the best way forward. The study, which was conducted by a team of international researchers including University College London, has found that social exclusion is the most important determining factor in radicalization, dispelling a number of well-established theories. Researchers used neuroimaging techniques to shed insight into how the brains of potential jihadists respond to different social stimuli.  Through ethnographic fieldwork and surveys, the researchers identified 533 young Muslim men in Barcelona in areas close to the site of the 2017 ISIS-sponsored strike that killed 13 and wounded dozens more. Among the young men, researchers identified 38 men of Moroccan descent who sympathized with radical Islamism. They had “expressed willingness to participate or facilitate” jihadism-linked violence. The 38 “agreed to have their brains scanned,” the Guardian reported. In the stimulation phase, each of the 38 men were placed in a group to play Cyberball, a virtual ball toss game, with three other Spanish players.  Researchers simulated social exclusion by having the Spaniards “abruptly” refuse to throw the ball to each study subject. The men’s cerebral activities during the game showed that they became more prone to violence when the Spaniards stopped throwing them the ball. While playing, the men became more militant and reactionary in their approach to religious symbols when they felt excluded as compared to when the game proceeded normally, scans showed.  Issues like religious teaching in schools or the Spanish society’s reaction to the construction of mosques became more important, “sacred” and “worth dying for” when subjects’ Spanish mates excluded them from the ball tossing game. Countering ‘wrong-headed’ theories Nafes Hamid of University College London, who participated in the research, told the Guardian: “The first ever neuroimaging study on a radicalized population shows extreme pro-group behavior seems to intensify after social exclusion.” Previous theories of radicalization blamed low socio-economic status and poverty, low education levels, and in some cases individuals’ psycho-biological tendency toward violence as important factors of radicalization. For Hamid, however, the results of their study “finally dispel” the established but “wrong-headed” theories. “This latest research has shown how values start to become sacred and indicates that social exclusion makes non-sacred values behave like sacred values, which in turn makes people recalcitrant and prone to violence,” he said. Hamid called on governments to take the study’s results into account and devise more effective ways of curbing radicalization. “Far from needing to improve economic conditions, combat ideology, or medically treat extremists, focusing on alleviating interpersonal discrimination can keep those with extremist leanings on the non-violent and negotiable side of the fence.” Islamist resurgence The study comes as concerns about terrorism persist in Morocco and Europe.  Last week, reports indicated that both Moroccan and EU authorities are worrying over the possible security impacts of returning ISIS fighters. Having taken part in high-caliber violence in combat zones in Syria and Iraq, the returnees are thought to be doubly dangerous: As terrorists and as recruiters. In Morocco, the murder of two Scandinavian tourists near Imlil in the Atlas Mountains has recently reignited the debate about radicalization.  Condemning the “horrific” and “barbaric” double murder, Moroccans called for more investment in education to fight radicalization. In late December last year, the country’s highest body of religious scholars, the ulema, joined the discussion.  The Mohammedia League of Scholars, as the religious body is called, announced its readiness to make Islamic teaching and Islamic jurisprudence more accommodating to social changes. The league said Moroccan mosques should emphasize Morocco’s “tolerant and open Islam” when preaching. While the University College London study broke ground by using brain scans, its results confirm many ideas that artists—mostly through novels and films—in the Muslim world have been portraying. While poverty and other factors may help explain radicalization, many radicalized people were “detached” and socially excluded young men who joined radical groups to get the attention and sometimes affection that they did not receive from society. “If you had respected me, I would have stayed. But you treated me like your mule,” an ISIS returnee told his father in “Brotherhood,” a 2018 25-minute short film by Tunisian Meryam Joobeur.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) dismantled a three-member ISIS cell on Tuesday in Nador and Driouch, two cities in eastern Morocco. The suspects, between the ages of 18 to 31,  were active in eastern Morocco’s Rif region, according to a statement from the Ministry of the Interior. During the operation, BCIJ seized knives, hunting rifles, military suits, firearms, texts glorifying extremism, batteries, and electric wires. The ISIS cell was plotting terror attacks to undermine the security and stability of Morocco. According to the ministry, the operation confirms “the continuity of terror threats” and the existence of people “fed by extremist ideology to serve” ISIS’s agenda. BCIJ is continuing to investigate the three to find any additional terror suspects connected to the cell. In his recent interviews, BCIJ chief Abdelhak Khiame echoed the ministry’s statement, emphasizing that war against ISIS will take a long time. Morocco’s security services dismantled nine cells in 2018 and eight in 2017. Khiame added that 918 people were arrested for terror-related crimes, including 14 women and 29 minors. He noted that 98 percent of the people arrested in terror-related cases are Moroccans.  Since its creation, BCIJ has thwarted 59 cells, 51 of which had ties to ISIS. Although the number of terrorist cells in Morocco has decreased, Morocco still faces a terror threat.

Rabat – The news agency of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) said that the “president” of the separatist a group Ibrahim Ghali inaugurated today  an “administrative complex in the fourth military region” in Mehriz, a town east of Morocco’s defense wall in Western Sahara. The news agency added that the complex includes “regional government offices in the region, including human resources, security, stewardship, telecommunications, health, and the political commissariat.” The inauguration of the illegal facilities in Western Sahara followed military maneuvers held in the region by the front’s ”army.” According to the separatist news agency, the military maneuvers were carried out under the supervision of Ghali. Polsiario’s action will escalate tension as Morocco and the UN firmly warned the separatist group against any action that might change the status quo of the region. With this move, the Polisario is violating the UN Security Council Resolution 2440, which called on the front to adhere to its commitments” to the UN Secretary General and his Personal Envoy with respect to the buffer strip and the regions east Morocco’s berm. The resolution also urged the Polisario to refrain from relocating facilities to areas located east Morocco’s defense wall, including Tifariti and Bir Lahlou, claimed as “liberated zones” by the separatist group. The recent provocative moves will put the front in confrontation with the UN, according to the Moroccan government.

Washington D.C. – A US House of Representatives draft budget has adopted language that excludes Western Sahara from the US’ financial aid to Morocco, signaling a negative shift in Congress towards Morocco.  The House passed the bill on Thursday, but the Senate has not adopted it yet and nor has President Trump signed it into law.  In recent years, Morocco has relied on the tacit support that Congress, especially the House of Representatives, provided to legitimize its position on Western Sahara. For the past four years, all US budget bills have made US aid for Morocco available for use in Western Sahara. In addition, Congress included Western Sahara in the Morocco section of the budget, highlighting Congress’s support for the Moroccan position.  This year, however, Morocco seems to be losing place in the US Capitol to Algeria and Polisario, whose lobbying firms’ advocacy with members of Congress seems to be paying off.  The new draft bill did not make the aid for Morocco available for use in the Western Sahara, nor did it include the territory in the Morocco section. More still, the section devoted to Western Sahara is seven pages removed from the Morocco section.  If adopted as is, the budget would be a great blow to Morocco and signal that the balance of power in the fierce lobbying and public relations campaign between Morocco and Algeria is tilting in favor of the latter.  Previous budgets supported Morocco Algeria has long sought to thwart Morocco’s efforts to garner support from both houses of Congress for its position on Western Sahara. Over the past four years, the House of Representatives was leaning towards Morocco and adopted spending bills that favored its position.  For example, the first version of the House of Representatives’ budget in the fiscal year that ended on September 30, 2018, called on the secretary of state to urge the World Food Program to establish a registration system for the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps.  The language signaled the House’s support for Morocco’s repeated calls on the UN to conduct a census in the Tindouf camps. Morocco wants the UN to assess the real number of Sahrawis living there and test its accusations that Polisario’s leadership and Algeria are embezzling the humanitarian aid destined for the camps. Algerian lobbying at work But the final version of the budget that Trump signed into law did not include that provision because of Algeria’s lobbying firm’s advocacy. The firm lobbied some key members of the Senate, such as Senators Lindsay Graham, Patrick Leahy, and James Inhofe, a longtime supporter of Polisario and advocate of the rights of Sahrawis to self-determination.  To force the House of Representatives to water down its outright support of Morocco, the three members of the Senate introduced a budget that called on the Trump administration to consult with MINURSO before spending the part of its financial aid for Morocco earmarked for Western Sahara. That language reflected Algeria’s and Polisario’s claim that, since Polisario is the legitimate representative of the Sahrawis, it should be consulted before signing any agreement concerning the territory. Highlighting the will of both houses to reach a compromise, the final budget bill neither called on the secretary of state to press for the registration of Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps, nor did it call on the Trump administration to consult with MINURSO on the spending of the financial aid made available for Western Sahara.  The final spending bill did, however, include for the first time a paragraph that called on the secretary of state to “inform the Committee on Appropriations on steps taken to strengthen monitoring of the delivery of humanitarian assistance provided for refugees in North Africa, including any steps taken to ensure that all vulnerable refugees are receiving such assistance.” Morocco saw the inclusion of this language in itself as a significant gain and a signal of the House of Representatives’ support for Morocco.  Setback for Morocco  If adopted as is, the new language in the 2019 draft budget bill, however, would be a blow to Morocco and reflect that the Algerians are again getting the upper hand in the US Congress as a result of the effective work of their lobbying firms, including Foley Hoag. This firm was instrumental over the years in garnering the Senate’s support for the Algerian position.  One has to go back to fiscal year 2011 when Democrats had control of Congress to find US spending bills that neither made US assistance to Morocco available for Western Sahara nor supported Rabat’s position. While Democrats controlled the House of Representatives during the first two years of Obama’s presidency 2009-2011, the spending bill made the financial aid to Morocco contingent on respecting “the right of individuals to peacefully express their opinions regarding the status and future of the Western Sahara and to document violations of human rights.” It also urged Morocco to “provide unimpeded access to human rights organizations, journalists, and representatives of foreign governments to the Western Sahara.”  When Republicans controlled the House of Representatives, Morocco successfully gained their support. In the meantime, Moroccan efforts in the House were not matched by a sustained charm campaign to gain Senate support, even though the Senate was under Republican control.  Morocco stepped out, Algeria stepped in Without sustained Senate lobbying, Morocco left a vacuum which Algeria filled. Algeria had long enlisted the support of Republican Senator James Inhofe, the most vocal supporter of Polisario in the Senate.  Senator Inhofe has visited the Tindouf camps on many occasions and is among the rare Republican lawmakers that supports Polisario and calls for a Sahrawi referendum.  Algeria has relied on this diehard supporter of the Polisario to garner Senate support and temper the House’s support for Morocco. With the recent developments in the House of Representatives, it remains to be seen what options Morocco will have to prevent the Algerian narrative from making more breakthroughs in Congress.  US still supports Morocco The language in the draft 2019 budget bill does not mean that the US government is leaning towards Algeria and Polisario and turning its back on Morocco for good. The bill’s language on assistance to the Sahara makes clear that “nothing in this act shall be construed to change the policy of the United States to support the United Nations-led process to monitor the ceasefire and bring about a peaceful, sustainable, and mutually agreed upon solution for the Western Sahara.”  That being said, with the House under the control of the Democrats, the pressure that John Bolton is putting on the parties to show willingness to negotiate a settlement to the conflict, coupled with his long-held support for the referendum, and Morocco’s lack of support in the Senate, Morocco will face an up-hill battle to maintain the gains it has achieved in recent years in Washington. At the least, Morocco will have to work hard prevent any development that jeopardizes its position.  This new twist in the House of Representative underscores the urgency that the Moroccan diplomatic corps mobilize more than ever before to secure at least the positive neutrality of all branches of the US government. The current situation requires an overhaul of Morocco’s media and outreach strategy in Washington, D.C. It is high time Morocco moves swiftly to fix what went wrong and devise a new strategy that would help it neutralize Algeria’s full-blown and effective lobbying in Washington, D.C. The Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs should figure out how, despite outspending Algeria’s lobbying, Morocco’s efforts have fallen short from achieving a decisive breakthrough in Washington or at least in maintaining the gains of recent years. Any wait-and-see attitude or overconfidence in the strong ties between Morocco and the US will cost Morocco dearly. Samir Bennis is the co-founder of Morocco World News.

Rabat – A high unemployment rate and disconnect between the labor market and universities continues to plague Morocco’s economy, despite the government’s confidence it can solve the persisting problem.  According to Moroccan economy-focused outlet Les Inspirations Eco, stagnant performance in the labor sector was one of the markers of 2018 for the El Othmani-led government.  Between the first half of 2017 and the second half of 2018, the government’s performance in creating jobs was far below the set target, the newspaper reported. While the government promised to lower unemployment to 8.5 percent by 2021, the current rate (10 percent) suggests that the government is falling behind schedule and will most probably not hit its 2021 target. According to Les Inspirations Eco, a breakdown of the national unemployment rate is even more worrying. In urban settings, generally associated with better job prospects, the unemployment rate is 14 percent. Among young people without a university education the rate is 27.5 percent, and among university graduates it is 17.1 percent. The government, led by the Justice and Development Party (PJD), promised to create 1.2 million jobs during its five-year mandate. To realize that promise, the government would have to create a little over 200,000 jobs annually.  Last year, however, the country’s labor market generated only 122,000 jobs. The government’s promises are “imaginative,” the newspaper commented, explaining that Morocco’s current economic performance cannot even get close to achieving the government’s goals. But the government, unrepentant, believes that it is on track despite “minor” setbacks and can hit its targets by 2021.  In response to statistics showcasing the government’s “imaginative” promises, government sources pointed out the creation of programs like “Idmaj,” “Taehil,” and “Taefiz” which last year eased professional integration for thousands of government recruits. The government is hoping to capitalize on such “active programs” to attract more candidates to the public sector.  Defending the government’s 2021 projections, the employment and civil service ministry suggested that in addition to the figures noted in reports such as Les Inspirations Eco’s, nearly 135,000 recruits from 2018 are in the process of signing contracts before being confirmed as full-time government employees.

By Zakaria Wadghiri Rabat – A number of activists of the Amazigh (Berber) movement in Morocco are demanding that Yennayer, the Amazigh New Year’s Day, become a national and public holiday.

Such calls have increased since Algeria made January 12 a national and public holiday for the first time last year. Moroccans will celebrate the Amazigh New Year 2969, known as Yennayer in Tamazight (Berber), on January 12.

The Amazigh youth organization Tamesna will organize demonstrations outside Parliament in Rabat on Yennayer for the sixth year in a row.

Tamesna Coordinator Adil Adaskou told Morocco World News (MWN) that the demonstrators intend to commemorate the popular holiday and to remind Morocco of the Amazigh people’s legitimate claims—the official recognition of Yennayer as a national public holiday. Amazigh activist Mounir Kejji told MWN that the celebration is not new and neither are the demands. “There are celebrations in urban, rural and diaspora communities.” “Morocco should learn from Algeria now. Even their schools are celebrating.” Kejji added that raising awareness is important especially since the successive governments have not met the demands. He continued, “The fact that all organic laws from the 2011 constitution were passed except the ones regarding the officialization of Amazigh and establishing the Languages and Culture National Council shows a lack of political will. We are still not clear on how the current PJD-led government is handling this. The struggle continues for this recognition.” In December, Amina Ben Sheikh addressed a message to King Mohammed VI calling for the recognition of the Amazigh New Year as a public holiday.

In her message, Ben Sheikh said that “recognizing the Amazigh New Year as an official national holiday side by side with the other national holidays would restore the spirit and philosophy of the Constitution.”  She also recalled the monarch’s speech on October 17, 2001, in which he said that the “integration of Tamazight is a national responsibility, for no culture can deny its roots. From these roots, [Morocco] must embrace openness and reject close-mindedness in order to thrive and develop.” It remains to be seen whether the Moroccan government will meet the demands of Amazigh activists.

Rabat – The Regional Academy of Education and Training (AREF) in the Fez-Meknes region has chosen Mariam Amjoun, the 9-year-old who won an Arabic reading competition, as its reading ambassador. AREF made its selection at a youth book fair that opened today in Fez. AREF called the fair “The Youth Book Fair, Edition of Mariam Amjoun.” In a statement to Maghreb Arab Press, the director of the Fez-Meknes Academy, Mohcine Zouak, welcomed the initiative which encourages students to read, because reading contributes to their personal training and opens the world to them. Zouak added that the show is one of the academy’s activities to bring books closer to students and their parents. Originally from Taounate, a town 80 kilometers north of Fez, Amjoun won the 2018 Arabic Reading Challenge in Dubai in October 2018. She outperformed 10.5 million competitors from across the world. Contestants read at least 50 books and wrote their summaries. The Arabic Reading Challenge also rewards the best teacher and supervisor in the Arab world.  The total amount of prizes awarded amounts to AED 11 million, or about MAD 30 million. Amjoun won AED 500,000 (MAD 1.3 million) in prize money.  The fair has several activities including workshops for plastic art and reading under the supervision of teachers and volunteers.

Rabat – The African Union has announced the agenda for its 32nd ordinary summit, which will take place from January 15 to February 11 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The summit will take place under the theme “Refugees, Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons: Towards Durable Solutions to Forced Displacement in Africa.” The agenda of the summit will include the 37th Ordinary Session of the Permanent Representatives’ Committee (PRC) January 15-16; the 34th Ordinary Session of the Executive Council February 7-8; and the 32nd Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the AU’s Heads of State and Government February 10-11. Irregular migration has been the focus of the pan-African organization in recent years. In 2017, King Mohammed VI addressed issues such as youth immigration in a message to the participants of the 29th AU summit. “African population growth, African institutions, migration and youth issues are opportunities we should leverage together,” the King said. The King renewed Morocco’s commitment to Africa’s development during the international conference of migration held in December 2018 in Marrakech. The monarch said in his message to the symposium that Morocco’s efforts to tackle migration are “neither recent nor incidental.” The King also emphasized Morocco’s “longstanding, voluntary commitment expressed through a policy which is humane in its philosophy, global in its substance, pragmatic in its methodology and responsible in its approach.”

Rabat – In an interview with Turkish Anadolu Agency (AA), Moroccan singer-songwriter Nouamane Lahlou shared moments of his life, career, and his opinion on classical Arabic music. During the interview, Lahlou said that Moroccan Arabic songs are “superficial” and do not reflect the identity of his country, Turkish newspaper Daily Sabah reported January 7. The 53-year-old singer said that for him, music should reflect the identity and culture of the country’s singer.arabic songs   “Arabic songs don’t reflect our natural identity. You cannot understand which country you are in when you listen to a [classical] Arabic song,” said Lahlou. Lyrics, for Lahlou, are more important than melody. “Do the lyrics touch on humans and human issues and other religions, and why and how should I sing? Lyrics are more important than music.” Lahlou began his musical career at 5 years old. At the age of 11, he became a member of a musical association called “Nesaim Andalusia.” At the age of 18, Lahlou represented his country  in the US with Walt Disney, an event that marked a turning point in his life. Lahlou wrote and sang many songs featuring Moroccan cities, such as Chefchaouen and Ouazzane in northern Morocco, Fez, Essaouira, and Marrakech. His latest song is about Zagora, a city in southeastern Morocco. In his songs, Lahlou describes “the beauty of the nature, ancient history and cultural heritage of the cities.” He said that writing one song about a city takes about 1.5 years. “I do research before starting to write a song about a city,” Lahlou added. Lahlou’s most popular works are: “Bladi Ya Zin Lboudane” (My Most Beautiful Country) and “Lamdina Laqdima” (Ancient Medina). Lahlou revealed that his newest song will be about three religions.

Rabat – International media reported that Malaysia Sultan Muhammad V announced his intention to abdicate the throne, a decision unprecedented in the country’s history. The Malaysian palace confirmed the decision, but has yet to issue a statement explaining the King’s reason. The 49-year-old sultan held the throne for two years and had another 3 years left to reign before the throne rotated. The country’s rulers are expected  meet to decide on the next leader. In December 2018, photos of the Malaysian King marrying Miss Moscow 2015, Oksana Voevodina, went viral. The wedding was reportedly held at a concert hall in Barvikha, a village in Moscow. The wedding reportedly did not serve alcohol and all food was halal, cooked according to Islamic law. The 25-year-old wife of the resigned king converted to Islam in April 2018. In a photo posted to Twitter last year, Voevodina posed in a hijab with her husband. Despite the release of photos of the sultan’s marriage to  Miss Moscow 2015, to international news outlets, including The National, many are still calling the marriage a rumor because royal officials have not released a statement confirming the marriage.

Rabat – Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, who fled her Saudi family and was arrested on Sunday at the Bangkok airport, will not be sent back to Saudi Arabia “against her will,” the Thai immigration police chief said on Monday.

“If she does not want to leave, she will not be sent back against her will,” Surachate Hakparn told a press briefing. He added that Thailand would allow her to meet with representatives of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

The Thai government had scheduled to send Rahaf back to Kuwait, from which she had fled, on Monday on a plane from Bangkok. However, the flight left without her after she barricaded herself in an airport hotel room, Phil Robertson, a Human Rights Watch Asia representative told AFP. 
Rahaf accused her family of locking her in a room for six months as punishment for cutting her hair short. She was considering seeking asylum in Australia, which she said she has a visa for. After disembarking in Bangkok to catch her connecting flight to Australia, a Saudi diplomat met and stopped her at the gate, according to the BBC.

In April 2017, another Saudi citizen, Dina Ali Lasloum, 24, was arrested while in transit in the Philippines trying to escape a forced marriage. The Philippines sent Lasloum back to Saudi Arabia, and she has not been heard from since, the BBC reported.

Rabat – A Moroccan resident in Spain has saved three children, two of his own and a neighbor’s toddler, from a burning building in northern Spain near Barcelona. Spanish media reported that a 10-floor building caught fire, killing three and injuring 20. Thirteen of the victims are reported to have suffered “light injuries.” The fire began shortly after 9 a.m. local time on Saturday. The building was on Marques de Mont-roig Avenue, in Badalona, a residential town north of Barcelona in Spain. The Moroccan hero, Yassine Maati, climbed bravely to the fourth floor through an emergency exit and an air conditioning duct to reach his apartment and save his two children. According to testimonies, Maati climbed a ladder on the outside of the building while another neighbor held it secure from above. After rescuing his two children, Maati helped them and his neighbor’s three-year-old son jump out of the window. The three children are in critical condition after jumping out of the window to escape the flames.  Firemen placed mechanical ladders against the building to save many of the residents who immediately received initial treatment. Following the tragedy, Badalona City Council decreed three days of mourning for the three fire victims.

Rabat – Morocco and Nigeria have granted British engineering company Penspen the contract for the first phase of the Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) of the proposed gas pipeline linking Morocco and Nigeria. The Moroccan National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONHYM) and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation granted the contract to Penspen, the company said in a statement January 7. The decision follows a feasibility study that Penspen completed in July 2018. The first phase of FEED, according to Pensen, “consists of a detailed review of the feasibility study results and in-depth evaluation of the gas demand and supply study.” Penspen “will also support the client in marketing and promoting the pipeline project to potential stakeholders showcasing the wider benefits of its development.” The 5,700-kilometer gas pipeline will serve 12 African countries for an estimated cost of $20 billion. The pipeline is also known as the Nigeria Morocco Gas Pipeline Penspen CEO Peter O’Sullivan said, “Following Penspen’s successful execution of the feasibility study, we consider it a huge privilege to be selected by both clients for the next stage of the project definition.” Penspen is executing the FEED study from the company’s Abu Dhabi office. The company will also carry out some “special studies required for the FEED services, environmental impact assessment, Nigeria gas supply study and risk study respectively.” Nigeria-Morocco pipeline project started in 2016 During the signing ceremony of the Nigeria-Morocco Pipeline Project agreement in May 2017, Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita said that the Nigeria-Morocco pipeline will have a positive impact on over 300 million consumers. The pipeline would speed up electrification projects in all of West Africa, serving as a basis for the creation of a competitive regional electricity market, Bourita added. King Mohammed VI chaired the ceremony in the presence of Nigerian President  Muhammadu Buhari at the Royal Palace of Rabat. The project was first announced following a meeting between King Mohammed VI and Buhari at the UN Climate Summit COP22 in Marrakech in November 2016. The two heads of state further examined the project during the King’s visit to Abuja in December 2016.

Rabat – The European Space Agency (ESA) has tested ExoMars, a Mars rover, at the Europlanet Ibn Battuta Centre near Erfoud, eastern Morocco.

Europlanet, an ESA research network, chose the Erfoud area because it is similar to the Martian environment: It has a red, rocky terrain that is very similar to the surface of Mars.

The uniformity of sand dunes gave computer vision algorithms trouble in navigating because the robots were programmed to identify differing, not homogenous, land features. 

The ExoMars rover, due to land on Mars in 2020, is part of a project to search for evidence of life on the planet. It is a joint mission by the ESA, funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program, and the Russian space agency Roscosmos.

Morocco hosts additional Ibn Batouta space analogs in the Sahara desert in Alnif, Ouarzazate, Zagora, and Laayoune.

Rabat – The British oil and gas company Sound Energy has identified gas bearing sands with its second TE-10 well, “within and below the currently mapped structural closure.” The company finished drilling the TE-10 well at a total measured depth of 2,218 meters, “with gas shows down” to a depth of 2,070 meters, the company said in a statement Monday. Sound Energy identified an “additional thin bedded net pay” after reaching the total depth. “Quantification of the overall net pay is underway and will require substantiation from side-wall core analysis and further wireline log evaluation,” Sound Energy wrote. A “pay” is a reservoir or portion of a reservoir that contains economically producible gas. At the end of last month, the British company announced encouraging initial results at the well in its Tendrara project in eastern Morocco. The results included a “potential TAGI gross reservoir sequence from” 1,899 meters to 2,009 meters of measured depth and “an initial net pay estimate of up to 10.5m, with an average porosity of 8%.” Sound Energy successfully recovered a gas sample from one of the pay intervals at a depth of approximately 1,937 meters. “The successful retrieval of this gas sample confirms the presence of moveable hydrocarbons in the reservoir, and importantly is the first successful gas test from the TAGI sandstone in the Tendrara licence,” the company said. Located 25 kilometers northeast of the anticipated production area in Tendrara, the TE-10 well, is the second of three planned exploration wells. TE-10 is planned to test the North East Lakbir prospect in the company’s Greater Tendrara permit. The upstream gas company is currently planning to conduct a well test over the reservoir interval in February 2019. The groundwork for drilling the third well in the exploration program, TE-11, is expected to kick off after testing the TE-10 well. Last month, Sound Energy plugged and abandoned the TE-9 well, which they drilled to a total depth of 2,925 meters, after the company failed to find producible gas at the well.

Rabat – Israel is expected to demand compensation from seven Arab countries for property Jews left behind when they immigrated to Israel.  Jews have reportedly left behind property with $250 billion when they were obliged to leave homes in Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and Yemen for Israel after Israeli independence in 1948. Israeli Minister for Social Equality Gila Gamliel maintains that the Jews from the seven Arab countries experienced injustice and were forced to flee their countries. Speaking Saturday on Israeli television channel Hadashot News, Gamliel said, “The time has come to correct the historic injustice against the Jews from Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Yemen, and Iran – countries from which Jews were expelled.” Gamliel added that she will coordinate efforts to obtain the compensation. The minister estimated that Jews lost $250 billion in real estate when they mass-migrated between 1948 and 1960 to the newly-founded state, according to The Jerusalem Post. Israel plans to request $35 billion from Tunisia and $15 billion from Libya but has not released the estimated amounts it will seek from other countries. Israel released the $250 billion estimate in anticipation of the announcement of the Trump administration’s long-awaited peace plan for Israel and Palestine. However, US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman announced Sunday that the plan would only be revealed in “several months.” Israel is expected to demand the compensation as a condition of a regional peace deal based on a 2010 Israeli law which states that any peace deal with Arab countries or Iran is contingent on individual Jews or Jewish communities receiving compensation for property they lost in 1948. Israel has been conducting discrete valuations of Jewish property in the seven countries during the past 18 months.

Rabat – On Sunday, Polsiario’s “army” carried out a provocative military maneuver in Mehriz, a town east of Morocco’s berm wall in Western Sahara. The “official” news agency of the self-styled Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), Sahara Press Service, reported that the separatist army conducted a “military maneuver in the fourth military region in Mehriz,” a region the Polisario Front claims a “liberated zone” in Western Sahara. The maneuver, added the agency, was supervised by the self-proclaimed leader of the front, Ibrahim Ghali. The provocative move might escalate tension between Morocco and the separatist group because both Morocco and the UN warned Polisario of taking any action that might change the status quo of the region. The Sahara Press Service said that the region also witnessed the “destruction of the eighth and last stockpile of antipersonnel mines.” Through this move, the front is violating UN Security Council Resolution 2440, which called on the front to “fully adhere to its commitments to the Personal Envoy” with respect to the buffer zone and other areas in Western Sahara east of Morocco’s defense berm. The resolution also called on the separatist group to refrain from changing the status quo. The UN also banned any meeting between foreign officials outside of the Tindouf camps in Algeria, urging Polisario to stop relocating or constructing any facilities in the areas that Polisario has long claimed as “liberated zones.” The military maneuver in Mehriz followed Polsiario’s defiant threats to disrupt participants of the Monaco-Dakar Rally. Earlier this month, pro-Polisario news outlet Futurosahara reported that “the Monaco-Dakar Rally organizers ignore the Sahrawi authorities’ warnings for the second year in a row.” Polisario’s new provocative maneuvers are also expected to further slow down the UN-led political process to find a mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. The maneuvers might also hamper the efforts of the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Kohler, who managed to convene the parties to the conflict in a roundtable of talks in Geneva in December 2018. The Moroccan government has responded to Polisario’s recent threat to the Monaco-Dakar rally in emphasizing that such maneuvers will put the separatist group in confrontation with the UN and not Morocco. On January 3, Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said that “from the start of the ceasefire in the 1990s until today Morocco has been firm and will remain resolute and will continue to be firm on these provocations.”

Rabat – Local authorities have approved the Rabat Tramway extension project to Temara, 15 kilometers south of Rabat, and to Sale Al Jadida, 10 kilometers east of Rabat, a source from the Tramway Company of Rabat-Sale (STRS) told daily newspaper L’Economiste. Two tram lines, Line 1 and 2, currently connect the sister cities of Rabat and Sale. The approval of the new extensions will speed up the completion of the study phase of the project to start construction in early 2020. The new tram stops are expected to enter into service in 2023, the daily newspaper reported January 6. The extension will cost MAD 4.5 billion. The central government and local authorities will contribute 50 percent of the total budget. The first tests of the current 2.4 kilometer-long extension of Line 2 in Rabat to serve the Yacoub Al Mansour neighborhood are planned for January 25, 2019. The four new stops on the line in Rabat will begin service in February, the daily newspaper’s source said.  The current extension works of Line 2 in Sale are expected to be completed in July. The 4.6 kilometer-long extension will add 8 stations serving the Moulay Ismail and Al Quaria neighborhoods. On October 24, 2017, King Mohammed VI launched the 7-kilometer extension works of Line 2 of the Rabat-Sale tramway at a cost of MAD 1.7 billion. The Rabat-Sale tramway began operating on May 23, 2011. The network covers 19.5 kilometers with 31 stops. The Rabat-Sale tramway carries approximately 110,000 passengers per day.

Rabat – France’s foreign intelligence service (DGSE) allegedly conducted a covert investigation into the 2018 Moroccan boycott of Centrale Danone and provided President Emmanuel Macron with a report on the findings.  The report suggested the boycott was a domestic affair into which the Moroccan subsidiary of the French Danone company was “dragged as a diversion,” a source told Moroccan outlet Economie &amp; Entreprise last week.

According to the same source, the investigation found that a Casablanca-based firm specializing in digital influence launched a troll operation that resulted in millions of Moroccans joining the boycott. The boycott cost Danone nearly MAD 500 million in addition to considerable collateral damage on its agricultural upstream.

Despite Danone CEO Emmanuel Faber’s repeated visits to Casablanca, the social media campaign to boycott Centrale Danone products continues for a ninth month. The boycott, launched on April 20, 2018, targets three companies with large market shares for high prices in the Moroccan market: Sidi Ali, Centrale Danone, and Afriquia Gaz. The main actor in the Moroccan dairy sector, Centrale Danone, experienced the largest loss among the boycotted companies. Miriem Bensalah-Chaqroun, the former president of the Moroccan confederation of businesses (CGEM), is the CEO of Oulmes Mineral Water, the company that produces Sidi Ali mineral water. Aziz Akhannouch, the Moroccan agriculture minister, is the CEO and chair of Akwa Group, the mother company of Afriquia Gaz, a liquid petroleum gas distributor.

Rabat – A female MP from Morocco’s ruling Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD) has just been reminded of society’s constantly regulatory looks on the female body: Her dress should not reflect her choices but society’s take on what is best for her. Earlier last week, PJD MP Amina Maelainine found herself entangled in a web of discussion about her public appearance. To Maelainine’s surprise if that is ever surprising in patriarchal societies—she discovered that her public appearance was more scrutinized and more important than her achievements as an MP. Sharing a horde of the MP’s pictures without a veil—she normally wears one—while on holiday in Paris, critics decried Maelainine’s “hypocrisy” and double standard with clothes. Why, they asked of her, embrace different clothing in different countries? If she appears ashamed to veil herself while in France, why not just live without a veil while in Morocco? As ever, Moroccans were divided on the case. There were those who rose to the MP’s defense. They were, unsurprisingly, mostly women, and they called for de-normalizing the dominant male gaze which tends to give society license to censor female bodies. For this first camp, society should take its nose out of people’s—especially women’s—personal lives and choices. Self-proclaimed feminists or progressives in great part, they maintained that regardless of her political affiliation, Maelainine is free to dress as she sees fit. But the online shaming went on, oblivious to claims of the sovereignty of personal choices. Commenters mocked, ridiculed, and lectured Maelainine about what is best for her. The acrimony bore all the marks of what Moroccan sociologist Fatima Mernissi has called “the male elite”: Women’s bodies continue to be the center stage of the relentless struggle between “tradition” and “modernity.”  To the MP’s critics, it was not only about the perceived double standard of her choice of clothes. The undertone of their slurs seemed to suggest that “authentic” Moroccanness, as far as the dominant discourse is concerned, lies precisely in women’s covering up.  Maelainine unveiled or in a bikini—there were reports of pictures showing the MP in a bikini—a number of critics fumed, was a “total disrespect and dishonor to the image of the authentic Moroccan woman” Personal vendetta? Beyond the unending debate about women’s rights and individual freedoms in Morocco, there were whispers and signs of personal revenge in the Maelainine case.  As the cacophony showed no sign of abetting, the obviously disgruntled MP responded on Thursday night. Maelainine took to Facebook to deny the allegations, refuting the authenticity of the circulated images.  The pictures had been fabricated, she said, hinting that people in some ideological quarters would use “such methods we thought we were done with” to publicly humiliate those who disagree with them. “I would like to point out that the pictures are not new and have already been sent to some of the party’[s] ministers and some members of the Secretariat who talked to me about them a few months ago…. You cannot bite every dog that bites you.”  The Facebook post’s most compelling part, however, was not her entreaty that the Moroccan public should dismiss the “fabricated” images. It was, rather, her plea that Moroccans judge her based on her merits as a politician and a representative of a cause, not on her personal life choices. “No one should hold me responsible outside of my public responsibilities.” Yet her response set off a new wave of online discussion.  There were supporters who sided with the PJD MP, upholding the sacredness of personal life choices.  But it also appeared that Maelainine’s rebuttals gave an air of falling into the trap of her critics. Lawyer Lahbib Haji, now Maelainine’s critic-in-chief, eagerly seized the opportunity to launch even sharper attacks. In response to the Facebook post, Haji said he knew the pictures were not “fake” because they reflected PJD’s culture of deceit and “fraud.” “Your party knows this with certainty, which means that it adopts this type of fraud,” he commented. The lawyer added, ever more confrontational: “I call on the parliament to urge the judiciary to conduct technical expertise on her published images which she claims to be fabricated.” Re-centering the debate While a strong case could be made that Haji’s call that the judiciary investigate the authenticity of the bikini and veil pictures would be a waste of Moroccan resources, the actual debates lies elsewhere: What if Maelainine had been a man?  Moroccan men constantly shift between traditional djellaba, jeans, and suits, depending on the social context of their public appearance. What is the fuss for? Is it about Maelainine’s “hypocrisy” or  is it about the challenge that the pictures—putting aside her denials of their authenticity—pose to gendered roles and society’s expectations of an Islamist woman?  The answer, Moroccan illustrator Zainab Fasiki recently told Inside Arabia, is that Moroccan men are obsessed with the female body. Morocco’s predominantly patriarchal public sphere controls, tames, and categorizes women’s bodies, the 24-year-old argued. As if controlling female public behavior was not enough, there is now a tendency to hide and suppress their bodies. “We are always hiding the female body,” she said. “All I ask of our brethren is that they take their feet off our necks.” In June of last year, Moroccan journalist Mouna Lahrech wrote a fiery attack on the limits that society puts on Moroccan women’s choices of clothes.  Titled “Here is why I hate the Djellaba,” the article was the passionate plea of a woman whose “boredom” with the djellaba and decades of docile submission to societal codes had made her rebellious against a national dress.  “I do not know why, and for what purposes, I would impose on myself to wear this thing that engulfs women in an obsolete conservatism,” Lahrech wrote. Moroccan society’s gendered regulations and norms, the article elaborated, spring form patriarchy’s self-aggrandizing concern for women’s safety and wellbeing. The idea is to shame, censor, and call out women whenever they deviate from established expectations.  The end result is to seek and call for limitations on the public display of femininity. And, more often than not, shamed women are obliged, even when being defiant to play society’s game of likability. Maelainine’s “polite” denial of the alleged photographs has very little in common with Lahrech’s outburst of feisty feminism. Seen from less ideological lenses, however, the two women seem to be at issue with the same thing: Society’s constraints on unencumbered selfhood and public self-expression. In the frenzy that Maelainine’s bikini debate (let us consider that the images were authentic) engendered, there were those who intellectualized the discussion.  They complained that ultra-liberal Moroccans were making it sound as though women-shaming was a Moroccan preserve. “This is patriarchal and not a specifically-Moroccan reality,” one online commenter said. The suggestion is warranted, as was recently revealed in the US’s pre-2020 elections thrill. In a much-debated Politico article, Elizabeth Warren, who has just announced her bid to run for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, saw her winning chances reduced to her “likability” scores.  “How does Warren avoid a Clinton redux—written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground?” the Politico article asked, creating a forest of likenesses between two political figures—Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren—whose dissimilarities far outweigh anything they may have in common. That Warren was reportedly perceived as “cold” and “unlikable,” Politico seemed to suggest, was a sufficient reason to foresee defeat.  The unwarranted comparison struck an intimate chord in America’s world of political commentaries, with the majority slamming Politico’s piece as mainstream media’s uneasiness with female candidates masquerading as “intelligent” political analysis. “The issue with Elizabeth Warren isn’t likability. It’s sexism,” Moira Donegan wrote in the Guardian.  Like Donegan, there is a rising cohort of media personalities suggesting that it is high time that the American public and political establishment start treating female candidates based on what they bring to the table of American politics and not on how well they perform womanhood.  While the US and Morocco substantially differ in terms of political culture, much the same could be said of the Maelainine affair. Nearly eight years after the 2011 Constitution which set out to further Morocco’s democratic experience and “liberate” Moroccans, it is perhaps high time that Moroccan society reconsidered some basic tenets of private and public life. Or, as Maelainine herself suggested, what is the point of sneaking into other’s privacy?

Rabat – General Director of National Security Abdellatif Hammouchi announced disciplinary sanctions ranging from warnings to temporary suspensions for four policemen in Marrakech for not preserving the personal and private data of a cross-dresser who police investigated in a hit-and-run road accident on New Year’s. The four security members include a divisional police commander, a senior commissioner, a senior peace officer, and a peace officer, according to a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). The statement condemned the lack of policemen’s rigor in preserving the personal data of an individual who is the subject of a judicial investigation. The cross-dresser reportedly hit a motorcyclist with his car and attempted to run away. After stopping him, eyewitnesses and passersby started insulting him after noticing that he was dressed in women’s clothes and wearing a wig. Videos and pictures of the individual circulated widely shared on social media. Many Moroccans reacted to the incident. While some slurred him for disrespecting Moroccan culture and religion, others condemned the sharing of his pictures, calling it a violation of his personal freedom.

Rabat – Gabonese Government Spokesperson Guy-Bertrand has told the BBC that the government arrested four military leaders who announced a coup d’etat this morning against President Ali Bongo Ondimba’s government. Early this morning, Gabon experienced a probable coup attempt against Bongo, still recovering from a stroke in Morocco. Bongo has not been in Gabon  since October 2018.  Four Gabonese military members seized a state broadcaster and announced their plans to establish a National Restoration Council Monday morning. Soldiers, according to international news, said that they were not satisfied with the recent speech Bongo gave from Morocco. After seizing the broadcaster, Ondo Obiang, who identified himself as a lieutenant, delivered a speech on air to inform citizens of the military’s intention. WATCH: Soldier in Gabon reads statement on national radio, announcing a coup d’etat https://t.co/7SHTR3281A pic.twitter.com/br5Ba0ivnV — BNO News (@BNONews) January 7, 2019  “We cannot abandon our homeland,” Obiang said, calling on young Gabonese forces to mobilize for “defence and security and Gabonese people to join us.” The lieutenant added that the “eagerly awaited” day had come, and the army decided “to put itself on the side of the people in order to save Gabon from chaos.” Obiang called on people to stop what they were doing to “take control of the street.” “If you are eating, stop; if you are having a drink, stop; if you are sleeping, wake up. Wake up your neighbors…. rise up as one and take control of the street.” Over the New Year, Bongo acknowledged the precarious situation of his country in a message he recorded in Morocco. “It is true that I have been through a difficult period, as sometimes happens in life,” he said but promised his citizens of a new day. “Today, as you can see, I am better and I am preparing to meet you again soon,” he added. The Gabonese president arrived in Rabat in November 2018 after suffering a stroke in Saudi Arabia in October. The president came to continue his recovery at the invitation of King Mohammed VI. Bongo became president of Gabon after the death of his father in 2009. He narrowly won re-election in 2016 in a poll marred by deadly violence. Bongo is the third president in Gabon. Since Gabonese independence from French colonization the country has had just three presidents.

Rabat – Casablanca, Morocco’s economic center and most populated city will soon get its first public restrooms, albeit only 100. With a population of 3.36 million, Casablanca will have just one public restroom for over 30,000 people. Casa Amenagement SA, a road construction company in Casablanca, has pledged to construct the public restrooms at a cost of over MAD 50 million.
 The company is expected to start construction in the coming weeks. A study by the National School of Commerce and Management, based on interviews with Moroccans, found that women are the most likely to use public restrooms in the country.  Ninety-one percent of women surveyed expressed their frequent need to use public restrooms, compared to 80 percent of male interviewees. Without public restrooms, many people use toilets in public spaces, such as stores, shopping centers, cafes, or road stations. Some even tend to urinate in public. Locals and visitors alike have also complained about the lack of hygienic restrooms in Casablanca’s suburbs.  Poor sanitation in public restrooms is a threat to public health because it is linked to the transmission of diseases such as hepatitis A, cholera, and diarrhea.

Rabat – International magazine, Vogue Australia, has listed Morocco’s Chefchaouen first among top 12 destinations to visit in 2019. Although each and every region in Morocco Tourism Destinations has its unique beauty, Chefchaouen may be the city that could rival Marrakech, Morocco’s red city and one of the most popular travel destinations for tourists visiting the country. Vogue Australia has recommended Chefchaouen to international tourists who might have already visited Marrakech and are looking for a change. “If your Instagram feed is anything to go by, the beautiful city of Marrakech in Morocco may seem a little bit ‘been-there-done-that’… visit Chefchaouen instead” wrote the magazine. “Chafchaouen’s “blue streets “ are a must-see, wrote the magazine. The other top destinations that the magazine listed include: Zanzibar in Tanzania; Valletta in  Malta; Porto in Portugal; Seville in Spain; Petra in Jordan; Osaka in Japan; Nusa Lembongan, Indonesia; Miami, USA; Jaipur, India; and Chengdu, China. Morocco’s other popular destinations are, Fez, Rabat, Essaouira, Ouarzazate, Casablanca and Tangier. Tourists from countries such as Romania, Poland, and the Czech Republic are now flocking to the North African country.  Morocco’s Regional Tourism Council (CRT) reported that 2019 will be a promising year for tourism in Morocco.

Rabat – Two  Spanish criminologists conducted a study on women involved in terror-related crimes in Spain. The study, quoted by  Ceutaldia, indicates that nearly 34.8 percent of women radicalized by terror organizations in Spain are Moroccans. The study showed that the majority of the 21 women “investigated during the last decade for radicalization” were between 19 and 25 years old. The criminologist, Ariadna Trespaderne and David Garriga, said in their study that  60.9 percent of these women are from Spain. The study said that none of the women had a criminal record. According to the study, terror organizations target young women of “fertile ages” to marry and settle with their families. Since terrorist attacks in Casablanca, Morocco adopted an anti-radicalization policy to fight terror threat. Morocco’s security services have also emphasized the importance of cross-border cooperation to fight radicalization among Moroccan immigrants. Moroccan anti-terror offices also mobilized against former Moroccan ISIS fighters, seeking to return to the homeland from conflict zones, such as Iraq and Syria. Last month, head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) Abdelhak Khiame said that 1,666 Moroccans joined conflict zones. He said that about 929 of this number joined ISIS and about 225 others have a criminal record linked to terrorism. Khiame said that 239 Moroccan fighters returned from conflict zones, while about 643 others were killed in conflict zones, including ISIS wives and children during suicide attacks. Khiame emphasized that returnees are always a threat to countries that receive them. “The Kingdom of Morocco knows that [returnees] will pose a threat to the security of citizens and its stability. That is why it put in place the counterterrorism strategy in 2015.” Returnees usually receive sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years in prison. ISIS Moroccan suspects are spread throughout the MENA region, but are mainly in Iraq, Syria,  and Libya.

Rabat – Morocco’s Royal Navy units did not participate in the Red Wave naval exercise held in Saudi Arabia from December 30 to January 4, 2019, in the Red Sea. The military exercise convened units from Egypt, Jordan, Djibouti, Yemen, UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Morocco’s no-show in the military event might be translated as further evidence that Moroccan-Saudi diplomatic ties are strained Despite formal congratulatory messages between the leaders of the both countries, diplomatic ties between the two countries are tense since Morocco’s decision to stay neutral on the Gulf crisis between the Saudi-led coalition and Qatar. Morocco’s neutrality caused a Saudi official to show anti-Moroccan sentiments during the 2026 World Cup bid. During the bid, former -chairman of the General Sports Authority of Saudi Arabia Turki Al Sheikh showed unfriendly sentiments towards Morocco. He complained about Morocco’s neutral position on the Gulf crisis between Qatar and the Saudi-led coalition. Al-Sheikh tweeted, “Some people went astray. If you want our support, you should seek it in Riyadh. What you are doing is wasting your time. Now ask the pseudo-state to help you,” referring to Qatar. Saudi Arabia lobbying against Morocco’s bid during the World Cup process resulted in further tension between the two countries. When Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced his “world tour” in 2018, King Mohammed VI refused to receive him personally, according to a source quoted by Morocco World News.

Rabat – Moroccan-French author and activist Jacob Cohen has strongly criticized the Zionist strategy aiming to influence people around the world to justify the occupation of the Palestinian territories. The author, who was born in Meknes in 1944, criticized Zionism at a lecture under the theme “the Holocaust … and the Zionist Agenda” held in Rabat on Friday, January 4. Cohen referred to the Holocaust as a “new religion” invented by Zionists to influence the world to justify the occupation of Palestine. He added that the Zionist lobby made the issue of the Holocaust so “existential” and have “prevented  historians from talking about the issue unless it is done in a way that satisfies the Zionist agenda.” The agenda, according to Cohen, aims to victimize Jews, and to show that nobody suffered more than them. The author added that Israeli governments have been presenting the Holocaust as a mean “to spread fear” since the 1970s to  turn a blind eye to its massacres against Palestinians Cohen also criticized the Aladdin project  initiated by  the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) aimed at introducing Muslims to the realities of the Holocaust. “Aladdin also set itself the task of highlighting the historical evidence concerning the role of Muslim rulers and citizens who helped the Jews during the Nazi reign of terror, said ProjetAladin.org. Commenting on the project, Cohen said that the Aladin program shows that “zionists only talk about peace and the ideal of this dream, and even the right to a two-state solution without condemning the occupation.” He also spoke about te “the evil genius of Zionist”  and the racist propaganda and deception, recalling the “arbitrary identification of the number of Jewish victims.”

Rabat – The French TV channel, France2, stated that 30,000 retirees spend their winters in Morocco and come back to France in the spring. In a report broadcasted on Saturday at 1:15 am, France2 emphasized that ‘almost 30,000 drive down each year in caravans to the Moroccan sun, as soon as the cold falls on the Hexagon. And like swallows, these pensioners return to the nest when it is better in France.” French retirees made Morocco their second homeland due to the gentle climate in winter, sunny weather year-round, welcoming locals, and a living cost that rises their purchasing power. Morocco is the third country after Portugal and Thailand that French people prefer to settle in, according to an investigation published by French website Retraite Sans Frontieres. According to the same source, Morocco is a preferred destination for its geographical proximity to France, its large French expatriate community, and its cost of living that is 40 percent cheaper.

Rabat – Moroccan arts and culture website Maghrebarts conducted a survey, asking twenty film critics and journalists from around the country to critique Moroccan films released in 2018.  The films were judged on a number of different factors and assigned points based on these critiques. In the end, three films stood out as being particularly noteworthy this year: “Volubilis” won first place, followed by “Al Jahiliya”, and “Sofia,” according to news sites.  Film critics recognized “Volubilis” last year as well, both domestically and abroad. The movie won five separate awards at the National Film Festival of Tangier.  In addition, the movie also won the Jury prize at the Malmoe Arab Film Festival held in Sweden, and was nominated for awards at the El Gouna International Film Festival, and the Venice Film Festival, according to IMDB. The movie tells the story of Abdelkader, a security agent, and Malika, a housemaid. The two hope to get married despite their money issues, and face extreme challenges when Abdelkader experiences a traumatic and humiliating event. This is not Bensaidi’s first acclaimed movie. His film “A Thousand Months”  was screened at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, and his movie “Death For Sale” earned a spot at the Toronto International Film Festival, and even received an Oscar nomination.

Rabat – The President of the Spanish People’s Party  (PP) Pablo Casado visited on January 2 the military cemetery at the Spanish enclave, Melilla, “to pay tribute to the Spanish military “ who participated in the Rif war in 1921. According to  El Diario, the politician visited the cemetery to “to tell the Army thank you for your services, we are with you and with the heroes of Spain who lost their lives for this land, in the Annual Disaster.” The tribute of Casado followed a statement from Spain’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell, who raised the possibility of healing “wounds 100 years after the Rif War and the Battle of Annual. Morocco’s resistance, which was led by  Abd El Krim El Khattabi, defeated Spain’s soldiers. Spanish observers called the battle “the disaster of Annual” because of the numerous deaths of Spanish soldiers. Approximately 13,000 Spanish soldiers died in the battle. December marked the 97h anniversary of the battle. Spain is accused of using toxic gas during the Rif war under the instruction of King Alfonso XIII in 1923. Morocco’s government has long called for  Spain to open dialogue on the unprecedented decision to use poison gas during the war, which violated the Treaty of Versaille signed in 1919.

Rabat – On Saturday, police in Tangier Med Port thwarted a drug trafficking operation, seizing 13 tonnes and 750 kilograms of hashish, according to a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). The statement added that police seized the drugs on board of an international transport truck registered in Morocco. The police department in Tangier opened an investigation under the supervision of the prosecutor’s office to arrest the driver as well as possible accomplices involved in drug trafficking. Morocco’s security services are cracking down drug trafficking attempts in several cities across the country. On December 19, 2018, Morocco’s  Central Bureau of Judicial Intelligence (BCIJ) seized a boat loaded with cocaine in El Jadida, near Casablanca. On the same month, the BCIJ found a farm in Boujdour in the Laayoune Sakia El Hamra region used by a drug network for cocaine trafficking and storage. Authorities revealed that Morocco’s security services  seized 1.65 tons of cocaine, over 1.3 million psychotropic and ecstasy pills (up 43 percent over 2017), 52 tons of cannabis resin, and 693 kilograms of cannabis in 2018. Morocco’s proximity to Europe has attracted several international drug trafficking networks, including those from South America. Recently, El Pais reported that  Latin cartels have been using Africa, and Morocco in particular, as a transit point for trafficking drugs to Europe. Back in December 2018,the BCIJ arrested members of an international drug trafficking ring specialized in smuggling cocaine between Morocco, the US, Latin America, and Europe. Authorities also seized a tonne of cocaine during the operation.

Rabat – Moroccan Islamist preacher Hassan Kettani condemned degrading Islamist scholar Qadi Ayyad during a comedy show that Moroccan television channel 2M aired on New Year’s Eve. During the most recent episode of his show “Al Jumua Talk” on Youtube, Kettani criticized 2M, saying: that channel had invited a “ridiculous” comedian who used “degrading and insulting” words against Imam Ayyad. The comedian used Qadi Ayyad’s name as the punchline for a joke that associated “Qadi” with “excrement,” saying: “At home you have a bathroom that has a small library inside. You read Qadi Ayyad’s book and you are done defecating.”  Born in Ceuta in 1083 under the Almoravid dynasty, Qadi Ayyad was the scion of a notable scholarly family. Ayyad became a prestigious scholar and great Imam of Ceuta and then a magistrate in the Emirate of Granada.  Sheikh Kettani excused the comedian, citing the fact that he might not have been familiar with Ayyad. However, Kettani stressed that 2M, “which gets paid from the public money,” did not accidentally show the scene.  The channel “is used to degrading sacred Islam,” including disrespecting the status of the Prophet Muhammad and Islamist scholars, he said. After citing some of Ayyad’s works, Kettani called for respecting scholars and stressed that Moroccans should show indignation over the comedian making a mockery of Ayyad. He also called on Ulama councils’ scholars and intellectuals to condemn and raise voices against this act. Ayyad served as a judge in Ceuta between 1121 and 1136. He lost a revolt that he headed against the coming of the Almohades to Ceuta. Ayyad was then exiled to Tadla in central Morocco and later to Marrakech, where he died in 1149. Morocco’s Cadi Ayyad University in Marrakech was named after Qadi Ayyad. He is also known as one of the “seven saints of Marrakech.”  Seikh Kettani was a former political prisoner. In September 2003, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for alleged connections to the Casablanca bombings in 2003. Eight years later, Kettani was granted a royal pardon due to efforts by his lawyer, Mustapha Ramid, who later became Morocco’s Minister of Justice. Since his release, Kettani has denounced extremism and encouraged its rejection.

Rabat – The US House of Representatives passed on Thursday its 2019 draft spending bill which excluded Western Sahara from aid funds allocated to Morocco. The unprecedented move lent tacit support to Algiers-backed narrative that the Western Sahara is not under “Morocco’s sovereignty.” The move also stands in striking contrast with the 2018 Budget which lent- as used to be traditional US policy in the past four years- support to Morocco’s position. The draft bill has yet to be adopted by the Senate and then signed into law by President Donald Trump. Seemingly siding with Algeria’s and the Polisario Front’s claims that the separatist movement should be the US’ legitimate intermediary when dealing with the Sahara question, the bill, which was obtained by Morocco World News, stipulated that aid allocated to Western Sahara be separated from those allocated to Morocco. “Funds appropriated under title 21 III of this Act shall be made available for assistance for the Western Sahara,” read the part of the spending bill that spelled out the House of Representatives’ move referring to Western Sahara as a separate political entity from Morocco. The draft bill makes clear, however, that “nothing in this Act shall be construed to change the policy of the United States to support the United Nations-led process to monitor the ceasefire and bring about a peaceful, sustainable, and mutually agreed upon solution for the Western Sahara.” While a host of other recent developments can be said to explain the perceived sudden change in US Congress position in the Western Sahara conflict, Algeria’s successful PR campaign stands out as most plausible. A recent long New Yorker article quoted a group of US officials and “Sahrawis” who presented the perpetuation of the four-decades long conflict as stemming from Morocco’s “refusal” to hold a referendum. Despite warning signals before the House of Representatives’ move, Morocco is still upbeat about the depth of its strategic alliance with the US. Omar Hilale, Morocco’s permanent representative at the UN, had told the New Yorker’s reporter that US-Morocco relations are “so strong” that no senior American politicians can threaten Morocco’s position. While Hilale’s point seemed to highlight tangible diplomatic gains that Rabat has recently made, new developments seem to be suggesting that the other camps is winning the hearts and minds of US’ foreign policy establishment. As Morocco’s position seems challenged, it remains to be seen what Rabat will do next to neutralize Algiers’ aggressive lobbying campaign in Washington.

The Spanish Ministry of Labour, Migration, and Social Security, has announced that over 19,000 seasonal workers from Morocco will harvest strawberries and other berries this season in the Huelva province.  The majority of the seasonal workers, 11,000, went to Huelva to harvest in previous seasons and fulfilled their commitment to return home to Morocco afterward. The recruitment process will take place January 17 to 19. Many previous Moroccan seasonal farmers in Spain did not return to Morocco after the expiration of their contracts and are either living illegally in Spain or have become regularized. Last year, Spain agreed to hire over 10,000 Moroccan agricultural workers to pick berries for the April to June harvest season. In May, some Moroccan seasonal workers filed complaints against their employers for sexual assault. After a Moroccan-Spanish delegation visited the farms, the Moroccan Ministry of Employment maintained that “no specific case of abuse or violation against Moroccan workers was found.” In June last year, Moroccan and Spanish women rallied in Huelva in a march of solidarity with the seasonal workers, denouncing the alleged sexual assaults. The Moroccan minister of employment, Mohamed Yatim, said on October 2 that Moroccan-Spanish cooperation on seasonal employment has “positive results.”

Rabat – Real Madrid has officially signed Mohamed Mizzian, 18, as a loan from his club UD Melilla.  The signing came as a surprise because of European champion clubs’ tradition of avoiding activity in the winter transfer window.

FC Barcelona was also interested in the Spanish-Moroccan player. Mizzian caught the eye of Madrid officials during a match between UD Melilla and Real Madrid in Copa del Rey. Real Madrid will have the option to buy Mizzian’s contract at the end of this season, when his contract with Melilla ends, according to Spanish media. Mohamed Mizzian will play for Castilla and could get chances with the first-team. [AS] pic.twitter.com/ayE5RINGEL — RMOnly (@ReaIMadridOnly) January 2, 2019  
The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) summoned Mizzian for a training camp of the Moroccan national under-17 team in February 2016 in Toulouse, France.

Rabat – The Government Council adopted Bill 57.18  amending and modifying Law 77.15 on the ban of plastic bags on Thursday. Law 77.15 prohibits the manufacture, import, export, marketing, and use of plastic bags. The new bill “aims to establish a solid and flexible legal arsenal for the disposal of plastic bags,” Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said at a press briefing after the weekly government council meeting. The bill set new definitions for the raw plastic material and semi-finished plastic material used in bag-making. The bill set out new articles defining a legal framework for inspections and seizures, granting the relevant authorities new powers. In addition, the bill introduced new articles to control manufacturers’ activity. Manufacturers will have to submit a declaration at the Ministry of Industry on the nature of their activity, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. The consumption of raw materials used in the manufacture of bags dropped by 35,000 tons (50 percent) between 2015 and 2018, said Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy Thursday in a presentation on plastic bags. According to El Khalfi, the authorities recorded 4,389 offenses related to using plastic bags, seized 821 tons of prohibited plastic bags, and seized 107 tons of banned bags at border posts. The courts made 757 judgments with fines of MAD 5 million, he added. 743,600 inspections conducted, 7,500 tons of plastic bags destroyed The interior ministry carried out 739,000 inspections between July 2016 and December 2018, and the Ministry of Industry conducted 4,600 operations during the same period. The authorities collected and destroyed 7,500 tons of plastic bags in accordance with the law, El Khalfi emphasized. The operation cost the government MAD 83 million. Although Law 77.15 has been in effect for 2.5 years, plastic bags are still used in Morocco. As one roams the streets of Morocco, its shops, and traditional souks, one notices that plastic bags are still used by grocery stores and street vendors in Morocco.  Plastic bags are, according to some, easy to use and merchants offer them for free, unlike alternatives which are considered expensive in reference to the purchasing power of Moroccan citizens.

Rabat – Denmark has deported Said Mansour, convicted of incitement to terrorism and formerly a dual Moroccan-Danish citizen, to Morocco. According to Danish media, Mansour arrived in Casablanca yesterday night, aboard Royal Air Maroc flight 222 from Copenhagen. Danish authorities handed him into Moroccan custody. Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen tweeted that he was “very satisfied” with Mansour’s deportation: “Said Mansour has been handed over to the Moroccan authorities. A final end to a pertinent effort to carry out the Danish Supreme Court’s ruling to deport him in 2016…. It sends a clear message that criminal foreigners, who so obviously act against the Danish values and promote terrorism, do not belong in Denmark.” Said Mansour er netop overdraget til de marokkanske myndigheder. Et endeligt punktum for en ihærdig indsats for at gennemføre Højesterets udvisningsdom fra 2016. Jeg er meget tilfreds med et klart signal om, at kriminelle udlændinge, som fremmer terror, ikke hører til i DK #dkpol — Lars Løkke Rasmussen (@larsloekke) January 4, 2019  Rasmussen had talked to Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita in December about Mansour’s deportation, according to Danish news outlet Horsens Folkeblad. Danish immigration minister Inger Stojberg was in Morocco this week on a secret trip to make a deal with Morocco on the deportation. In a statement today, Stojberg said, “Justice has been served.” Mansour, she said, was “one of the most fanatic Islamists who we have deported…. He was on the very top of our list.” In an unprecedented 2015 ruling, a Danish court stripped Said Mansour of his Danish citizenship. The court had convicted Mansour of incitement to terrorism for Facebook posts praising Osama bin Laden and encouraging followers to join the al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, according to Al Jazeera. The court sentenced Mansour to four years in prison. Mansour appealed the loss of his citizenship, arguing he would face torture in Morocco. The Danish Supreme Court in 2016 ruled against Mansour, and the Danish government has since been trying to deport him. Stojberg today asserted the deportation deal “is completely in order concerning the obligations we have to abide by the international human rights of Said Mansour.” The remarks imply Denmark received promises from Morocco that Mansour would not be physically harmed, tortured, or executed. On December 17, 2018, Danish tourist Louisa Vesterager Jespersen was found murdered with a Norwegian tourist near Imlil, in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains. Morocco has arrested 23 suspects in the case and connected it to terrorism. The Imlil murders may have expedited Denmark’s efforts to deport Said Mansour. Mansour was the first Danish citizen to lose his citizenship and be deported.  In 2007, Mansour received a separate terror conviction and spent 3.5 years in prison in Denmark. Born in Morocco, Mansour has lived in Denmark since 1983, earning citizenship in 1988. He has four children with a Danish ex-wife and grandchildren living in Denmark. Morocco does not have an extradition agreement with Denmark. According to a Norwegian source, many Norwegian and Danish criminals come to Morocco to avoid extradition.

Rabat – Tangier’s Prefectural Police Department arrested two French nationals of Tunisian and Moroccan origin on Friday. The suspects were storing and trafficking cannabis and psychotropic drugs.   The suspects used a store for gardening equipment to hide 50 small plastic bags filled with cannabis resin and hid cannabis in six large vases which the police confiscated. The police also seized envelopes containing money, including foreign currency, according to the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). The suspects are currently in custody undergoing investigation. Morocco’s DGSN, prefectural police, and the National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) have all intercepted dozens of drug trafficking networks in the country. Among the most common drug seizures in Morocco are cannabis resin, psychoactive drugs, and cocaine. Earlier this week, security services at the Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca arrested a South African and a Namibian with 3.7 kilograms of cocaine inside their stomachs. On December 15, the BCIJ also found a farm in Boujdour, a city in the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region, used by a drug network for cocaine trafficking and storage.

Rabat – Saudi blogger Mohammad Al Shammari has described the Muslims who conquered Andalusia as invaders and claimed that Islam has been “a savage religion” since the Umayyad era in the seventh and eighth centuries. “Muslims entered Spain as invaders. They captured over 600,000 people and after four centuries, the church regained its land from the invaders. Why should we cry on something we took by force? If logic says that land belongs to whoever invades and imposes power over it, then we should treat Israel with the same logic,”  Al Shammari tweeted on January 2. المسلمون دخلو أسبانيا غزاه فأسرو وسبو مايتجاوز ال٦٠٠ ألف، وبعد اربع قرون استعادة الكنيسة أرضها من الغزاة فلماذا نبكي على شيء أخذناه بالقوة؟ وإذا كان المنطق يقول أن من يغزو ويفرض قوته فالأرض ملكه، إذا فلنعامل إسرائيل بنفس المنطق#الاندلس_احلي_امانينا — محمد بن نخيلان 🇸🇦 (@iMohad) January 2, 2019  The conquest of the Iberian peninsula started in 711 when Muslim commander Tariq ibn Ziyad landed at Gibraltar leading a small army of 7,000 Moroccans under the orders of Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I. Muslims ruled over most of the Iberian peninsula, calling it al-Andalus, for nearly eight centuries, from 711 to 1492. From the mid 13th to the late 15th century, the Emirate of Granada was the last Muslim stronghold in the Iberian Peninsula. In January 1492, the Catholic monarchs, Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon, took over Granada, completing the Christian Reconquista of the peninsula. Al Shammari compared the Catholic Church’s reconquest of Andalusia to what Israelis are seeking in Palestine. He seemed to defend the Israelis’ position against Palestinians. Al Shammari criticized those who mourn the loss of Andalusia and wish to regain it, saying they should treat Israel with the same logic. “Poor Israelis should be allowed to return to their land which Arabs seized and took over,” he wrote in a jeering reply to a Twitter user who emphasized that Islam is a religion of pride and glory and that Muslims will regain Andalusia some day. وش يرجعك؟ أرض ماهي أرضك ولا لك عرق فيها؟ واذا تبي نمشي بمنطقك خلنا نسمح للمساكين الاسرائليين يرجعون لأرضهم اللي اغتصبها العرب منهم — محمد بن نخيلان 🇸🇦 (@iMohad) January 2, 2019  Responding to a tweet highlighting Islam as a religion of mercy and tolerance, the Saudi blogger, who is living in the UAE, stressed that the Umayyad state politicized Islam. “Acquitting Muslims of killing is a claim that lacks credibility. The political motives were dominant in the public scene. It was expected that Muslims would leave Spain especially if you read about that era and the outbreak of a nationalist movement calling for the return back to the embrace of Europe again,” Al Shammari wrote. الواقعية مطلوبة وكلامك عين العقل، تبرئة المسلمون من الدماء هو إدعاء يفتقد للمصداقية، الدوافع السياسية كانت هي المسيطرة على المشهد العام، وخروجهم من أسبانيا كان شيئاً متوقعا خصوصا إذا قرأت عن تلك الفترة ونشوب حركة قومية ترغب بالعودة لأحضان أوروبا مرة أخرى — محمد بن نخيلان 🇸🇦 (@iMohad) January 2, 2019 
He also stated that Muslims have used their authority unjustly since the Umayyad state. “Muslim politicians misused Islam and made it a lash on people’s backs and a sword on the necks of those who disagreed,” he wrote. “Savage Islam is the product of a political plot that began in [the era of] the Umayyad state and has developed to this day.” والإسلام أُسيء استخدامة من قبل الساسة المسلمين فجعلوه سوطا على ظهور الناس وسيفاً سليطا على رقاب كل من خالفهم الرأي..
الإسلام الوحشي هو نتاج حبكة سياسية بدأت منذ الدولة الأموية وتطورت حتى يومنا هذا — محمد بن نخيلان 🇸🇦 (@iMohad) January 2, 2019  Al Shammari also denied the existence of an Islamic civilization in Andalusia, saying, “If Muslims brought civilization to Andalusia, why did we not see the same civilization in the Arabian Peninsula?” For the Saudi blogger “Islam has nothing to do with civilization” since the religion could not create civilization in the Arabian Peninsula. إذا كان سبب الحضارة في الإندلس هم المسلمون، لماذا لم نرا نفس الحضارة في الجزيرة العربية؟ 😄 — محمد بن نخيلان 🇸🇦 (@iMohad) January 2, 2019  The Andalusian civilization, according to Al Shammari, was thanks to the Spaniards who “were open to science and supported the thought movement.” Al Shammari cited the example of Ibn Rushd, known as Averroes in Latin, a Muslim and Andalusian philosopher who was born in Spain in 1126 and died in 1198. Al Shammari stressed that Muslims repressed Ibn Rushd’s thought while Europeans revived it and erected a statue of him.  “The Spaniards consider the Andalusian era as a part of their civilization for which they don’t owe favors to the Arabs.” على كلامك الاسلام ماله دخل لأنه ماقدر يسوي شي بالجزيرة العربية، وأهل أسبانيا كانو بطبيعتهم متفتحين للعلوم فدعمو الحراك الفكري، ابن رشد (الأندلسي) قمع المسلمون فكره وخلد الأوربيون ذكره حتى هذه الساعة ووضعو له تمثالا، الأسبان يعتبرون فترة الأندلس جزء من حضارتهم ولا فضل للعرب بها — محمد بن نخيلان 🇸🇦 (@iMohad) January 2, 2019  Al Shammari’s tweets went viral on social media and received both criticism and admiration. The Saudi blogger reflects his country’s increasingly friendly relations with Israel. Saudi Arabia, according to some reports, may normalize relations with Israel in the near future.

Rabat – The Court of First Instance in Ain Sebaa, Casablanca, adjourned the hearing of Salafi Sheikh Abdelhamid Abounaim, suspected of inciting murder, on Thursday. The trial will resume January 24.

The Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) heard Abdelhamid Abounaim making death threats and apostasy charges. Prosecutors charged Abounaim with terrorism and brought the case to the Casablanca court.
   Abounaim called Moroccan activist Ahmed Assid an “apostate” after Assid said that verses of the Qur’an regarding armed jihad do not apply to modern times.

“We are against terrorism, subversion, and corruption,” Abounaim said in a Facebook video showing him leaving the court. “The greatest wrong is insulting the prophet, the sharia, and attacking religion.” The Casablanca Court of First Instance ruled in 2017 in favor of Abounaim  in a case against 2M channel, after he described the Moroccan channel as “the devil.” A court handed Abounaim a suspended one-month jail sentence in 2014 for accusing politician Driss Lachgar of apostasy after he called for a ban on polygamy.

Rabat – Moroccan police have arrested at least 23 people as suspects in the murders of Danish Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Norwegian Maren Ueland, who were decapitated near Imlil in the Atlas Mountains. In a recent interview with Swiss news outlet Tribune de Geneve, the head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, said that the Swiss-Spanish suspect was not “directly involved in the assassination of the two students, but he knew the perpetrators.” Khiame added that the Swiss suspect and the other suspects had viewed ISIS propaganda films.  “He was in contact with a Daesh operative in Syria via Telegram messaging,” Khiame added. According to Khiame, the suspect calls himself “Abu Yahia or Abdullah … He first tried to join a Qur’anic school in the south of the kingdom and then he moved to Marrakech.” The BCIJ chief added that the suspect was hesitating to choose between Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. He arrived in Morocco in 2015. After moving to Marrakech, he met with the self-styled “emir of the jihadist cell involved in the murder of two students.” The self-styled emir is the same person who decapitated one of the two victims. The Swiss suspect also participated “in several secret meetings with the members” of the cell. The suspect, according to Khiame, converted to Islam in the mosque of Petit-Saconnex near Geneva in 2011. The suspect attended sermons given by two French imams, both converts to Islam. Both imams “were expelled from the [mosque] for encouraging followers to jihad.” The suspect was planning to undermine Morocco’s stability by targeting security services and tourists when he was radicalized. “He led some members to practice shooting in a field with blank cartridges and even recruited sub-Saharans with whom he also planned to join Daesh in northern Mali.” The suspect will be prosecuted in accordance with the 2003 Anti-Terror Law for having ties with a group that planned to commit acts of terror  in Morocco. War against terrorism continues In the interview, Khiame also spoke about the international security cooperation between Morocco and other countries. Speaking specifically about the international security between Morocco and Switzerland, he said, “ We are on good terms with the security services and I suppose our intelligence services are cooperating.” He said that the two countries will strengthen security cooperation in the aftermath of the double murders. “Without enhanced cooperation between all intelligence services we will not be able to defeat them,” Khiame added. Khiame also echoed a statement he made in a recent interview with Moroccan channel 2M, saying that “the disappearance of Daesh from the Syro-Iraqi zone does not signal the end of this ideology.” He added that the first threat is the return of some fighters to their homelands or other countries. “The second is the lost people who self-radicalized surfing the internet. The fight will be long,” he added. The bodies of the two Scandinavian tourists were found on December 17, 2018. The suspects arrested for the double murder appeared before the investigating judge pending their trial after the investigation was finalized. Suspects involved in terror crimes typically receive sentences ranging from 10 and 20 years in prison.

Rabat – The United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) has estimated that Morocco registered 1,879 births on January 1, 2018. UNICEF estimated that Morocco’s New Year’s babies could live to the age of 77, until 2096.  In Algeria, 2,407 babies were born on New Year’s Day, 516 were born in Tunisia, 335 in Libya, and 522 in Mauritania. Globally, India and China recorded the largest numbers of births on New Year’s Day, with 69,994 and 44,940 babies in each country, respectively. Large numbers of births were also recorded in Africa. Ethiopia registered 8,185 births, South Africa 3,320, Kenya 4,560, Uganda 5,500,  and Tanzania 5,500 births. The mortality rate of children under the age of 5 has decreased throughout the years from 1990 to 2017 in Morocco and other Maghreb countries.  According to estimates released in September from the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation, the number of deaths among children aged 5 and below was 23 per 1,000 live births in 2017. Morocco registered 63 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990. As for infants under 28 days, 14 deaths per 1,000 live births were registered in Morocco in 2017. According to the Child Mortality Estimation report, “boys are expected to have a higher probability of dying before reaching age 5 than girls” worldwide.

Rabat – Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid has responded to the criticism he received for saying he was “staggered” that renewed charges were brought against a member of the Justice and Development Party (PJD) Abdelali Hamieddine. Hamieddine is being re-prosecuted as an accomplice in the 1993 murder of Mohamed Ait Ljid Benaissa, a leftist student. The case dates back to February 1993 when a group of masked people beat Benaissa with sharp objects as he was leaving Dar El Mehraz University in Fez. Hamieddine was previously prosecuted for the case in the 1990s. At the time, the criminal chamber acquitted Hamieddine of the accusation, which had been based on the grounds that he “contributed to a quarrel that led to the killing” of Ait Ljid, according to Ramid. On Wednesday, Ramid told reporters at a seminar in a university in Tangier that the Moroccan “judiciary is independent.” He added that judges are “required to exercise their independence in practice.” Three lawyers filed a complaint on December 20, 2018, against Ramid.  The complaint followed Ramid’s condemnation of the re-prosecution of Hamieddine. The minister took to his Facebook after a judge ordered the prosecution of Hamidine, citing “Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which explicitly states that no one may be again subject to trial or punishment for a crime for which he has already been convicted or acquitted in a final judgment in accordance with the law and criminal procedure of each country.” In December, the Fez Court of Appeals postponed Hamieddine’s trial to February 12, 2019. The reason given was to allow for the preparation of all documents for the high-profile trial.

Rabat – The UK has said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is not leaving the presidency any time soon and that Moscow is responsible.

“Regretfully, we do think he is going to be around for a while,” British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told Sky News Thursday. “That is because of the support [Assad] has had from Russia. Russia … gained a sphere of influence [and] a responsibility.”

Hunt’s comments signal a change in policy from his predecessor, Boris Johnson, who said a year ago that President Assad should only remain in power if re-elected after a peace agreement. Assad has regained control of most of the country with the support of Russia, Iran, and armed groups such as Hezbollah. 
Last week, the UAE reopened its embassy in Damascus. In December, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir became the first Arab leader to visit post-war Syria. Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz will travel to Syria at the end of next week to meet with President Assad.  Morocco has regularized Syrian refugees in Morocco and in 2012 set up a field hospital in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. Morocco remained neutral in regard to Russia’s involvement in the Syrian crisis while supporting an undivided Syria.

The legal agreement emphasized the need to protect suspects’ rights during the extradition process, the minister noted. As part of the agreement, both parties will cooperate in serving summons, judicial documents, and letters of request and in executing judgments, decrees, and arbitral awards. Under the contract, the extradition process excludes individuals prosecuted for political offenses, El Khalfi said. “The agreement will not affect the rights and obligations of the contracting States which they have assumed under international conventions and treaties.” The contract also includes some common provisions regarding extradition waiver proceedings, property submission, provisional detention, and costs arising from extradition, according to El Khalfi. In September 2018, Morocco and India signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on cooperation in the field of cybersecurity.  “The MoU intends to promote closer cooperation for exchange of knowledge and experience in detection, resolution and prevention of security-related incidents” between the two countries, according to Indian news outlet India Blooms. India and Morocco enjoy friendly bilateral relations. Last year, both countries signed many agreements and MoUs on various sectors including air service, tourism, social programs, mining and geology, and information technology.

Rabat – German media have reported that Amine Harit will not play this week with his German football team Schalke 04, due to an injury. However, the injury may not be the player’s biggest problem or end his stint with the team. The footballer could leave the team because of his behavior as soon as this winter, according to ESPN. Derwesten.de reported that the 21-year-old parties and gambles frequently at the Duisburg casino. Staying out late partying regularly may have affected the performance of the footballer who was part of the Moroccan team that participated in the 2018 World Cup. The winner of the Bundesliga Rookie of the Year award for 2017–18, Harit joined Schalke 04 in July 2017. In June 2018, Harit hit and killed 30-year-old pedestrian during an alleged street race in Marrakech. The 21-year-old, however, only paid a fine and received a suspended sentence after the fatal road accident.

Brazilian model Gisele Bundchen, Hillary Clinton, Saudi Princess Ameera al-Taweel, and more have also posed in Moroccan caftans. The caftan was originally worn by Ottoman sultans, but due to the Ottoman Empire’s strong global influence in the last few centuries, various cultures have adopted it throughout the world, such as North and West Africa.

The caftan reached Morocco after its spread through Andalusia, which first adopted it in the 9th century. Morocco later refashioned and added its unique touch to the caftan, creating what is now known as “the Moroccan caftan.” Today, caftans are embraced in the world of fashion.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) has decided to introduce video assistant referee (VAR) in its top league, Botola Pro, starting next season in the fall. The FRMF is planning to sign an agreement with FIFA to implement VAR in Botola Pro, daily newspaper Al Massae reported.  VAR was first widely used in the football world during the 2018 Russia World Cup. FIFA considered it “largely successful.” With VAR, referees have the opportunity to review video footage of crucial moments of play. The Moroccan football team criticized the referee’s choice not to consult VAR in the Atlas Lions’ World Cup game against Portugal when the Portuguese team committed a foul. Following the World Cup, many European leagues began using the technology to help referees make the right decisions. FRMF will sign the agreement during the FIFA congress in Marrakech January 15-17. Marrakech will host the second meeting out of the three FIFA summits of the 2018-19 season. Doha held the first meeting December 11-13. The FIFA summits are an opportunity for all 50 FIFA member associations from five confederations to discuss strategic football matters and for FIFA itself to better understand their needs. The FIFA summits will conclude in Rome January 21-23.

Rabat – The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has issued a statement after Algeria decided to shut its border to Syrian, Palestinian, and Yemeni refugees. The agency expressed concerns about the safety of refugees reportedly stranded at Algeria’s southern border with Niger. The agency said that it had received information that the “group, comprising some 120 Syrian, Palestinian and Yemeni individuals, were detained at the Tamanrasset Centre in southern Algeria before being taken to an area near the Guezzam border post on 26 December.” A group of the refugees remain “stranded in the desert, three kilometers from the Guezzam border post where they are exposed to the elements.” The other group “who were taken to the border are unaccounted for.” The UNHCR said that it contacted Algerian authorities regarding the matter. It also denied that the group of refugees were moved to the border “with the agreement of UNHCR,” saying that it had no involvement. UNHCR called on Algeria for “access to those individuals, to address humanitarian needs and to identify those in need of international protection and to ensure their safety.” After receiving criticism from the international community, Algeria cited concerns over terrorism. Hassen Kacimi the head of the migration department at the interior ministry in Algeria, said that the country cannot “accept members of armed groups fleeing from Syria when it comes to our security.” Quoted by Reuters, he added that “this is a criminal network and we must be very vigilant not to allow them to enter into Algeria.” In the summer of 2018, UNHCR strongly criticized Algeria for abandoning migrants in the Sahara desert. The Globe and Mail reported in June 2018 that Algeria had abandoned 13,000 migrants over the past 14 months, including women and children, without food or water.

Washington D.C – The article portrays the conflict exactly the way Algerians and Polisario love it: Morocco is “occupying” the territory, it “oppresses” the Sahrawis, there is “no freedom of movement there,” and the “Sahara” never belonged to Morocco. The author even used a treaty that dates back to 1767 to give the reader the false impression that Morocco never considered Western Sahara as part of its territory. But Niarchos did not say that since the signing of the treaty, Morocco had never accepted its interpretation by the Spanish crown at the time.  Many researchers have pointed out that Spain misused the Spanish language version of the treaty to its advantage and ignored Morocco’s objections that in the Arabic version, Article 18 of the treaty referring to modern-day Western Sahara never acknowledged that the territory was not under Morocco’s sovereignty. In his attempts to use historical agreement to prove that Morocco’s claims over the territory are not solid, the author omits the treaty signed between Morocco and the UK in March 1895 in which the British recognized that Western Sahara belonged to Morocco.  Pushing the Algerian story and controlling the narrative Niarchos does not seek to inform the reader about the intricacies of the conflict. His main objective is to push the Algerian narrative and portray Morocco as an “occupier” and the main obstacle to a final solution to the conflict. Hence his selective use of historical facts to back up his narrative.  It is striking that the author gives no voice to any analyst or academic who may challenge the overtone of his article, its omissions, misrepresentations and inaccuracies. What is even more striking is that the article makes no mention of the fact that Algeria has supported Polisario at the political, diplomatic, military, and financial levels since its inception over 40 years ago. The main message of the article is to stress that the conflict is strictly between Morocco and Polisario.  Nor does Niarchos mention the embezzlement by the Polisario leadership and the Algerian government of the humanitarian aid destined to the Tindouf camps for the past four decades, let alone that the inhabitants of the camps have no freedom of movement inside Algeria nor can they obtain refugee cards from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. A report of the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants in 2009 said that Polisario deters Sahrawis from visiting Mauritania by requiring that applicants leave family members and assets behind. In addition, no Sahrawis can travel to a foreign country without a green light from Polisario and Algeria.  Polisario’s constitution states that no political parties can be established in the Tindouf camps until the “independence” of Western Sahara. In addition, Polisario does not allow any opinions that might challenge its legitimacy within the Tindouf camps or its handling of the UN-led political process.  Mustafa Salma Oueld Sidi Mouloud, former head of the Polisario police, has paid a heavy price since 2010 for expressing a dissenting opinion and stating the Moroccan autonomy plan could pave the way to ending the conflict. He was first imprisoned and then expelled from the camps and prevented from reuniting with his family. In my several discussions with him, Mustafa Salma confided to me that any Sahrawi who harbors different views from Polisario is accused of treason, harassed, and harshly punished by the Polisario leadership. A sober reminder of Polisario’s intransigence with dissenting voices in the camps was the statement made by Bachir Mustapha Sayed, the self-styled minister of the interior of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Commenting on the establishment of “Sahrawi Initiative for Change,” Mustapha Sayed said, “Anybody who splinters from the Polisario, or seeks to establish a new organization will deserve no mercy or sympathy from our side, nor appreciation of his idea.” Instead of providing the reader with a balanced approach, Niarchos steers away from questioning Polisario’s leadership and its manipulation by Algeria. He portrays the Tindouf camps as a quasi-functioning state where “schools operate and dispensaries provide food and medicine and a legal code is in force, and courts try cases.” He claims that economic conditions have “improved” to the point of talking about “quasi capitalism.” Niarchos paraphrased a Polisario official who said “women in the Sahrawi refugee camps enjoy a level of empowerment unusual in the wider Arab world.”  The resemblance in the language used in the article and that used in David Keene’s articles about the conflict is striking. In an op-ed published in 2010, David Keene claimed that the Polisario’s constitution is “almost unique among Muslim nations in that it guarantees residents the vote and provides equal rights for women.” In another op-ed published in 2004, he asserted that Polisario “built a functioning democracy that guarantees equal rights to men and women.” Morocco should neutralize Algeria’s PR campaign  The way in which the article is written and how the debate was framed shows that it is conspicuously the result of the PR work being done by David Keene since he was hired by Algeria in November. Through the publication of this article, the Algerians seek to set the debate and control the narrative, and they have succeeded so far.  One would be naive to think that a reporter who has never written about the conflict has, all of a sudden, taken interest in it and wants to educate people about it. This is Washington D. C. lobbying firms’ playbook. When a lobbying firm wants to raise awareness about any given issue and mobilize support for it, it picks a reporter, pays for a round-trip plane ticket and accommodation, and arranges for the reporter to meet select people. Upon returning from the trip, the reporter writes an article that promotes the narrative that his friends seek to promote in Washington.  There is no shortage of examples that show how foreign countries use lobbying firms to cajole friendly reporters into writing damaging reports about their adversaries.  Since Algeria hired David Keene in early November, I have said repeatedly that it was a warning sign for Morocco, and Moroccan officials should be on alert and mobilized more than ever before.  In light of the well-orchestrated media campaign that Algeria launched in the past two months, one wonders what the Moroccan PR firms that the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs hired in early 2018 have been doing to neutralize the Algerian narrative and push for Morocco’s position in Washington, D.C. For the past year, I have seen neither media activity on their part nor articles in any major US media, less alone any hearings in Congress to push for the Moroccan narrative.  As I have said in my previous article, Moroccan diplomats should take stock of the work its PR firms have done and assess the impact of their work on the public debate in Washington about the conflict. It does not only take a Washington-based firm to win support for one’s political agenda. For the past two years, Morocco has been dealing with an unconventional and unpredictable administration that does not necessarily abide by the same principles that governed US foreign policy in the past. Moroccan media and observers would do a disservice to their country if they do not take this seriously. The recent American decision to withdraw troops from Syria should serve as a reminder about the unpredictability of this administration and the need to work tirelessly to avoid any development that might jeopardize Morocco’s vital interests.  Meanwhile, other analysts have tried to downplay the risk that the Bolton effect and Algeria’s PR campaign pose for Morocco and preferred to stick to the same timeworn narrative of Morocco’s relations with the United States. According to this narrative, the US would not turn its back on Morocco because of the strength of bilateral ties between the two countries. Moroccan media and analysts should show more commitment to call things by their name and give readers and officials the full picture of what is at stake. There is no doubt that Moroccan diplomatic efforts have made substantial gains in recent years. But the gains will be lost if Morocco does not work proactively to prevent Algeria from shaping the debate about the conflict in Washington. Samir Bennis is the co-founder of Morocco World News.

Rabat – Morocco received MAD 30.4 billion in foreign funds in 2017, up 35.7 percent compared to 2016, according to the Treasury and External Finance Department (DTFE), daily newspaper L’Economiste reported January 2.  L’Economiste said the rise in foreign loans is explained by the budget increase allocated for reform programs, amounting to MAD 20.7 billion in 2017 compared to only MAD 6.6 billion in the previous year. The external funding that Morocco received included loans of MAD 20.89 billion, concessional loans of MAD 7.07 billion, and grants of MAD 2.44 billion. The government allocated 22 percent of the funds for the financial sector, 19 percent for budget support, 15 percent for agriculture, 14 percent for social services, and 13 percent for transport. “The external funding strategy is based on the macroeconomic objectives set in particular in terms of economic growth, the budget deficit, the external position and the public debt,” L’Economiste explained. Morocco’s public external debt rose to nearly MAD 332.35 billion in 2017, compared to MAD 312.46 billion in 2016, according to DTFE. At the end of 2017, Morocco had MAD 900 billion in public debt and MAD 149 billion in debt service. Public external debt represented 31 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017, a fraction of a percent higher than a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Economy. Public institutions and enterprises (EEP) have borrowed the most, carrying MAD 179.3 billion in debt, followed by the Treasury with MAD 153.1 billion in debt. The French Development Agency (AFD) announced last month that Morocco receives the bulk of the agency’s funding in Africa, with €2.9 billion in loans as of  October 15, 2018. In 2017, AFD provided Morocco with €431 million in loans for project funding. The most recent AFD loan to Morocco amounted to €50 million to extend and improve potable water in the country’s northern provinces. The North African country plans to issue a new bond in 2019 of around €1 billion euros, according to Minister of Economy Mohamed Benchaaboun.

Rabat – Forbes has ranked Morocco as the 62nd “Best Country for Business” for 2019.  The magazine said that Morocco earned this place due to its “proximity to Europe and relatively low labor costs” and that it is working “towards building a diverse, open market-oriented economy.” The country’s key business sectors include agriculture, tourism, aerospace, automotive, and phosphates, according to Forbes. “Morocco has increased investment in its port, transportation, and industrial infrastructure to position itself as a center and broker for business throughout Africa.” Forbes also noted King Mohammed VI’s leadership in business, saying that since taking the throne in 1999, “King Mohammed VI has presided over a stable economy marked by steady growth, low inflation, and gradually falling unemployment.” The magazine, however, acknowledged that “poor harvests and economic difficulties in Europe contributed to an economic slowdown.” Morocco’s ranking dropped from 55th in 2017 out of 153 countries, ranking in the top 36 percent. The magazine also noted Morocco’s Free Trade Agreement with the US and its Advanced Status agreement with the EU as boosting Moroccan exports. “Morocco also seeks to expand its renewable energy capacity with a goal of making renewable more than 50% of installed electricity generation capacity by 2030,” said Forbes. The UK topped Forbes list for 2019 before Sweden, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Canada, and Denmark. Regionally, Tunisia ranked 82nd and Algeria 114th.

By Juliette Owen-Jones Rabat – The World Health Organization’s (WHO) director-general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, visited Ebola-affected areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo for a three-day mission over the new year. According to WHO, Ghebreyesus “took stock of the outbreak, spent time with affected communities, and personally thanked responders for their dedication.” His visit comes amid a large Ebola outbreak, which began in August 2018 and continues to worsen.  According to the country’s Ministry of Health, as of Wednesday, the total estimated number of patients is 608, with 368 deaths.  Ghebreyesus visited Beni, Butembo, and Komanda, the areas worst affected by the outbreak. Not only are the areas suffering the most from the public health crisis but also from rising civil unrest. According to WHO, there are currently 50 armed groups in the DRC causing violence. Civil unrest adds additional risk With a long-awaited election held December 30, the government shut down the internet and SMS communication. A senior advisor to the president, Barnabe Kikaya Bin Karubi, told Reuters that the decision was to made to “preserve public order” and prevent “fictitious results.” The shutdown stirred controversy and led to protests. Protestors violently attacked an Ebola clinic in Beni, angered by the government’s decision to postpone the election until March in Ebola-affected areas such as Beni, Butembo, and Yumbi. Opposition supporters believe the decision was a deliberate move made by the current government to disenfranchise them during this critical period. The UN public health agency also estimates that more than a million refugees and displaced people are traveling through the country, and this movement is a potential risk factor for Ebola to spread further. After seeing the epidemic firsthand, Ghebreyesus expressed his concern over “the impact of the recent disruptions at this critical moment. This outbreak is occurring in the most difficult context imaginable.”  He added that for the crisis to be resolved, “The response needs to be supported and expanded, not further complicated. Ebola is unforgiving, and disruptions give the virus the advantage.” In June, the Moroccan Ministry of Health undertook measures to prevent Ebola from reaching the country. The ministry said it was closely monitoring the outbreak in DRC and had installed thermal imaging cameras at Casablanca’s Mohammed V Airport.  Additionally, the Ministry of Health strengthened diagnostic methods and management procedures for suspected cases of Ebola by giving Casablanca’s Institut Pasteur diagnostic laboratory equipment.

Rabat – A train derailed Friday morning in Casablanca, damaging most of its compartments. No passengers were on board. A video shows smashed and overturned compartments of the train which derailed at around 8 a.m. while heading to Casa-Port station, resulting in delays. 
The eyewitness who recorded the video pointed out that “luckily passengers were not onboard.” The National Railway Office (ONCF) has not published details about the cause of the derailment but wrote on its Twitter page that two empty compartments had collided during testing. pic.twitter.com/IbSv5VgdXR — ONCF (@ONCFgroup) January 4, 2019  The derailment is reminiscent of a deadly train accident in Morocco three months ago.In October, a regular ONCF train derailed near Bouknadel between Rabat and Kenitra, killing seven people and injuring as many as 125.

Rabat – Following campaigns targeting violence against women, Moroccan NGO Alternative Movernment for Individual Freedoms (MALI) has launched a campaign to ban premarital virginity tests for women in Morocco. Although virginity tests are not legally required before marriage, several Moroccan activists and feminists have condemned their widespread usage. In December, MALI posted a statement to announce their campaign “my vulva is mine.” The campaign aims to “condemn sexual and racial violence for what is known as the virginity test.” Virginity tests, often imposed The statement added that the test is “often imposed by the family or the man. It is important to remember that this examination is a violation of the basic rights of women and an attack on their dignity.” MALI recalled a joint statement issued by the UN Human Rights Council, UN Women, and the World Health Organization (WHO) in October 2018. The organizations called on several countries, including Morocco, to ban virginity testing for women and girls, explaining that virginity tests have no scientific credibility. “There are many women born without a hymen and there are others with a broad hymen that remains intact even after sexual intercourse,” MALI added. MALI argued, “40 percent of women do not bleed during their sexual intercourse.”  However, bleeding is still considered an indicator of virginity, especially in rural areas. Not a legal requirement, but widely used Stephanie Willman Bordat, an international human rights lawyer, spoke with Morocco World News on the danger of the virginity test and how it “harms” the dignity of women. Willman said, “In Morocco [virginity tests] are not a legal requirement but in practice they are used in both criminal and family matters.” Willman referred to sexual assault cases. Prosecutors require virginity test results to prove rape committed against unmarried women. Willman noted that prosecutors seek virginity tests for rape victims because convicted rapists are subject to tougher punishments if they raped virgins. Defense lawyers also seek virginity tests to acquit those accused of rape. She added that some families prefer the bride to have a virginity test “before marriage so that the husband can’t abusively throw her out or repudiate her right after marriage claiming she was not a virgin.” The UN NGOs and WHO said in their joint statement that in case of rape, virginity tests can cause further physical damage when doctors use their hands to check whether the hymen is still untouched. Hymen, which partially covers the opening of the vagina, comes in different shapes, and some women are born without it entirely. Hymen usually remains intact before sexual intercourse. But it can also be stretched by non-sexual activities, including extreme physical activity, horse riding, and bicycling. Some women with a stretched hymen, whether from sexual or other physical activity, pay for an operation to “repair” the hymen to protect family honor. Virginity can’t be established scientifically Willman said that virginity tests are “problematic from a purely forensic medical view.” Scientifically, you can’t really establish virginity or not.” She added that the tests are discriminatory against women. “They make women’s worth as either brides or rape victims depend on their virginity,” Willman said. After the UN’s and WHO’s joint statement, Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi responded that the tests are not legally required before marriage. He added that Morocco’s family code asks for a “medical certificate as a required document before marriage, but it has nothing to do with virginity test.” In an informal poll on Morocco World News’s Facebook page, approximately 1,900 people voted on January 2 on whether virginity tests should be an option or should be banned. Over 1,300 voted for the complete banning of virginity tests while fewer than 600 people voted that the test should be an option. Willman said that “if Morocco is going to ban these tests – as they should – they need to take measures that address the reasons why people use these tests.” She gave as an example using the test to determine punishments in rape cases, saying the government should “punish all rape harshly.” She also said that Morocco “should not allow repudiation and annulment of marriage based on accusations of non virginity.” Willman also called for “sexual and biological education in schools so that people reflect and make decisions based on science, etc.” MALI also called on doctors to refuse to perform virginity tests. The movement also called to “combat gender stereotypes about the sexuality of women in marriage.”

Rabat – Morocco has given Spain a list of demands in exchange for Morocco’s efforts in curbing the flow of irregular migration to Europe.  Spain, which is often the first entry point of irregular migrants to Europe, is demanding that Morocco double its border control. In return for its cooperation, Morocco is requesting more compensation from Spain and the European Union, according to Spanish outlet El Pais. Morocco handed Spanish authorities “a list of demands in exchange for intensifying border control,” El Pais reported. Morocco is a regular EU partner, having struck a number of agreements in the important sectors of agriculture, fisheries, and security.  On the migration front, the North African country was the most-used route by migrants seeking to reach the European Union in 2018. Recently, Brussels pledged a €140 million fund to help Morocco curb the ongoing flow of irregular migration to Europe.  But Morocco has still not received the funds that Europe promised. Key among Morocco’s demands of Spain is that delivery of the promised funds be accelerated, as well as a new cooperation on education and training of Moroccan nationals.  El Pais explained: “In addition to the 140 million euros the EU has promised Morocco, the Maghreb country is demanding aid to train workers in key sectors such as tourism and health.” As for Moroccan university students, Rabat is reportedly pushing for an Erasmus-like program between Spain and Morocco, giving Moroccan students a one-year abroad experience at Spanish universities. For students who have already completed their undergraduate studies in Morocco, the program would allow for postgraduate experience at Spanish institutions.  Spain ready to agree if EU pays Between July and August 2018, Morocco launched an unprecedented campaign to harden its migration policy, making it harder for migrants to cross to neighboring Spain. While the unprecedented crackdown decreased the number of successful irregular attempts, the number of migrants arriving in Spain is still significant, according to Spanish authorities. Spanish officials at the Ministry of Labor and Migration are supportive of Morocco’s demands, saying that Morocco’s cooperation is a key factor in the success of Europe’s and Spain’s migration policy.  “You have to invest in this type of initiative; the EU has to get involved,” the newspaper quoted the officials as saying.  As long as the EU provides the funds for the projects, Spain is ready to comply with Morocco’s demands, Spanish sources argued. While advocating in December for more EU support to secure Morocco’s cooperation, Consuelo Rumi, Spain’s state secretary for migration, said: “It is about Morocco having no excuse for not collaborating.”

Rabat – Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said that the Polisario’s provocative threats to violate restrictions in Guerguerat will put Polisario in confrontation with the United Nations, not with Morocco. El Khalfi added that the UN Security Council was clear in its recent Resolution 2440, which called on Polisario to “fully adhere to its commitments” in regards to the buffer zones and east of Morocco’s defense wall. At a press conference on Thursday, El Khalfi said that Morocco “from the start of the ceasefire in the 1990s until today has been firm and will remain resolute and will continue to be firm on these provocations.” Polisario threatened to disturb participants of the Monaco-Dakar Rally again this year. In January 2018, the separatists also defied UN resolutions by penetrating the buffer zone and intercepting two participants of the rally challenge. In October 2018,  during the adoption of Resolution 2440, the Security Council called on Polisario to refrain from any maneuvers that would change the status quo of the region. It also called on Polisario to refrain from relocating or constructing any facilities in the areas that Polisario has long claimed as “liberated zones.”

Rabat – The monthly international financial affairs magazine, The Banker, awarded Morocco’s central bank governor, Abdellatif Jouahri, “Central Banker of the Year 2019” in Africa. The Central Banker of the Year awards “celebrate the officials that have best managed to stimulate growth and stabilise their economy.” The Financial-Times-owned magazine chose Jouahri for his strong monetary policies that helped shape Morocco’s economic growth. “The country’s banking sector has been strengthened, largely as a result of work by the central bank and its governor, Abdellatif Jouahri,” The Banker wrote on January 2. Jouahri became the governor of Morocco’s central bank, Bank Al Maghrib, in  2003. The magazine explained the hard challenges the Moroccan economy faced after the “impact of a severe drought dented economic growth in 2016, which came in at just 1.2%.” “But improving weather conditions ameliorated the overall outlook for the country in 2017 when gross domestic product expanded by 4.4%.” The Banker, which is the world’s premier banking and finance resource, stated that Morocco’s economy “continues to exhibit strong, underlying fundamentals, even as the country grapples with a number of developmental challenges.” The British magazine also indicated the central bank’s work towards the Moroccan currency liberalization, which is pegged to a two-currency basket weighted 60 percent to the euro and 40 percent to the US dollar. The Banker, which was first published in January 1926, stated that the central bank made  “an important step” in loosening the currency fluctuations in January 2018. “This gradual process of currency liberalisation should improve the competitiveness of the economy and promote higher levels of investment and diversification of trade flows with Africa,” the Banker quoted rating agency Moody’s. The Banker recognized Jouahri’s achievement in maintaining Morocco’s inflation consistently low at an average rate of 1.5 percent over the past ten years and policy rates at 2.25 percent since March 2016.  The London-based magazine also noted the central bank’s partnership with Morocco’s telecommunications regulators to jointly launch a national mobile wallet in November 2018. Mobile wallet payments in Morocco will reach an expected $5.3 billion by 2023, the magazine noted. In October 2018, Jouahri received a trophy with an “A grade,” which is the highest distinction awarded by Central Banker Report Cards 2018 from Global Finance. During the same meeting, Jouahri won a second prize: the best Central Bank governor in 2018 for the Middle East and North Africa, awarded by Global Markets newspaper. The Global Finance magazine also named Jouahri best central bank governor in 2017. The Banker also chose Croatian central banker, Boris Vujcic, as Banker of the year in Europe, Mexico’s central bank governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon, in the Americas, and Malaysia’s central bank governor Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus, in Asia-Pacific. Kuwait’s central bank governor Mohammad Al-Hashel won the 2019 Middle East Central Bank Governor of the Year. The magazine named the Egyptian minister Mohamed Maait as Africa’s 2019 finance minister of the year.

Rabat – Netflix has removed an episode of “Patriot Act” from its service in Saudi Arabia, after the comedy show criticized Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salam (MBS) and his alleged role in the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In an episode of the Netflix show, US comedian Hassan Minhaj criticized the Saudi account of the murder of Khashoggi. Minhaj said in the episode that “this entire cover-up exists for one reason … just a few months ago Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, aka MBS, was hailed as the reformer the Arab world needed, but the revelations about Khashoggi’s killing have shattered that image.” “And it blows my mind that it took the killing of a Washington Post journalist for everyone to go, ‘oh I guess he’s really not a reformer.’ Meanwhile, every Muslim person you know was like, ‘yeah no s**t,'” he added. Criticizing bin Salman, Minhaj argued that “MBS is not modernizing Saudi Arabia, the only thing he’s modernizing is Saudi dictatorship.”  In response to Netflix’s decision to ban the episode, Minhaj took to his Twitter and said, “Clearly, the best way to stop people from watching something is to ban it, make it trend online, and then leave it up on YouTube.” Minhaj added, “Let’s not forget that the world’s largest humanitarian crisis is happening in Yemen right now. Please donate: https://help.rescue.org/donate/yemen.” Clearly, the best way to stop people from watching something is to ban it, make it trend online, and then leave it up on YouTube. Let’s not forget that the world’s largest humanitarian crisis is happening in Yemen right now. Please donate: https://t.co/znMP8vyJma https://t.co/t2VUDhhIdB — Hasan Minhaj (@hasanminhaj) January 2, 2019  Saudi Arabia is facing pressure both for the Yemen crisis and the murder of Khashoggi. Weeks after the murder of Khashoggi, Saudi Arabia authorities admitted the journalist was killed inside the consulate. In a shifting narrative, the country at one point argued that the journalist was killed in a fistfight. International officials condemn the murder, speculating MBS was directly involved . In December, the United States Senate unanimously said that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. “That is a strong statement. I think it speaks to the values that we hold dear,” said Senator Bob Corker. “I’m glad the Senate is speaking with one voice unanimously toward this end.”

Rabat – Morocco’s general prosecutor announced on Thursday that seven more suspects in the murder of the two Scandinavian tourists appeared before the investigating judge at Rabat’s Court of Appeals.  The prosecutor requested the investigating judge put the suspects, including a Swiss-Spanish suspect who allegedly recruited and trained the others to use state-of-the-art communication technologies, in preventive detention. Last Sunday, December 30, 15 members arrested in connection to the double murder underwent a similar investigation at the Court of Appeals in Rabat. The Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested 22 suspects in total, including  a Swiss national who also holds Spanish nationality on December 29 in Marrakech.  After he had converted to Islam, the Swiss man became “radicalized” and left Switzerland to form a terrorist group. According to BCIJ head Abdelhak Khiame, although four of the suspects pledged allegiance to ISIS in a video, they committed the crime independently of ISIS, but were influenced by the self-styled “caliph” of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Authorities found the bodies of Danish tourist Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Norwegian tourist Maren Ueland on December 17 near Imlil in the Atlas Mountains. Khiame confirmed that the victims were stabbed and decapitated. The murder of the tourists made international headlines. Shocked that the brutal murder happened in their country, Moroccans expressed sympathy and solidarity with the victims’ families and countries of origin.

By Mohamed Hikal Rabat – Essaouira’s major hotels and classified establishments recorded an occupancy rate of 100 percent over New Year’s Eve, a positive finale to a promising year for tourism in the coastal city. Overnight stays increased by 10 percent and the total number of visitors rose by 15 percent during the first ten months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, according to the Provincial Delegation of Tourism. The president of Essaouira’s Provincial Council for Tourism, Redouan Khan, said the influx of European tourists was comforting and Essaouira has become a top tourist destination.  Khan expressed his appreciation for the tourism sector’s efforts  to make Essaouira a clean, safe, and welcoming environment and offer services offered to visitors. The city’s weather, proximity to Europe, its people’s openness, and the richness of its cultural heritage have all made Essaouira a perfect venue for art and culture events. Every year, Essaouira hosts multiple festivals, including the Gnaoua World Music Festival in June. The “city of wind” is perfect for surfing, and visitors can spend quality time fishing or practicing their favorite water sports. For shopping fans, the souks in the medina (old city), a UNESCO World Heritage site, offer a variety of souvenirs and finely crafted traditional items.  A number of organizations have worked to improve tourism in Essaouira, including the Ministry of Tourism, the National Office of Airports (ONDA), and the Essaouira Mogador Association. According to Khan, the council has doubled its efforts to launch direct flights linking Essaouira to London, Madrid, and Barcelona. The council is also planning to secure a flight between Essaouira and the nearby Canary Islands, which Khan says would guarantee more tourists every year. Built 20 years ago, Essaouira’s Mogador International Airport has increased its annual passenger traffic from 26,000 in 2007 to 95,000 passengers in 2018. The figure has increased by approximately 12 percent every year, according to the National Office of Airports (ONDA). Mogador Airport is Morocco’s 11th busiest and serves 24 different destinations every week. On December 26, the airport celebrated the arrival of its 100,000th traveler from Bordeaux, France. In another effort to enhance Essaouira, King Mohammed VI chaired a signing ceremony on October 22, 2018, for restoration programs of the medina in Essaouira. The government allocated MAD 300 million to restore Essaouira’s medina.

Rabat – The UN Security Council has announced its Provisional Programme of Work of Security Council for January 2019. In its agenda, the Security Council is dedicating January to consulting on peacekeeping missions in the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.The Western Sahara conflict is on the agenda, with the consultation on MINURSO due to take place on January 29. In December, the Security Council Report announced that the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy, Horst Kohler, would brief the Security Council on the conflict and MINURSO in January. The consultation agenda targeting UN missions follows US National Security Advisor John Bolton’s remarks  addressing what he perceives to be unnecessary UN missions that fail to end stalled conflicts. Regarding MINURSO, Bolton expressed frustration that 27 years after its creation, the body has proven “ineffective” and has not ended the conflict over the region. In addition to MINURSO, the 15 members of the Security Council will also consult on MONUSCO operating in the Republic of Congo, UNOWAS in West Africa and, UNFICYP in Cyprus. In December at the Heritage Foundation, Trump’s national security advisor discussed the US’s financial contributions to the UN missions in African conflict zones. “The United States will no longer provide indiscriminate assistance across the entire continent, without focus or prioritization,” Bolton said. He added that his country will “not tolerate this longstanding pattern of aid without effect, assistance without accountability, and relief without reform.” US Representative for UN Management and Reform Ambassador Cherith Norman Chalet echoed Bolton’s remarks. “Unfortunately in a deeply dissatisfying and disappointing turn of events, every country decided reform was good and right for the UN, but not for how it is financed,” she said. The US is a top contributor to the UN budget, providing $10 billion annually.

Rabat – The Algerian government has responded to international criticism for expelling Syrian migrants, citing concerns over terrorism.  Al Jazeera quoted Hassen Kacimi, the head of the migration department at the interior ministry, as saying that the 50 migrants Algeria expelled to Niger last week were suspected to have a terrorist background. Algeria  had previously claimed the Syrians were irregular migrants. Defending Algeria’s policy, Kacimi told Reuters, “We have hosted 50,000 Syrians in the past few years for humanitarian reasons. But we cannot accept members of armed groups fleeing from Syria when it comes to our security.” He added: “This is a criminal network and we must be very vigilant not to allow them to enter into Algeria.” In November, Anwar Al Bouni of the Syrian Center of Studies and Legal Research took to Facebook to denounce Algeria’s treatment of Syrians.  Al Bouni accused the country of being insensitive to tSyrian refugeeshe plight of Syrians, likening Algeria’s attitude to the racial profiling of Arabs by an Arab state. He wrote that Syrian refugees were “stuck in an Arab country.”  According to the Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights (LADDH), Algiers expelled 50 “desperate and distressed” mostly Syrian refugees on December 25 and 26.  LADDH said in a statement the Syrians were “abandoned somewhere in the desert between Algeria and Niger where they are in great distress and facing hunger and cold weather.” Kacimi said the Syrians had come through the Malian and Nigerien border to seek refuge in Algeria. Algeria considers the Niger-Mali route a hub of insecurity and illicit activities. People who use that route are suspected of being armed fighters, Kacimi explained. LADDH has adamantly criticized Algeria’s “insensitive” move. The rights group said it was doubtful whether the latest deported convoy of refugees has terrorist links.  According to LADDH’s statement, the latest deported refugees were Syrians, Yemenis, and Palestinians, with “a considerable number of children and pregnant women.”

Rabat – After a joint investigation by the Freestone County Sheriff and the McLennan County Sheriff, police arrested an American school teacher in central Texas for conspiring to traffic a minor to Morocco for prostitution. The arrested woman, Amber Michelle Parker, 37, is an eighth-grade teacher in Mexia Junior High School in Mexia, Texas. Freestone County Sheriff Jeremy Shipley said that Parker “was placed under arrest for the offense of Trafficking of Persons.” The arrest came after other family members contacted police, doubting Parker’s intentions with the girl. Texas news outlet KBTX quoted Shipley as saying the woman “was online talking to multiple guys in Morocco trying to get it setup where she could take [the minor] with her over there to them.” Parker promoted the girl as a virgin. McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara said Parker posted semi-nude pictures of the minor in lingerie online to find men interested in the girl, Waco Tribune-Herald news outlet reported. “It’s a very low-down thing, it’s the worst of the worst when you prostitute your own relative, that’s as low as you get,” said McNamara. “It’s sickening to think a woman would stoop that low.” Although Parker was planning to take the child to Morocco, the minor did not travel. Family members told McNamara that Parker visited Morocco in mid-December 2018 and returned to the US on January 1. “Family members got wind that Parker was going to try to lure this girl to Morocco,” McNamara said. “It is a dastardly story, and it is trafficking at its worst.” Thanks to the family members, the girl is now safe and is with her father who came from out of Texas to take her.

Rabat – Moroccan dual citizens will be exempt from the 12-month obligatory military service proposed by the Moroccan government in August 2018. Quoted by Belgian outlet RTL Info, the Moroccan embassy in Belgium announced that “binationals are not affected by this measure, unless they wish.” The reintroduction of compulsory military service concerned some Moroccan youth. On December 27, the House Representatives in Parliament passed the law at a plenary session. During the session, the delegate minister in charge of the National Defense Administration, Abdellatif Loudiyi, said that the measure will promote a spirit of sacrifice and self-discipline. The upper house has not yet voted on the bill. According to Loudiyi, the bill is in line with King Mohammed VI’s instructions. It also fell within the framework of Article 38 in the Constitution, which states that all citizens, both women and men, should contribute to the defense of the homeland and its territorial integrity. Citizens aged 19 to 25 are subject to 12-months of military service unless they have valid reasons exempting them. However, people over the age of 25 who were eligible for an exemption can still be called up until the age of 40 if the reason for their exemption is no longer relevant. About 10,000 Moroccans are expected to begin the 12-month military service each year starting September 2019.

Rabat – Morocco’s ulema, a body of religious clerics, have launched an assault on radicalization, vowing to counter its messages and stop the spread of “textual and erroneous” interpretation of religious texts. The Mohammedia League of Scholars, Morocco’s ulema or highest body of Islamic scholars, met on Friday, December 28, to discuss how to counter the “worrying spread” of radicalization. The scholars sought to find ways to counter radical discourse and equip both the public and imams with sufficient training and general knowledge to “resist the radicalization trap.” Speaking after the Friday meeting, Ahmed Abbadi, the league’s secretary general, said that the ulema seeks to simplify and uphold Morocco’s Maliki tradition of Islamic practice, which is “grounded in tolerance and openness.”  According to Abbadi, the radicalization industry is thriving in many countries and in some quarters in Morocco because a number of believers are not sufficiently informed to discriminate between messages.  “The practice of Islamic jurisprudence should reflect social changes,” Abbadi said. He explained that in today’s context of globalization and rapid changes in the communication industry, Islamic scholars need to invest in social networks and other communication channels to detect and counter the rhetoric of radical groups which are already established on such platforms.   Instead of their traditional reactionary attitude towards social changes, religious clerics ought to “positively react” to social transformations and take them into account in making sense of the world for believers. Abbadi explained, “An effective Islamic jurisprudence in the 21st century must think and accompany its environment’s social changes.”  Religious teaching today should be both accessible and updated to “immunize the people” against the constant danger of radicalization, he argued. Abbadi’s statements come amid fears of a revival of terrorism following the double murder of Scandinavian tourists in Morocco and news of a prospective return of former ISIS fighters. Founded in 2006 by royal decree, the Mohammedia League of Scholars is part of Morocco’s counter-terrorism efforts. Operating on the ideological front, the body is charged with training “a new generation of Islamic scholars and imams” to disseminate religious tolerance and prevent the spread of radical Islamism.

Rabat – After an Al Ayam journalist interviewed an orphaned 7-year-old girl about her experience of her mother’s murder, Moroccan social media users, journalists, and activists have denounced the “insensitive” act and demanded that the child see a psychologist. Many Moroccans argued that the journalist’s asking the child about details related to her mother’s decapitation was a violation of the child’s rights and morality to gain views and spark controversy. Others also pointed out that journalists should not have shown the child’s face to the cameras, out of respect for her.  Sami Elmoudni, founder of the Moroccan Forum for Young Journalists, wrote on his Facebook page that the child is in need of psychological help rather than being exposed to the media’s questions. The director of the Al Ayam news outlet, Noureddine Miftah, has apologized for the video on behalf of the interviewer in a Facebook statement, writing that he was shocked when he watched the interview and immediately ordered it be removed. “It is unacceptable and unprofessional. I deeply apologize for this unintentional mistake which I hope will not be repeated.” Locals in Oued Ifrane, a rural town in the Ifrane region in Morocco’s Middle Atlas Mountains, found Fatima Rayhan’s decapitated body in a deserted area on Friday, December 28. The child allegedly saw her mother’s decapitated head after locals and family found her body.  Two days after the murder, police arrested a suspect, a shepherd who tried to force Rayhan to marry him and killed her after she repeatedly refused, according to her father’s statement. Following Rayhan’s death, her father, who suffers from cancer, became depressed and called on King Mohammed VI and charitable Moroccans to help him financially to raise his 7-year-old granddaughter and save his family from poverty. Many people showed interest in adopting Rayhan’s daughter. Some who proposed adopting the child live abroad.

Rabat – Polisario members are planning to repeat their controversial maneuvers disturbing participants of the Monaco-Dakar Rally again this year. Polisario again threatens to violate the Guerguerat buffer zone, a thin strip of land on the border between Mauritania and Western Sahara in southern Morocco. The Africa Eco race winds through Guerguerat between Morocco and Mauritania on its way from Monaco in Europe to Dakar, Senegal. Pro-Polisario news outlet Futurosahara reported that “the Monaco-Dakar Rally organizers ignore the Sahrawi authorities’ warnings for the second year in a row.” The separatist website also confirmed that Polisario sent two vehicles to the region last year,urging MINURSO to “take necessary measures.” The news outlet added that Sahrawis warned the organizers that they will “hinder the passage of the rally in case of a provocation from the participants through carrying the Moroccan flag or any provocative map.” To cover up its intentions, Futurosahara reported that a source from the Polisario denied any development in the region. The participants of the rally are expected to arrive in Mauritania through Guerguerat on January 7. The threats are not new; Polisario members defied UN resolutions by penetrating the buffer zone in January 2018.  Polisario’s self-styled “civilian police” sent two vehicles to the race hoping to hinder and intercept two participants of the rally challenge coming from Dakhla. If the pattern continues this year, the UN may take strict measures against Polisario. The Security Council issued a warning in October, calling on Polisario not to change the status quo of the region or hamper the UN-led political process. Through its Resolution 2440, the Security Council also called on Polisario to refrain from relocating or constructing any facilities in the areas that Polisario has long claimed as “liberated zones.”

Rabat – Morocco’s economic growth is expected to have decelerated to 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, down from 4.4 percent during the same period in 2017, the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) announced January 2. The non-agricultural production growth rate is expected to have decreased to 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, down from 3.4 percent in the same period in 2017. According to HCP’s forecasts, the non-agricultural production growth rate is expected to slightly increase to 2.9 percent in the first quarter of 2019. In the third quarter of 2018, Morocco’s overall economic growth slowed to 3 percent, down from 3.9 percent during the same quarter in 2017. HCP stated that Morocco’s primary economic sectors, fisheries and agriculture, recorded a sharp slowdown in growth rate to 4.1 percent in the third quarter of 2018, down from 13.4 percent in the third quarter of 2017. Explaining the statistics, HCP said agricultural value added production grew by only 3.8 percent instead of 15 percent a year earlier. However fishing value added production grew by 6.8 percent compared to a decrease of 3 percent. Growth to fall to 2.5% in first quarter of 2019 HCP expects the national economy growth rate to fall to 2.5 percent in the first quarter of 2019, down from 3.3 percent in the first quarter of 2018. The fall is due to an anticipated 0.7 percent fall in agricultural value added production. Morocco’s central bank, Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM), expects Morocco’s economic growth to have slowed down to 3.3 percent for 2018 compared to 4.1 percent in 2017.  Concerning public finances, the budget deficit is expected to have widened to 3.7 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2018 and continue, according to BAM’s forecasts, to remain at that level in the medium term. Morocco’s GDP grew by 4.3 percent in the third quarter of 2018, and prices rose 1.3 percent, an increase over 0.2 price growth in the third quarter of 2017. The government has approved a budget of MAD 443 billion for 2019 Finance Bill, aiming to achieve a growth rate of 3.2 percent in GDP.

Rabat – The director general of National Security (DGSN), Abdellatif Hammouchi, has ordered the general inspection commission to investigate who leaked and shared pictures of a crossdressing man arrested in Marrakech on New Year’s Day. DGSN announced on Wednesday that it will take disciplinary procedures if any of its members were responsible for sharing the pictures. In the early hours of Tuesday, Marrakech police arrested the man after he hit a motorcyclist with his car and tried to run away, according to a press release by DGSN. When eyewitnesses and passersby noticed the man was wearing a dress and wig, they started to insult him. The situation nearly got out of hand as people swarmed the man, who tried to hide his face from phone cameras. Videos and pictures of the incident have been widely shared on social media networks.  While many Moroccans slurred the man for disrespecting Moroccan culture and society, calling him “immoral” and “effeminate,” others condemned the sharing of pictures and videos as “disrespectful” and “a violation” of his personal freedom. Some also argued that the man deserves punishment because crossdressing contradicts Islamic morality in the country.  Homosexuality and cross-dressing are considered immoral in Morocco and most of the Muslim world. Same-sex relations are punishable by law according to Articles 483, 489, 490, and 491 of the Moroccan Penal Code. The New Year’s incident is similar to the experience of another Moroccan man in Marrakech whom locals beat for wearing a woman’s robe in 2015. The incident had sparked widespread controversy over the violence the homosexual man experienced and LGBTQ rights in Morocco.

Rabat -Moroccan officials found two Spanish pro-Polisario activists in Laayoune who claimed that they were there for New Year’s Eve, according to Spanish news outlet El Espanol. Both Patricia Ibanez and Irati Tobar were staying at the house of  Hassana Alia, who was sentenced to life in prison by the Rabat military court in 2013 for his involvement in the Gdim Izik  uprising.  In 2010, Sahrawis at the Gdim Izik camp, near Laayoune, clashed with Moroccan police, resulting in the death of 11 Moroccan officers and the injury of 70 others, including four civilians, as well as great property damage. Alia is living in exile in Spain, having sought asylum there.  Alia receives aid monthly from separatist human rights activists, along with other Polisario separatists, to spread the separatist ideology.  Ibanez told the Spanish news outlet that outside Alia’s house “there was a police van and another vehicle with tinted windows, and around the corner thay had a taxi waiting.” Moroccan authorities sent the Spanish nationals to Agadir, explaining that they could visit the city but “not staying with a family. We tried to talk to them and explain, but there was no way,” Ibanez said. Alia posted a photo of the two Spanish nationals, saying Morocco had expelled them. Morocco sentenced 25 people for the Gdim Izik uprising of November 8, 2010 in the village of Gdim Izik, during which several Moroccans were brutally murdered, including 11 police officers. A Moroccan military court sentenced the defendants to 20 years to life imprisonment. Some of them were sentenced in absentia. Later, a civilian court retried the case when Morocco reformed its judicial code so that military courts could not try civilians. The civilian court handed down the same sentences.

Rabat – The Moroccan-born Israeli singer Maya Casabianca 78, died on Sunday, December 31, in the village of Kfar Tavorv village in Israel. Casabianca was born in 1941 in Casablanca, Morocco, as Margalit Azran. Her birth city inspired her stage name. She moved to France with her family in the 1950s where she became a famous singer after she signed a contract with the Philips record company. Casabianca performed with renowned French singers like Yves Montand and Georges Brassens. Casabianca’s music was popular in the Arab world, especially in Syria and Lebanon, and even in the Soviet Union.  The singer had kept her Jewish identity concealed from the general public and her fans in Russia and the Arab world.  Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that some of Casabianca’s most memorable performances were in Moscow when she sang the Israeli national anthem, Hatikva, back when Israel and the Soviet Union did not have diplomatic relations. “The Russians of course didn’t know that I was Israeli; for them I was the French star,” she told Haaretz in 2001.  Casabianca later moved with her family to Israel and left her singing career and fame behind.

Rabat – Spain received 57,250 irregular migrants who crossed the Mediterranean in 2018 up to December 26, according to Spanish outlet El Pais. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimated the figure could surpass 58,000 arrivals by the end of 2018 with an average of almost 160 arrivals daily. El Pais added that 300 migrants arrived in Algeciras on December 28 aboard the Open Arms humanitarian ship. Arrivals in Spain this year accounted for 50 percent of all undocumented migrants that arrived in Europe via  Spain, Italy, Greece, Cyprus, and Malta across the Mediterranean, which totalled 113,145 by December 19, 2018, according to IOM. While the number for Spain is a record, the total number is low compared to the migrants and refugees who entered Europe by sea during the same period in 2017 (168,258) and 2016 (359,160). El Pais cited Amparo Gonzalez of the state-funded scientific research agency CSIC, saying that many of the irregular “migrants – who are mainly from Morocco, Guinea and Mali – will not settle down in Spain.” According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 31 percent of those who entered Spain irregularly were from Morocco, 20 percent from Guinea, and 16 percent from Mali. Thirty to 50 percent of the irregular migrants who enter Spain either go to other European countries, or are deported to their home countries, especially if they are Algerians or Moroccans, Gonzalez stressed. She noted that sub-Saharan africans in Spain represent a minority of migrants, blaming media for spreading the misconception that “all of Africa wants to come to Spain.” Javier Aparicio Maydeu, an analyst, believes that irregular migration across the Mediterranean route will continue until Europe reaches an agreed-upon migration policy. But with the 2019 election coming soon in Spain “any changes will be put on hold,” Maydeu added. More than 3,400 people died or went missing on migratory routes across the globe in 2018, including 2,242 deaths only in the Mediterranean. At least 769 undocumented migrants died using the western Mediterranean route from Morocco to Spain in 2018, over three times the recorded Mediterranean deaths in 2017, according to IOM. Waves of undocumented migrants will continue reaching Europe through Spain this year. Just yesterday, January 1, Spanish rescue services assisted 111 migrants traveling on three boats in the early hours of the day, according to El Pais.

Rabat – On December 13, John Bolton, the Trump administration’s national security adviser, unveiled the US’s Africa strategy, stressing Washington’s aim to reinvest in its “global power” image in Africa. Bolton called for a bold and adventurous US Africa policy to contain and counter China’s and Russia’s “expansionism.” And while reactions to the plan have been numerous, both in tone and number, it is still unclear how the move will translate on the ground in US-Africa relations. Bolton as key to the new US strategy in Western Sahara After presenting a strategy set to secure American economic interests, fight terrorism, and ensure that “US aid money is effectively used,” Bolton focused on his “favorite topic,” Western Sahara.  As one of the architects of MINURSO, the UN military mission in Western Sahara which he helped establish in 1991, Bolton expressed frustration that 27 years after its creation, the body has proven “ineffective.” That MINURSO has been unable to organize a referendum in nearly three decades, concluded a dismayed Bolton, was proof that Washington needs to reengineer its diplomatic efforts with relation to the Western Sahara dispute. Like with Bolton, there is a tendency in some diplomatic circles to slam Morocco for “refusing” for a referendum to be held to once and for all broker a peace settlement in Western Sahara. What often gets sidelined, however, is Algeria’s and Polisario’s refusal for a UN-sponsored independent observation team to evaluate the Tindouf camps’ demographic makeup and determine who “the real Sahrawis” are.  Until Morocco’s 2007 Autonomy Plan which advocates for local autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty, Rabat’s position, as recently echoed by a group of “Sahrawi dissidents,” was that Polisario is not a legitimate representative of the Sahrawis. For Rabat, a referendum would be counterproductive until independent observers settle those legitimacy and demographics-related contentious points. The US’s Africa strategy, and by extension Bolton’s Western Sahara remarks, have been compared to the “imperialist” big stick diplomacy, when great powers exert substantial amounts of soft-sounding hawkish pressure to get desired outcomes.  Bolton may not have thought of the newly unveiled strategy in imperialist terms, but he seemed to agree with the “big stick” characterization of the plan.  In a recent lengthy article for the New Yorker, Nicolas Niarchos wrote that a number of officials with briefing on the ongoing UN-led process in Western Sahara credited Bolton with making possible both the shift towards a shorter MINURSO mandate and the seemingly corresponding diplomatic overtures.   Stalled and frozen for decades, with conflicting parties not even willing to sit at the same negotiating table, the decades-long dispute in Western Sahara may be “nearing its end” thanks to recently regained diplomatic momentum, Niarchos suggested.  The sentiment is mostly derived from the fact that, in merely a few months, Horst Kohler, the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara, has succeeded in getting Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and the Polisario Front to the same table for talks.  The parties met in early December in Geneva. And although the discussions were mostly—and unsurprisingly—inconclusive, just the fact that they actually met and discussed seemed enough, unheard of in years. Most importantly perhaps, all parties decided to meet again in March 2019. The second Geneva meeting and the stakeholders’ perceived commitment to brokering a lasting deal has spiked hopes that the Horst Kohler-moderated process will be more effective than other UN-led processes. According to diplomats who spoke to the New Yorker’s Niarchos, however, Bolton’s high-pressure-inspired diplomacy is single-handedly responsible for the perceived diplomatic overtures under Kohler’s auspices. “Officials present [in Geneva] told me that President Trump’s new national security adviser, John Bolton, played an important role in getting the groups to the table,” Niarchos wrote. The “Bolton effect,” as one of Niarchos’s diplomatic sources went on to argue, was the plausible explanation for such a quick change of pace and direction in how the international community, particularly the UN, is now dealing with the Western Sahara question. The allusion is familiar to Western Sahara observers. Bolton’s reservations about MINURSO’s indispensability in Western Sahara and his insistence that the body’s mandate be considerably cut to exert more pressure on conflicting parties explained why its mandate was only extended by six months late last year, instead of the traditional one-year extension period.  Only 2 Americans are ‘serious’ about Western Sahara Addressing the effect of his anti-MINURSO stance, Bolton not only agreed with the “Bolton effect” rhetoric, he brought it to a much higher level. In the process, he indirectly accused the international community and previous US governments of not doing their homework in solving the crisis.  “You have to think of the people of Western Sahara, think of the Sahrawis, many of whom are still in refugee camps near Tindouf, in the Sahara Desert, and we need to allow these people and their children to get back and have normal lives.”  Morocco’s King Mohammed VI raised similar concerns in a recent speech, albeit in a different tone.  “I should like to say today, in a very straightforward and responsible way, that Morocco stands ready for a direct and frank dialogue with our sister nation, Algeria, in order to settle the transient and objective differences impeding the development of relations between the two countries,” King Mohammed VI said.  While the King did not directly reference Western Sahara, observers have been quick to extend Morocco’s “honest dialogue” offer to the Western Sahara question. (It is an open secret that Algeria’s continued support for the Polisario Front is a central element of the cold diplomatic ties between Algiers and Rabat). The backbone of Bolton’s “frustration,” as he himself stressed, is that the large majority of diplomats—American and foreign—either do not understand the real stakes of the Western Sahara dispute, or are not genuinely willing to broker a lasting settlement.  “The conflict has not been handled well, and that’s why it continues to persist. There are two Americans who really focus a lot on the Western Sahara: one’s James Baker, the other’s me…. I think there should be intense pressure on everybody involved to see if they can’t work it out.” Encounter of patient and impatient diplomatic methods Bolton’s unveiling of the US’s Africa strategy engendered a flurry of commentaries and news reports.  While some focused on the plan’s perceived neo-imperialism and paternalism-leaning ideology conceiving of Africa as a continent waiting to have great powers (US, China, Russia) solve its problems, others focused on how Bolton’s Western Sahara remarks would be received in Morocco. The underlying geopolitics of Bolton’s position on Western Sahara “must be freaking out Morocco,” Al Monitor reported. “Judging by [Bolton’s] performance at the Heritage Foundation, it sounds like he is ready to oversee the demise [of MINURSO],” the outlet emphasized. Specialists who spoke to Al Monitor bore out the newspaper’s alarmist reading of Bolton’s Heritage Foundation speech. “The statement in itself is likely to deteriorate the climate between Washington and Rabat,” said Marc Pierini, a senior fellow at Carnegie Europe.   While such alarmism is warranted—and was echoed in some Moroccan circles—no official reactions from either Rabat or Washington have given the remarks the gravity that news articles have.  As far as Morocco is concerned, diplomacy entails patience and working with what you are given, Omar Hilale, Morocco’s permanent representative to the UN, said to Niarchos. “For us, we work with it, if they want six months, O.K. They want one year, it’s O.K for Morocco,” Hilale said.  That sentiment echoed foreign affairs minister Nasser Bourita’s remarks when asked by France’s Le Monde newspaper about the implications of the shortening of MINURSO’s mandate. The important thing, Bourita argued, is what the mandate achieves, not how long it lasts. He said the fuss about it all was a “false debate.” Judging by Hilale’s statements which stressed Rabat’s composure as the UN-led process unfolds, at play is an encounter between patient and impatient camps on an easy-looking but deep-rooted crisis. Bolton’s frustration, in the meantime, is no matter for contention. “I just get impatient when I think about it,” the New Yorker article quoted him as stressing, in reference to what he largely sees as an ineffective MINURSO. Meanwhile, “Polisario officials, for their part, have welcomed the renewed U.S. engagement,” Niarchos noted. He added that, like Bolton, the separatist front is losing its patience.  While Rabat has not been heard on what it makes of the so-called Bolton effect, there is an entrenched sense that the Bolton-as-key narrative has been disproportionately magnified. One senior security adviser, however important, cannot irreversibly derail the longtime Rabat-Washington alliance.  “Our bilateral relationships are so strong that they will not be jeopardized by any person,” Ambassador Hilale said.

Rabat – Morocco’s public health officials and the Ministry of Health have found common ground on raising Moroccan doctors’ working standards, easing tensions in a sector that threatened to go on strike by mid-January.  In a recent joint press release, the Independent Union of Public Sector Doctors (SIMSP) and the Ministry of Health announced that authorities “have taken into account the majority of doctors’ demands” and are setting a mechanism to ensure that the agreement is implemented. Like their counterparts in the Moroccan public sector, doctors at public health institutions are demanding improved working conditions, especially wage raises, leave, and retirement. The press statement emphasized the two parties “commitment to restore trust and restart the social dialogue” to improve both health practitioners’ working conditions and the quality of treatment at Moroccan public hospitals. Government representatives and doctors’ union representatives reached the agreement at a meeting in Rabat on December 24, after months of disagreements that unions attributed to the government’s refusal to cooperate. The agreement also mentioned the need to revive the country’s ineffective medical assistance system to make the country’s healthcare more inclusive. While satisfied with the terms of the agreement, healthcare professionals are not yet celebrating. They said they are waiting until the government translates into “concrete action” the principles of the joint press statement. SIMSP President Abdellah El Montadar Alaoui said: “This agreement in principle is a positive step for public sector doctors. Now we are waiting for implementation.” Alaoui added, “The ministry has taken our concerns into account. Now it is up to the government to act.” Key among doctors’ demands is a considerable revision of their salary scale.  Currently paid at a scale of 336 (the equivalent of other government employees with master’s degree), doctors are requesting that the scale be upgraded to 509 (equivalent to government employees with a doctorate, or “Bac +8” in the Moroccan system) which they say is more reflective of the length of medical school. The agreement comes as other professional sectors threaten to hit the country with “a month of anger” of protests and marches from early to mid-January.  Teachers’ unions announced late last month that they will march tomorrow, January 3. As no announcement has yet been issued to the contrary, the march is expected to proceed tomorrow from Parliament to the Ministry of Education.

Rabat – Morocco will increase the currency export limit for tourist travel to MAD 45,000 annually, starting January 14, according to a statement from the General Instruction Exchange Operations published by the Exchange Office. According to the Office of Foreign Exchange, the currency export limit will increase at a rate of “45,000 dirhams per year with an additional 10 percent of the individual’s income tax, all capped at MAD 100,000.”  Previously, travelers could carry only MAD 2,000 out of the country in local currency. The office added that the instruction “provides important liberalization and easing measures for both current operations (travel, imports and exports of goods and services) and for capital operations.” To ease currency restrictions for import businesses, the measure will also “harmonize the advance payment of imports of goods at the rate of MAD 200,000.” The measure will also allow small technology startups to pay for foreign services with international credit cards under “e-commerce” to the amount of MAD 500,000 per year. The instruction will allow exporters of currency exchange services to open accounts abroad for capital transactions, according to the statement. It will also allow Moroccan banks to finance industrial companies in Morocco’s export-processing zones with foreign currency. Moroccan banks will be able to grant loans using foreign currency in foreign currency accounts to finance import, export, international trading, and investment operations. In December, the Exchange Office announced that the currency export limit for people traveling for tourism would be linked to paid income tax.

Rabat – On Wednesday morning, the passenger train was hit by flying objects from a freight train carrying beer and traveling in the opposite direction on the bridge linking Denmark’s main islands, Zealand and Fyn. According to local authorities, the Copenhagen-bound train was carrying 131 passengers and three crew members on board.  A heavy storm also made it difficult for emergency services to reach the train. Danish authorities closed the 18-kilometer bridge which is part of the infrastructure that links Denmark and Sweden to Germany. Morocco suffered a deadly train accident in October. An ONCF train derailed near Bouknadel between Rabat and Kenitra, killing seven people and injuring as many as 125. Another train crash recently hit Ankara, Turkey, in December, leaving seven people dead and 43 injured.

Rabat – From a long and middle-distance runner in his early years, Morocco’s Abderrahim Ben Redouan has become a laborer, carrying cement bags in his 50s.  Ben Redouan competed in the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics for Morocco as a 30-year-old, coming 84th in the men’s marathon. A number of social media users have been sharing before-and-after pictures of the forgotten Moroccan runner, feeling sorry for the sportsman’s current life. When Ben Redouan’s career ended, the former runner found himself alone to face the challenge of earning a living and feeding his young children, according to Moroccan media reports.   Although he reached out to Moroccan authorities and several sports institutions responsible for paying current Moroccan athletes, Ben Redouan did not receive any financial help or a position in an athletic club. Ben Redouan’s financial situation continued to deteriorate as he found all doors blocked to him, Moroccan media reported. Having exhausted all his options, Ben Redouan began fishing with just a fishing pole. Ben Redouan, who lives in the G5 neighborhood in Rabat, now works as a cement bag porter.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Office of Food Safety (ONSSA) has published new statistics, showing that 67 percent of Moroccans do not check for a label on the olive oil they buy. Only 33 percent of those surveyed said that they check for nutrition information and labels on olive oil before purchasing. ONSSA warned consumers in a Facebook post to read labels, checking expiration dates, preservation conditions, sanitary and safety requirements, and the product’s license number.  The post followed a campaign by Morocco’s Ministry of the Interior, which deployed a special patrol unit to combat vendors selling fake olive oil across Morocco. Frauds allegedly use capsules, mixing them with lukewarm water to produce a liquid that resembles olive oil, potentially causing health risks. In December, Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch said his ministry would also deal strictly with frauds selling fake essential oils. The minister added that Morocco had harvested 2 million tons of olives in 2018. The number represents an increase of 28 percent compared to last year. Morocco became the 4th largest olive producer across the world in 2018. Morocco’s principle regions for olive production are Marrakech, Fez, Meknes, and Casablanca. Olive trees cover more than 1.07 million hectares in Morocco, accounting for 65 percent of the tree species in the country. The olive sector is a major employment source, providing 380,000 jobs. Women make up 20 percent of the workers in the sector. The sector also helps the trade balance in Morocco by ensuring the inflow of foreign currency, estimated at MAD 1.8 billion annually. In addition to olive oil, ONSSA also posted about honey, saying that honey products should be labeled throughout all steps of its marketing. The label should indicate whether the honey was produced fully in Morocco. If not, the label should include whether the product was imported. The product also has to include nutrition information and safety conditions.

Rabat – The father of the 24-year-old Ifrane victim, an elderly widower and cancer patient, told Moroccan media in a video that his brutally murdered daughter, Fatima Rayhan, was the family’s breadwinner. Rayhan was a mother and a divorcee who lived at her parents’ house. Following Rayhan’s death, her father entered a state of depression and called on King Mohammed VI and Moroccans to help him financially to raise his 7-year-old granddaughter and save his family from poverty. Many Moroccans showed solidarity with the family on social media and offered to donate to the family. Some even offered to adopt and care for Rayhan’s daughter. Locals in Oued Ifrane, a rural town in the Ifrane region in Morocco’s Middle Atlas Mountains, found Rayhan’s decapitated body in a deserted area on Friday, December 28. Two days later, police arrested a suspect in the murder, a 38-year-old shepherd who was on the run in a nearby forest until his arrest in Tounfite, a town in Midelt Province, Draa-Tafilalet, Morocco. Rayhan’s father related that the shepherd had tried to force Rayhan into marrying him. When she repeatedly refused, the shepherd became vengeful, waited by her house until she went outside at 5 a.m., and then dragged her to an isolated area and killed her. According to her father, Rayhan had already filed a complaint to the local gendarmerie about the shepherd’s threatening her. However, the shepherd apologized, and she withdrew the complaint. The Ifrane murder came just 11 days after terrorists murdered two young Scandinavian women by decapitation near Imlil, 90 kilometers south of Marrakech.

Rabat – Representatives of Morocco and Honduras have reaffirmed their increasing readiness to strengthen diplomatic ties and further cooperation on a wide range of common issues. The two delegations met yesterday in Brasilia at the inauguration of Brazil’s newly elected president, Jair Bolsonaro. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, who led the Moroccan delegation, spoke about the “common interests” of the Moroccan and Honduran people. El Othmani particularly highlighted the South-South impetus of Morocco’s diplomatic efforts, suggesting that increased dialogue between Global South countries is a key element in collectively facing global challenges.  Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez noted Morocco’s increased visibility on the global stage, especially on issues of migration and security. He said such issues are global concerns and require more collaboration on bilateral and multilateral levels. In recent years, Morocco has extended its diplomatic outreach, particularly in Africa and the Americas, often in a bid to garner more diplomatic support for its Western Sahara position. The government of Honduras, a supporter of Morocco’s position, reiterated its stance in the Brasilia meeting.  President Hernandez called for further ties between Rabat and Tegucigalpa, saying that his country stands with Morocco on the question of territorial integrity. He said Morocco “can count on the friendship and the support of Honduras.” The two officials stressed the need to accelerate bilateral cooperation on agriculture, tourism, and renewable energies.  El Othmani extended an official invitation to the Honduran government to send a delegation to attend the Meknes International Agriculture Fair (SIAM) to be held later this year.  In response, Honduras invited Morocco to be an observer state in the Central American Integration System (SICA), the region’s eight-member political and economic organization.

Rabat – Security services at the Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca have arrested a South African and a Namibian with 3.7 kilograms of cocaine inside their stomachs. The two passengers were arrested on December 24 at Mohammed V airport when they arrived on a flight from Sao Paulo, Brazil, the Casablanca police department said in a statement on Tuesday. The passengers carried a total of 187 capsules of cocaine concealed inside their stomachs: 101 capsules in the South African and 86 in the Namibian. Police transported the two passengers to Ibn Rochd University Hospital Center in Casablanca to remove the cocaine from their stomachs. They are currently in custody for further investigation under the supervision of the prosecutor’s office. The arrests came a week after security services at the Mohammed V International Airport had arrested a sub-Saharan passenger with nearly 2 kilograms of cocaine inside her stomach. The arrested passenger had also arrived on a flight from Sao Paulo. On December 19, Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Intelligence (BCIJ) seized a boat loaded with cocaine in El Jadida, near Casablanca. On December 15, the BCIJ also found a farm in Boujdour, a city in the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region, used by a drug network for cocaine trafficking and storage. The operation followed the arrest of seven individuals in possession of one ton of cocaine earlier this month. The criminal network attempted to smuggle cocaine between Morocco, the US, Latin America, and Europe. In 2018, police seized 1.65 tons of cocaine, over 1.3 million psychotropic and ecstasy pills (up 43 percent over 2017), 52 tons of cannabis resin, and 693 kilograms of cannabis.

Rabat – The UK’s biggest import partner, Ireland, is planning to expand its diplomatic missions worldwide. The republic aims to open an embassy in Morocco by 2020. Ireland also plans to open diplomatic missions in Ukraine, the Philippines, India, Colombia, Chile, Jordan, Wales, and Los Angeles. The republic also opened missions in Vancouver, Canada, and Monrovia, Liberia, in 2018, according to Irish Times. The republic’s foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney told reporters, “Across the world we have about 80 diplomatic missions. Over the next few years that’s going to be over 100 as we expand.” He added that the operation to expand the republic’s diplomatic footprint is proceeding at “a pace that hasn’t happened since Independence and we are having to take on a lot more staff and spend more money.” Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) said that Ireland is currently one of the few EU member states without a diplomatic presence in North Africa. Ireland is represented in Morocco by its ambassador to Portugal, as well as by two honorary consuls in Agadir and Casablanca, added MAP. The UK’s decision to leave the EU, Brexit for short, has led to a myriad of diplomatic challenges. In 2016, the UK held a referendum to decide whether the country should exit or remain in the EU. At the poll, 51.9 percent voted to leave the EU, over 48.1 percent voting to remain. In Northern Ireland, 55.8 percent voted to remain in EU, while 44.2 percent voted for Brexit, according to the BBC.

Rabat – The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) has reported that 94 journalists were killed in 2018, an increase from 82 in 2017. The IFJ said in its annual report released Monday that the 94 journalists and mediaworkers died in targeted killings, bomb attacks, and crossfire incidents.  Afghanistan tops the list of dangerous countries to practice journalism, with 16 murders. Mexico witnessed 11 killings, followed by Yemen with 9, and Syria with 8. India had seven murders. Pakistan, Somalia, and the US witnessed five killings each. The Philippines, Ecuador, and Brazil had three killings each. Columbia, Palestine, and Guatemala had two each. IJF President Philippe Leruth commented on the killings of the journalists and the repercussions on journalism. “Journalists are targeted because they are witnesses,” Leruth was quoted by the Associated Press as saying. He added, “The result of this [is] when a journalist or many journalists are killed in a country, you see an increase of self-censorship.” The list “paints a situation of on-going safety crisis in journalism, which was highlighted by the cruel murder of the Washington Post columnist and Saudi national, Jamal Khashoggi,” IFJ introduced the report. Khashoggi, known for opposing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s policies, was killed by a team of Saudi agents in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on October 2. “Jamal Khashoggi was a very well-known figure, but you know, the most shocking statistic is that we know that nine of 10 journalist murders remain unpunished in the world,” the IFJ’s Leruth said. More than half of the journalists killed induring 2018 were “deliberately targeted.” 348 journalists in prison The media rights group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said on December 14 that “the deadly violence and abusive treatment of journalists show an unprecedented level of hostility towards media personnel.” RSF noted that 348 journalists are currently in prison and 60 are being held hostage. In the past two years, several Moroccan journalists have been prosecuted for expressing their opinions on certain laws or on human rights violations. Moroccan courts sentenced journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui to 3 years in prison over the Hirak Rif protests and journalist Taoufik Bouachrine to 12 years in prison for alleged sexual assault Another media rights group Committee to Protect Journalists, shared the same position as RSF.  It said in October that 324 journalists during the past decade had been “silenced through murder worldwide” and that no perpetrators had been convicted in more than 85 percent of those cases. In 2006, 155 killings were reported, the highest number since the IFJ began its annual count in 1990. In the three years prior to 2018, the numbers had been in decline.

Rabat – Egyptian police found four slaughtered bodies belonging to the same family in their apartment in Kafr El Sheikh, 134 km north of Cairo. Local police found the bodies of the wife and her daughter on the ground while the other two children’s bodies were slaughtered in their room, in the early hours of Tuesday.  An Egyptian doctor confessed he committed the murder of his wife, also a doctor, and three children aged 8, 6 and 4, respectively.  The 42-year old doctor said he had disputes with his wife, which caused him to “lose his temper and commit the murder.” The police arrested the suspect for further investigation. According to local media, the doctor said he strangled his wife with a “curtain rope” and stabbed her with a knife until he made sure she was dead before he stabbed his three children. He then seized his wife’s jewelry in an attempt to mislead police into believing it was a robbery crime.

Rabat – After the 2019 Finance Bill stipulated an increase in the domestic consumption tax on certain cigarette brands, the government said that new prices of cigarettes take effect on January 1. Marlboro Red Beyond and Marlboro Gold Beyond packs will be sold for MAD 35 instead of MAD 32. Price of all other cigarettes of the same brand Marlboro increased by MAD 2. Marquise Medium and Marquise Classic, the most widely-consumed cigarettes on the market, will be sold for MAD 21.5 instead of MAD 20. Other cigarettes brands such as “Casa” will be sold at MAD 20 instead of MAD 16, “Maghreb” for MAD 18, “Olympic KS” for MAD 20, and “More” for 18. The Moroccan Company of Tobacco (SMT) agreed to support government’s decision to increase tax on cigarettes. However, some tobacco companies in Morocco reportedly doubted the seriousness of the  2019 Finance Bill analysis, which, according to them, will aid in creating a market for smuggled tobacco. According to Article 5 of the 2019 Finance Bill, the minimum tax rate will increase from MAD 567 to MAD 630 per 1,000 cigarettes, while the minimum tax burden will increase from 53.6 percent to 58 percent. Morocco received MAD 10.48 billion from the domestic consumption tax in 2017, up from MAD 9.86 billion in 2016, according to customs administration. In October, Minister of Economy Mohamed Benchaaboun stated that the bill’s increase of taxes on tobacco consumption will generate additional revenue, estimated at MAD 1.2 billion in 2019. The 2019 Finance Bill also included raising domestic consumption taxes on shisha tobacco from MAD 350 to MAD 450 per kilogram.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani met a number of Brazilian MPs and diplomatic representatives Monday at the Moroccan Embassy in Brasilia. El Othmani is in Brazil to represent King Mohammed VI at the presidential inauguration ceremony of the new Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, taking place January 1. During the meetings, the officials discussed ways to strengthen bilateral relations and spoke about major reform projects implemented by Morocco, state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. “This meeting with representatives of both chambers of Congress and Brazilian decision-making centres is very important as it provided an opportunity to review the quality of bilateral ties,” El Othmani told MAP. The head of government indicated that both countries show “a willingness to develop these relations for the better in the economic, political and trade fields between the two peoples”. “There is a need to further develop the strong relationship between our two countries,” El Othmani stressed. Diplomatic relations between Morocco and Brazil started in 1906 after Brazil appointed consul in Tangier in 1890. Brazil is Morocco’s third largest customer and trade between the two countries is important, according to El Othmani. El Othmani praised the adoption, by a majority of Brazilian MPs, of a parliamentary motion which supports Morocco’s efforts to reach a mutually agreed upon solution to the Western Sahara conflict. El Otmani also met with chairman of the Brazilian Senate’s Foreign Relations and National Defence Committee (CRE), Fernando Collor. Collor welcomed the Kingdom’s participation in the inauguration ceremony of Brazil’s new president, saying, it is “an illustration of the solidity of bilateral relations”. El Othmani also met some Brazilian MPs and representatives of Arab and African ambassadors to Brasilia. Bolsonaro was elected president on October 28 2018 as president of the Federative Republic of Brazil. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, the Israeli and Hungarian prime ministers, Benjamin Netanyahu and Viktor Orban will be present at Tuesday’s inauguration of Brazil’s new far-right president. Bolsonaro pledged to move the Brazilian embassy in Israel to Jerusalem after he won president elections. He wants closer business and technology ties with Israel. “As previously stated during our campaign, we intend to transfer the Brazilian Embassy from Tel-Aviv to Jerusalem. Israel is a sovereign state and we shall duly respect that,” he said.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Culture and Communication said Moroccan news outlets received MAD 71 million in 2018. According to the ministry’s press release, more regional and local newspapers received support in 2018 than 2017. The ministry also began supporting online news outlets. Seventy-six press agencies received direct support, including 60 newspaper and 16 online news outlets. Out of the total, twelve were party-owned newspapers and 16 were regional platforms. To comply with the Constitution’s guarantee of freedom of thought, opinion, and expression, the ministry said it “supports press agencies and enhances their professionalism.” Article 28 of the Constitution guarantees the free and unrestricted practice of press freedom. However, the 2018 Annual Freedom of the Press report published in April ranked Morocco 135th in the world for press freedom, citing alleged “strong judicial pressure on journalists.” The ministry commented that Morocco has a diversity of media ownership structures and full freedom to print and distribute newspapers and online content.  The press release concluded that, in 2018, the media sector continued to be tax exempt.  In the past two years, several Moroccan journalists have been prosecuted for expressing their opinions on certain laws or on human rights violations. Moroccan courts sentenced journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui to 3 years in prison over the Hirak Rif protests and journalist Taoufik Bouachrine to 12 years in prison for alleged sexual assault.

Rabat – On Saturday, December 30, Chinese authorities closed three mosques in southwestern where the Hui Muslims live. South China Morning Post said that the mosques were closed as they were “illegally established and conducted illegal religious education.” The news outlet added that the shutdown of mosques in Weishan comes  after several crackdowns against Muslims against Muslims mosques in Ningxia and Gansu. Throughout the year,  Chinese authorities expanded detention of Uighur Muslims in China’s Xinjiang province. Authorities justified the mass internment by saying that they were simply intended to bring the Muslim Uighur people into a “modern, civilized” world. In a report that the submitted by the UN, over a million Uighurs are currently detained in what the government calls “re-education camps.” The Chinese government also imposed legal penalties targeting Muslims in China, a ban on both women wearing headscarves and the religious instruction of children. The government of the western Chinese province of Xinjiang  said that tat any Muslims who think alcohol, cigarettes or dancing are forbidden need to be arrested. A 2018  report from the Humans Rights Watch stated that the “ government restricts religious practice to five officially recognized religions in officially approved religious premises, and the Chinese government retain control over religious bodies’ personnel appointments, publications, finances, and seminary applications.” In response, a group of Muslim Uighurs recorded a video to cry for help from scholars, activists and journalists.. “Muslim countries have economic and political interests, that is why official news outlets pay no mind to this case. That is why scholars and organizations must at least deliver this message to all muslims,” a man representing the community said in the video.

Rabat – Moroccan citizens can continue to apply for registration in the “Tayssir” (Facilitation) program which provides funding for parents to enroll children in schools, until Monday, January 7. The education ministry had set the deadline for registration as December 22 but decided to postpone it at the request of a student-parent association. According to the minister’s communique, the extension period will also allow citizens to apply for the Medical Insurance Plan for the Financially Underprivileged (RAMED). Moroccan applicants can register by filling in an application form and attaching their own ID cards and the children’s birth certificates. The Tayssir program is one of the government’s efforts to facilitate access to education for all children and reduce the dropout rate. Tayssir provides parents cash payments to formally enroll children aged 6 to 15 in school.   In July, Amzazi said that he wants to reduce the rate of school drop-outs from 5.7 percent in rural primary schools to 1 percent by 2024-2025. According to a December 2018 report from Morocco’s National Observatory for Human Development (ONDH), 93 percent of 6 to 11-year-olds were enrolled in primary schools in 2017. Enrollment rates dropped off for older children. Only 61 percent of 12 to 14-year-olds were enrolled in secondary school in 2017. For high school, only 37 percent of 15 to 17-year-olds were enrolled.
 The education ministry also wants to increase Tayssir’s beneficiaries from 700,000 to 2.1 million beneficiaries

Rabat – Achraf Hakimi, a Moroccan Atlas Lion, is the fastest footballer in the German league with a speed of 35.10 kilometers per hour, according to Kicker. Second in the list is Kai Havertz with 35.02 kilometers, while the third is Konrad Laimer with 34.97 kilometers per hour. The 20-year-old defender has been making a strong impact in the Bundesliga with his team, Borussia Dortmund. He joined the team in July 2018 on a loan from Real Madrid. The team, however, wants to secure a permanent contract with the young player. Hakimi won a second Bundesgliga Rookie of the Month award in December. In December, the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) ranked Hakimi as the top fullback in the European leagues in the last three months. He outperformed several stars with a score of 85.3. Hakimi was also ranked among Europe’s 50 most promising under 20 footballers in February, according to CIES.

Rabat – 2018 was a year full of big events in Morocco that  impacted the political, social, and economic aspects of Moroccans’ lives. The events from 2018 listed below were major news in Morocco. Many Moroccans started a national campaign on April 20 to boycott three major companies in Morocco: Centrale Danone dairy, Sidi Ali bottled water, and Afriquia gas stations. The campaign aimed to speak out against rising commodity prices.  The boycott lasted through the spring and early summer and negatively impacted the earnings of the companies it targeted. The main actor in the Moroccan dairy sector, Centrale Danone, experienced the largest loss this year. In September, Central Danone, which was the company most responsive to the campaign, decided to cut milk prices by 30 centimes, selling a 470-milliliter milk carton at MAD 3.20 instead of MAD 3.50. After 20 years of not qualifying for the FIFA World Cup, the Moroccan team participated in 2018 World Cup in Russia (June 14-July 15) bringing joy and enthusiasm to Moroccan fans. Unfortunately, Moroccans did not achieve full happiness because the Atlas Lions were eliminated in the group stage. Morocco was placed in Group C which included Iran and two strong teams: Spain and Portugal. However, the Moroccan team played great games in the last two matches against Portugal and Spain after losing the first match to Iran (0-1) with an own goal.  FIFA used video assistant referee (VAR) technology for the first time in the 2018 World Cup. Several football teams and fans were not satisfied with the “unjust” use of VAR throughout the Russia tournament due to the alleged mistakes referees made in using VAR. Morocco complained that VAR was not used to judge fouls in Morocco’s favor in its Portugal game (0-1), but the technology was used to allow an equalizer for Spain in Morocco’s last game (2-2). One day before the start of the 2018 World Cup games, Morocco lost its bid to host FIFA’s 2026 World Cup disappointing many Moroccans. Only 65 countries voted for Morocco’s bid to the 134 countries which voted for the United (North American) bid at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow. Many Moroccans were surprised that some Arab countries—Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Jordan, Iraq, Bahrain, and Lebanon—voted against Morocco. Morocco, however, was able to count on the support of Algeria, Tunisia, Qatar, Syria, Egypt, Palestine, Yemen, and Oman. On June 26, the judge of Casablanca’s Appeals Court pronounced sentences in the case of 53 detained Hirak Rif activists. The Hirak Rif leader, Nasser Zefzafi, received 20 years in prison. Other leaders of the protest movement, such as Nabil Ahemjik, El Boustati, and Samir Ghid, received the same heavy sentence. The court sentenced dozens of other Hirak activists to between 1 and 15 years in prison. The court convicted most of the activists of “undermining the internal security of the state” and “preparing a conspiracy against internal security,” following their participation in protests which broke out in the northern Al Hoceima province in 2016 and 2017.   Many citizens condemned the sentences because they found them “very heavy and unfair.” Zefzafi was also selected as one of the three finalists of the EU’s Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. On August 20, the Moroccan Council of Ministers approved a draft bill to reintroduce mandatory military service. The delegate minister in charge of the National Defense Administration, Abdellatif Loudiyi, introduced the bill, saying it aims to “promote the spirit of sacrifice and self denial.”  Many Moroccan youth and activists opposed “the legislative speed” which accelerated the ministerial council’s approval of Bill 44.18 “unlike other more important laws that have not been adopted yet.” Some Moroccan intellectuals stressed the need for the government to open public dialogue to discuss all aspects surrounding the mandatory military service. However, the government did not hold public hearings on the bill. On December 26,  the House of Representatives in Parliament passed Law 44.18 at a plenary session. The bill has not yet been passed in the upper house. Both men and women aged 19 to 25 would be subject to 12 months of military service. Beginning in September 2019, 10,000 young people are expected to begin service in the military each year. September 12, 2018, was a historic day for Moroccan women, as the Moroccan court implemented Law 103-13 on eliminating violence against women. It took the government six years of consultation and public debate to pass the law published in the official gazette in February 2018. The law then went into effect on September 12. The law on the elimination of violence against women provides women the ability to file complaints of sexual harassment and ensures harassers receive harsher punishments. According to the law, people who sexually harass in public spaces, by use of words, acts or signals of a sexual nature for sexual purposes, can receive prison sentences ranging from one to six months and fines from MAD 2,000 to 10,000. Perpetrators of cybercrime, such as sexual blackmail, could face one to three years in prison and a fine ranging from MAD 1,000 to 20,000 if found guilty. Moroccan women have expressed positive feelings about the law, which defines any act of violence and harassment as a crime. But for some activists, the implications of the law are still vague since women do not know exactly what they should do if they are harassed. The activists assert that the “law has to put into place the implementing mechanisms.” On October 16, a train heading to Kenitra from Casablanca derailed in Bouknadel, near Rabat, at about 10:30 in the morning.  The accident killed 7 people, including the train’s engineer, and injured at least 125 people. After an investigation, the public prosecutor of Sale’s Court of First Instance blamed the driver for going 158 kilometers per hour. Many Moroccans expressed rage against ONCF, Morocco’s state-owned railway company, blaming it for the accident after a recording of a conversation between ONCF employees blaming faulty tracks, improper signage, and speeding went viral. On October 26, the government adopted Draft Decree 2.18.855, adding 60 minutes to the standard time in Morocco, moving Morocco to GMT+1 year-round. The government adopted the change overnight, only two days before Morocco was set to turn back the clocks one hour with the end of Daylight Saving Time (DST) October 28.  The government’s last-minute decision to maintain GMT+1 year-round was based on “an evaluation study.” The decision, which according to the government was “a sovereign decision,” angered many Moroccan people who raised questions about whether a study was ever conducted. Many Moroccans took to social media to reject the move and express their worries about the long-term effects of the decision. On October 31, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2440 which extended the mandate of the UN mission, MINURSO, in Western Sahara for 6 months for the second time since 2008. The mandate had traditionally been extended for 12 months.  The resolution mentioned Algeria for the first time since 2002 and since the start of the political process in the Western Sahara conflict. For the first time since 2012, the four parties in the conflict took part in a roundtable discussion. Morocco, Algeria, Polisario, and Mauritania all participated in the Geneva round-table December 5-6 to discuss a framework for negotiations.  In an unprecedented speech, King Mohammed VI showed a willingness to open the border with Algeria with “no need for third-party mediation.” On the 43rd anniversary of the Green March on November 6, the King expressed Morocco’s readiness for “direct and frank dialogue with Algeria to settle the transient and objective differences impeding the development of relations between the two countries.” He suggested the countries set up a joint political mechanism for dialogue and consultation. Many international officials ,such as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and former US Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley, lauded King Mohammed VI’s call. The African Union also praised the King’s offer. Countries like the US, Spain, France, the UAE, Qatar, Jordan, and Tunisia all backed Morocco’s dialogue initiative. However, Algeria has not officially responded to the King’s dialogue offer yet. Several sources from Algeria spoke anonymously about the Moroccan offer to the press. One anonymous source said that King Mohammed VI’s offer is “questionable” and “not sincere.” On November 15, King Mohammed VI and French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated Africa’s first high speed train (LGV) in Morocco, named Al-Boraq. The high speed train links Tangier and Casablanca in two hours and 10 minutes instead of the normal five-hour train ride. The train also makes stops in Kenitra and Rabat. The trip from Tangier to Kenitra now takes 50 minutes, while the trip from Tangier to Rabat takes 80 minutes. Morocco received loans from several countries, foreign companies, and financial institutions to construct the LGV, which cost €2 billion. Morocco’s railway company, ONCF, set promotion prices for passengers under certain conditions. Some Moroccans and MPs opposed the LGV, saying the country has more important priorities. They stressed the need to improve the already existing railway network and trains. They also called on the government and ONCF to extend the railway network to other parts of Morocco in the south and southeast. On November 21,  the French Arianespace satellite launching company launched into orbit the new Mohammed VI-B satellite from the Vega Launch Complex in Kourou, French Guiana. The Mohammed VI-B is the second satellite of Morocco’s Mohammed VI – A and B program to orbit. Mohammed VI-A was launched in 2017 and cost €500 million. The Mohammed VI-B satellite is capable of taking up to 1,000 images per day with a resolution of up to 70 centimeters and will be circulating in the same orbit as the first satellite, 620 kilometers above the earth. The satellite will be mainly used for mapping, surveillance, and agricultural activities. It will help with “prevention and management of natural disasters, monitoring changes in the environment and desertification, as well as border and coastal surveillance.” Unfortunately, 2018 ended with a horrible double murder after terrorists murdered two young Scandinavian women near Imlil, 90 kilometers south of Marrakech in the Atlas Mountains.  The crime took place on December 17 against Danish tourist Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Norwegian tourist Maren Ueland who came to the area to camp near Mount Toubkal. Shocked and horrified by the act of terror, Moroccans condemned the murder and expressed sympathy for the victims’ families on social media, on the streets, and in front of the Norwegian and Danish embassies in Morocco. Moroccan authorities have arrested 23 suspects in connection with the murder. The first four appeared in a video online pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Police arrested the latest suspect, a man of dual Swiss and Spanish citizenship, on December 29. According to a statement from the general prosecutor, 15 suspects in the Imlil murder appeared before the investigating judge at Rabat’s Court of Appeals on December 30.

In ten months, a young Moroccan man has cycled across thirteen African countries, arriving in Gabon in December, where two locals, impressed by his sense of adventure, filmed a video of him.  In the video, the cyclist, Yassine, arrives with his bicycle in the middle of a Gabonese forest and starts chatting with two local men who were curious to know more about his unordinary journey. Yassine left Morocco on March 8, 2018, to pedal through the African continent. Throughout his journey, Yassine says he only uses a tent to sleep. Before reaching Gabon, the cyclist had passed through Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Benin, Niger, Nigeria, and Cameroon.  In the video, which quickly went viral, Yassine says his next African destination will be Congo-Brazzaville. Yassine’s adventure allowed him to meet and make friends with the two Gabonese locals who considered him a “brother.”  One of them says in the video: “This is a marvellous adventure … Do you know Moroccan and Gabonese people are brothers?” mentioning King Mohammed VI and Gabonese President Ali Bongo’s friendship. Yassine’s story is similar to that of another Moroccan man who cycled from Morocco to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The 58-year-old Moroccan, Mohammed Rbouhate, challenged himself to complete the Hajj pilgrimage by bicycle.

Rabat – Moroccans represent the largest number of migrants who crossed the western Mediterranean route to Spain in 2018, according to EFE. Guineans and Malians were also among the largest numbers of immigrants who crossed using the westerly route. Quoting recent statistics from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Spanish news outlets reported that 31 percent of those who entered Spain irregularly were from Morocco. About 20 percent of the irregular migrants were from Guinea, while 16 percent were from Mali. In December, the  Spanish Ministry of the Interior said that in the first 10 months of 2018, 10,060 irregular Moroccan migrants had arrived in Spain, up from 1,310 in the same period in 2016. The number of Moroccans who want to reach Spain may increase. A new study by Gallup estimated that Morocco would lose 19 percent of its adult population and 29 percent of its 15 to 29-year-old if migration were an option. Spain has been complaining about irregular migration, seeking help from Morocco’s border security to curb the flow of migrants. However, Morocco has also become a final destination for some migrants. Last month, the European Commission announced that the European Union would deliver €148 million to Morocco on the migration front. “The EU is intensifying its support to Morocco to address irregular migration in response to increased migratory pressure along the Western Mediterranean Route,” the commission said.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Human Rights has firmly rejected Amnesty International’s  recent analysis of a trial in a Casablanca court which sentenced 53 people involved in the Hirak protests in 2016 and 2017 in Al Hoceima province. The court handed four activists heavy sentences of 20, including the prominent leader of the movement, Nasser Zefzafi. Amnesty said in its analysis of the trial on December 17 that it had“serious flaws.” “The first trial proceedings resulted in a gross miscarriage of justice,” said Amnesty’s Middle East and North Africa Director Heba Morayef in a statement, ahead of the appeal hearing set for December 17. In a statement from the Moroccan ministry yesterday, authorities “expressed their absolute rejection of the statement made by the organization because of its lack of objectivity and neutrality.” The statement added that the analysis did not comply with the organization’s international standards. The ministry said that Moroccan authorities are “very surprised” by Amnesty’s position that “Morocco’s judicial authorities must ensure the appeal trial does not descend into another charade marred by torture complaints and other fair trial violations.”  The ministry said that the position is “blatant interference” and a “clear violation of the most basic international standards.” Morocco’s Ministerial Commission on Human Rights will issue a detailed response to Amnesty’s allegations in the coming week.

By Mohamed Hikal Rabat – Moroccan mountaineer Bouchra Baibanou has become the first Moroccan to complete the “Seven Summit” challenge, climbing the seven continents’ tallest peaks.   The first Moroccan woman to summit Mount Everest Baibanou completed the seven summits with Antarctica’s Vinson Massif. She shared pictures of her accomplishment on Saturday, December 29, to celebrate the end of the year. “So proud to reach the summit of Vinson in Antarctica and finish the project seven summit. I hope to inspire others that the dream can be fulfilled. After 8 years I closed the challenge and became the first Moroccan to climb seven summit.” “Thanks to my family, my friends, my sponsors, to all who supported me,” Bouchra commented on one of the photos she shared on Facebook. She posted another photo documenting her arrival in Punta Arenas, the southernmost city of Chile from where she flew to Union Glacier in Antarctica prior to her Vinson Massif challenge. Bouchra Baibanou celebrated the end of her Vinson Massif mission with another picture bearing the caption: “Vinson’s team in Union Glacier waiting for the flight back to Punta Arenas.” Before heading to Antarctica, Baibanou gave a press conference in Casablanca, saying she would climb the massif “to prove that dreams can come true [if you] just believe in it and have the will. With a lot of perseverance [and] determination, I am pursuing my dream to climb Mount Vinson, the highest peak in Antarctica, and to be the first in Morocco to realize the ‘Seven Summits’ challenge.” Vinson Massif is the highest summit in Antarctica with an altitude of 4,892 meters. A US navy airplane discovered Vinson Massif in 1958.

Rabat – The spokesperson of the Federal Department of Justice and Police (FDJP) in Switzerland, Anne-Florence Debois, commented on the arrest of a Swiss-Spanish suspect in the murder of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway, whose bodies were found near Imlil, Morocco, on December 17. Debois told Swiss  press that the suspect had a criminal record in Geneva between 2007 and 2013 for robbery, damage of property, drugs, aggression, and domestic violence. The man converted to Islam, became radicalized and left Switzerland. He moved to Morocco in 2015. Debois said that Fedpol, the Swiss police, are in continuous contact with their partners in Switzerland and  abroad “to make the necessary clarifications and facilitate all exchanges of information in the case.” Switzerland’s Public Ministry of the Confederation said that the investigation is “in the hands of the authorities of the territory in which the crime was committed.” Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested the suspect of dual nationality on December 28. The suspect allegedly taught other suspects in the murder how to commit the crime. BCIJ has arrested 22 suspects in connection to the crime. In a statement on Sunday, December 30, the general prosecutor said that 15 suspects appeared before the investigating judge that morning. The other seven suspects will appear before the judge in the coming days, added the statement. BCIJ is still investigating possible links to additional suspects. Four of the arrested suspects appeared pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi last month. But the suspects did not coordinate with ISIS before committing the crime, according to Moroccan authorities.
