Rabat – After leading Ajax Amsterdam to a major win over AZ Alkmaar (3-0), the Moroccan attacker Hakim Ziyech received the Ajax Amsterdam “Player of the Year” award, for his excellent season, skills and performance. At the reception following the match, Hakim declared that the award took him by surprise. Erik Ten Hag, Ajax Amsterdam’s manager expressed his ultimate satisfaction with Ziyech: “Hakim is an artist on the field” has declared Erik, “I would want nothing more than to keep him for Ajax.” Ziyech has confirmed his will to leave Ajax Amsterdam for an unknown destination, with hopes of exploring himself, as he has stated “I think I’m ready to leave, I’ve said it many times, it’s not new. I want to challenge myself and develop myself, so maybe it’s time to go further and find a new challenge.” Numerous European clubs are interested in recruiting the Moroccan footballer, including, Inter Milan and AS Rome. The two Italian clubs have been monitoring Ziyech’s performance and considering signing him since last winter. However, the two clubs’ hopes of recruiting the attacker failed, as his value is predicted to rise in a notable way after the Russian World Cup. The Italian club Inter Milan has been in negotiation with Ajax, since the fourth quarter of 2016, as the board members have made an offer of 15 EU million to hire Ziyech. Other European countries have expressed their intentions in recruiting the talented player, namely, Liverpool, Dortmund, and Marseille. In terms of statistics, the talented Atlas Lion, known for his technique in dribbling and free kick ability, has scored nine goals and 15 assists this season. In total, Ziyech has scored 19 goals with Ajax since his debut with the club in 2016. With those kind of stats, there’s reason to wonder: will Ziyech be crowned Netherlands best player of the year?

Rabat- The US-based private equity firm Carlyle, is suing the Moroccan government for over USD 400 million in the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), claiming the sum is equivalent to the profit  lost when Morocco’s sole refinery went bankrupt three years ago, Moroccan media outlet Medias24 reported.  On January 30, 2018, the Carlyle Group accused Morocco of “violating the terms of the free trade agreement” concluded in 2004 with the United States. In a notice addressed to the head of government, the group claimed that the firm’s “investments were directly impaired” by “wrongful actions undertaken by the Moroccan government.” 
For the time being, no request has been filed, as the Carlyle Group said it “hopes to engage in good faith negotiations with the Moroccan government to reach an amicable settlement of the dispute.”   Nevertheless, “if a resolution of this dispute is not quickly achieved, the Carlyle Entities intend to submit their claims to the arbitration of ICSID,” where they intend to claim a compensation greater than USD 400 million, to recover the unfulfilled commitments made by the SAMIR (Société Anonyme Marocaine de l’Industrie du Raffinage), which was once a flagship of the refining industry in Morocco before it shut down.  In 2015, the Moroccan government seized the SAMIR refinery after it charged the company USD 1.35 billion in unpaid taxes. Faced with new financial struggles from the 2014-2015 oil price crash, SAMIR, which operated the refinery in Mohammedia, was forced to cease production and was liquidated in 2016. According to the statement, the US investment fund accuses the Moroccan government for the “transfer,” “seizure,” and the “collection” of crude oil and refined petroleum products, belonging to Carlyle Group, that were stored in the tanks of the SAMIR refinery. Carlyle’s Long-Lasting Battle to Recover the USD 400 Million After the Court of Appeal of the Casablanca Commercial Court decided SAMIR’s final judicial liquidation in 2016, the company struggled to proceed and asked for several extensions for the liquidation process. The company has repeatedly insisted that the plant needs to restart production so creditors, including the Carlyle Group, can gradually recoup the money (USD 600 million), which the refinery had secured from them before its closure.  It is believed that SAMIR’s collapse left some of the world’s biggest trading firms, including Carlyle, with unpaid debts of over USD 1 billion. As of spring 2017, several foreign investors expressed interest in purchasing the troubled refinery. The Swiss giant Glencore and the Carlyle Group teamed up to bid on the Samir refinery, in hopes of recovering about USD 600 million in losses stemming from the SAMIR shutdown, but to no avail.  A few days later, the Carlyle Group decided to file suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, against insurer MS Amlin, previously known as Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Underwriting, after the company refused to cover the losses.   Carlyle Commodity Management, a subsidiary of Carlyle Group formerly known as Vermillion Asset Management, told the court that it holds about 7 million barrels of crude and oil products stored at the refinery and that SAMIR had emptied these holdings without the notifying and obtaining the consent of the private equity firm in 2015.  In January 2016, the Carlyle Group first filed for insurance coverage from MS Amlin, after concluding that the oil could not be recovered. The insurers denied coverage and explained in court documents that Carlyle was a lender and did not actually own the oil it claimed was lost and therefore was not entitled to insurance coverage.  MS Amlin also accused Carlyle of not properly mitigating its alleged losses, citing it a breach of their contractual duty. Now the Carlyle Group has taken its disagreement to court and formally accused MS Amlin of going back on its agreement to cover losses, as shown in court documents cited by Reuters. The dispute is still ongoing. According to the Wall Street Journal, Carlyle Group has already spent USD 5 million in legal and professional fees recover the money lost in the Moroccan oil refinery deal, adding that this deal “highlights the risks US investors face in emerging markets that have unfamiliar investor-protection laws.”

Rabat – The Kuwaiti Ministry of Foreign Affairs reaffirmed on Sunday Kuwait’s principled and firm stance on Morocco’s territorial integrity and the importance of solving the Sahara issue within the framework of the kingdom’s sovereignty. An official source at the Foreign Ministry said that Kuwait’s stance on the issue has remained unchanged and that “Morocco’s Sahara” is the term adopted as part of the discourse of Kuwait’s foreign policy, Kuwait news agency (KUNA) reported. The Kuwaiti official cited Kuwait’s support to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2414, which passed last Friday, KUNA added. The press communiqué sets the record straight less than 24 hours after Kuwait’s delegate to the United Nations said his country support the rights of “the Saharawi people to self-determination.” Kuwait “reaffirms its full support for the personal envoy of the UN Secretary General for Western Sahara, Horst Köhler, for a fair and acceptable solution for both sides, guaranteeing the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination,” said the Kuwaiti delegate. This statement raised eyebrows in Morocco and was perceived as sign of Kuwait support for the Polisario. The Security Council adopted resolution 2421 on Friday, extending MINURSO’s mandate for six months and reaffirming the preeminence of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan in the steps toward resolution. In this resolution, the Security Council also expressed its concern with the presence of the Polisario Front in the buffer strip in Guerguerat and called for its immediate withdrawal.

Her father is Fouad Filali, whose father, Abdellatif Filali, was former Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister.

Rabat – Moroccan activist, professor, and head of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU) Nabila Mounib has broken her silence on the media campaign aimed at spreading awareness among Moroccans about the high cost of certain products in the country. The campaign, launched last week, has been spreading its influence among Moroccan people, officials, and politicians, about the high prices of Sidi Ali (bottled water), Afriquia (gasoline) and Centrale Laitière (dairy products). In a recent party meeting, Mounib heavily criticized the “exorbitant prices” of the aforementioned products.  According to Mounib, people behind the campaign are “young people, who have a great political conscience and know what is happening in the country” and are looking forward to shifting the monopoly exercised by some companies.  Referring to the Sidi Ali company, managed by CGEM standing CEO Meriem Bensaleh, Mounib criticized the Bensaleh for poor quality products.  “The family takes advantage of the mineral and aerated waters and sells them to Moroccans at exorbitant prices with a plastic of bad quality,” she said. Announcing her full support to the campaign, Mounib said: “We should end the monopoly of companies in order to have a competitive economy and lower prices of goods.” Mounib’s message followed statements by public officials, including Nabil Benabdellah, former Minister of Housing and Urban Policy and Secretary General of the Party of Progress and Socialism; and Nizar Baraka, President of the Social Economic and Environmental Council, former Minister of Economy and Finance, and head of the Istiqlal Party. Both officials voiced their support for the campaign, describing it as a call for change. Benabdellah also linked the campaign with the Jerada, Al Hoceima, and Zagora protests, which erupted in Morocco in 2016, 2017, and 2018, calling on the government to meet social demands of citizens. Baraka has also commented on the campaign, calling on the government to listen to the message conveyed by the boycott, rather than looking for the people behind the campaign. “The important thing is not to know who is behind the campaign, but rather to understand the message conveyed.” Boycott Outcomes Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum reported today that Afriquia gas, owned by Moroccan Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (and Forbes’s richest man in Morocco) Aziz Akhannouch, has lost MAD 15 million since the launch of the boycott on April 21.  According to the newspaper, the Afriquia gas stations, typically found alongside Marjane and Acima supermarkets across the country, lost between 25 and 45 percent of its daily revenue. In Nador, Afriquia gas station lost 47 percent of revenue, while in Casablanca, the company lost 39 percent. The Afriquia headquarters in Casablanca did not respond to MWN’s request for verify of the reported statistics. Akhannouch already expressed his opinion regarding the campaign at the ongoing International Agriculture Fair (SIAM), currently held in Meknes. Akhannouch announced his support to Central Laitière for dairy products and said that internet campaign cannot stop 470,000 employees in the dairy sector. Furthermore, he reprimanded citizens, saying they should be thankful for the fact that there are no milk shortages and the product is available throughout the year. Moroccan Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Boussaid has also denounced the campaign, emphasizing that “We must encourage Moroccan companies and products, unlike some fools who call for a boycott of Moroccan companies.” The boycott remains ongoing throughout the country. The boycotted companies have not yet released any official response.

Rabat – Despite being listed as one of the top 50 most promising under-20 players in Europe, Achraf Hakimi might not be on French coach Zinedine Zidane’s list of Real Madrid players for the upcoming season. According to Spanish media Mundo Deportivo, the Moroccan player apparently did not convince Zidane of his value.  The coach is seriously thinking about replacing Hakimi, when his contract end in June. “He did not feel comfortable in his position on the side and showed some inaccuracies, especially in defense,” said the newspaper which closely followed Hakimi’s performance during the Real Madrid-Bayern Munich (2-1) match at the Bernabéu. “Achraf is here, he is a very young player, his first year with the first team. We must go slowly with him, we will see what we do Tuesday,” said Zidane after the game. According to the same source, the Real Madrid’s coach may choose to replace Hakimi with Lucas Vasquez in the right-back position against Bayern-Munich on Tuesday. Despite his recent performance, the footballer delivered a great performance with the Atlas Lions during the 2018 World Cup Qualifiers, and is highly likely to be among the players who will represent Morocco in the World Cup next summer. The Moroccan sensation made his official debut at the Santiago Bernabeu on October 1, when Real Madrid’s key defender Dani Carvajal couldn’t play due to injury.  The footballer netted his first goal for his Spanish team on December 10 against Sevilla, becoming the first Moroccan ever to score for Real Madrid. Hakimi is very proud of being able to play with one of the best football teams in the world. In October, the young athlete told beIN Sports “I am very happy to play with the best team in the world.”  He also expressed his gratitude to Los Blancos’ coach Zidane for selecting him to play in decisive games in La Liga.

Rabat – Morocco’s Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, passed a social initiative called “Moumk’In” for The Empowerment of Young People as a part of the national plan for the promotion of employment, according to a press release. This document was signed, on one hand, by the State, represented by the Ministries of the Interior, Economy and Finance; National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education and Scientific Research; and Labor and Professional Integration; and, on the other hand, by the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM) and the Association of Regional Councils. “Moumk’in” aspires to set up tools and devices for job seekers, especially among young people, to shift mentalities and behaviors in society and to meet the challenge of employment, which faces many countries of the world in the present moment. Through this new initiative, the government hopes to provide to job seekers with the tools to acquire the required skills and professional demeanor to facilitate their entry into the world of work. Entrepreneurship is increasingly becoming a priority in government action, as it implements a gradual rise in the mechanisms of pre- and post-creation support for entrepreneurs and measures facilitating access to finance, particularly in the context of advanced regionalization. “Moumk’In” promises to create a Regional Center of Employment and Skills Development before 2021,  “which will pilot the regional programs for improvements in employability and support for the self-employed, the observation of the regional employment market, and capacity building and creation for regional employment actors, including those of civil society.” This project will span from 2018-2021, working to achieve the job creation potential, which has been identified at 1,200,000 opportunities in the context of sectoral strategies and plans.

Rabat – Commenting on the adoption of Resolution 2414 by the UN Security Council on Western Sahara, Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Omar Hilale urged Algeria to shoulder its responsibility in the conflict.   The Algeria-backed Polisario Front “has been clearly” rebuked by the international community because of multiple provocative actions aimed at hindering the UN mediation on the Western Sahara conflict,” he said.  Speaking at a press conference at the UN headquarters in New York, Hilale said the United Nations executive body used strict and precise language in reaction to the recent maneuvers of the Algerian-backed Polisario Front.  Hilale added that the resolution validated Morocco’s grave concerns over the destabilizing situation east of Morocco’s defense wall. “The executive body of the United Nations has used extremely strong language against the Polisario separatists, in order to put an end to these serious provocations in these two areas,” said Hilale, adding that the Security Council tackled the situation in a “firm and responsible” manner. According to Hilal, the resolution represents a “frank and strong” support for Morocco’s key requests: urging the Polisario Front to withdraw from Guerguerat buffer zone and, secondly, more productive involvement from Algeria in the process to end the conflict. The Security Souncil on Friday put heavy pressure on the Polisario Front, urging it to withdraw immediately from the Guerguerate and  to refrain from relocating parts of its administrative facilities from Algeria’s Tindouf camps to Bir Lahlou, east of Morocco’s defense wall.  Those actions, according to the Security Council, will hinder the stability and the legal status of the region. Recalling the United Nations and Security Council’s recent warnings addressed to Polisario, Hilal said that the unanimous UN reactions underscore the Security Council’s firm rejection of any attempts by the Polisario to change “the realities on the ground.” “The Council now considers [those attempts] to be a violation of the ceasefire, and a serious threat to the political process that the Secretary General’s Personal Envoy, Horst Köhler, is actively engaged in relaunching,” he said. The Polisario Front’s actions have reignited tensions in the region, which led Morocco to step up its rhetoric and to threaten to take military actions in the case the UN failed to shoulder its responsibility.   Following the adoption of the new Security Council resolution on Friday, the Polisario Front has now been left with no choice: “Either they comply with the demands of the Security Council and withdraw, or own the serious consequences that will result from their unlawful actions,” Hilale told the press. The Moroccan official also expressed his satisfaction with (always satisfaction with not over, disappointed with not over)  the Security Council’s decision to call on Algeria to shoulder its responsibility and to cooperate in finding a mutually acceptable political solution to end the conflict. “The Council has asked it [Algeria], in a new paragraph, to increase its commitment to the negotiation process and to fulfill its special and essential role in supporting the political process,” he added.

On Tuesday, the world of football was stunned to learn of the death of former Atlas Lions’ coach Henri Michel after a long battle with cancer. King Mohammed VI addressed a letter of condolence to Michel’s family and the world of football. The King also paid tribute to the sporting legacy of the late footballer, who left his mark on the French and world football scenes. King Mohammed VI’s Brazzaville Visit

King Mohammed VI landed on Saturday night in Brazzaville, the Republic of Congo to attend the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Climate Commission and the Blue Fund of the Congo Basin, taking place on Sunday. During his official visit, the King will also chair a signing ceremony of several investment agreements in various fields, including health, education, mining and agriculture. During the opening of the symposium, the King recalled the challenges that hinder the full development of the continent.
Security Council’s Resolution on Western Sahara Morocco’s leading newspapers, including Al Massae, Assabah and Akhbar Al Yaoum in addition to Moroccan online news sources, have all reported on United Nations Resolution 2414 related to Western Sahara. On Friday, the UN Security Council adopted the resolution which extended the mandate of the UN mission, known as MINURSO, for six more months. The resolution also put significant pressure on the Polisario Front following their repeated illegal activities east Morocco’s defense wall. Morocco’s Renewable Energy Sector on the Move On Thursday, King Mohammed VI expressed his satisfaction over the progress made by the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) as it relates to Morocco’s renewable energy sector. MASEN’s president Mustapha Bakkoury presented program status updates for the monarch, including updates on the Noor solar power plants, particularly Noor Ouarzazate II and Noor Ouarzazate IV, which will be operational in May. Moroccan Bid Threatens United 2026 While Morocco is continuing to collect support from several countries, US President Donald Trump felt the heat and has warned countries over their support for the Moroccan bid. Trump took to his Twitter account on Thursday and wrote that the US would possibly withhold its support to the countries pledging support for the North African bid. “It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the US bid,” wrote Trump in reference to the widespread support that many football federations have pledged the Moroccan bid. Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said on Thursday in Rabat that the government cabinet plans to increase the budget for social dialogue to MAD 6 billion. El Khalfi said that the government also plans to increase the salaries of officials, a measure that would cost nearly MAD 4 billion. The strategy is aimed at improving the income of more than 700,000 employees.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has once again reiterated his commitment towards Africa’s development during his speech at the opening ceremony of the 1st Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Climate Commission of the Congo Basin and the Blue Fund for the Congo Basin. During a speech delivered before numerous African leaders participating in the summit on Sunday, the King acknowledged the ongoing challenges that continue to hinder the continent’s economic and social development. The monarch described the symposium as an “urgent wake-up call” for Africa to meet the many challenges that impact people’s lives on the continent. The King also reminded the participants of the summit of the plentiful natural resources that the African continent enjoys; resources that are a crucial element for sustainable equitable development. “We do realize there are plenty of challenges,” said the King, adding that “the most significant of these, today, is how to reconcile the need to achieve development in our Continent with the awakening of ecological consciousness.” He then emphasized that the continent needs to take urgent measures to protect its corners from the impacts and the “devastating effects of global warming on the planet.” The monarch said that all Africa needs to shoulder its responsibility by contributing to efforts that safeguard “African biodiversity.” The symposium will also seek to establish formal financial resources to fund projects in the sectors of the blue and green economy as well as to fight against climate change, food shortages and water shortage. Commending the summit’s ambitious goals, King Mohammed VI recalled the major steps discussed at COP22 held in Marrakech in 2016, as well as the development priorities which were established at the first Africa Action Summit on the sidelines of COP22. The King also singled out the issue of the lack of drinking water in the continent, raising this crucial question: “How is it possible that in a continent which has more than 5,000 billion cubic meters of water in its aquifers, 320 million African men and women still have no access to drinking water?” The King then emphasized that these challenges could only be solved if a collective unified response was offered to better protect the continent’s resources. “Let us be aware of our wealth and of our ability to innovate. Let us pool our energies and summon our courage,” said the King. King Mohammed VI arrived in Brazzaville on Saturday evening with a ministerial delegation that consists of Minister of National Education Saïd Amzazi, Minister of Equipment and Transport Abdelkader Amara, Minister of Health Anas Doukkali, Minister of Energy and Mining Aziz Rebbah, Minister of Tourism and Social Economy, Mohamed Sajid, Minister Delegate for African Cooperation Mohcine Jazouli, and Secretary of State for Sustainable Development, Nezha El Ouafi. The monarch’s advisors, Fouad Ali El Himma and Yassir Zenagui, Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Boussaid and Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch are also taking part in the event.

Rabat – Authorities and customs police in Tangier seized 490 kilograms of hashish resin at the Tanger-Med port facility on Friday. A statement by the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that the drug shipment was concealed inside a truck bound for Spain. The police arrested the truck driver and placed him in custody for further investigation. Other suspects may be identified as the investigation continues. Earlier in April, police seized 53 kilograms of cannabis in a shipping truck in Tanger-Med Port. The authorities arrested the truck driver who was attempting to reach Spain after X-rays revealed the drugs concealed behind the vehicle frame and the engine cooling system.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI addressed on Sunday in Brazzaville a speech to the 1st Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Climate Commission of the Congo Basin and the Blue Fund for the Congo Basin.  Here follows the full text of the speech: “Praise be to God May peace and blessings be upon The Prophet, His Kith and Kin Your Excellency Mr. Denis Sassou-Nguesso, President of the Republic of the Congo, Your Excellency Mr. Paul Kagame, Chairperson of the African Union, Your Excellencies the Heads of State and Government, Your Excellency the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Ladies and Gentlemen, First of all, I should like to thank most warmly the many Heads of State who, despite commitments made long in advance, have agreed to change their agendas, at my request, in order to be here with us to take part in this important Summit and give it the continental dimension it deserves. I should also like to thank our distinguished host, the President of the Republic of the Congo, His Excellency Denis Sassou-Nguesso, for assembling us here at the heart of Central Africa to discuss a major project. It is a rallying project which offers promising prospects for the Congo Basin, for the region and for our Continent. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Africa has irreversibly embarked on a path towards profound change. With each passing day, our Continent is asserting itself more and more, looking to the future with confidence and serenity. And yes, we do realize there are plenty of challenges. To be sure, the most significant of these, today, is how to reconcile the need to achieve development in our Continent with the awakening of ecological consciousness. Our meeting today sounds like an urgent wake-up call for us all. It is vitally important for our Continent – indeed for humankind – because it implies a collective awareness of the devastating effects of global warming on the planet. Ours is a collective responsibility: to safeguard African biodiversity. The depletion of that common heritage has a far-reaching impact on people’s daily lives and is detrimental to the socio-economic development of the communities which depend on it. The Congo Basin is at the heart of this concern. This is the world’s second most important region for global carbon storage and the second largest river basin. It is also one of the largest forest areas on the planet – a region which is home to more than half of the Continent’s animal species. This regulator of the planet’s climate makes Africa the world’s ‘second lung’. It is here, and now, that the future of this vital asset is being shaped. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, At COP22, which was held in Marrakech in November 2016, we gave pride of place to Africa. To give substance to the priority granted to Africa, I made a point of convening the first Africa Action Summit on the sidelines of COP22. The watchword of that Summit was the co-emergence of Africa. As we were keen to put a practical, operational complexion on the Summit’s proceedings, we set up three sub-regional Commissions: • The Sahel Commission, chaired by the Republic of Niger; • The Island States Commission, chaired by the Republic of Seychelles; and • The Congo Basin Commission, chaired by the Republic of the Congo. Thanks to the leadership of President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, the Congo Basin Commission has achieved tangible progress in terms of turning the climate challenges facing the region into opportunities. Several steps have been taken since the Africa Action Summit. The Blue Fund was created in Oyo in March 2017. Its operational measures were agreed in Brazzaville in November 2017, and the implementation of the project was fast-tracked in Rabat in March 2018, during a meeting on the terms of reference of the Blue Fund’s preparatory study. Throughout the process, the Kingdom of Morocco has rallied behind this ambitious project to ensure its success, building on the expertise my country has gained in tackling climate change. I decided to support this program because it is based on a new paradigm that fulfils current and future needs. It is centered on integrated, inclusive, solidarity-based programs offered by the new blue and green economies. This decision is also justified by the human dimension which is a pivotal component of the project. Indeed, an inclusive, participatory approach that involves the region’s inhabitants is essential. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Guided by a brotherly spirit and by African solidarity, we have gathered to help unleash a beneficial dynamic. What is at stake is nothing less than the preservation and development of a precious African heritage: the Congo River. We owe this to the 200 million Africans who live in the Congo River Basin; we owe it to our Continent. The establishment of the Blue Fund must go hand in hand with the mobilization of economic stakeholders and civil society organizations so that tangible mitigation and adaptation measures may be taken, and climate-resilient development guaranteed. Financing is the main challenge facing the implementation of the project: we must innovate and come up with mechanisms that will help us identify and raise financial resources. We need to convince bilateral and multilateral donors – public as well as private – of the pertinence of the project. The Blue Fund will inevitably trigger a positive dynamic which will involve projects that will boost and benefit Member States’ economies. I am thinking, in particular, of measures to improve inland waterways, develop secondary ports, promote sustainable fishing practices, fight river water pollution and upgrade irrigation systems with a view to increasing agricultural productivity. This new water-centered economy will be the main driver of development. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Aside from the consequences of climate change, food shortages and dwindling water reserves can lead to significant population migration flows, weaken states and create precariousness. How is it possible that in a continent which has more than 5,000 billion cubic meters of water in its aquifers, 320 million African men and women still have no access to drinking water? What makes this alarming reality all the more serious is that if we fail to act, in the coming years climate change will lead to land degradation and a scarcity of water resources: the 25,000 sq. km of waterways will then face the risk of silting and pollution. Collective mobilization is crucial. And this Summit shows that it is possible. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, To rise to the challenge of developing the Congo River Basin means we need to set in motion a cooperative dynamic for sustainable development, not just at the level of riparian countries, but throughout the Continent as well. If we want to protect the two lungs of the planet, this challenge must become a collective ambition nurtured by Africa and the world. Our Continent’s natural and ecological resources make it one of the most important global players; its immense basins and rivers are home to an invaluable wealth: water, or the ‘blue gold’. As it has become a scarce commodity, water is increasingly coveted. Let us be aware of our wealth and of our ability to innovate. Let us pool our energies and summon our courage. Not only would we meet all the challenges, but we would also show that countries pursuing the same dream together, guided by the same vision, know how to act and to surpass themselves in order to forge a unified Continent – one which is proud of its many identities and its roots; a Continent resolutely on a path towards progress. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, In the task of building the Africa of the future, environmental preservation is the cornerstone of African co-emergence. It is the bedrock on which the Continent’s inclusive economic growth will be built. We must work together to tackle global warming and its risks, and transform our economies to promote sustainable development. Our presence here today attests to our resolve to place these issues front and center in our concerns and our action. We are determined to undertake concrete initiatives that are likely to help safeguard the rights of future generations. The Kingdom of Morocco will work resolutely and unremittingly for the implementation of the Continent’s large-scale development projects. The ecological challenge should no longer be seen as a threat, but as an opportunity. That is the significance of our common commitment today – a commitment rooted in the principles of shared responsibility and pan-African solidarity. Thank you. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.”

Rabat – Secretary-General of the Progress and Socialism Party (PPS) Nabil Benabdellah has joined the list of prominent people who fully support the ongoing boycott against the high prices of key Moroccan-made products. The boycott began online and is in opposition to recent price increases for widely used staples from major Moroccan companies, including dairy products made by the Centrale Laitière, bottled water from Sidi Ali, and Afriquia gasoline. In a video widely circulated on social media, Benabdellah said that the boycott is a spontaneous expression of people who have been suffering due to the high cost of living in the country. The Moroccan politician also compared the growing online protests to recent mass demonstrations that erupted in the country, including in Al Hoceima, Jerada Jerada and Zagora, urging the government to fully respond to citizen demands around economic opportunity and social disparity issues.
 “We have not done enough to meet these demands, so people are in urgent need of dignity and respect. They demand better living conditions, transparency and true democracy,” said Benabdellah. Benabdellah’s support followed a similar statement made by Nizar Baraka, Istiqlal Party’s Secretary General. In an interview with the radio broadcast “Point à la ligne,” Baraka said that the government needs to seize upon the message conveyed by the campaign. In response to the boycott, several government officials are calling the campaign a weak plot to undermine the brands that are being boycotted. Baraka, however, said that what is important is to understand the message conveyed and not to know who is behind the campaign. Several Moroccan celebrities echoed the citizen demands, including Moroccan divas Asmae Lamnawar, Latifa Raafat, Saida Caharf, and Najat Aatabou.

Rabat – Moroccan technology excels once again in the international world of innovation. Majid El Bouazzaoui, President of Morocco’s OFEED Association, recently received four separate awards at four international innovation fairs for his “automatic orientation system of photovoltaic panels” invention. The award-winning innovation “avoids the accumulation of dust and sand on the surface of photovoltaic panels, owing to this automatic change of orientation, to ensure a high level of energy efficiency in the long term, to save enormous quantities of drinking water and to preserve the environment against pollution,” the Moroccan association OFEED Morocco and the International Federation of the Inventors Associations (IFIA) told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). El Bouazzaoui won the gold medal in the environmental protection-energy category at the International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva, the Inventarium-Science Trophy in Portugal, a TIIAWA (Taiwan International Invention Award) gold medal in Taiwan, and a silver medal at the International Archimedes Fair in Moscow. In 2017, El Bouazzaoui received six more gold medals for the same invention in China, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Poland and South Korea. OFEED’s technology innovation has presented Morocco with the opportunity to sign 14 memoranda of understanding with Russia, Germany, India, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Levanon, Poland, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Taiwan, Malaysia, Romania and Finland. The association’s success also enabled Morocco to organize “Let’s Challenge 2.0”, an innovation competition held in Kenitra with the participation of 19 countries. El Bouazzaoui is an engineer in electronics specializing in networks and telecommunication. He is also a member of the Executive Committee of the International Federation of Inventors Associations (IFIA). In 2017, El Bouazzaoui won an Inpex Award of Merit during the INPEX International Exhibition of Inventions, held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. King Mohammed VI also awarded El Bouazzaoui his Wissam Al Istihkak Al Watani (medal of national merit) of 2nd Rank on Throne Day in 2016.

Rabat- After being convicted of discrimination by more than 800 Moroccan railway workers, the French National Railway Company (SNCF) finally decided not to appeal to the Supreme Court, by paying a total estimated at EUR 160 million to the workers, in compensation for their “moral damage, career, training and retirement,” AFP reported.  The workers, referred to as Chibanis (which translates to older workers with “white hair”), were recruited in the 1960s and ‘70s as contract workers, after France and the newly independent Kingdom of Morocco signed an agreement allowing France to recruit approximately 2,000 Moroccans to work in the French railway system, due to a shortage of manpower.  Fifty years later, 800 of them spoke out against the injustices they endured and sued the SNCF for more than EUR 600 million, as they accused the company for not treating them as full employees. In 2015, the Council of Paris Industrial Tribunal officially charged the SNCF with discrimination against Moroccan railway workers, who had filed complaints and fought for a reported 10-15 years while waiting to be acknowledged and compensated by the railway company.  The SNCF appealed the rulings, but a Paris court upheld the decision last February, stating that the discrimination was blatant and that the company “did not demonstrate that this difference in treatment was justified by objective reasons.”  In addition to being convicted of discrimination, the court also ordered the France’s national rail operator to pay over EUR 160 million as compensatory damages to the workers, according to their defense lawyer Clelie de Lesquen-Jonas, who said that the ruling was a great victory to them.   In a statement to AFP, the SNCF indicated that it will not form an appeal cassation, wishing “an appeasement with the Moroccan workers.”  The French daily reported that checks have already begun to be distributed to former railway workers and their widows.

Rabat- The low-cost airline FlyOrange will launch several flights during the summer season for several cities in northern Morocco, the management’s company announced in a recent statement.  FlyOrange will offer flights departing from the Netherlands to the airports of Nador, Tetouan, and Al Hoceima. The statement adds that the company mainly targets the Moroccan-Dutch diaspora, since a large part of this community comes from the Rif region.  The prices range between EUR 90 and EUR 300 for flights scheduled to begin on July 11, from Brussels and Rotterdam to Al Hoceima and Tetouan.

Rabat – The Casablanca City Council signed four conventions with a public company for environment and beach management to organize beach entertainment programs starting this summer. Starting in May, Casablanca beach-goers will no longer have to worry about paying exorbitant prices to rent an umbrella, table, or chairs, as the Casablanca City Council has decided to bring the beaches, which are overseen by private companies, under public management. The poor conditions caused by mismanagement at the Lalla Meriem, Ain Diab, and Ain Sebaa beaches of Casablanca have caused the City Council to sign a three-year agreement to transfer management to public organizations dedicated to protecting the environment, reported Assabah on Friday. In addition to setting prices higher than necessary, the same source adds that the private management companies did not comply with the government’s decision to divide public space, allotting 30 percent to business owners, while leaving the remaining 70 percent for citizens.

Rabat – The Istiqlal party’s Secretary General, Nizar Baraka, has voiced his support for the ongoing online boycott campaign launched against the rise in commodity prices across the country. In an interview given to the radio broadcast “Point à la ligne,” Baraka said that the government needs to seize upon the message conveyed by the campaign.  In his comments, the Moroccan politician contested comments made earlier this week by officials, including Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Aziz Akhannouch, and Minister of Finance and Economy, Mohamed Boussaid. The boycott, launched on April 20, on Twitter and Facebook, protests the high prices of several products, including Centrale Laitière, Afriquia (a subsidiary of the Akwa Group), and Sidi Ali companies. On the sidelines of the 13th annual International Agriculture Fair in Morocco (SIAM), Akhannouch has announced his disregard for the online campaign. The minister, who is also the owner of the Afriquia gasoline boycotted by online protesters, declared that the internet campaign cannot stop 470,000 employees in the dairy sector, noting that citizens should be thankful for the fact that there are no milk shortages and the product is available throughout the year. Baraka criticized the exorbitant prices of hydrocarbons, “which have reached a maximum that citizens can no longer stand.” While several officials called the campaign a weak plot, Baraka said that “the important thing is not to know who is behind the campaign, but rather to understand the message conveyed” through the campaign. The official said that the campaign reflects the suffering of citizens due to the high cost of living. Several Moroccan celebrities have also expressed their support and solidarity with the online boycott campaign in protest of the rise in commodity prices, including Moroccan divas Asmae Lamnawar, Latifa Raafat, Saida Caharf, and Najat Aatabou.

Rabat – Moroccan critics are tearing apart the Moroccan national team’s Adidas World Cup kits, following their release on Friday. The kits are white, with accents red and green, representing the Moroccan flag and the symbol of the Royal Football Federation (FRMF). The much-awaited jerseys have received a great deal of online criticism from unimpressed Moroccans.
 Some Moroccan social media users have pledged to boycott Adidas, drawing from the Moroccan-made product boycott in protest of the exorbitant prices of Sidi Ali (bottled water), Afriquia (gasoline) and Centrale Laitière (dairy products). #??????? ?????? — BiShA ?????? (@mdbisha90) April 27, 2018  Fans have also criticized the delay Adidas announced to release the Atlas Lions’ jerseys. On March 27, Moroccan newspaper Al Massae reported that Moroccan football officials and Adidas’s executive committee agreed to delay the official release of the Atlas Lions’ World Cup jersey to avoid forgery.
Citing Adidas’s concerns, Al Massae added that there might be “counterfeit duplication of the kits” if uncovered before the opening of the Russia FIFA tournament. ????? ??? ??? ???????? ? #??????? #????_???? https://t.co/D5eAkSO23D — amazighiya??

New York –   Explaining its vote on Security Council Resolution 2414, the United States reaffirmed Friday at the UN Security Council that the Moroccan Autonomy Plan remains a “potential approach” for the final settlement of the Western Sahara dispute. “We continue to view Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as serious, credible, and realistic, and it represents one potential approach to satisfy the aspirations of the population in the Sahara to run their own affairs with peace and dignity,” Amy Tachco, Political Coordinator of the Permanent Mission of the United States to the United Nations, told the Security Council, following the adoption of resolution 2414, which extends the mandate of the MINURSO until October 31, 2018. The US diplomat, who insisted on the importance of resuming talks in the framework of the UN process and the mission of the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy Horst Kohler, stressed the “special and important role” that neighboring countries can play in the negotiating process. The American diplomat’s statement echoes the repeated calls Morocco has made to the Security Council in recent years to pressure Algeria to be fully involved in the negotiating process. Moroccan diplomats have repeatedly stated that they won’t engage in direct negotiations as long as Algeria, the main backer of the Polisario, is not part of the political process.   Giving a new push to Morocco’s autonomy proposal, the US diplomat emphasized the need for the parties to work towards achieving a “realistic and practical” solution to the conflict. “We call on the parties to demonstrate their commitment to a realistic, practicable, and enduring political solution based on compromise by resuming negotiations without preconditions and in good faith,” the US diplomat added. Additionally, the American diplomat warned the Polisario against taking any further maneuvers that could cause instability in the region, adding that such actions would not help the parties reach a mutually acceptable political solution. “We expect that all parties will respect their obligations under the ceasefire and refrain from any actions that could destabilize the situation or threaten the UN process,” the US diplomat pointed out, referring to the repeated Polisario provocations in the Guerguerat region, located in the buffer zone. “Unilateral changes to the status quo on the ground will not help us get to a lasting and peaceful solution,” she concluded.

Rabat – Moroccan officials were unanimous in their satisfaction with United Nations Security Council resolution 2414 on Western Sahara adopted on Friday.  Moroccan Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita said that the Security Council resolution is the “result of Morocco’s strong determination and mobilization to counter all actions aimed at undermining the country’s territorial integrity.” Expressing satisfaction with  the resolution’s language, Bourita said Friday after the vote that this achievement is attributed to King Mohammed VI actions “to counter all insidious attempts aimed at hindering the interests of Morocco.” He added that the positive resolution reflects “the leadership of King Mohammed VI, Morocco’s diplomatic strategy and all the living forces of the nation to defend the territorial integrity and national unity.” Bourita went on to add that the resolution is a response to the repeated Polisario violations east Morocco’s defense wall, in the area known as the Berm.  Bourita added that the resolution reflects the eagerness of the international community to relaunch the political process under the leadership of UNSG Personal Envoy Horst Kohler, on the basis of a new and dynamic spirit. The resolution, adopted on Friday, extends MINURSO’s mandate for six months pressures the Polisario, and expresses “concerns” about maneuvers in the whole area east of Morocco’s defense wall, including Guerguerate.  The resolution also urged Algeria to shoulder its responsibility and to contribute to the UN-led political process. According to Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN Omar Hilal, the Council’s request is “a logical response to Algeria’s direct involvement, for four decades, in the Sahara issue.” Hilal told the Press at the UN headquarters on Friday that the Security Council “has acted with firmness, responsibility, and concern to impose the law, in accordance with its mandate for peacekeeping and security in the world.” Hilal also expressed his satisfaction with the language used by the Council to address its concerns over Polisario’s illegal actions in the region. “The executive body of the United Nations has used extremely strong language against the Polisario separatists, in order to put an end to these serious provocations in these two areas.”

Rabat – President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have responded to the controversial tweet that US President Donald Trump posted on the 2026 World Cup. On Thursday, Trump wrote on his Twitter that the joint bid is “strong” to host the FIFA tournament in 2026. Trump also threatened the countries pledging support for Morocco’s bid. “It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the US bid,” Trump wrote, referring to the widespread support many federations have pledged the Moroccan bid. Trump’s fellows, Nieto and Trudeau also expressed their support for the joint bid on their Twitter accounts on Friday. “We can have differences but football unites us. Together we support the bid of Mexico, Canada and the USA to host the 2026 World Cup,”  wrote the Mexican leader. Podemos tener diferencias pero el fútbol nos une. Juntos apoyamos la candidatura de México, Canadá y EUA como sede de la Copa Mundial 2026. @realDonaldTrump @JustinTrudeau. https://t.co/Sr0bLAJvy2 — Enrique Peña Nieto (@EPN) April 27, 2018 
Since he took office in 2017, Trump has been pledging to build a border wall between the US and Mexico to decrease undocumented immigration. His immigration policies, including the travel ban on Muslims issued in 2017, have sparked an intense debate around the world. Canadian Prime Minister also took to his Twitter on Friday emphasizing that “Canada fully supports the North American bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and we are ready to welcome the world to this extraordinary tournament.” Le Canada appuie entièrement la candidature nord-américaine pour la Coupe du monde de la FIFA 2026, et nous sommes prêts à accueillir le monde à l’occasion de ce tournoi extraordinaire. Ravi de cette collaboration avec @EPN et @RealDonaldTrump. — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) April 27, 2018  He concluded his tweets by saying that he is “delighted with this collaboration with Mexico and the US,” tagging Trump and Nieto. The tweets, however, could not cover up Trump’s threatening message posted on Twitter on Thursday. International news sources reported on Trump’s threats, which hinted that the US would withhold monetary support to fans of the Moroccan bid. News sources also raised questions regarding FIFA’s potential reactions on Trump’s tweets, asking if such a reaction could disqualify the United 2026. FIFA did not respond to MWN’s request for comment concerning Trump’s tweet. Rather, FIFA said that it cannot comment on specific statements related to the process. According to FIFA regulations, political repercussions and interference are illegal, as national football associations are supposed to be independent of political activities.

Rabat – Kanye West’s “bromance” with Donald Trump has cost him 9 million followers on Twitter. Fans of the American rapper are definitely not happy about his latest tweet, which endorses Trump and refers to him as “his brother.” On April 25, West took to Twitter to share some photos that surprised almost all of social media. The 40-year-old artist first tweeted a photo of him wearing Donald Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” hat. pic.twitter.com/tB8SlAjIfV — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) April 25, 2018  As if Twitter wasn’t already totally fired up, he shared a close up photo of the hat and let everyone know that Donald Trump had signed it himself. “You don’t have to agree with trump but the mob can’t make me not love him. We are both dragon energy,” wrote West in another tweet adding that even if Trump is “his brother” he does not agree with everything he does. The US President responded three hours later, quoting the tweet and calling his comments “very cool.” West, who has received 21 Grammy Awards, made waves across the entertainment industry with the viral tweets, which caused him to lose over 9 million followers, including music superstars Kendrick Lamar, Rihanna, and Jaden Smith. This isn’t the first time Donald Trump and Kanye West have crossed paths. In December 2016, West headed to Trump Tower in New York to meet with the political figure, with whom he exchanged a hug. Besides thanking West for his support, Donald Trump was busy threatening countries, whose football federations promised support for Morocco’s 2026 World cup bid. “It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the US bid,” wrote the US president on his Twitter account, referring to the widespread support many federations have pledged the Moroccan bid.

Rabat – When President Trump chose to force changes in immigration law, banning Muslims from entering the United States, he was pushing the boundaries of executive power, coercing the US government to accept his will.  Pending a Supreme Court decision, executive power may very well prevail; Americans chose their president and, now, they have to deal with the consequences. The world, however, did not put Trump in the White House. His threats to supporters of Morocco’s 2026 World Cup is nothing but a show of American privilege and power. Trump believes that he can call Africa a “shithole” and still expects Africans to support his demands. He calls Muslims Islamic terrorists and still wants their support, or else. If Obama were still the president, United’s chances of winning the bid would essentially be guaranteed. What the current US president does not understand is that Morocco has a strong chance of winning the bid, thanks in large part to his bullying tactics. The current US Senate and House representatives, who are apprehensive about losing seats in the upcoming midterm elections, have accepted Trump’s daily tweeter dome and the Republicans in their majority simply say: let Trump be Trump.   They may let him be who he wants to be, but the world does not have to bend to Trump’s demands, and the world does not have to report Trump’s so-called base. When President Trump broke the global status quo with his decision to move the US Consulate in Israel to Jerusalem, the world responded with firmness and voted in favor of the Palestinians. Almost all countries, with the exception of a few dictatorships, rejected his bullying, including those who see themselves as allies to the US. Trump’s recent threats provided the world with a new opportunity to declare that we are citizens of the world, and we will not let the bully continue bullying.For those countries that worry the US will cut aid if they support Morocco’s bid, it is well-known that the US government offers its aid conditionally.The US looks for its own interest first and foremost and is still the only country in the world that gives Israel a free pass. The Moroccan bid committee should not respond to Trump’s threats. Let him shoot himself in the foot. Morocco’s biggest problem at this time is the current FIFA head, Gianni Infantino, who is adamant about preventing Morocco from reaching the FIFA congress final vote. By all means, let Trump be Trump… and, hopefully, Morocco will benefit.

Rabat- Moulay Hafid Elalamy, Minister of Industry, Trade, Investment, and Digital Economy, seems to be optimistic about Morocco’s automotive industry.  Inaugurating the 2018 edition of the Automotive Subcontracting Fair, which took place from April 25-27 in Tangier, the minister set himself the challenge of reaching 1 million vehicles produced each year in Morocco by 2025.  “We are going to exceed MAD 100 billion of export sales which is expected by 2020, but I will take a new bet and raise the bar to MAD 200 billion export with a production capacity of one million vehicles by 2025,” the minister said. Commenting on the performance and achievements of the sector, Elalamy said that Morocco aspires to make the automotive sector a real vector of development, stating that the automotive industry is the leading export sector with nearly MAD 70 billion of turnover registered in 2017, compared to MAD 40 billion in 2014, marking 44.5 percent of industrial exports. The minister added that the number of jobs created by the sector between 2014 and 2017 stood at 83,845 new positions, thus contributing to the creation of 29 percent of industrial jobs.  The automobile industry is considered one of the most promising and dynamic sectors in Morocco, greatly increasing Moroccan exports through the help of its human, material, and technical assets and potentials.  Moreover, Morocco has become a favorite investment destination for many of the world’s leading car manufacturers, including the leading French manufacturer Renault, which opened a plant in Tangier in 2012.  In 2015, France’s PSA Peugeot Citroen announced that it will open a manufacturing plant in the city of Kenitra. The direct result of this new plant will be the creation of 4,500 direct jobs and 20,000 indirect jobs by the time the factory becomes operational in 2019. According to the minister, these investments boost Moroccan exports, contributing to a reduction in Morocco’s trade imbalance.

Rabat – Four FIFA officials paid a two-day visit to Morocco earlier this week to learn more about the country’s assets, including stadiums and accommodations to host the world’s 23rd premier football tournament in 2026. President of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) Fouzi Lekjaa told French news agency AFP that the visit was “successful.” More specific details of the visit is have yet to be unveiled. FIFA has sent its Task Force to Morocco on April 16, to evaluate Morocco’s assets to host the World Cup in 2026. After their first visit, the Task Force informed Morocco’s World Cup bid committee of an additional visit to hold talks with Morocco’s officials concerning the country’s hotel capacity and stadiums. Following their first visit, the Task Force told the chairman of the Moroccan committee that the Task Force “expressed their admiration” for the Moroccan bid. In total, the group visited stadiums, training camps, fan sites, and media centers in several Moroccan cities, including Marrakech, Casablanca and Agadir Prior to its visit to Morocco, Lekjaa, expressed his concerns over the Task Force in two letters addressed to FIFA. The first letter was sent on March 25. “To my surprise, the scoring system was finally sent to us on March 14–24 hours before Morocco submitted its file and two days before the deadline for the submission of applications to FIFA,” wrote the FRMF president. On April 3, FIFA responded to convey that the aim of the Task Force is to “determine whether the bids meet the requirements in terms of infrastructure and revenue-cost criteria.” FIFA’s response was not enough to convince Morocco’s FRMF. “We have taken note of your answers, but unfortunately they have not resolved these concerns, and we are still convinced that the scoring system does not comply with the requirements of the bid rules,” Lekjaa told FIFA. Lekjaa continued, saying that Morocco was surprised this measure surfaced only 48 hours before Morocco submitted its bid.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI is expected to travel to the Republic of Congo this weekend to sign a set of mining and trade agreements. Morocco World News reported earlier in April that the King will take part at the International  Blue Funds Conference. “I am pleased to announce the presence of the King of Morocco at the first Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Congo Basin Climate Commission and the Blue Basin Congo Fund,” said Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso. Quoting Congo’s Minister of Environment, Nature Conservation, and Tourism, Arlette Soudan-Nonault, Bloomberg reported on April 26, that the King will land in Brazzaville this weekend to attend the summit to discuss Congo Basin Blue Fund on April 28. The official added that the King will also meet with the president. Throughout his visit, the two country heads will sign several deals on mining, agriculture, fishing, health and transport. The summit will convene 16 African leaders who will discuss the implementation of the Blue Congo Basin Fund, a project conceived in part at the COP22 in Marrakech to provide support to the countries of the Congo Basin to create a “shift in their economies from reliance on forest-based resources to much greater use of renewable river and water-based resources,” according to the Brazzaville Foundation for Peace and Conservation.

Washington D.C. – Despite all the photos, videos and Facebook posts, the Moroccan community in the United State remains divided, unengaged and underused by both the Moroccan Embassy and the Moroccan governmental agencies in charge of Moroccans residing overseas.   In fact, recent actions undertaken by Moroccan officials further eroded the trust and widened the gap between large segments of the Moroccan-American community and the homeland. Thirty years after the beginning of what could be described as the first wave of Moroccan immigration to the United States, Moroccan officials remain hesitant to engage their compatriots and anxious to open up to the community at large. The role of the diaspora in American political life and especially in lobbying for the Moroccan Sahara is almost non-existent. In Washington, All of Morocco’s recent “limited” diplomatic and political successes were the fruits of expensive lobbying efforts and not a result of Moroccan-Americans civic activism. Such meager showing is a testament to the failure of the many Moroccan organizations entrusted with tapping into the talents of the Moroccans residing abroad to push national interests including the Western Sahara dossier. The few community events in the U.S. that were sponsored by Moroccan official entities failed to produce tangible results because of lack of advertisements and meek outreach efforts. While support for these meetings is far from universal, it will show Rabat’s resolve to utilize its diaspora for the benefit of the nation. Notwithstanding the buzz around posters, meetings, pictures and video of Moroccan-American activities, the community remains divided, disorganized and ill-equipped to advocate for the home country especially on the issue of Western Sahara The many conferences that the Moroccan press cover from Washington seldom feature powerful politicians, influential diplomats, heavyweight legal expert or known academicians who could advocate the Moroccan positions in the Western Sahara conflict and give Rabat’s policies credibility and authority. Furthermore, none of these gatherings produced a real change in the American positions. Rabat needs a grassroots strategy to represent Morocco’s autonomy plan as a legal and credible resolution to the Western Sahara conflict. Despite recent widely publicized events showing gathering of Moroccan-Americans, only a miniscule fraction of the diaspora in America is involved in such activities. In fact, events like the third forum of Moroccan Competencies Living in the United States, that was held in Marrakech April 3-4, 2018, do more harm than good to unite the community and tap into the large pool of Moroccans living in the US who can help the Kingdom to advance its political and economic agendas. As in similar gatherings, the Moroccan authorities in Rabat and Washington never coordinated, canvassed or consulted the wide community. Instead, as it has been the practice in the past thirty years, the few “chosen ones” were flown to Marrakech to attend and were marketed as representative of Moroccan-Americans. While such initiatives are helpful and welcomed, they should be transparent, genuine, and fair. Moroccan authorities, in this case the Minister of Moroccans Living Abroad, Abdelkrim Benatiq, seemed more interested in claiming the organization of the meeting than achieving the stated goals of the conference. More worrisome is the fact that such projects push away the elements who can help the homeland and portray government’s efforts as halfhearted and insincere. If the Moroccan embassy in Washington and the Minister of Moroccans Living Abroad were serious about finding and involving the most capable and qualified among the thousands of Moroccans, they should have open houses across the USA and invite the community. Such invitations come with risks, but with a lot of benefits that outweigh the negatives. After all, it is the job of diplomats to talk to their constituency no matter how “uncomfortable” the encounters could be. Communal meetings with a diverse group of citizens is a sign of acceptance and recognition of all views, but they also bring into sharp contrasts some of standing tensions between some in the community. However, just the fact of having open house would unify and energize large segments of the Moroccan-American diaspora. It is worth remembering that successful campaigns are about the substance and the messenger and not style and decor.

Rabat – If studying and writing is your passion, and you are enthusiastic about an idea for a new book, congratulations! You have made the right decision to become the part of scholars’ world. However, you must know several fundamental rules to write a truly exceptional book. Writing isn’t always an easy task. Follow the suggested steps below to tackle some of the problems you might face as you pursue passion. Plot and Story of the Book The plot is the summation of different events in the story. Designing a book-worthy plot is essential. First, you need to identify the purpose of your book. Are you interested in writing about religion, politics, atheism, sports, or another topic? Identifying your intended genre will help you to map out a book-worthy plot. Visit the libraries, consult similar books and give yourself space to give symmetry to disparate ideas. Study… a Lot of Books Although it may seem contradictory, to write well, you must read well, and often. Studying different writing styles and topics can inspire you to create unique ideas and connections. Miscellaneous Rules As the saying goes, “Nothing is new in the world.” Every new move or step is essentially an advanced form of a previous version. Consult history books, study the facts and add something new to write a new book. For example, you are writing about Helen of Troy or Titanic, don’t fret over rewriting the events or changing the spirit of the event. Rather, aim to add fictional elements that may attract a new audience. Take a Macro and Micro View of Book The author is the best critic of his/her book.  Study your words, pages, and chapters time and time again to reduce unnecessary elements. The writer can build only a compelling story and plot if they can hold audience attention, free of distracting additional information. Pick Story from Your Society You may find a lot of horrible, as well as exciting, stories every day if you study the newspaper. Each nation has heroes and its issues, and every topic has a story. Draw from real-world events around you as inspiration for your story. Remember, truth is often stranger than fiction! Take Classes to Sharpen Your Skills Some of the most renowned universities offer writing classes online, oftentimes free of charge. Attend writing classes if you can, as instructors can set you on the right track and provide personal feedback for you throughout your writing journey. If classes aren’t quite your speed, there are also numerous online institutions that offer custom essay writing and schedule group classes. Joining a group of like-minded writers can help you to work through similar challenges, be it in plot or character development. The Importance of Characters Characters are often the most memorable aspect of a book. The best characters are relatable to the audience in someway. When you are designing your characters, design their life story, and think about how they would respond in various day-to-day situations. Now it’s time for you to move forward with your book! A few last suggestions: take your work seriously, create an environment where no one may disturb you, and perhaps most importantly, be patient and kind with yourself. Sponsored Content.

Rabat – The selection process for choosing the host of the FIFA 2026 World Cup presents an opportunity for the competing nations to introduce themselves to the rest of the world.  For the next seven weeks, the bidding nations – Morocco, on one hand, and a tripartite bid from Canada, Mexico and the United States on the other – will be scouring the world looking for votes from FIFA’s member associations. The quadrennial football tournament is the world’s premier sports tournament and an obsession across the globe. A billion people watched some portion of the 2014 World Cup final match either on TV or portable device. It’s perhaps only fitting that the race between the North American bid and the Morocco bid will likely take on the characteristics of a national presidential election in the closing weeks and days. Who’s up, who’s down? Of Morocco’s many unique attributes, tolerance is perhaps the most notable and profound. Not based on volumes of parliamentary work committee reports or religious edicts, tolerance here is rooted more in a unique amalgam of history, geography, cultures (note the plural) and a monarchy that has shaped the kingdom’s evolving civil society for more than 350 years. Tolerance. Tasamuh in the local dialect. There are several important aspects of social and religious tolerance that inform Morocco in 2018 and which speak to the traditions of its 35 million citizens. During World War II, Nazi Germany overran half of France and then established a puppet regime based in Vichy. Morocco, then a French protectorate, was home to roughly 250,000 Jews. While Jews were rounded up elsewhere across Vichy controlled France and Nazi-occupied Europe in 1941 and 1942, the then 32-year-old Sultan, Sidi Mohammad ben Yusef (later as king, Mohammad V – the grandfather of the current king), protected the lives and property of the Jews of Morocco. His now famous reputed reply to both Vichy officials and close confidants expressing his defiance of Vichy edicts is the stuff of legend: “There are no Jews in Morocco. There are only Moroccan subjects.” In December 2015, the Institute for World Jewish Studies honored the late Mohammad V with the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.–Rabbi Abraham Heschel Award. When Jews and Muslims were expelled from Spain beginning in 1492, they settled throughout Morocco and eventually alongside the indigenous Amazigh people. Perhaps it’s this quirk of history that gives Morocco a fascinating, colorful and soulful national identity that finds expression in music, food, dress, language and temperament. A 2013 World Economic Forum (WEF) report ranked the world’s most welcoming nations for foreign visitors based on survey data. Morocco placed third behind only Iceland and New Zealand. The high score is not just a reflection of the enduring popularity of one or two tourist destinations like Marrakech or Fes (Marrakech is a fusion of Las Vegas and New Orleans; medieval Fes channels the role of colonial Philadelphia), it is a reflection of the intimacy by which Moroccans view their role as hosts. During the holy month of Ramadan, it’s common for those foreigners who have spent a certain duration of time in the kingdom to be invited into the homes of colleagues, neighbors, friends and strangers to break fast at sundown. In my Peace Corps site, it didn’t matter that I wasn’t Muslim. It only mattered that I was a stranger deserving of hospitality during a month of spiritual renewal and familial celebration. “You are family” has meaning here, too. There are four main schools within the Sunni Islamic faith. The Maliki madhhab (school of thought) is predominant in Morocco and it incorporates notions of the common or pubic good into religious teachings and doctrine. How will Islamic faith and scripture inform and affect the community or the people? What are the customs and practices of society that can help inform faith and strengthen that society? The influence and relevance of Morocco’s religious traditions can be seen in the Mohammad VI Institute for the Training of Imams, Morchidines, and Morchidates in Rabat. Since the institute’s beginning in 2015, hundreds of faith leaders and religious scholars from countries across North Africa and Europe have come to the institute to train and to share religious traditions. The global respect Morocco has earned for the promotion of tolerance led to the Marrakech Declaration in 2016; some 300 imams and faith leaders from across the Muslim world gathered to reaffirm their support for the religious rights of minorities in Muslim nations and for genuine interfaith dialogue. As the Arab Spring unfolded in 2011, the king of Morocco led a national discussion about how Moroccan civil society could be enhanced and how the voices of young people could genuinely be heard. The 20 February Movement that led protests across the kingdom against the stagnation of the status quo was primarily led by youth. Changes included a new constitution, greater power for the parliament and recognition of the indigenous Amazigh language as an official language of the kingdom. National political leaders made a new commitment to critical issues like youth engagement, regional disparities, and youth employment opportunities. The aspirations of young Moroccans, those who live in cosmopolitan cities and those in the rural countryside, help drive important policy debates in the kingdom. The 2011 constitution provides a specific mandate for society to support the development of young people “to establish themselves in [an] active and associative life and to give assistance to them in the difficulty of scholarly, social or professional adaptation.” The principal that it takes a village to raise young people is an important part of tolerance. A dar shabab (youth center) is a key feature of most Moroccan towns and many big cities. Thirty seats in the House of Representatives are now reserved for young people under 40. Beyond the meat-and-potatoes issue of job creation, Morocco’s youth culture embraces the new with the old, secular and religious; often equally familiar with the songs of Rihanna as with Moroccan folk icon Rouicha. Which ever bid wins the right to host the 2026 World Cup it will have an impressive amount of lead time: eight years. The length of two full US presidential terms. Each of the four bidding nations certainly offers football players, staff and fans endless cultural and historical exploration opportunities outside the respective stadiums. Those eight years will also give the chosen host nation(s) time to build a more resilient civil society, perhaps a more perfect union.

Rabat – Following defeat in their former stronghold in Syria and Iraq, ISIS fighters are fleeing to Africa, in hopes of destabilizing Europe, according to the head of the UN World Food Program, David Beasley. According to Beasley, ISIS wants to use the African continent as a basic operation to create havoc and instability in Europe. The UN official explained to the Guardian that many extremists who fled Syria have found refuge in the Sahel Corridor, one of Africa’s most unstable regions. In the Sahel, Beasley elaborated, the extremists from Syria are conspiring with local groups like Boko Haram, Al Shabab, and AQIM (Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) to use food scarcity as a recruitment tool to both fill their ranks and trigger another wave of migration to Europe. “You are going to face a similar pattern of what took place years ago, except you are going to have more ISIS and extremist groups infiltrating migration,” Mr. Beasley told the British outlet earlier this week. He suggested that Europe “take immediate actions” to help the regional Sahara leaders in the international coalition work to defeat the extremist groups. If these extremist groups succeed in the Sahel Corridor, he warned, the crisis threatening Europe will be much worse than the waves of migration created by the Syrian crisis. “If you think that you had a migration problem resulting from the destabilization of a nation of 20 million people like Syria,” the UN official said, as he addressed himself to European leaders, “wait until the greater Sahel is region of 500 million people is further destabilized.” He added that Europe and the international community “need to wake up” in time to prevent escalations in the Sahel Corridor. The Sahel belt, which includes Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, Mali, and Mauritania, is Africa’s most infamous driver of transnational insecurity and terrorism-linked strikes; it is also the point of gravity of groups such as AQIM, Ansar Dine, and Boko Haram. The region is also known to be extremely vulnerable to drought, floods, food scarcity and extreme poverty. Beasley fears that the Sahel Corridor may be transformed into a far more significant breeding ground for global terrorism, and that its many aggrieved youth can be easily lured by extremists to join their grand plan of instilling chaos and instability in Europe. “Greater Sahel is percolating,” he said, further arguing: “what we are picking up is that they [ISIS fighters] are partnering with extremist groups like Boko Haram and Al Qaeda to divvy up territory and resources and continue to infiltrate and destabilize in the hope of creating migration into Europe where they can infiltrate and cause chaos.”

Rabat- A horse pulling a carriage was reportedly injured after ramming into a car near the Majorelle Garden in Marrakech on Tuesday. After a fight occurred between two horses, one of them nervously moved toward a passing car, according to Hassan, a member of an association of horse-drawn carriages in Marrakech.  A video of the incident has circulated on social media, showing several people encircling the damaged vehicle where the horse’s legs were trapped.  With the help of a few individuals, the driver of the carriage managed to pull the animal out of the car. However, the horse has been badly injured and is currently under the care of the animal welfare association. According to a tourism professional, carriage activity is in full swing right now, as the city of Marrakech experiences its peak season. The professional explained that all 146 of the Marrakech carriages are operating at full pace, which causes the horses to become tired and nervous, and thus, more prone to accidents.  “There is currently pressure on the carriages–horses. Sometimes, they work from 8 a.m. to midnight. We should think about creating shifts, horses must get rest,” the same source added.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – The southern Moroccan city of Laayoune will host its first international conference on English Language Teaching (ELT), from April 27-29, at the local Superior School of Technology.  The city’s branch of the nationwide Moroccan Association of Teachers of English (MATE) organized and will oversee the conference, in conjunction with the regional academy of education and training, Laayoune Saqya Lhamra. Speaking to Morocco World News, the head of the conference’s academic committee, Lahcen Tighoula, called the event the “first of its kind” in Laayoune, and hopes that the conference will help local English teachers to “take their experience further and meet the challenges that face English language learning and teaching in the region.” The conference’s theme, “Promoting ELT: Local and Global Dimensions,” reflects the conference’s outward-looking focus, bringing together an assembly of national and international speakers from as far away as Greece, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Marisa Constantinides, a panelist and Director of Studies of CELT in Athens, Greece, told Morocco World News, “We are a global community of educators and this is our time to learn from one another without borders and restrictions. Education has suddenly opened up to include everyone through the use of technology and the ability to connect globally.” Constantinides also commended the conference’s gender parity, noting that the majority of ELT practitioners worldwide are women, and are often underrepresented in ELT conferences. “I salute the committee for having included three female plenary speakers in the lineup! This is wonderful for the community of ELT practitioners,” she told Morocco World News. However, the three-day event also brings together diverse pedagogical perspectives from across Morocco: educators from Laayoune will convene alongside professors from Ifrane’s Al Akhawayn University. In addition to the range of panel presentations, the conference will also include 10 presentations, six workshops tailored to the needs of EFL teachers, two workshops for EFL students, and a keynote address, “Back to the Future of Learning Technologies,” delivered by Irish scholar Gráinne Conole. Tighoula called pedagogical innovation “a ‘must’ in a changing world not only to meet the needs of the local student population…but also to face the challenges of technology, media, and global citizenship education.” Laayoune MATE has been active in the region for the last decade, and organizes a range of programming for educators and students, such as seminars for teachers, Spelling Bee championships, public speaking contests, and other student leadership activities. The papers, workshops, and debates will culminate in recommendations for ELT stakeholders.

Rabat – The coach of the Moroccan national football team, Hervé Renard has reaffirmed his determination to achieve an “honorable course” with his Atlas Lions during the 2018 World Cup in Russia. In an interview with international sports outlet Goal, Renard said that it will be very disappointing if his team leaves the World Cup green field in the first phase of the tournament. “To go further in this competition, we will go to make the best possible tournament, not to participate only.” According to Renard, Morocco’s disqualification in the first round “would be a huge disappointment for Morocco. Renard also discussed strengths of the teams that Morocco will confront during the first round: Spain, Portugal, and Iran. “For Spain, it has a talented workforce.,” ‘ said  Renard, adding that “We should be on our guard.” “It is one of the World Cup favorites.” Commenting on Portugal, Renard suggested that he will not “minimize the impact” of Cristiano Ronaldo, but rather “evaluate and analyze and give it all the importance it deserves.” For the list of 23 players that will be in Russia, Renard said: “90 percent of the list is already established.” There is still 10 percent that can vary depending on injuries and last minute unavailability. The coach also commented on the case of Moroccan-Spanish footballer Munir El Haddadi, who expressed his desire to play with the Moroccan team in Russia. “You have followed the case. Everything was said.” There is a small chance this will happen in the World Cup, he added. For several months, El Haddadi and Morocco’s Royal Football Federation have attempted to convince FIFA to give El Haddadi the chance to represent Morocco in the World Cup. El Haddadi represented Spain at the youth level and made a brief appearance as a substitute in an international game against Macedonia with the Spanish national team in 2014, which ruined his eligibility for the Moroccan national football team, according to the FIFA eligibility committee. El Haddadi currently plays for the Spanish club Alaves, where he is on loan from Barcelona during the 2017-2018 season. The tournament will begin on June 14. The Moroccan team will first play against Iran on June 15, while the second game will be against Portugal on June 20. Morocco will then play its last game for the first round of the tournament against Spain on June 25.

Rabat – The Security Council adopted on Friday afternoon a new resolution extending MINURSO’s mandate for six months until October 31, 2018. Unlike last year, the resolution was adopted without consensus, with three members abstaining from voting, Russia, Ethiopia and China. Resolution 2414 was initially scheduled to be adopted on Wednesday, but due to lack of agreements between members of the council, the vote was deferred until today. Despite Russia and Ethiopia’s attempt to water down the language of the draft resolution and avoid “alienating” the Polisario, no major changes were made to the final version of the resolution. However, there are two changes in the latest draft compared to the original resolution circulated to the members of the Council on Monday, April 23. The first consists in renewing MINURSO’s mandate for six months only rather than 12 months. The second change relates to the Council’s call on Algeria and Mauritania to fully contribute to the negotiation process. Whereas the first draft called on the neighboring states to “increase their engagement in the negotiating process and to fulfill their special essential role in supporting the political process,” the language of the final draft calls on the neighboring states to merely “make important contributions to the political process and to increase their engagement in the negotiating process.” Essentially, the language of the final draft has been watered down in a way that it relieves pressure on Algeria, the main supporter of the Polisario. Morocco has repeatedly called on Algeria to be fully involved in the political process, since it is the country that hosts, arms, and supports the Polisario politically and diplomatically. Emphasis on Morocco’s autonomy proposal  Like in last year’s resolution, preamble paragraph of the resolution gives preeminence to the Moroccan autonomy plan presented on April 2007 by “welcoming serious and credible Moroccan efforts to move the process forward towards resolution.” Meanwhile, the resolution merely mentions the counter-proposal that the Polisario submitted the same month without giving it any credit for moving the political process forward. Regarding the recent tensions in the whole area east of Morocco’s defense wall, the resolution commended the “measured response of Morocco to most recent concerns regarding the buffer strip.” Other than the usual language contained in the remaining preamble paragraphs, the operative paragraphs of the resolution contain positive language overall for Morocco. Taking note of Morocco’s calls to United Nations to stop the Polisario’s attempts to change the status quo in the whole area east of Morocco’s defense wall, including the buffer zone, the Security Council has expressed “concern” over the Polisario’s actions and called for its immediate withdrawal from the Guerguerat region. In addition, the Security Council expresses its concern over Polisario’s announcement to transfer administrative functions to the zones of Tifariti and Bir Lahlou and “calls for the Polisario Front to refrain from any such destabilizing actions.” Besides the paragraphs on tensions in the area east of Morocco’s defense wall, the most significant change in this year’s resolution in comparison to previous years is it emphasis on the need that the parties to the conflict work towards reaching a “realistic” solution. Paragraph 2 of the resolution emphasizes the need for the parties to “make progress toward a realistic, practicable, and enduring political solution to the question of Western Sahara based on compromise and the importance of aligning the strategic focus of MINURSO and orienting resources of the United Nations to this end.” This is a highly significant change in that it is first time the Security Council uses such language in a resolution related to the Western Sahara conflict. Since the adoption of Resolution 1754 in April 2007, the Security Council had never used such terms. In the resolutions adopted since, the council instead called the parties to show “realism and compromise” towards reaching a political solution. This language is positive for Morocco, as it puts more emphasis on the fact that a solution to the conflict would only be achieved if the parties worked out a formula that is realistic and viable. Since Morocco submitted its Autonomy Proposal to the Security Council in 2007, a number of influential members of the Security Council, such as France and the United States, have described it as “serious, realistic” and credible,” paving the way towards reaching a mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. Meanwhile, the Polisario submitted a counter-proposal to the Security Council, which emphasizes that any resolution to the conflict must be achieved through the holding of a referendum for self-determination, which maintains independence as a potential outcome. Many observers, as well as former UN officials, ruled out the possibility that an independent state can be established in southern Morocco.  In an interview with Spanish newspaper El Pais in August 2008, former United Nations Secretary General Personal Envoy to Western Sahara, Peter Van Walsum, said that the establishment of an independent state in southern Morocco was “unrealistic.” Morocco has repeatedly emphasized that any solution calling for the independence of the territory is red a line, stressing that autonomy is the most it can offer. While the Security Council has renewed its call for the parties to resume negotiations in order to achieve a mutually acceptable political solution, it remains to be seen whether Morocco will accept direct talks with the Polisario. Given Morocco’s calls for the United Nations to push Algeria to fully partake in the political process, it is unlikely that Morocco will engage in such a negotiations as long as Algeria is not involved as a full-fledged party. However, based on the dynamic of negotiations within the Security Council, it seems that the latter its moving towards calling clearly on Algeria to become fully involved in the political process. Though Russia watered down the language of the resolution, that the first draft adds a new paragraph calling on Algeria and Mauritania to fulfill their “special essential role in supporting the political process,” is an indication that the Security Council is moving towards viewing Algeria as part of the problem and part of the solution. If by the end of October 2018, no progress has been achieved and Morocco continues to shot down any UN request of direct engagement with the Polisario, the Security Council might push harder to call more clearly on Algeria to be involved in the political process.

Rabat – The German-based multinational cooperation, Adidas, unveiled the official kits of the Moroccan national team for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The jerseys are simple: mostly white with accents red and green, representing the Moroccan flag. Morocco World News reported in March that some Moroccan football fans went frustrated about the delay of the release of Morocco’s kits. On March 27, Moroccan newspaper Al Massae reported that Moroccan football officials and Adidas’s executive committee agreed to delay the official release of the Atlas Lions’ World Cup jersey to avoid forgery. Citing Adidas’s concerns, Al Massae added that there might be “counterfeit duplication of the kits” if uncovered before the opening of the Russia FIFA tournament. The countdown for the tournament has already started. Only 47 days are left before the massive event, which will begin on June 14, in Russia. The Moroccan team will first play against Iran on June 15, while the second game will be against Portugal on June 20. Morocco will then play its final first-round game against Spain on June 25.

Rabat – Amid Trump’s comments on the 2026 World Cup race, FIFA told Morocco World News that it “cannot comment on specific statements in connection with the bidding process.” Trump said on Thursday that the US “put together a Strong bid” with Canada and Mexico to host the 23rd tournament in the World Cup, before attempting to bully countries into supporting United 2026. The president threatened to cut the US support from countries that will not back the US bid and its decisions. Earlier today, MWN asked the world governing football body about its stance regarding the tweet. According to FIFA’s regulations, political repercussions and interference are illegal, as national football associations are supposed to be independent of political activities. “We can only refer to the FIFA Regulations for the selection of the venue for the final competition of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and in particular to the Bid Rules of Conduct incorporated there in,” FIFA told MWN. Trump’s statements came ahead the FIFA Congress vote, scheduled to take place in Moscow on June 13, when 211 football federations will vote for their favorite bid to host the 2026 World Cup. The US president also referred to the countries that do not support the US decisions at the United Nations. Trump was undoubtedly referring to some countries’ stance on the Jerusalem question, following his decision last December to announce Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv. Countries from all the corners of the world have already promised support for the Moroccan bid, including Saint Lucia, Qatar, Botswana, Nigeria, Kenya, Belgium, France, Egypt, and Tunisia.

Rabat – After months of ignoring the impending World Cup bid vote, Trump has finally spoken…well, tweeted. For all the criticism and eyebrow-raising that the United World Cup bid has been receiving for the past months, including the now-infamous FIFA-led plot to disqualify Morocco’s bid and Trump’s generally unpopular global decisions, the US president shied away from commenting—or tweeting—on America’s bid to host the footballing world’s most sensational and exciting tournament. Until yesterday, that is. “Will President Trump ever speak out about the World Cup? Will he endorse United 2026? Or should he? What is the president waiting for?” For the past three months, these questions have peppered the comment sections of many notable American outlets. Most of those who commented resigned themselves, somewhat gratefully, to the probability that, as far as a World Cup bid is concerned, a “Presidential tweet” was highly improbable: the US, after all, is not famous for its “soccer” culture.  “Well, since when does the US care about ‘soccer’ anyway,” several comments read. But when has President Trump missed an opportunity for a political tweet? And so, on April 26, America’s tweep-in-chief flipped the playing field in the football world, from passion to a calculated geo-strategy zero-sum game where “who is not with us is against us,” as another republican president notoriously put it in the wake of what we now know as 9/11. For Trump, football–especially the organization of the World Cup—should pan out via the same great power politics where “shithole countries” are forced to follow the erratic theatrics of those who promise to assist them in financial terms: the heart is where the money is. Or, more accurately, what the heart wants no longer really matters. “The US has put together a strong bid,” President Trump tweeted, highlighting the US position over Canada and Mexico, the States’ joint-bidmates. He continued: “It would be a shame if countries we always support were to lobby against the US bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)?” The way that Trump’s tweet ends is telling: “these countries,” coding for countries he has called “shitholes” in another context, seems like a direct affront to the predominantly African and Arab bloc endorsing Morocco’s bid. With this tweet, Trump is sending “these countries” a clear message: support our bid or prepare to face the political and financial consequences.  While Morocco 2026 officials have deployed colossal efforts and heavily invested in winning the heart and minds of those who will be voting on June 13, President Trump thinks that United 2026 need not bother making the same effort. For the president, diplomacy and persuasion are for the weak; when you’re strong, like the US, you either intimidate, threaten, or extort–it’s the Trumpian way. Morocco has been denouncing FIFA’s North American favoritism for months now. The global football federation is notorious for its big money policies. Its capitalistic approach appears to be working: modern football is dominated by big corporations and juicy businesses everywhere in the world today. The passion, the love, and the whirlwind of emotions—the side of the game that has thrilled and charmed millions for decades–is buried beneath ads and sponsorships. Look at any online platform, and you will see that football lovers are unanimously frustrated and disgusted about how money is defining the game. Conspiracy theories—which are sometimes more about truth than conspiracy—lead debates among football fans. FIFA’s history feeds into money-mania; it has a history—and now a present—replete with instances of corruption, favoritism, and influence peddling. While we hoped that the 2015 USD 200 million “bribes and kickbacks” scandal that cost Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini their positions at FIFA and UEFA, respectively, was by now a bygone era, German outlets Der Spiegel and Die Welt reported earlier this week that the current FIFA president, Giuseppe Infantino, is plotting a “dirty game” to disqualify Morocco over claims of “technical unfitness.” The German dailies claimed that Infantino and the task force are more interested in the financial returns of the US bid for FIFA than “technical fitness.” But Infantino could also be thanking the US soccer federation for playing such a significant role in his election to the head of football’s highest body–money and favoritism never left FIFA calculations. But when geopolitics enter this already-messy picture, there is more mess to come, more chaos, and, ultimately, more disdain and contempt for “these countries.” If this new configuration succeeds, countries without big corporations and geopolitical weight can forget about the power of passion and love. This new post-modern football is more an exercise in cooptation and silencing that benefits the powerful alone.

Rabat – Sofiane Boufal is Southampton’s new persona non-grata. The 24-year-old football player has been sidelined by the Southampton Premier League, due to an altercation with his coach, Mark Hughes. In a press conference held on Thursday, Southampton coach Mark Hughes explained that Boufal had made a “mistake.” “He probably needs to be confident again” said Hughes, adding that Boufal would not be playing against Bournemouth on Saturday. According to the Guardian, the Moroccan player, who was on the bench for the team’s loss to Chelsea, irritated his coach by refusing to warm up. The Atlas Lion must now train with the under-23 years. Boufal has had his ups and downs with Southampton since he arrived in the summer of 2016, after trading from LOSC for nearly EUR 19 million. Boufal chose to stay with the Saints and managed to win the trust of his former coach, Mauricio Pellegrino, who decided to grant him more playing time. Born in Paris, Boufal came through the youth system at Angers and made his debut in the French second division at the age of 18. The following season, he became a first-team regular. Lille paid EUR 4 million for the Moroccan player in January 2015, and he made quick impact with his speed and dribbling. Boufal first attracted the attention of top European clubs in 2016, when Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain, and Inter Milan are all said to have expressed interest. Boufal made his debut with the national team on March 26, 2016, starting in a 1-0 African Cup of Nations qualification victory against Cape Verde.

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat – The Moroccan National Tourist Office (ONMT) is organizing a promotional event called “Moroccan Week” in São Paulo. The event will run from April 27 – May 2, and will take place at the Conjunto Nacional building on Avenida Paulista. In an effort to encourage Brazilian tourism to Morocco, ONMT is hosting the free event “Moroccan Week” to exemplify Morocco’s cultural diversity.  The event will feature music and dance performances, art demonstrations, henna body painting, Arabic calligraphy, a mint tea ceremony, and parades showcasing typical Arab garb, such as the kaftan – a traditional robe often made of silk, cotton, or cashmere, usually donned at weddings and religious celebrations. There will be a total of six parades, which will take place on Saturday, April 28, and Sunday, April 29, at 2 p.m., 5 p.m., and 7 p.m. Guests are encouraged to check out the Orquestra de Música Marroquina (the Moroccan Music Orchestra), which will be performing Andalusian music that dates back to the 9th century. It is considered a blend of Amazigh and Spanish influences, and differs drastically from other forms of Arab music. The director of ONMT for Portugal in charge of Brazil, Abdellatif Achachi, will be attending the event. “Morocco is located strategically between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, lending it geography of valleys and mountains which come together and leave tourists breathless,” Achachi states. He continues, “[Between] Europe, Africa, and the Middle East are a melange, [Morocco is] a beautiful historic mosaic linking together the past and the present, and bringing incredible diversity.” São Paulo is one of 26 states in the Federative Republic of Brazil, and contains the country’s most populous metropolis. Its population should help maximize the event’s exposure. This is the second time the region has hosted Moroccan Week; the first weeklong festival occurred in 2015.

Rabat – The 15-member United Nations Security Council is expected to vote for a revised resolution on Western Sahara on Friday. The new version shortens the length of the UN mandate in the region and strengthens some language to emphasize the need for “realistic” solutions. A document obtained by AFP confirmed that the Security Council will vote for the UN resolution on Western Sahara on Friday. On Thursday, the UN reportedly submitted a revised draft resolution on the mandate of the UN mission in Western Sahara, also known as MINURSO. Though the Security Council was set to vote for the new resolution on Wednesday, April 25, but Russia and Ethiopia called the US draft resolution was not “balanced.” According to AFP, the resolution proposes no significant changes, other than shortening UN mission in the Western Sahara (MINURSO) mandate to six months, instead of one year. As in previous versions, the new version asks the parties to the conflict to engage in the UN-led political process to resume negotiations “without preconditions and in good faith” to find a solution to the four-decade conflict.  The document also called on Algeria, which has been denying its responsibility in the conflict recently, to cooperate in the UN-led political process to end the issue. Furthermore, the first draft resolution pressures the Polisario Front to withdraw from the region and refrain from its illegal operations, including attempts to relocate “defense headquarters” to Bir Lahlou, which have significantly increased regional tension. Stronger language, particularly in the conclusion of the resolution, constitutes an additional style shift away from the wording adopted by the UN since 2007. Specifically, the resolution calls for parties to work towards reaching a “realistic and practicable” resolution to the conflict. The Security Council “emphasizes the need to make progress towards a realistic and practicable and enduring political solution to the question of Western Sahara based on compromise and the importance of aligning the strategic focus on MINURSO and orienting resources of the United Nations to this end.” If the final language of the resolution stands, it would be the first time since 2007 that the Security so unequivocally uses “realistic” and “practicable.” In the past, the Security Council resolutions fell short of applying such direct language by simply calling on the parties to work “with realism and a spirit of compromise.” Many believe this new language constitutes a blow to Polisario, who maintains that any solution to the conflict must go through the referendum of self-determination, with the option of independence. Morocco has rejected any resolution that would implement measures beyond the Autonomy Proposal it presented to the Security Council in April 2007. On April 4, King Mohammed VI addressed a letter expressing Morocco’s concerns over both Polisario’s maneuvers and Algeria’s repeated denial of its responsibility in the conflict. The monarch underscored Algeria’s attempts to prolong the issue and its refusal to engage in negotiations that would contribute to end the issue. “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario.” Officials from Algeria, including Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia and Foreign Affairs Minister Abdelkader Messahel both denied Algeria’s involvement in the conflict, claiming that the negotiations should be between Morocco and Algeria only. However, Algerian news outlet TSA said that while Algeria keeps denying its involvement in the region, a public tragedy publicly contradicted their statements, when Polisario members and Algerian officials were collectively killed in a plane crash earlier this month. The news source criticized Djamel Ould Abbes, Secretary General of Algeria’s National Liberation Front, claiming that the official should have kept the presence of Polisario on the flight secret “for several reasons.” In an interview with Spanish Newspaper El Pais in August 2008, former United Nations Secretary General Personal Envoy, Peter Van Walsum, said that the establishment of a state in southern “was unrealistic.”

By Michael M. Crow and Maysa Jalbout Rabat – The demand for higher education around the world is growing. By 2030, according to UNESCO, the number of enrolled students is expected to more than double to over 414 million. Serving that population and others requires extraordinary energy and imagination, strategic thinking and innovation. The need for quality higher education is especially important in the Arab region as a whole, whose youth make up the highest proportion of the youth population in the world. While the Arab world expects to widen its educated talent pool by 50 percent by 2030,  according to the World Economic Forum, opportunities are out of reach for far too many of the region’s 105 million young people.  This means thinking differently about the kinds of institutions and the approaches to teaching and learning that will best accomplish this mission. Given the scale of need, the region could not build enough brick-and-mortar colleges fast enough. However, the advancements in online higher education make it possible to optimize existing educational resources and tap into increasingly sophisticated and flexible online degree programs and courses that match or even exceed the traditional classroom experience. New digital tools allow us to assess and serve the variety of ways that students absorb information and develop understanding. With a growing body of data, we can better understand how to help struggling students and provide individualized learning that allows students to work at their own pace and achieve better outcomes. Far from the early days when students simply watched a recorded lecture, today online students experience courses comprised of short learning modules, dynamic problem-solving and experimentation, interactive simulations and real-time feedback.  And we know that Arab youth are well-positioned for this kind of learning: A recent student survey conducted by the Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation for Education (AGFE) found that 90 percent of Arab high school and university students are confident in using online resources for academic work, and over fifty-five percent spend at least 3 hours on the internet every day.  Recognizing the opportunity to increase access for the widest number of qualified students, AGFE and Arizona State University (ASU) joined forces to offer 550 scholarships to high-achieving Emirati and Arab youth under 30 years old to complete their master’s degrees online. The Al Ghurair Open Learning Scholars (OLS) Program offers scholarships in 28 specializations, ranging from business analytics and construction management, to systems, industrial and electrical engineering, to early childhood education, nutrition and sustainable tourism.  As a global leader in online education, ASU offers courses developed and taught by world-class professors who are focused on student success, both academically and professionally. The master’s programs represent the ongoing commitment by ASU to expand its diverse and increasingly global student body, as well as AGFE’s dedication to help train a new generation of Emirati and Arab youth who can continue to pursue their careers while tending to family and other responsibilities. This flexibility enables access for talented youth who previously lacked the opportunity to continue their education internationally.  In addition to offering a high-quality education, students enrolled through the Open Learning Scholars program also benefit from academic counseling and coaching, one key reason ASU online students (over 30,000 worldwide) have one of the highest completion rates (over 90%). Attainment of college and advanced degrees represents the single clearest predictor of social and economic mobility. Across the OECD countries, adults with a university degree earn on average 56% more than those with only a high school diploma. Evidence across the globe also finds that university graduates have lower rates of unemployment, better health outcomes and longer lifespans.   This focus on education could not be more critical, both for the lives of individual students and for the positive development of society more broadly. Given the accelerating economic and technological transformations around the world, those who will prosper and meaningfully contribute to society must be creative, adaptive learners with the lifelong faculty to learn new skills and concepts, embrace new ways of thinking and learning, and pursue new careers. This is both the promise and responsibility of higher education.  The continuing evolution of high-quality online education—and the expanding investment in new digital tools and capabilities—makes it possible to provide access to higher education on a global scale. This is a great reason to be optimistic about dramatically increasing the number of Arab students with higher education credentials.  –Michael M. Crow is the president of Arizona State University, ranked the most innovative university in the U.S. for three straight years by U.S News &amp; World Report. –Maysa Jalbout is the chief executive officer of the Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation for Education, a privately funded foundation based in Dubai.

Rabat – Following recent accusations of racism, Moroccan-French comedian Gad Elmaleh has won best in comedy Webby Award for his “Welcome to America” sketch published on the internet in 2017. “Welcome to America,” which was in the category that rewards “less than 5 minutes of movies and videos created as a single episode in comedy or the art of making people laugh,” brings together the Moroccan comedian Gad Elmaleh and American actor Ron at the airport, as the comedian prepares to enter the United States. The sketch is about a border policeman who pesters the humorist about his Moroccan nationality. Elmaleh is then arrested by an agent affiliated with the passport control as he enters the United States.  When border patrol asks him “Why were you born in Morocco?” the comedian answers: “I imagine that it is because my parents were in Morocco at the time of my birth.” This skit was broadcasted in 2017 on the US comedy site “Funny or die.” In the end, the Moroccan humorist recovers his passport after an altercation that is quite unpleasant for him, but very funny for his audience. The Webby Awards ceremony will be held on May 15, when the winners will have to give a five-word speech. The award comes after recent accusations of racism against the Chinese community, which followed the rebroadcasting of a skit known as “The Chinese” from his show “Everything is Possible,” with French co-star Kev Adams. The 47-year-old was quick to apologize for his portrayal of Chinese people on the “Touche Pas à Mon Poste” show and made amends to the French Asian DJ Louise Chen, whom he had previously satirized, on April 23. The Webby Award is a tribute to quality on the Internet, including websites, interactive ads, online movies and videos, and mobile websites. Nominees and winners have been selected by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences since 1996.

Rabat – US President Donald Trump took to his Twitter to attack countries, whose football federations promise support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid on Thursday. Although FIFA pledges no political interference in its tournaments, Trump wrote that his country “put together a Strong bid” with the other two North American nations to host the tournament in 2026. Trump went on to say “It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the US bid,” referring to the widespread support many federations have pledged the Moroccan bid. The U.S. has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada &amp; Mexico for the 2026 World Cup. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2018  The US President also threatened to withhold support from countries that will not side with the US bid and its decisions. “Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)?” Trump asked, referring to the stance of UN members on the Jerusalem question. This was not the first time Trump threatened cutting US support to other nations. On January 2, the US President took to his Twitter account threatening to cut US fund to Palestinians. Trump said, “It is not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries and others, As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED of Million of Dollars a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate [with Israel].” It’s not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries, and others. As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018  In January, Trump’s administration announced its intention to cut more than half of the financial aid that the US normally provides to the UN agency helping Palestinian refugees. Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the US State Department, said in January that the Trump administration will provide only USD 6 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). She added that the country will withhold another USD 65 million for “future consideration.” The official claimed that the US decision is aimed at encouraging other countries to increase their funding of the UN agency. Two months ahead the FIFA Congress vote, scheduled to take place in Moscow on June 13, Morocco is gathering votes from all the corners of the world, including Europe, as the solo bid against the joint American bid. Countries that have already pledged to support Morocco 2026 include Lebanon, Palestine, Nigeria, Qatar, Botswana, France, Luxembourg, Russia, Belgium, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, and Kenya.

Washington D.C. – While the move was not entirely unexpected, the Russian delegation asked for the vote to be deferred for several more days presumably to give it time to water down the language to avoid any anti-Polisario sentiment. The United States, the drafter of the resolution, circulated it to the members of the Security Council on Monday, with the vote scheduled two days later on Wednesday. In echoes of last year, with this extra time, Russia will undoubtedly attempt to ensure that the final wording of the resolution contains a paragraph or a sentence blaming Morocco for the tension that erupted in the region in recent weeks. In my analyses earlier this month of the conflict, I predicted that Russia would try to undermine the support that Morocco enjoys in the Security Council from certain allies and posited that the draft resolution would not be adopted on April 25 because of the lack of agreement between influential members of the Security Council over the wording of the resolution. More importantly, I argued that war would not break out between Morocco and the Polisario, and stressed that Morocco’s diplomatic campaign aims drive the narrative and discussions in its favor and persuade the Security Council to take a tough stance against the Polisario. Regardless of the text of the resolution that the Security Council will vote upon tomorrow, Morocco has so far succeeded in undermining the Polisario’s attempts to deceive the international community as to its supposed eagerness to reach a mutually acceptable political solution in line with the Security Council resolutions adopted since 2007. Morocco has also succeeded in exposing the Polisario’s repeated violations of the cease-fire agreement and military agreement No. 1, as well as its attempts to change the status quo in the buffer zone and throughout the area located east of the security wall. Morocco has also conveyed a clear message that there will be no direct negotiations to reach a final political solution to the dispute as long as Algeria is not called upon to participate actively in the negotiations as a key party to the conflict and the main supporter of the Polisario. Notwithstanding these successes, it would be both naïve and reckless to believe that the rapprochement between Morocco and Russia in recent years and the signing of many agreements between the two countries would lead Moscow suddenly to become a reliable ally of Rabat and thus support Morocco’s position on the dispute. Such a belief would ignore and overlook the common strategic interests that bind Russia and Algeria, interests built over the decades since the Cold War. No matter how close a rapprochement Morocco achieves with Russia, it cannot match the value of Russia’s military deals with Algeria. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Algeria was the third-largest customer for Russian arms between 2007 and 2016, and is now Africa’s largest importer of Russia weapons, absorbing 46% of Russia’s exports to the continent. Since the signing of the strategic partnership between Russia and Algeria in 2001, relations between the two countries have developed significantly, especially in the military and security fields. For example, in 2006, the two countries signed a $7.5 billion deal under which Algeria acquired Russian weapons. The deal was considered to be the largest since the collapse of the former URSS. In addition, in 2016, Russia supplied Algeria with weapons worth $1.5 billion. On the other hand, under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin, Russia has sought to revive the same geo-strategic rivalry that prevailed during the Cold War between the former Soviet Union and the United States of America. Russia does not want to leave the United States free to influence the course of events in areas traditionally considered within the sphere of Western influence. In the context of this geo-strategic rivalry, Russia might use the Western Sahara conflict as a means to check its Western rivals and to send a clear message to France and the United States that it is ready to do whatever is necessary to defend its interests and the interests of its allies. This strategic positioning was evident in Russia’s role in Ukraine, Georgia, Iran, and Syria, all countries that Russia has fought to keep under its sphere of influence in recent years. On the other hand, it would be misguided to think that Morocco could operate without the key role played by the United States in the dispute over the Western Sahara. Likewise, it would be an exaggeration to suggest that Moroccan-American relations have entered a period of stagnation since President Donald Trump took office. If that were the case, the U.S. president would not have signed for the second year in a row an appropriation bill allocating a portion of the U.S.’s financial assistance to Morocco expressly to the Western Sahara. By expressly allocating funds to the Western Sahara, the United States is tacitly acknowledging Morocco’s de facto sovereignty over the territory. This support, however insufficient might be, is the result of the strong relations between the two countries and their advanced stage of maturity. Just as Russia and Algeria have built strong ties for decades, Morocco and the United States have forged a strong relationship at all levels since the 1777. Thanks to these historical relations spanning more than 240 years, Morocco has built bridges with many players in the sphereof successive American governments. As a result of the strong ties between Morocco and the United States, whatever the level of disagreement there is at times between the two countries – for example, during the second term of former President Barack Obama’s administration — Morocco’s familiarity with the American psyche and the foreign policy establishment in Washington D.C., not to mention the support its enjoys among many members of Congress as a trusted and a reliable ally, have helped to overcome differences between the two countries and immunize their relations from deterioration. The negotiation process in the Security Council this year has signified beyond all doubt that Morocco’s traditional alliances with France and the United States, as well as Spain, remain as important and critical as ever and that however, Morocco’s bilateral relations develop with Russia or even China, such relations will not be at the expense of its longstanding and solid relations with its traditional allies. Thus, as long as the Western Sahara dispute is on the agenda of the United Nations, Morocco must rely on its traditional alliances to defend its interests and to head off any developments or policy shifts that undermine its efforts to preserve its territorial integrity.

Rabat – Despite strong counter terrorism measures —both in urban and remote areas—the MENA region remains still a hotbed of contraband activities, according to a new study by the Flemish Peace Institute. Porous national borders and contested governments have contributed to the prevalence of arms smuggling and terrorist networks, the study claims, as countries in the MENA area are still recovering from chaotic and unstable recent past. The 26-page study, which features data analysis on Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco (including Western Sahara), and Tunisia, claims that “illicit arms dealings and trafficking have proliferated in the region.” The Gaddafi Factor Among the various explanations posed as possible reasons for the proliferation of illicit guns and terrorism-linked violence, the former Libyan leader’s death ranks as the most significant factor, opening up markets for illicit gun trade and cross-border circulation. With Arab uprisings and the demise of Muammar Gadaffi, the region witnessed waves of instability post-2011, especially in terms of territorial gains by smugglers and armed militias in Libya. “Determining how many weapons entered circulation after Gaddafi’s fall is a very difficult exercise,” the study says, reporting that reliable sources suggest “over one ton of arms were looted after Gaddafi fell.” Post-Gaddafi Libya is also said to have been a key driver of instability and illicit trafficking in the region as a whole. The lack of central authority, coupled with the emergence of armed factions and tribal allegiances, transformed the country into a “de facto sponge” that imported troubles and instability to neighboring countries in the recent years. Moroccan Exception? “Morocco and Algeria are both among the largest arms importers in Africa. While Morocco does not report significant violent episodes or seizures of firearms, Algerian authorities regularly report on the numerous arms seizures and counter-terrorism operations in the country, especially along its borders with Libya, Mali and Niger,” the study states. The report also documents that despite the pervasiveness of criminal activities across MENA borders, each country, depending on its military and its violence-countering system, has devised ways of fencing itself against both political instability and the infiltration of illicit arms on its territory. In that context, Tunisia is dubbed “a peripheral market for small arms and light weapons,” with a relatively low level of illicit gun flows (e.g. Kalashnikovs from Libya). Meanwhile, there is the presence of a reportedly strong network of illicit guns flow (both in and out) in Algeria. Despite constant military patrols and daily reports of seizure of illicit arms, the south of the country is still viewed a hub of insecurity. In 2016 alone, the Algerian military reported seizing 668 Kalashnikov automatic rifles, 37 mortars, 18 RPGs, 7 rockets, 792 grenades, and 6 anti-aircraft missiles. These numbers suggest that the Algerian “black market” for guns also involves heavy weapons. In addition to an active network of illicit guns and other criminal trafficking, the study reveals, the country was recently a hub of organized violence and a haven for Islamic militias and other armed groups, notably AQIM (Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb), Soldiers of the Caliphate, and the Polisario Front. In Morocco, on the other hand, there have been few, though not insignificant, violent incidents involving illicit guns. According to the study, the few cases of violence and gun smuggling witnessed in Morocco are mostly linked to the Polisario Front and some ISIS sympathizers operating in urban terrorist cells. Morocco has been safe from the terrorist groups (notably AQIM and ISIS) which have caused havoc in other parts of the region, making it hard for terrorist cells and other forms of organized violence to gain a foothold in the country. Between 2010 and 2016, reports pointed to less than 50 violent incidents, the study finds. And while most of the ISIS-linked terrorist cells are dismantled and denied the possibility of launching terrorist strikes in Morocco, the Polisario Front’s arms trafficking is turned toward Mauritania. “According to an official Mauritanian source, the Polisario Front represents one of the leading suppliers of illegal weapons to Mauritania,” the study claimed. It added that the group’s “large military arsenal” was acquired from the substantial military and logistic support it has been receiving from “states such as Libya and Algeria.”

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat- The biological pest control group, Biobest, announced the launch of its new, EUR 1.2 million “state-of-the-art” facility, which will boost Morocco’s aphid biocontrol capacity, on April 24. Aiming to satisfy the strong demand for zero-residue products and tackle the rising problem of pesticide resistance, the Belgium-based company fully equipped the 2,000 square-meter vertical livestock facility with air-conditioned rooms, thus preparing to ensure a “flexible” and “reliable” supply to its customers.  “Aphids remain one of the most challenging pests to control with biological methods,” declared Biobest, which offers producers around the world a full range of “natural enemies” for agricultural pest problems, as well as the necessary technical advice for a successful pests control.  While synthetic chemical pesticides are effective in protecting crops, they have proven to cause acute and chronic health effects, in addition to upsetting the natural equilibrium of agricultural systems and the environment.   Biobest provides an alternative solution that uses microbial biopesticides to work against certain pests without harming other organisms.  “The success of biocontrol against aphids does not depend on a miracle product, we recommend strategies that combine different aids in an effective way,” says Biobest sales manager, Marc Mertens, “the midge Aphidoletes has an important role to play, given its great predatory ability, since its effectively gets rid of emerging aphid infestations. It forms a powerful tandem with different parasitoid wasp species. We continue to work in expanding our range of solutions, and our consultants know how to help producers best combine the most effective IPM solutions in different crops and climates.”  This project is expected to reinforce the company’s position as a leading supplier for integrated pest management solutions in Morocco and to underline the Moroccan franchise’s role within the global production network, asserted the managing director of Biobest Morocco, Karim Jerate.   Founded in 1987, Biobest offers biofriendly solutions to producers in more than 60 countries, Through its subsidiaries, the company has productions sites, sales personnel, and technical support strategically located around the world for efficient global service.  “With several production sites around the globe, our goal is to offer a flexible response capability to producers in different parts of the world. Our Moroccan team has done a remarkable job completing the construction of this new production plant on time and according to the required specifications,” said Biobest Chief Operating Officer, Karel Blockmans.

Rabat – Following the bad buzz and accusations of sexism, Nestlé has decided to cancel the #BghitNtezewaj (“I want to get married”) mini web-series. “Nestlé Morocco takes into account the reactions that may have emerged following the broadcast of the first episode of the web-series and decided to end [its broadcast],” said Nestlé Morocco in a statement released Thursday, April 26. Nestlé’s new advertising project, released on Tuesday, sparked condemnation across social media platforms for its sexist messaging. The ad features a mother looking for a wife for her son. To find the best match, the mother tests a group of girls on their cooking and house management skills. Through this clumsy ad, Nestlé intended to be “original” by copying a French show, which is also criticized in France, called “Who wants to marry my son?” With its clichés and stereotypes, Nestlé Morocco has provoked an avalanche of criticism, including the hashtag #ShameOnNestle across various social media platforms. The Moroccan company apologized, explaining that it will no longer broadcast the show. “NESTLE Maroc sincerely regrets that the web series ‘Baghi Ntzewej’ could have offended or shocked a certain number of people. This was obviously not its intention.” Having said that, Nestlé wanted to showcase woman’s “important” role in the company. In a press release, the company stated that it “is particularly vigilant regarding women’s roles in the company, as 52% of [Nestlé] the staff in its head office is occupied by women,” adding that “the Management Committee has 37%.”

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat- During the celebration of the 13th annual International Agriculture Salon in Morocco (SIAM), Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture, Aziz Akhannouch, publicly announced his disregard for the online campaign in protest of the rise in commodity prices. On Thursday, April 25, Akhannouch–who is also the owner of the parent company of Afriquia gasoline–publicly announced that he believes agricultural production will not be affected by a virtual campaign. “Moroccans drink milk morning and afternoon…this is not a game,” he said. “They are aware of the fact that when they drink one cup of milk, they help a good number of dairy farmers who live off it.” Akhannouch added that the internet campaign cannot stop 470,000 employees in the dairy sector, noting that citizens should be thankful for the fact that there are no milk shortages and the product is available throughout the year, while also hailing the efforts of cattle breeders in the sector. The dairy, gasoline, and bottled water boycott launched on April 20, on Twitter and Facebook. Protesters have created pictures, videos, memes, and pages, to raise awareness of the exorbitant prices of the Centrale Laitière, Afriquia (subsidiary of the Akwa Group), Sidi Ali companies, compared to others that sell the same products, three weeks before the beginning of Ramadan. Hearkening back to Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani’s move to dispel public doubts surrounding the safety question of drinking tap water, Akhannouch and other event participants stood side by side and raised their glasses of milk, implying their support for the product.

Rabat- Morocco placed 123rd, with a score of 26.1 percent, in the 2017 Kochenov Quality of Nationality Index (QNI), issued by the Henley and Partners, the world’s leading resident and citizenship planning firm.  The index ranks the quality of nationalities worldwide, covering 168 countries, on the basis of both the internal factors, such as economic strength, human development, and peace and stability, as well as external factors, including visa-free travel and the ability to settle and work abroad without cumbersome processes.  In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, the index shows that Morocco came second in North Africa after Tunisia, which scored 28.3 percent and occupied the 110th ranking globally. While the kingdom ranked seventh in the Arabic-speaking region’s list, the UAE came in first, displacing Israel for the first time on the QNI and clinching the 46th place globally. According to the QNI report, the Emirati nationality made a significant leap forward, as its holders received visa-free travel access to the Schengen Area in 2016.  Like the previous editions of the QNI, the European countries maintain the top spot in this ranking. The French nationality topped the list as being the world’s best nationality, earning a score of 81.7 percent out of a possible 100 percent, fractionally ahead of Germany, which was knocked off the top spot for the first time in seven years, with a score of 81.6 percent, with Iceland following closely with a score of 81.5 percent.  The QNI also divides the nationalities of the world into five quality-based tiers — Extremely High Quality, Very High Quality, High Quality, Medium Quality, and Low Quality — giving a very clear picture of the standing of each nationality in the world based on a percentage scale.  The Moroccan nationality features in the Medium Quality category, among other nationalities such as the Algerian and Egyptian nationalities, with a score between 20 percent and 34.99 percent.

Rabat – Air Arabia Maroc has launched a campaign to seduce the northern European countries. After taking part in several international trade fairs and exhibitions, Air Arabia Maroc is continuing its efforts to strengthen tourism between Morocco and Europe. On April 23, Air Arabia Maroc and the Regional Tourism Council of Agadir organized, an “Agadir special theme evening” in Copenhagen, to reinforce tourism and help increase the number of arrivals to the city. This thematic night was conceived in the format of a traditional Moroccan dinner and was attended by more than 120 participants, including travel agencies, tour operators, bloggers, and Danish media representatives. “This was the occasion to present the discreet charms of a region which shelters the first seaside resort of Morocco, with its 300 days of sunshine a year and its 6 km of fine golden sand,” said the company in a press release. At night, Air Arabia and CRT Agadir picked six lottery winners of three-night packages, including flights, to experience Agadir’s seaside, medina, and beaches, in addition to tours in Taghazout and Taroudant. Influencers had the opportunity to try the Air Arabia Express service, which allows Air Arabia Morocco travelers to arrive at their final destination in the city center at a low cost and with minimal waiting time. This successful promotion of Agadir, which has had good media coverage in both Denmark and Sweden aims to promote the work carried out by Air Arabia Morocco, the ONMT, and the CRT Agadir to highlight the Souss-Massa region. In October 2017, Arabia Morocco has made Agadir its sixth air base in Morocco by launching new routes linking Agadir to seven European destinations, including Dublin, Manchester, Cologne, Munich, Toulouse, Stockholm, and Copenhagen. Air Arabia Maroc is a Morocco-based joint venture and member of the Air Arabia Group which was launched in 2009. Air Arabia Maroc has been launching new weekly flights linking Morocco to several European destinations including, in 2017, Marrakech to London and Paris. Air Arabia Maroc serves 32 global destinations from six Moroccan cities, bringing its total network to 49 routes. In addition to Agadir, Air Arabia Maroc operates from Casablanca, Tangier, Fez, Nador, and Marrakech, with service to various European cities.

Rabat – As speculations about FIFA’s anti-Morocco 2026 bias gain wider following just over one month out from the final vote, some senior officials are weighing in on the debate and urging FIFA to dispel the idea of disqualifying the North African bid before the final vote on June 13. Speaking earlier this week to the Associated Press, Germany’s football federation’s chairman, Reinhard Grindel, said that FIFA should reconsider its position on Morocco 2026. Grindel said that prematurely disqualifying the North African bid raise more questions and concerns that could further tarnish the reputation of the footballing world’s highest body. The bottom line: Morocco 2026 should be given the right or chance to support its merits before the FIFA congress. Although Mr. Grindel does not oppose the influence that the task force is reported to hold in the 2026 bidding process, the German thinks that allowing Morocco to maintain its position in the contest is FIFA’s safest way of avoiding accusations and bitterness from parts of the world that already feel marginalized and discriminated against by international bodies. Not allowing Morocco to stand and defend its chances is the surest manner to provide a fertile ground for “conspiracy theories,” the German official argued. “If there are only two [candidates], the congress must have the chance to vote,” he said, adding, “We don’t need any rumors in such a process.” Read Also: Morocco 2026 Up Against ‘FIFA’s Dirty Game’: German Daily However, Grindel did not say which bid his country will vote for, stating that Germany will only decide after reading the task force’s evaluation of the bidders’ capacities “to host such a World Cup.” The question of FIFA’s bias and partiality in the process is no trivial matter to the body’s officials, who have been issuing statements to reiterate the organization’s “neutrality and objectivity” in the whole process. Speaking amidst such pointed concerns over a anti-Morocco 2026 FIFA agenda, one FIFA spokesperson said that the body has been doing everything possible to prevent accusations of this nature. The spokesperson called the accusations “unfounded,” while reminding the public that FIFA president, Infantino, will not even be present at the final vote in Moscow. “The process is fair, objective, and transparent,” the spokesperson said, later arguing that the task force, which is reported to have been set up to realize Infantino’s United agenda, is “guided by clear and objective criteria, and its report will be made public to guarantee full transparency of the process.” Sidelining Potential Pro-Morocco 2026 Officials? Meanwhile, however, the highest instances of the body itself are mired in a series of mutual suspicions and accusations. FIFA Secretary General Fatma Samoura has been reported to the organization’s ethics committee, on grounds of “disclosure, cooperation, reporting, and conflict of interest,” all of which are said to be in relation with her possible closeness to Morocco’s bid. BBC reported this week that claims of Mrs. Samoura’s “alleged breaches of ethics” surfaced when the task force, which visited Morocco last week, revealed an “undeclared family link” between FIFA Secretary General and the Senegalese ambassador for Morocco 2026, El Hadj Diouf. Asked about the allegations, Mrs. Samoura said that they were ridiculous and suggested that forces inside the body are plotting to eliminate some voices that could oppose or expose the executive board’s behind-the scene-maneuverings. “I have a good idea who is conveying this message,” she said, adding, “The whole country of Senegal will laugh at FIFA Ethics… because everyone in my family knows the origin of El Hadj Diouf.” Another FIFA senior official, who allegedly spoke under conditions of anonymity, told the British news outlet that prior to the task force’s visit to Morocco, Infantino “encouraged them to find any evidence that could block Morocco’s candidacy.” The same anonymous source elaborated that there are fears that an actual vote will see Morocco emerge triumphant over the North American bid which is believed to be more financially beneficial for FIFA. There are forces inside FIFA—its president included—trying hard to undermine Morocco’s bid, the same source suggested. In response to the mounting suspicions of FIFA’s pro-United 2026 agenda, a FIFA spokesperson emphasized the need for people to acknowledge the efforts the current FIFA team has exerted to reform a body whose troubled past—mired in corruption and vote-buying—is no secret to anyone. He said that the allegations are “defamatory” and “unacceptable” as they come at a time—less than two months before the vote—when “calm, sense of responsibility, and respect” should prevail instead.

Rabat – The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) will launch a new generation of National Electronic Identity Card (CNIE) with reinforced security criteria for identification documents in 2019.  On Monday, a statement from the DGSN, reported by Maghreb Arab Press, said that new applications in the identity cards will allow access to a digital system adopted by the various public and private stakeholders, while modernizing the design format in a way that takes into account the historical and cultural specificities of Morocco. With the new CNIE, citizens will be able to use identity and biometric data contained in the IDs to authenticate new operations, facilitating access to public administration and private sector services, including public programs and health benefits. The new ID cards are lower in cost than previous cards and are guaranteed to all citizens, including minors. In contrast, the current cards are only offered to citizens 18 and up. In the case of minors, the ID cards will be available immediately after birth or at the age of schooling, the DGSN stated. Technology adopted in these cards will be utilized to make other identity papers, such as residence cards for foreigners and the professional cards of police officials. The same source added that this technology could be used later in the issuance of identity papers to citizens of neighboring countries. The updated IDs will offer citizens the opportunity to opt in to internet notifications in the case of loss, theft, or the death of the cardholder, in order to prevent fraudulent use. This update comes in line with DGSN’s strategic vision, which sets its sights on enabling easier access to public services for all citizens in the kingdom.

Morocco’s parliament also reiterated its intention to further reinforce relations and cooperation with Parlacen and to build an advanced partnership, with the framework of the commitments of both parties. Attmoun said that the meeting in Morocco will “undoubtedly” help boost cooperation in several areas, including international relations and migration. Anselmo Otoniel Navarro echoed Attmoun’s statement, commending Morocco’s efforts to enhance the partnership between the parties. He added that the visit of the members of the commission of the Central American Parliament will allow learn more about Morocco-EU partnership.

Rabat – With FIFA’s decision to add a new requirement to the bidding process, the leading German daily, Di Welt, urges Morocco to do something to prevent “FIFA’s dirty game” from succeeding with a United win: Morocco 2026 should seek competent legal authorities, the daily advises. Whereas international and Moroccan news outlets expressed doubts about the rationale behind the extended power given to the task force’s “expert opinion,” the German daily “is sure of Infantino’s plot to disqualify Morocco’s bid.”  With FIFA unabashedly intent on driving Morocco 2026 out, the report claims that only the Lausanne-based independent court for sports-related disputes could save Morocco’s bid from being prematurely and unduly sidelined. Di Welt speculates that FIFA’s new rule is designed with one purpose: convince the footballing world that the North American trio is the only “fitting bid.” According to the new rule, Di Welt reports, any bidding nation should have six stadiums that fit all international standards, as opposed to five stadiums that FIFA had always required of previous World Cup bidders. The daily claims the only way to respond to the plot is to “force FIFA to be impartial” in the process and to go back to the rule of five ready stadiums. To accomplish this, Di Welt suggests that Morocco immediately present its case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The problem is not just that Morocco does not meet the requirements of the new rule. A far bigger problem, according to the outlet, is that FIFA is giving itself the liberty of changing rules so close to the conclusion of the bidding process, when the implementation of a new regulation would be impossible to accommodate. Without any notice to either federations or bidders, World Cup bidding regulations seem to be amended, added, and nullified as Infantino and his inner circle see fit.  At the end of the day, Morocco cannot sprout an additional stadium by June 13, guaranteeing the North African country a lower ranking than the infrastructure powerhouse that is the United bid. In the meantime, Morocco 2026 officials will continue  their communications crusade to convince national federations to vote for the North African bid on June 13 in Moscow. Morocco 2026’s chief Moulay Hafid Elalamy has affirmed Morocco’s refusal to acquiesce when it senses unfairness and bias in the bidding process: “We will use sports-sanctioned means to fight for our right to bid for the hosting rights…if they say that we are not qualified, they will have to prove it, to show us why.”

Rabat – The spectacle at Anfield was, as usual, a mixture of joy, drama, and impeccable athletic fluidity: What a night! What a display of ultimate football! Comments and opinions may differ about whether Liverpool’s sensational football is unstoppable at this moment in time–whether they can claim the UCL title again, more than a decade after the unbelievable victory against AC Milan. But one thing is indisputable:  only this Kloop-coached attacking machine could lead a UCL semi-final game by 5-2 and still look unsatisfied at the final whistle. Roma, to say the least, have been mesmerizingly merciless in their UCL campaign, stunning Valverde’s Barcelona and topping a group that included Chelsea and Atletico Madrid. But when it comes to away games, Dzeko and Co. have been staggeringly shoddy, practically unrecognizable. Firmino’s uproar; Salah’s deft versatility; Mané’s blistering runs—Liverpool was too much of a pain to bear. Outranked and outclassed in all departments for 80 minutes, Roma barely looked like a professional football team. But Roma’s tactical blunders notwithstanding, Liverpool needed the class, the illuminating presence, and the flawless moves of one single man to help them demolish their opponents: Mohamed Salah. The Egyptian, recently crowned the Premier League’s player of the year, played against his former teammates as though he still needed to prove himself. To show doubters that he, and nobody else, remains the sensation of this season. What a relishing return in the cour des grands! When Roma’s Brazilian goalkeeper shutdown Salah’s first dangerous shot in the first 30 minutes, there was a feeling of inevitability hovering in the air, a prelude to a Salah-led onslaught by a team with a brilliant attack. And Salah can now dream beyond the premier League: should Liverpool qualify for the final (for Roma has not said its last word), the Egyptian can start dreaming of the Ballon d’Or, a suggestion that would have sounded unbelievable when Roma sold him to Liverpool last summer. By scoring two masterpieces and setting up two other goals for the other members of Liverpool’s deadly trio, Salah proved his place, once more, among the best that the game has right now, enrapturing Anfield and handing Jürgen Klopp the chance of playing his second UCL final. Like City in the first leg of the quarter-finals, Roma succumbed to the unrivaled physicality and the restless whirlwind of attacks and counterattacks upon which Liverpool currently thrives. Save for Nainggolan, who battled tooth and nail to maintain his sanity in the midfield, other Roma players spent 80 minutes asking themselves what had happened to their hitherto-impressive midfield-dependent squad. Salah was omnipresent, playing in the middle, passing on the sides, bringing momentum to his mates and challenges to Roma’s defense, and, ultimately, scoring the first two goals that drove energy out of De Rossi and his squad. At 2-0, the air was heavy for Roma and there was ample indication that more goals were on their way for Liverpool. The much-anticipated goals did come, tactfully and brilliantly set up by the new boy in town. Single-handedly taking on Roma’s defense, the Egyptian made his opponents look like playground kids on two different, yet uncannily similar, occasions. “We made it easy for them,” said Roma head coach Eusebio Di Francesco. With the score 4-0 at sixty minutes, football fans could be pardoned for wishing that it was Barcelona, and not Roma, that had made it to this defining stage. By the time Firmino headed Liverpool’s fifth goal pass Alisson, Anfield was on fire, thrilled by the unstoppable bravado of a breathtaking attacking side capable of scoring 10 goals in three UCL fixtures (and not in the group stage, like PSG!). Towards the end, however, some ancient Roman god breathed a bit of creative spirit in the Italian squad. Kloop’s tactical shift—withdrawing his scorer-in-chief—gave the Italians a moment of brilliance, leading them to score two goals in the last ten minutes and changing the whole texture of a game that previously looked irreversibly sealed at 5-0. With a final score of 5-2, it was unbelievable how the Italian supporters at Anfield welcomed the final whistle. They seemed convinced that, like against Barcelona some two weeks ago, the away goals were all that was needed to secure another otherworldly performance at home one week from now, another miracle that will—supposing that it does happen—have this squad’s propensity for implausibility inscribed in gold alongside football’s greatest moments. Under the shiny and smiling eyes of Roma’s unfathomably triumphant supporters, the original question resurfaced, “We came back against Barcelona; will we, again, this time?” Swept up in the moment, they triumphantly answered: “Why not?” Head manager Di Francesco hopes—or believes—that his side will be miraculous once more. “If you don’t believe anything can happen, then you shouldn’t be playing these games,” the Italian said at the end of the game, adding, “We will see a very different Roma in the second leg.”

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – During his appearance on the French show “Quotidien,” French writer and philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy praised King Mohammed VI’s religious approach to further women’s rights in Morocco, on April 24.  Invited by Yann Barthès to talk about the manifesto against “new anti-Semitism,” Lévy used his platform to laud Morocco as a positive example of moderate Islam, especially in regard to women’s rights.  Referring to the 2004 Family Code, known as Al-Mudawana, Lévy declared, “In Morocco, there has been a great revolution in women’s rights recently, and the current monarch, Mohammed VI, has given women certain rights that are very uncommon in the Muslim world.”
 “How did he do it?” added Lévy, “He asked Ulama, men of faith and wisdom to study the Quranic texts and see how they can be made with women’s freedom. Moroccan women can get divorced, they are not repudiated, they are not enslaved by their husbands.” Earlier this month, 40 women’s rights associations unanimously called for a comprehensive review of the family code, in order to put an end to some “discriminatory” provisions. “After 14 years since the application of the Family Code, given the problems and shortcomings noted and the persistence of the discriminatory nature of many provisions, we, women’s rights associations signatory to this press release, call for a total and deep revision of all the books of the Family Code, including those relating to inheritance,” read the press release.  Three hundred influential French personalities have signed the manifesto against anti-Semitism marked by “Islamist radicalization” following several hate crimes against Jewish people.   The signatories included former French President Nicolas Sarkozy; actor and filmmaker Gérard Depardieu; legendary singer, public activist, and diplomat Charles Aznavour; and iconic singer and songwriter Françoise Hardy.  Lévy explained that the proclamation does not call for abandoning the “problematic” religious texts, but rather, for re-interpreting them and putting them into context.

Washington DC – There is a strong feeling among Sahrawi refugees, Polisario’ s military and civilian officials, and  pro-independence groups that Algerians started growing restless and annoyed with the presence of their Sahrawi “guests” on their soil. Has the Polisario overstayed the Boumediene welocome? In an attempt to create a persistent security threat to destabilize its neighbor Morocco, the Algerian military promised in 1975 a small group of anti-colonial militiamen fighting Spain in the Western Sahara an independent state if they turn their arms on their brothers. Nearly forty years later, the Sahrawis are no closer to a homeland and Algiers policy of unconditional support of the Polisario separatists is in crumbling. Not since the suspicious death of El-Ouali Mustapha Sayed, founder of the Polisario separatist movement, had Algerian officials felt confounded and jumbled in their management of the Western Sahara conflict. Last month’s decision of the Polisario to set up shop in the U.N. controlled zone separating Morocco and Algeria raised military tensions in this corner of North Africa and revealed the failure of Algeria’s strategy to push for a self-determination referendum in the region as the only viable solution to the conflict. When analyzing the latest U.N. reports on the Western Sahara, it becomes abundantly evident that a referendum is problematic and independence is unviable. As such, the Sahrawi leadership in Tindouf must ask the Algerian authorities to allow the thousands of Sahrawi civilians and hundreds of armed men warehoused in the Algerian deserts resettle wherever they choose before it is too late. Recently, the pro-Polisario press in Tindouf and Algiers started a campaign to thank the Algerian government, military and people of their ongoing “support” of the Sahrawi “cause.” This was a reaction to the indifferent coverage in the Algerian media of recent setbacks suffered by the Polisario at the United Nations and the European Union. The assassination of El-Ouali in 1976, allegedly on the orders of the late Algerian President Boumediene, was Algeria’s first betrayal of its commitment to the thousands of Sahrawis who were promised independence. El-Ouali, who before his death started to doubt Algeria’s true intentions and its long-term dogma in the region, had to be neutralized. Today, as Algeria faces unprecedented political and economic decline, Sahrawi refugees and their armed guerrilla are becoming a political and economic liability for the ruling elite. Some pro-independence Sahrawis in Algeria and Morocco are sensing a new betrayal in the works. In fact, Polisario’s  incursions in the UN-patrolled buffer zones is a cry for help and an attempt by the Polisario to put their Algerian sponsors in front of their responsibilities. The Polisario, which has fought a guerrilla war against Morocco in the same zone, has maintained a symbolic presence in the area of Bir-Lahlou hoping to make it their “capital” one day. Thus, the guerrilla was hoping for a more robust support from the Algerians when they decided to move into the buffer zone. To the contrary, Algiers’s meek response to Rabat’s “provocations” sent the chills down the spine of many in the Polisario leadership. The Tindouf separatists fear the impact of Algeria’s current political impasse on the North African nation’s engagement to support the “independence” agenda. Polisario leaders are sensing a cooling in their relations with high-ranking Algerian military officials who are more concerned about the future of their nation under a disabled ailing president. Furthermore, current geopolitical realignments in Europe left Algiers isolated. Spain, a major supporter of the Polisario outside the left wing Latin American governments, moved quietly to back Morocco and France has openly supported the Kingdom in its calls  for a military intervention in the Western Sahara to stop Polisario violations. With no option to achieve either a military victory or a diplomatic resolution, the Polisario movement became a hostage to the Moroccan-Algerian regional rivalry and remains the opening show of every Algerian-Moroccan “fight.” However, there is a new and vibrant Sahrawi youth movement in  the Tindouf camps in Algeria where thousands of refugees has lingered since 1975 hoping to go back to their homes in Morocco one day. For these young Sahrawis, Algeria has become the actual impediment to their dreams and hopes of a normal life. With no prospect to achieve independence for the foreseeable future, the Sahrawis in Tindouf need to increase pressure on the Algerians to either engage Morocco in direct negations on the future of the Western Sahara and the demarcation of the Morocco-Algeria borders. If not, the DRS (Algeria’s notorious military intelligence agency) should  let the Polisario leadership negotiate with the Kingdom without interference. For its part, the Moroccan government needs to do more to convince the world community of the fact that Algeria’s involvement has severely limited the UN ability to resolve the Western Sahara conflict. The continued Algerian support for the Polisario are the only reason the conflict is still raging and the likelihood of renewed armed hostilities is always real.

Rabat – In celebration of the debut of the 13th Annual International Agriculture Fair (SIAM), the Moroccan National Society of Highways (ADM) announced the opening of new toll booth stations on the Meknes-East highway. The Meknes-East Highway already has six toll booths in service, and announced that it intended to open an additional four. The increase in toll booths reflects ADM’s goal to modernize and invest more in national highway infrastructure. ADM emphasized its wish to consolidate transport time and improve traffic circulation in areas around Meknes.  Working toward this goal, ADM created an app which allows travelers to view traffic conditions in real-time. It also offers “Tag Jawaz,” a card that travelers can load with credit in order to cut passage time through the toll booths without having to stop and pay each time they pass through. Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan opened the fair, which runs through April 28, on Tuesday. SIAM serves as an economic platform for agricultural participants to share their experiences, products, and achievements with the local and international community. The event includes seminars, forums, workshops, livestock competitions, comedy shows, and live concerts.

Rabat – Morocco has fallen two places to the 135th ranking in the 2018 Annual Freedom of the Press report, published by Reporters Without Borders (RSF). The index linked the low ranking to the alleged “strong judicial pressure on journalists.”   RSF claimed that Moroccan law enforcement “deliberately hindered the work of national and foreign media,” who were trying to cover up Hirak Rif, a protest movement for improved socio-economic services that erupted in the Al Hoceima Province in 2016 and 2017 after the death of the local fishmonger Mohcine Fikri. The RSF report added that several complaints have been filed against both citizen and professional journalists, “many of whom are currently in prison, and under prison sentences and fines.” In 2017, Morocco was ranked 133rd due to authorities use of political and economic pressure to deter local independent media from covering sensitive issues. The report added that Morocco expelled several foreign reporters in 2016, for lacking official permits. The Moroccan Ministry of Culture and Communication has deplored the report, calling RSF’s reasoning behind its ranking “baseless and lacking credibility.” The ministry added that it found RSF’s statements on alleged violations of media freedom “surprising.” Eighty-nine accredited foreign press correspondents in Morocco have acquired licenses from the journalism department in the ministry “to enable them to carry out their normal work in Moroccan territory in a natural environment,” the ministry reported, adding that several international journalists were allowed to complete their work in Morocco without interference by the public authorities. The source added that the practice of professional and responsible journalistic work is a specific, codified, and organized practice with strict professional laws and regulations.

By Sana Elouazi and Zoubida Senoussi Rabat – #Let_it_spoil (Khlih Yerib), has gone viral on Moroccan social media, as a vast number of Moroccan citizens take a stance against the high prices of some products, including Sidi Ali (mineral water), Central Laitière (dairy products) and Afriquia, a subsidy of the Akwa Group. Online protesters have taken to Twitter and Facebook, creating pages to raise awareness of the “exorbitant” prices of the three companies, denouncing the vast price margin compared to other brands selling the same products. The activists launched the electronic campaign using videos, pictures, and memes to boycott the three companies, three weeks before the beginning of Ramadan. “The campaign started among young Moroccans, especially those who can’t afford to pay more. They came up with the idea of boycotting, and they boycotted these three main products of the market,” Oussama Aslan Chakir, Founder of Casa Bel Visa Facebook page told Morocco World News. #????_????

If they could sell air to the citizens, they would do it in a heartbeat,” said one consumer on Twitter. “We have the solution to lift this injustice, the solution is easy: cut off the products of greedy companies!” The process is very easy; you only need to move awareness to wake up people,” a Moroccan journalist wrote on his Facebook account. While some believe that this campaign comes as a direct result of denouncing the high cost of living–especially ahead of Ramadan, which witnesses a high peak consumption demands of dairy products–others opposed the boycott, asserting that this call is essentially a settlement of political accounts rather than an outburst of popular anger. Moroccan media outlets, such as the Arabic daily Al Ahdath Al-Maghribiya, claimed that this campaign, which will run for over a month, is facade for a deeper political manipulation, orchestrated by what they have termed an “electronic army” close to Abdelilah Benkirane, former head of the Moroccan government and former Secretary General of the Justice and Development Party (PJD). This army, they say, is directed against the Moroccan billionaire Aziz Akhannouch, the owner of Akwa Group and Secretary General of the National Rally of Independents Party (RNI), in response to the “governmental blockage” following the October 2016 elections. In the aftermath of October 2016 elections, Benkirane failed to form a new government after the RNI, the PJD’s former ally, imposed a condition that would require the inclusion two additional political parties before the RNI would sign on.Benkirane refused the condition at the time, eventually resulting in his suspension as Morocco’s head of government. “We must not delude ourselves about the person targeted by this campaign. Centrale Danone and Holmarcom group act as sparring partners in a campaign aimed directly at Aziz Akhannouch,” a source from Akwa Group told the French speaking outlet H24info. “Our prices are among the lowest in the market. Unfortunately, a lot of pictures of price billboards in Afriquia gas stations, that circulated on social networks, were manipulated with the purpose to mislead public opinion,” the same source added. Moreover, Benkirane had previously called on Moroccans to boycott Danone products for ten days at a political rally that took place on May 24, 2014, after the French-based company, Centrale laitière, raised the price of its yogurt. His move was described by the Washington Post as “an attempt to demonstrate his own sympathy for the everyday struggles of the Moroccan people in the absence of the ability to enact reforms that actually address these challenges.” Mounir Bensaleh, the president of Anfass Democratic movement, told the media outlet LeSiteInfo, that the idea of boycott is an effective and universal weapon, “except in this case, as boycotting products belonging to certain politicians, in particular, shows that political intentions lie beneath.” “Involving the high cost of consumer products in settling political accounts is totally absurd,” Bensalah said, lambasting the governments of Benkirane and Saad El Othmani as solely responsible for the high cost of the products following the liberalization of prices, which allowed large companies to dominate the market. According to Abdellatif Jouhari, the chairman of Bank al-Maghrib, energy costs for Moroccans have also risen due to the liberalization of oil pricing policies and the lifting of subsidies, which allowed the per-liter cost to vary with market trends. During a press conference held in June 2017,  Lahcen Daoudi, Minister of General Affairs and Governance, stated that “citizens do not take advantage of the liberalization” of hydrocarbon prices enacted in December 2015 under a compensation fund reform, which was introduced by the previous government. The campaign also targets Meriem Bensalah Chekroun, former president of the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM) and who is currently the General Manager of Oulmès Mineral Waters, a subsidiary of the family holding company Holmarcom, which she joined in 1990. “We are well aware of this campaign and we don’t know how it started. When it comes to the price of water bottles, it is the same for all the brands. We don’t know why consumers chose to get at us and not at the other brands,” Brahim El Mekroumi, Head of Research and Development Department of Sidi Ali- Oulmès told MWN. The communication departments of both Centrale Laitière and Akwa Group did not reply to MWN’s requests for comment. On Tuesday, the Minister of Economy and Finance, Mohamed Boussaid, strongly denounced the boycott campaign during a parliamentary session, stating,“we must encourage business and Moroccan products, unlike these bewildered [people] who call for boycotting Moroccan companies that are structured [to] employ citizens and pay their taxes.” His comment sparked a wave of criticism on social networks from the “bewildered” online activists.

Rabat – As the 2026 World Cup bid vote draws near, the practical concerns and deeper safety implications of Islamophobia in the US could jeopardize the United bid prior to the June 13 vote. Despite FIFA’s claims that the World Cup focus on football, rather than “geopolitics,” international concerns surrounding Trump’s travel ban and the corresponding rise of anti-Muslim hate crimes in North America continue to trouble global football fans. Islamophobic fear-mongering has served as a benchmark of US President Trump’s stance on refugees, immigration, and anti-terrorism policy since the early days of his campaign. Trump’s avid use of social media has regularly stirred political backlash on an array of issues. However, his brash Islamophobic public statements, which includes his endorsement of the far-right, known anti-Muslim British propaganda group, Britain First, has generated concern throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Tensions spiked when the American president called for a complete shutdown on Muslim immigration in January 2017,  which he later applied to six Muslim-majority countries, issuing a travel ban by executive order. Since its original issuance, the ban has shifted to cover Iran, Chad, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and Somalia, with additional travel restrictions placed on North Korea and Venezuela. Protests in the streets and courtrooms alike stirred the US in the months that followed the executive order, as lower courts challenged the legality of the travel ban and citizens protested the division of loved ones and general immigration insecurity throughout the country. The long-term implications of the ban have also been reverberating throughout the football world, with the World Cup bid vote less than two months away. In a press conference held in March, US Soccer Federation President Carlos Cordeiro emphasized FIFA’s lack of a response to Trump’s travel ban and public xenophobic sentiments. “This is not geopolitics. We are talking about football,” said the chief of the US federation.  Though FIFA did not directly respond to MWN’s queries on the effects of the travel ban for Muslim participants and spectators, FIFA President Gianni Infantino already answered the question last year.  The FIFA chief expressed his concerns over Trump’s immigration policy in March 2017, when he warned the United bid that Trump’s travel ban could prevent the state from hosting the tournament in 2026. “Teams who qualify for a World Cup need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup. That is obvious,” Infantino told British press, emphasizing the incompatibility of Trump’s policy with FIFA regulations. The chairman of the United bid, Sunil Gulati, echoed Infantino’s statement in January, “This is not only about our stadiums and hotels. It is about perceptions of America…it is a difficult time for theworld,” he said. MWN reached out to prominent human rights organizations to better understand how the travel ban could set a new precedent in the football world or, alternatively, serve as a basis for the United joint bid disqualification. Human Rights Watch (HRW) responded, characterizing the travel ban as clearly discriminatory and predicting that it will serve as an obvious barrier to football fans hoping to cheer on their respective national teams.  Today, the Supreme Court of the United States will evaluate Trump’s travel ban. Several lower courts and states,  including Hawaii, have urged SCOTUS to block the ban, describing it as a violation of federal immigration law and the US Constitution.  MWN contacted the US embassy in Morocco for further comment regarding the potential barriers the travel ban could create for the United 2026 World Cup bid, but did not receive a response. Beyond structural barriers alone, the travel ban exemplifies deeper security implications for Muslim spectators. In addition to the heightened surveillance that Muslims in the US have faced for the previous two decades, derogatory public speech and Islamophobic hate crimes have seen a significant uptick over the past few years. A report by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) revealed that hate crimes in the US dramatically increased in 2016, with 6,100 incidents documented, an increase of more than 5,800 from the previous year. Anti-Muslim hate crimes composed more than 54 percent of the nationwide total.   Hate-motivated crimes extend to the other United bid nations: Canada experienced a 28-percent increase in hate crimes in 2017, according to CBC Canada. Data from Canada Statistics reports that hate crimes in Canada in 2016 increased for the third consecutive year, particularly targeting people of South Asian, Asian, and Arab descent. Try as he might to depoliticize the football world’s premier event, US Soccer’s Cordeiro has done little to assuage international concerns regarding the practical limitations of a travel ban and apprehension over spectator safety surrounding the tournament. His dissociation of “geopolitics” from the football field ignores the fact that the sporting world has always reflected various forms of discrimination among athletes, coaches, managerial staff, and spectators. One need only to look at the Olympic Games–Jesse Owens in 1936, the US women’s basketball team in 1976–to see how athletics reflect the historical moment. With mounting concerns for spectator and athlete safety, particularly for Muslims and Arabs more generally, perhaps the issue of discrimination should be elevated, rather than ignored at this stage, so that come summer 2026 football fans can enjoy the best possible tournament. Despite its leader status at the outset of the bid race and claims of infrastructural superiority, United 2026 appears to be losing steam, as global football federations pledge their support to the Moroccan bid. As the countdown to the World Cup bid vote draws near,  MWN has developed a series of articles to tackle root issues that will determine the future of World Cup 2026, when 211 football federations from around the world will gather for the final Moscow vote on June 13.

Rabat – Buffon has clarified his situation with Mehdi Benatia. The Moroccan-French football player Mehdi Benatia continues to make the headlines following the Juventus losses. After being targeted by the media for the “controversial penalty” story, the captain of the national team is dealing with another bash.   Yesterday, several Italian media reported that the captain of Juventus, Gianluigi Buffon spoke out against the Atlas Lion, throwing shade after the team’s Naples defeat. Buffon reportedly returned to the locker room at the conclusion of the game and poured out his frustrations over the loss to his teammates, including Benatia. Benatia did not appreciate Buffon’s criticism, allegedly raising his tone in response, according to Italian press, including Tuttosport, which reports a violent altercation between the two players. According to the Italian press agency EFE, no fight broke out in the locker room between Benatia and the Italian player.   “This is clearly invented gossip over the defeat of a team, they want to destabilize the team and make us lose our trust and unity,” said Buffon, denying that he blamed Benatia for the team’s defeat by Napoli. Buffon went on to define his teammate as a “very respectful” person on and off the field. Since he has been living in Italy, the Moroccan football player has dealt with criticism. A week ago, the Juventus defenseman was harshly criticized by Italian comedian, Maurizio Crozza, following the Real Madrid-Juventus confrontation. In 2017, he was called a “Moroccan sh*t” on his headphones in the middle of the interview. Benatia, 31, has spent most of his career in Italy, where he has played for Udinese, AC Roma, and Juventus. He joined the latter two years ago on loan from German football giant Bayern Munich. “El Capitano” must keep his head in the game, given the three fast-approaching pre-World Cup friendly games ahead. Leading the Atlas Lions, Benatia will battle the Ukrainian, Estonian, and Slovakian teams only a week prior to the kickoff for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

The photo was posted on Maradona’s official Facebook page on April 21, perhaps serving as a boon for Morocco’s bid to host the World Cup, as both of the legends have millions of followers and inspire many players and spectators in the football world. Maradona is known for his love for Morocco, as well as his admiration for the Moroccans and their King Mohammed VI. The star as he was filmed dancing to the Moroccans rhythms during his stay on November 6, 2015, at the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Moroccan Green March, during which he performed a gala match in Laayoune. Just as Maradona predicted the qualification of Morocco to the Russia 2018 World Cup, shared in a press conference preceding the match, he maintains there is still hope for the team to reach the 2018 World Cup Finals. He has also expressed his intentions and wishes to become a coach for the Moroccan national football team. The football superstar also talked about Morocco hosting the World Cup in 2026, explaining that it would be quite difficult, even though “Morocco’s infrastructure has developed strongly.” Regarding the North African bid, Roberto Carlos recently joined the list of ambassadors alongside Samuel Eto’o, Didier Drogba, and El Hadji Diouf to campaign and promote Morocco’s bid. The country is also expecting Egyptian Mohamed Salah and Portuguese Cristiano Ronaldo to join its list of ambassadors. Could Maradona and Rivaldo join that list?

Rabat- The 15th annual conference of the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCA) launched on April 24, at the Mövenpick Hotel in Marrakech, rallying investors and business leaders interested in the array of investment opportunities available on the African continent. AVCA, which describes its annual conferences as the leading and largest global private equity gathering, has a vision of promoting and stimulating an investment-driven development in Africa. This year’s conference marked the attendance of “over 600 leaders in capital-investment, representing over $1300 billion in collective assets,” said a press release that AVCA shared with Morocco World News. The source added that the conference convened panelists and leading business leaders who discussed crucial topics relating to investment and sustainable development in Africa. In addition to investors and business professionals, the conference also gathered a number of high ranking Moroccan officials. Lamia Boutaleb, the Secretary of State at the Ministry of Tourism, gave the conference’s opening speech, speaking about the multiple opportunities for investment in tourism, particularly in Morocco. Applauding Moroccan efforts made to develop and rejuvenate its tourism industry, Mrs. Boutaleb commented that Morocco is still in need of a sounder capital-investment program to help upgrade its current investment-attractiveness and performance level. Also speaking at the opening ceremony, the executive director of BMCE Bank of Africa, Brahim Benjelloun-Touimi, remarked on the numerous investment potentials in “less visible sectors,” such health and education. Other panelists expressed their positive evaluation and upbeat expectations regarding the economic performance of North Africa. “The region has endured roller-coaster years, but investors’ trust has been regained and North Africa has grown more attractive,” said Ziad Oueslati, co-founder of AfricInvest. Other panel topics included sustainable energy, inclusive growth, job creation, continental connectivity, as well as the necessity to further stimulate and inspire capital investments in “fragile and conflict-filled regions.” Throughout their varied presentations and commentary, all participants echoed the shared conviction that job creation and sustainable and inclusive growth must be put at the heart of any investment venture on the continent. Concluding the conference, Michelle Kathryn Essomé, AVCA’s General Director, reminded participants that the 15th AVCA-organized “global rally” happens at a critical juncture in a continent that showcases “boundless investment opportunities. And despite some troubling and challenging recent years in the recent past, “Africa has re-won the confidence of investors,” Mrs. Essomé argued. She added that AVCA will continue being the go-to advocate, promoter, and “catalyst for a capital-investment in Africa.” “We believe in the power of private capital,” Mrs. Essomé said, claiming that “Africa is the most dynamic and attractive emerging market in the world.”

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat- An ad sponsored by the Nestlé company, #BghitNtezewaj (“I want to get married”) has sparked condemnation for sexist messaging across social media platforms. The ad features a mother looking for a wife for her son. To find the best match, the mother tests a group of girls in cooking and house management skills. Viewers have deemed the ad the Moroccan version of the French reality show, “Who Wants to Marry my Son,” which follows a group of single men who ask their mothers to help them find their future wives. “Come on show me what you’ve got,” the mother says, as the girls compete to make the best desserts, thus proving their top housewife potential. Facebook commentators are less than thrilled. One post reads: “This is an insult to all women, please re-post to put an end to this farce.” 
Another Facebook user commented, “[The Nestle ads and others like them] are all clichés, derogatory to every rational human being and more particularly to women.” She goes on saying “It is a nonsensical competition where the girls compete over Sidi Anas, the perfect man, as if they were his concubines.”   
Yet another user writes, “Tell me that the happy ending is Sidi Anas marrying the 4 of the ladies at once because they all look like great cooks.” Tell me that the happy ending is Sidi Anas marrying the 4 of the ladies at once because they all look like great cook @NestleMaroc #baghintzewej #ShameOnNestle — Aïcha Del-lero (@Aichadell) April 24, 2018     #Baghintzewej, la websérie de Nestlé, est-elle un concentré de sexisme? https://t.co/CThLuOAWXE — Buzz Gossip (@BuzzetGossip) April 25, 2018  The nutrition magazine, Food Magazine, has taken provided a platform on their official Facebook page for the Nestlé brand manager, Salma Myar, to respond: “The motivation behind this ad is to give our customers ideas of recipes to use through an advertisement that is not classic, as it is usually during weddings that many of us make desserts,”  she explained “it was intended to be a funny subject for debate because of its stereotypical approach.” Although commentators continue to debate the effectiveness of the strategy, several Moroccans maintain that Nestlé’s gendered messaging is unacceptable, regardless of the company’s reasoning: “Whether or not @nestle‘s Morocco franchise has intended this to be serious, it pushes forth a problematic trope of the docile and submissive wife, especially in a country where measures to criminalize and prevent domestic violence have a long way to go.”   Here’s a graphic of the show sponsored by @nestle called “I want to get married,” where the mother places an ad for her son “Sidi Anas,” and where he gets to sit back, relax, taste food, and marry the one who cooks best pic.twitter.com/O7neH6uqu0 — Samia Errazzouki (@S_Errazzouki) April 23, 2018

Rabat – As tensions build around the international community’s position on the status of Western Sahara, Britain remains committed to international law and regulations. British Minister of State for the Middle East and North Africa, Alistair Burt, reaffirmed Britain’s non-recognition of Western Sahara as “occupied” during a parliamentary session earlier this week. Mr. Burt’s comments came in response to a question by Labor MP Steve McCabe. In his question, Mr. McCabe referenced Britain’s and Europe’s agreements with Morocco—especially the fisheries deal, saying that such deals or agreements constitute a violation of the Sahrawi people’s right to their resources. The Labor MP went on to call the agreements an “extraction of Sahrawi natural resources.” Answering the Labor MP’s question and further comments, the Minister of State maintained Britain’s official position on the Sahara issue, reminding Mr. McCabe that the British government policies remain faithful to Western Sahara’s unofficial status in international law. “The Government of Britain does not consider Western Sahara an occupied territory,” he said, before hastening to add that Britain—like many others in the international community—see a large of part of said territory as “disputed,” but “not occupied.” In an effort to further clarify the UK’s position on the question, the minister referred to his meeting with Morocco’s foreign affairs minister, Nasser Bourita earlier this year. He said that, upon meeting with his Moroccan counterpart, he reaffirmed his country’s commitment to finding a lasting, sustainable, and a feasible political settlement to the Sahara question. Britain, Mr. Burt added, wishes “for a mutually acceptable solution.” “We expect that all the parties involved in Western Sahara, including companies, operate within the framework of international law, and for the benefit of local populations,” he concluded.

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat – The US Supreme Court will evaluate President Donald Trump’s travel ban–the proposed set of immigration policies that prevents most Iranians, Libyans, Somalis, Syrians, and Yemenis from entering the United States–this Wednesday. Tensions over President Trump’s travel ban are expected to culminate on Wednesday, when Supreme Court justices finally evaluate the lawfulness of his immigration policies targeting a number of Muslim-majority countries. Trump announced the current travel ban last September, which, if approved would apply to Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. Venezuela and North Korea would also be subject to restrictions, though this portion of the ban has not been challenged in court. Trump first sought to implement his “Muslim-ban” immigration policy after taking office in January 2017. The travel ban represents the third draft of the order, following a series of objections in lower courts. Changes include the removal of several countries from the list, including Chad and Sudan.  Currently, Hawaii is the “lead challenger” of the ban, arguing that it violates federal immigration law and the US Constitution, due its display of religious bias. A three-judge panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals deemed that the ban outside of the president’s jurisdiction, and referred to it as “an override of broad swaths of immigration laws that Congress has used its considered judgement to enact,” reports CNN. Hawaii Lieutenant Governor Doug Chin stated, “Right now, the travel ban is keeping families apart. It is degrading our values by subjecting a specific set of people to be denigrated and marginalized.” In 2017, Trump declared on Twitter that ideally, bans “should be far larger, tougher and more specific – but stupidly that would not be politically correct!” Proponents of the ban have backed this notion, and argued that President Trump’s policies would protect the US from Islamist militants. They maintain preventing acts of terrorism should be a top priority.  Opponents have argued that Trump’s ban is an expression of hostility toward Muslims. They point to Trump’s statements conflating terrorism and Islam as evidence, including Trump’s 2016 tweet, “I think Islam hates us,” and videos that Trump retweeted expressing anti-Muslim sentiments.  John Bellinger, a former legal advisor for the US Department of State was quoted “I think the travel ban is a terribly misguided policy that appeared to be motivated more by a political intention of the president than by any real national security need.”  The travel ban case pushes the boundaries of America’s commitment to religious and racial tolerance, while also raising the question of executive power in matters of immigration. Although Morocco is not currently included in the travel ban, the “anti-Muslim” nature of Trump’s previous sentiments and policies instills uncertainty about the possibility of future restrictions.  Depending on the Supreme Court outcome, Trump’s travel ban could come into play in June, when international football federations vote on the host country for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. FIFA President Gianni Infantino expressed his concerns over Trump’s immigration policy in March 2017, directly warning the United bid that Trump’s travel ban could prevent the state from hosting the tournament in 2026. Infantino has emphasized that Trump’s policy is completely incompatible with FIFA’s regulations, saying “Teams who qualify for a World Cup need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup. That is obvious.”

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat – French columnist and television personality Enora Malagré wants to adopt a child from Morocco, as she is unable to have any of her own, reports Moroccan newsource Plurielle. “I cannot birth any children, so I will adopt,” Malagré was quoted on the French show “Les Grandes Gueules,” which aired on radio RMC.  The French entertainer suffers from a condition known as endometriosis, which she says “has ruined [her] chances of birthing children.” Nevertheless, the 37-year-old has not given up her dream of raising children. She says that for her, adoption is the perfect solution. In her adoptive search, Malagré has turned to Morocco. “I started the adoption process a short time ago,” she explains, “I expect it to be long. I am trying to adopt in Morocco because I am very attached to the country, and for other personal reasons.”  Endometriosis is a disorder where tissue grows outside of the uterus inside of it. The “dislocated” tissue grows as it normally would inside of the uterus, thickening, breaking down, and bleeding during each menstrual cycle. However the tissue is trapped inside the body, and unable to exit, causing severe pain.  Endometriosis can affect the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and also the pelvic tissues. As a result, fertility issues are common. Malagré encourages women to not suffer from the disorder in silence, and to seek medical treatment to help alleviate their symptoms. She believes that many women are embarrassed about their condition, and seeks to combat the stigma surrounding it.

Rabat – Casablanca’s Court of First Instance has delivered a six-month sentence to Afaf Bernani, one of the complainants in the Taoufik Bouachrine case. The complainant will serve her sentence for accusing the judicial police (BNPJ) of falsifying her statement. Bernani is one of the alleged victims who accused Bouachrine of rape, sexual assault, and violence. She accused Morocco’s judicial police of falsifying her statement during investigations in March, claiming that she had never been assaulted by Bouachrine. The complainant received a MAD 1000 fine, in addition to her jail sentence. In March, the Public Prosecutor of Casablanca’s Court of Appeal, Najim Bensami announced in a press conference announced his intention to prosecute Bernani. He told the press that Bernani confirmed that she was sexually harassed by Bouachrine and that the police have a video of her initial statement, in which she allegedly confirmed that she was assaulted. Bouachrine is facing heavy charges for sexual harassment, gendered violence and rape. Judicial police have said that they have 50 videos backing the charges facing Bouachrine. The police also added that the videos were recorded by the detained journalist himself. 
Bouachrine’s defense team has been making the case for their client’s innocence, claiming that the footage evidence have been “falsified.” However, the Public Prosecutor of the Casablanca court claimed the appeal against judicial police “has no legal basis.”

By Charles Kestenbaum Rabat – The Moroccan American Network held its Third International Media Forum on April 20, 2018, on the 13th floor of the prestigious National Press Club in downtown Washington, D.C. The event focused on an especially current and very global theme widely referred to as “Fake News.” The roundtable discussion event was well attended by a diverse audience of Moroccans and Americans and offered a broad range of insights through two speaker panels, one addressing fake news in the US context, and the other addressing it in the international arena.  The program was devised under the leadership of MAN President Mohamed El Hajjam, CEO of AV Actions Inc., and American lawyer, Elisabeth Myers who MC’d the forum and serves also an advisor to the group.   The first panel focused on the broader concepts of how fake news is defined today; how it has evolved from ancient roots in propaganda and disinformation; and how the new all-encompassing social media are redefining what fake news is and how much more impact it has on how the public sees events in particular, and the world in general.  The second panel narrowed its focus significantly to help the audience better apply these concepts to the media situation as it exists today in Morocco and the Middle East. As an outside observer who has both lived in Morocco and has an extensive background in Middle East media (MA in Mass Communications from American University in Cairo; 4 years at NBC News Beirut and the Cairo bureau), I was struck by how similar many of the concerns, issues and opportunities the panel identified as relevant to Morocco are to those in the U.S. The panelists noted the similarities and differences between Morocco as a constitutional monarchy versus the U.S. as a democratic republic. One surprising highlight of the afternoon was the official presentation of the Moroccan flag to the National Press Club by Minister Delegate Mustapha El Khalfi, the Minister Delegate to the Head of Government in Morocco responsible for Relations with Parliament and Civil Society.  Myron Belkind, an international journalist and a former President of the National Press Club, received the flag on behalf of the Club. He said that he was “thrilled” to have a program about “fake news” put on at the Club by the Moroccan American Network. “Fake news,” he said, “is a cancer on society and the only thing that could bring down a democracy.”  He added that the Moroccan flag would from now on be “displayed proudly at the Club along with all the other flags of the world.”  Minister el Khalfi, who is also the official Spokesperson for the Moroccan government, gave a presentation focused on “fake news” in the context of the Sahara. He is also the author of a book entitled “Moroccan Sahara: Realities and Illusions of the Conflict.” He discussed the myths and mistruths about the Western Sahara and signed copies of his book.   All in all, I was struck by the up-to-date technical awareness of the Moroccans at the event. Unlike many of the Middle Eastern countries, Morocco emerged from this event as a real pioneer in the development and engagement of social media and news – both “real and fake.”  Morocco is making strides in developing the tools necessary to investigate and combat fake news, according to Fadwa Kamal, an expert in digital research who is a fellow with Code for Africa.  Just as Google and Microsoft have developed open source tools in the US to verify facts and sources, efforts in Morocco are beginning to develop such tools, said Kamal. She offered several recommendations to further this effort. Moroccan lawyer Issam Ibramini highlighted the legal reforms that are being made in Morocco with respect to free speech and journalism. Carol Van Dam, an American journalist and radio talk show host for Voice of America, emphasized the importance of better education in combatting fake, false, and misleading news.  “Fake news is a cancer on the world,” she said. People need to be taught to exercise critical thinking and not believe everything they read on social media, she added.  The forum highlighted that the U.S. and Morocco can and should cooperate on both the governmental and private commercial levels to ensure that both countries’ citizens are free to engage in all aspects of social communications while also being protected on an individual and societal level from invasive, disruptive, and politically motivated purveyors of what is included today in the catch-all term “Fake News.”  However, the solution lies not in censorship or limiting free speech, according to lawyer and law professor Elisabeth Myers, who is a senior editor and advisor for Morocco World News and moderated the first panel.  Rather, she says, “we should focus on encouraging more and accurate speech, calling out and exposing distortions of the facts, and providing effective tools in the search for the truth.” The Moroccan American Network is a network of individuals dedicated to creating opportunities for small business in the U.S. and Morocco, according to MAN President Mohammed El Hajjam.  Focussing on three areas — small business, media, and cultural heritage, he says the Network “facilitates understanding and awareness through dialogue, forums, and events, and serves as a platform to educate U.S. media, the American public, and U.S. government officials.”   For example, the Moroccan American Network’s upcoming CEO Summit 3 on May 10th, also at the Press Club in Washington, D.C., will address “Shaping the Future of Africa: Challenges and Prospects.” The Network’s executive team consists of American and Moroccan-American advocates and lobbyists, lawyers, journalists, media and PR professionals and filmmakers, and think tank experts with 100+ combined years of experience on Capitol Hill and in international lobbying, national and local media, law and diplomacy, think tanks, and cutting-edge technology.  It sponsors delegation visits and exchange trips between the U.S. and Morocco and engages in partnerships, including memoranda of understanding, solidifying relationships among sister cities, universities, and think tanks.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat- Moroccan-French comedian Gad Elmaleh is under fire for racist portrayal, following the rebroadcasting of a skit known as “The Chinese” from his “Everything is Possible” show with French co-star Kev Adams. Controversy from the comedian’s “racist past” continues to haunt him, as the 2016 skit sparked outrage following its rerun on the French television network W9, on April 18. 
The accusations were mainly incited by the Collectif Asiatique Decolonial (CAD), which “defends people Asian descent people in the fight against state racism at the intersection of oppression that they experience,” as stated in the organization’s Facebook page. CAD called on Netflix to drop El-Maleh’s new special, titled “American Dream,” over instances of racism in previous programs. He also attacked an Asian French DJ who wrote a paper against his racist show
He took pictures from her Instagram and mocked her pic.twitter.com/3xBmOyZo1h — Collectif Asiatique Décolonial (@AsiatDecolonial) April 20, 2018  The 47 year-old was quick to apologize for his portrayal of Asian people on the “Touche Pas à Mon Poste” show and made amends to the French Asian DJ Louise Chen, whom he had previously “mocked,” on April 23.  El-Maleh admitted his mistake and maintained that he never had any malicious intentions at heart, especially after experiencing racism first hand. “I can talk to you about racism, and about what I have been through for years,” said El-Maleh to his interviewer Cyril Hanouna. “I apologize to Louise, if she’s watching, for being inconsiderate because I never intended to hurt her,” he added.

Rabat- Morocco’s National Council of the conservative Istiqlal party called on all political parties and representative institutions to defend Morocco’s territorial integrity during a meeting held on Saturday, April 21, in Rabat. During the meeting, the National Council of the Istiqlal (Independence) party focused on Moroccan mobilization to support and defend the country’s territorial integrity. In this framework, the party highlighted the need for regional unification of the southern provinces through the implementation of Morocco’s Western Sahara Autonomy Plan, which seeks to find a fair solution to the issue of Western Sahara. The Council was firm regarding its vision to defend the national cause and strengthen the kingdom’s borders, as it urged the UN Security Council to hold accountable the Polisario activities in the restricted area of the buffer zone by ending their illegal maneuvers. The meeting also condemned the Polisario Front provocations and recent attempts to change the status of the Guerguerat, Bir Lahlou, Tifariti, and El Mahbes regions. Additionally, the Istiqlal National Council insisted on the necessity of expanding the national economy through the creation of jobs and improvement of working conditions for employees, following the April 2011 agreement dedicated to enhancing the situation of public and private sectors in Morocco. As a side-note, the meeting was marked by the election of Chiba Mae El Aynayne as chair of the National Council of Istiqlal party.

Rabat – Despite a sluggish start, Morocco’s 2018 agricultural campaign has experienced an impressive upswing in production levels in recent months, suggesting that a bountiful harvest that may double returns in May 2018, exceeding the expectations of Moroccan authorities, according to Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture, Aziz Akhannouch, on the sidelines of a conference held yesterday in Meknes. Speaking about the challenges in Moroccan agriculture over the last ten years, Mr. Akhannouch said that productivity this year may produce the best agricultural yield in last decade, with productivity levels set to reach 98.2 million quintals. According to the minister, this provisional figure represents an increase of 3 percent compared to 2017 results. The figures entail three different categories of cereals: 48.1 million quintals of soft wheat, 22.8 million for durum wheat, and 27.3 million of barley. The crop yield stands out this year, as a smaller total area of arable lands has decreased results in previous years. While farmers and wheat growers worked on 5.4 million hectares last year, only 4.5 million hectares were used in this year agricultural campaign, the Minister reported, further hinting that this means an average of 21.8 quintals per hectare—an increase of 23 percent with respect to the previous campaign. For the agriculture minister, these improved and “exceptional results” reveal the massive human and financial efforts invested by farmers and agricultural officials. “This exceptional result showcases [Morocco’s] great and intervention capabilities, which have developed since the launching of the Green Morocco Plan. Launched in 2018, the Green Morocco Plan has been instrumental in transforming Moroccan agriculture, with grand investments and consequential results. Presenting the plan’s results from the last ten years, the minister said that the Green Morocco Plan has invested MAD 105 billion in the agriculture sector over the past decade. He went on to mention that such a considerable investment has been particularly pivotal in helping the sector grow by 7.3 percent since 2008, a figure that is more than double of Morocco’s average growth rate of 3.2 percent. More than a noticeable improvement in crop yields, however, the Green Morocco Plan has also helped employ over 250,000 persons, thus considerably decreasing the rate of rural depopulation. With job and food security, less people are willing to migrate to bid cities, Mr. Akhannouch noted. Reporting yesterday on Morocco’s “bountiful harvest,” Bloomberg hailed the country’s impressive “wheat outlook,” saying that such results allow Morocco’s wheat market to shed dependence on products from France, Russia, or Ukraine—Europe’s and the world’s top exporters of wheat and wheat-related products. “Morocco is poised to have a bountiful wheat harvest in 2018, and that may mean another slow year for the North African country’s top suppliers from Russia to France and Ukraine,” the outlet wrote, suggesting that the Green Moroccan Plan can, if the recent performance is sustained, propel Morocco beyond self-sufficiency into the category of wheat exporter.

In an interview with AFP, the CAF president promoted the North African bid, stressing that Morocco’s bid would serve the interests of Europe at different levels, due to its time zone and the short travel distance between European countries and Morocco. The African bid has the support of many countries, including European countries. The bid committee is looking forward of collecting more support from all corners of the world to be eligible to host the tournament. The countdown for the vote, which will take place officially on June 13 in Moscow, has already begun, with 211 national soccer federations from around the world pledging support to their favorite bids. FIFA and the voting federations will decide the winning bid based on several criteria, including,  hotel facilities, infrastructure, and commercial capacity.

Rabat – Natalie Portman isn’t happy about Israel’s policy concerning “recent events.” The Hollywood actress born in Israel has refused to attend the “Genesis Prize” ceremony to accept her million-dollar prize. The Genesis Award Foundation announced the cancellation of the ceremony on Friday, explaining that Portman would not make the trip because of recent events “extremely painful” for her related to Israel, which prevented her from “taking part with a free conscience.” The foundation said it “admires her humanity, and respects her right to publicly disagree with the policies of the government of Israel.” The Genesis award is annually given to Jewish people who have attained recognition and excellence in their fields. The prize was created with the objective of inspiring and developing a sense of pride and belonging among young unaffiliated Jews throughout the world, according to the Genesis Prize Foundation. The award is sometimes referred to as the “Jewish Nobel Prize.” The 36-year-old actress didn’t want to be associated with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was supposed to speak at the ceremony.   “My decision not to attend the Genesis Prize ceremony has been mischaracterized by others,” said Portman, referring to links drawn between Portman’s decision and larger social protests against Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory. “Let me speak for myself. I chose not to attend because I did not want to appear as endorsing Benjamin Netanyahu,” she said in a statement. The 2010 Oscar winner explained that she has the right to be critical of the leadership in Israel “without wanting to boycott the entire nation.” “The mistreatment of those suffering from today’s atrocities is simply not in line with my Jewish values. Because I care about Israel, I must stand up against violence, corruption, inequality, and abuse of power,” she added. Netanyahu’s Likud party reacted to Portman’s statements Saturday night, denouncing the “hypocrisy” of the actress. In a statement, the prime minister accused Natalie Portman of “talking about human rights while participating in festivals in countries that censor films and whose respect for human rights is much lower than that of Israel.” Moreover, Israel’s Minister of Infrastructure, Energy and Water, Yuval Steinitz discibred Portman’s attitude bordering on anti-Semitism. “She plays the game of the haters of Israel and those who seek to destroy the State of Israel,” he added. My decision not to attend the Genesis Prize ceremony has been mischaracterized by others. Let me speak for myself. I chose not to attend because I did not want to appear as endorsing Benjamin Netanyahu, who was to be giving a speech at the ceremony. By the same token, I am not part of the BDS movement and do not endorse it. Like many Israelis and Jews around the world, I can be critical of the leadership in Israel without wanting to boycott the entire nation. I treasure my Israeli friends and family, Israeli food, books, art, cinema, and dance. Israel was created exactly 70 years ago as a haven for refugees from the Holocaust. But the mistreatment of those suffering from today’s atrocities is simply not in line with my Jewish values. Because I care about Israel, I must stand up against violence, corruption, inequality, and abuse of power. Please do not take any words that do not come directly from me as my own. This experience has inspired me to support a number of charities in Israel. I will be announcing them soon, and I hope others will join me in supporting the great work they are doing.

Rabat – Saad Lamjarred has once again made the headlines, but this time it has nothing to do with either his music or his rape accusations. On Sunday, the Moroccan singer posted a picture wearing a very unusual accessory on his Instagram page, which has led him to be mocked and criticized harshly on social media. The singer of “Ghazali” made some interesting fashion choices when he appeared with a delicate crystal teardrop earring hanging from his left ear. Unfortunately, Lamjarred didn’t get the reaction that he expected from his 6 million followers.  “You look like a woman,” “Your earring is awful,” “You should be ashamed of yourself wearing women’s earring,” “You look ridiculous,” people commented below the picture.  However, Lamjarred’s fans defended him saying, “I think it’s brave and bold to wear this earring,” “Don’t listen to the haters, you look good.” Saad Lamjarred has made some other questionable choices these past few weeks. The pop star missed his court date at the Tribunal of Grande Instance in Paris, ducking his summons issued by the lawyer of his alleged rape victim, Laura Prioul, on April 9. ???? ?????? ???? ?? #????_????_????? #saadlamjarred1 #love_my_fans_forever_and_ever @kamalaitphotography @ayoubenji A post shared by  saadlamjarred (@saadlamjarred1) on Apr 21, 2018 at 12:04pm PDT

Washington D.C. – The draft resolution the Security Council is expected to vote upon this Wednesday to renew the mandate of the UN peacekeeping mission in the Western Sahara, known as MINURSO, puts heavy pressure on the Polisario and calls upon it to refrain from taking any actions that might cause instability in the region. Since the release of the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ annual report on the Situation Regarding the Western Sahara on March 29, Rabat stepped up its rhetoric against the Polisario’s illegal actions in the area east of Morocco’s defense wall, including the buffer zone. Morocco’s diplomatic offensive comes on the heels of repeated attempts by the Polisario to change the status quo of the region by erecting buildings in the region of Tifariti and Bir Lahlou – which it erroneously labels “liberated territory” – in addition to its incursions into the zone of Guerguerate in the buffer zone. During Morocco’s discussions with members of the Security Council and the United Nations Secretariat earlier this month, Morocco’s message was clear: if the United Nations failed to uphold the terms of the 1991 ceasefire, Morocco would take all necessary steps, including the use of military force, to prevent the Polisario from gaining a foothold in the whole area east of its defense wall. Based on the language of the draft resolution, the UN appears to be taking Morocco’s calls seriously and striving to avoid an escalation of hostilities in the region. To the Polisario and Algeria’s dismay, the draft resolution not only addresses the Polisario’s incursions into the Guerguerate, but also its attempts to impose a fait accompli “liberation” of the zones of Bir Lahlou andTifariti. Operative paragraph 2bis of the draft resolution expresses the concern of the Security Council regarding the Polisario’s violations of the ceasefire agreement and calls on the group to withdraw immediately from the Guerguerate. This paragraph echoes one of the paragraphs contained in the UNSG’s annual report on the issue in which the Secretary General called upon the Polisario to withdraw from the area. In addition, rebuking the Polisario’s misleading statements in the media in recent years with regards to the so-called “liberated territories,” the Security Council expresses in paragraph 2ter its concern about the Polisario’s intention to relocate part of its administrative operations from the Tindouf camps to Bir Lahlou and calls on the separatist movement to “refrain from any such destabilizing actions.” On the other hand, the draft resolution adds a new paragraph in which it calls on neighboring states (Algeria and Mauritania) to increase their contribution to the UN-led political process. Operative paragraph 8bis “calls upon the neighboring states to increase their engagement in the negotiating process and to fulfill their special and essential role in supporting the political process.” While this paragraph echoes the recommendation contained in the UNSG’s report in which he called for an increase role of Algeria in the political process, retaining it in the final version of the resolution would constitute a diplomatic victory for Morocco which has long called on the UN to view Algeria as full-fledged party in the political process. Morocco has always considered the dispute over the Western Sahara a result of a historic misunderstanding that was created in part following the Sand War of 1963 in which the Moroccan army humiliated its Algerian counterpart. The war, which broke out following Algeria’s refusal to redraw the borders of the two countries after its independence in 1962, left an indelible mark in the memory of the current political elite governing the country. There is unanimity in Morocco and among scholars around the world that the dispute will not be resolved if Algeria is not involved. In a letter that King Mohammed VI sent to the UNSG earlier this month, he emphasized Algeria’s prominent role in the prolongation of the Western Sahara conflict: “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario.” As if these paragraphs were not enough for the Polisario, additional new language in the draft resolution buttresses Morocco’s position and manifests the dynamics of the discussions within the Security Council. Operative paragraph 1bis of the draft resolution calls on the parties to work towards a “realistic and practicable” resolution that can be implemented on the ground. The Security Council “emphasizes the need to make progress towards a realistic and practicable and enduring political solution to the question of Western Sahara based on compromise and the importance of aligning the strategic focus on MINURSO and orienting resources of the United Nations to this end.” If this text stands and is approved as is on Wednesday, the Polisario will suffer a blow, signalling a shift in the Security Council’s approach. This would be the first time since Resolution 1754 of 2007 that the Security Council has called upon the parties in such an unequivocal way to work towards reaching a realistic solution to the territorial dispute. And this would be the first time that the adjectives “realistic” and “practicable” have been used in any such resolution. Ever since Morocco presented its Autonomy Proposal to the Security Council in April 2007, it has repeatedly emphasized that autonomy exercised within Morocco’s sovereignty is the most it can offer to extricate the dispute from the current political impasse. Meanwhile, the Polisario has clung to its position that any solution to the conflict must be achieved through a referendum of self-determination with the option of independence on the table. This option was deemed unrealistic by the former UNSG Personal Envoy to the Western Sahara, Peter Van Walsum, who said in an interview to Spanish newspaper El Pais in August 2008 that the establishment of a new state in southern Morocco was unrealistic. The second striking point in this paragraph is the emphasis on MINURSO’s need to “align its strategic focus and orient its resources to that end.” This language suits Morocco’s interests. For the past 10 years, there has been a heated debate between Morocco and the UN Secretariat on MINURSO’s mandate. This debate reached unprecedented levels when Morocco moved to expel the civilian component of MINURSO in April 2016 following the controversial statement made by former UNSG, Ban Ki-moon, in which he described Morocco’s presence in the Western Sahara as “occupation.” Although the UN mission was tasked with overseeing the ceasefire and organizing the referendum within 24 weeks after its establishment in September 1991, after it had failed to do so over a 15-year period, Morocco stressed on numerous occasions that MINURSO’s mandate no longer involves organizing a referendum, but overseeing compliance with the ceasefire agreement. For this reason, Morocco lacked any enthusiasm for allowing MINURSO to restore its civilian component to full functionality. The language of this paragraph appears to validate Morocco’s position that the UN should reconsider MINURSO’s mandate and reorient its resources. The Trump administration’s announcement in February that it would cut its financial contributions to a number of UN peacekeeping missions in the Middle East and North Africa, including MINURSO, bears out the supposition that the Security Council may be moving toward limiting MINURSO’s mandate to oversee the ceasefire. The Administration plans to cut its contribution to MINURSO by more than half, with a decrease from $18.4 million to $8.4 million. “MINURSO may achieve slight efficiencies in civilian staffing as well as a light reduction in the force,” stated the State Department in its budget proposal for fiscal year 2019. Given the Trump administration’s insistence that the UN improve its effectiveness and conduct an audit of the allocation of its resources, it is very likely that MINURSO’s civilian component, which was the one tasked with organizing the referendum, will be adversely affected by the American budget cut. However positive the draft resolution may be, its adoption as is may prove an uphill battle both for Morocco and its allies within the Security Council, chief of which is France. While the United States, the drafter of the resolution, seems to be leaning in favor of Morocco, opposition to language that is favorable to Morocco may come from Russia, as well as from Bolivia. Russia undermined the consensus of the Security Council in April 2016 when it abstained from voting in favor of renewing the mandate of MINURSO. Additionally, it played a prominent role along with Uruguay and Bolivia last year in blocking the Security Council’s efforts to adopt a strong resolution against the Polisario’s incursions into the Guerguerate. Most of the discussions that prolonged negotiations over last’s year resolution were related to Russia’s concerns that the draft resolution was too favorable to Morocco. This time around, unless the Americans and Russians reach an agreement regarding the language of the resolution, the same scenario as last year may be played out, with the result being a more watered down resolution.

By Hajare El Khadi Rabat – French jihadist Salah Abdeslam and his Tunisian accomplice Sofiane Ayari were sentenced to 20 years in prison for participating in a 2016 shooting against police officers in Brussels, on Monday, April 23.  In accordance with requisitions from the Federal Prosecutor’s Office, the criminal court found Abdeslam and Ayari guilty of attempted murder of a terrorist nature, reported BBC.  The judge, Marie France Keutgen, declared that Abdeslam and Ayari’s anchorage in radicalism undoubtable.  “Their intention is clear from the nature of the weapons they used, the number of bullets they fired and the nature of police officers’ wounds. Only the officers’ professional response prevented it being worse,” said Keutgen.   Abdeslam, a 28-year-old French national born in Brussels to French-Moroccan parents, is the only surviving suspect of the 2015 Paris Attacks, which claimed the lives of 130 people and left more than 350 injured.  Abdeslam was reportedly involved in petty crime in Belgium before becoming radicalized along with his brother, Brahim Abdeslam, in 2014.  The brothers both allegedly joined a French-Belgian network linked to the Islamic State (IS), which claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks,  as well as the metro bombings in Brussels, which killed 35 people only few days before Abdeslam’s arrest in 2016.  Victims of Brussels’s metro attack requested to be regarded as a civil party in Monday’s ruling; however, the court denied their wish saying that no links had been established between incident and the two suspects.  Hunting Abdeslam, Belgian police carried out a raid in the forest area near Brussels, on March 15, 2016, which lead them to the flat in which Abdeslam and Ayari resided along with other occupants. The residents and the Belgian police exchanged fire, resulting in the death of one of the three occupants and the wounding of three officers.  Abdeslam previously refused to answer questions at his trial opening in Belgium, on February 5, earlier this year.  Refusing to stand, the defendant protested that he would not answer any questions and he would remain silent throughout the trial.  “My silence does not make me a criminal or guilty. I am defending myself by remaining silent.” He added, “I am not afraid of you, I am not afraid of your allies. I put my trust in Allah and that’s all.”

Rabat – The administration of the Ain Al Borja prison in Casablanca denied comments that the detained journalist Taoufik Bouachrine is prohibited from receiving letters from family members on Friday. In a statement released by the General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR), Casablanca’s prison administration denied the comments, which were attributed to a member of Bouachrine’s defense committee. The prison administration confirmed that the detainee received five letters from his wife between April 2-11. The statement added that three more letters from Bouachrine’s wife, children, and sister were handed to him on April 19. “The allegations made by some lawyers of the detainee, will not deter the administration of the institution to enforce the law against all prisoners without distinction,” concluded the statement. Bouachrine was arrested on February 24, at the headquarters of Akhbar Al Yaoum. He is facing several charges, including human trafficking, the exploitation of people in need, and the abuse of power for sexual purposes. Bouachrine is also suspected of other crimes, including violent rape and attempted rape. The communiqué added that there are nearly 50 tapes documenting the sexual assault incidents, recorded on a hard disk and a digital video recorder.

Rabat – Morocco’s government spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi denounced the Polisario fake news campaign on social media during a meeting at the National Press Club in Washington on April 20. During a presentation on fake news, as part of the meeting organized by the Moroccan-American Network, El Khalfi said that fake news published by separatists leads to misleading conclusions, on the four-decade-long conflict in Western Sahara. The Moroccan minister also discussed Algeria’s involvement in the conflict, echoing King Mohammed VI’s statement addressed to the United Nations on April 4.  “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario,” said King Mohammed VI in a letter personally delivered to the UNSG by Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Nasser Bourita. During his presentation, El Khalfi also challenged Algeria’s “neutrality,”, emphasizing that country “arms the Polisario, shelters it, supports it financially and stands up against any solution.” El Khalfi denounced Polisario’s designation of the area east of Morocco’s defense wall as a  “liberated zone,” despite the fact that it is an area under the responsibility of the United Nations, represented by MINURSO. “This is a real example of separatist propaganda that seeks to disseminate false information alleging that the sand walls are [only] walls of separation,” he said. El Khalfi, emphasized that the walls “have defense and security objectives and played an important role in the stability and effectiveness of the implementation of the ceasefire agreement and subsequently in the fight against drug trafficking.” El Khalfi also refuted allegations that the Polisario Front is an official representative of the Saharawi population, calling them “unfound,” as the vast majority of Sahrawis are living in Morocco’s southern provinces and not in Tindouf camps, Algeria. Tension in the region has escalated in recent months due to Polisario’s ”illegal incursion” east of Morocco’s defense wall. In response to the Polisario’s maneuvers, Morocco called on the United Nations Security Council to take the necessary measures to stop the Polisario’s attempts to change the status quo in the region, warning that  it would take all necessary measures to abort the Polisario’s attempt, including the use of military force. Earlier this month, Dujarric said that members of the UN Mission had not “observed any military elements in the northeast territory.” However, on April 20, UN Secretary-General’s spokesperson confirmed Polisario ’s illegal activities in the region, noting that a MINURSO patrol unit was attacked and faced Polisario gunfire on April 16. “MINURSO has informed the UN Security Council that on April 16, in the Tifariti area, MINURSO observers were intercepted by Polisario elements, who then proceeded to fire warning [shots],” the UN official said, adding that the observers were deterred from doing their job and could only resume working much later in the day. Local media have been reporting on Polisario’s illegal actions in the region for the past several months. Other MINURSO convoys were allegedly targeted and intimidated with warning signs about potential minefields they had been monitoring in the areas, thus preventing the UN mission from conducting thorough observations in some areas.

Rabat – President of the African Football Confederation (CAF) Ahmad Ahmad continues to promote Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid, publicly calling on European football federations to vote for Morocco’s bid. In an interview with French news agency AFP, Ahmad said that CAF told “Europe to vote for us” referring to an African bid, so “we can vote for you next time. It is clear, it is democracy.” Ahmad also explained that a Moroccan bid serves the interest of Europe.  “Time zones, distance, fans, it is a question of interest for Europe,” adding that Europeans “do not need a visa” to travel to Morocco. “For all that, it is estimated that Europe must vote for Morocco,” Ahmad concluded. Morocco’s bid has already secured vote pledges from several European countries, including Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Russia, and Serbia. The Moroccan bid “raises hope for many young Africans, we must strengthen this hope for a youth in imbalance, in permanent questioning about their future. With a World Cup in Africa this youth can feed on hope,” Ahmad added. Morocco’s bid has garnered the support of many African and Middle Eastern countries hoping for a World Cup on the continent, including Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Botswana, Nigeria, Qatar, Palestine, and Saint Lucia. Morocco is determined to clinch more international support to win the right to host the World Cup. Ahmad is not the only CAF official who has supported Morocco’s bid. CAF’s first vice president, Kwesi Nyantakyi, said that Morocco has honored Africa throughout the month-long CHAN. According to Nyantakyi, the success of 2018 CHAN is proof that Morocco can organize major football events, referring to the 2026 World Cup. Morocco’s effort to secure the World Cup is, he added, “the project of an entire continent.” Around 221 national soccer federations from around the world will meet in Moscow in June to choose between Morocco and the USA/Canada/Mexico joint bid for hosting rights of the 23rd FIFA World Cup. The candidates will be judged based on several criteria, including FIFA’s technical terms, such as infrastructure and commercial capacity.

Rabat – Spanish authorities have arrested 35-year old Moroccan suspected of alleged terrorism financing in Malaga, southern Spain. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported today that the arrested suspect was a regular resident in Spain. The Spanish Ministry of Interior added that the individuals “frequently sent remittances with the aim of allowing his wife, who is one of the most dangerous and most wanted terrorists in Europe, to travel to Syria to join Daesh terrorists. In February 2016, Spanish police found out that the suspect’s wife had left Spain on a flight to Greece via Turkey, adding that she had received sums of money worth more than EUR 6,000 euros from the arrested suspect. This money was intended to finance her stay in Greece with a 25-year-old Palestinian, considered an “intermediate element in Daesh’s logistics apparatus.” The Spanish ministry further said that the same woman sent large sums of money to the Palestinian suspect’s family and financed his movements in Europe between 2015 and 2016. The arrested suspect’s statement demonstrated that he was aware of his wife’s hopes of becoming fighter in the ranks of Daesh, which she has since accomplished.A total of 279 suspected terrorists have been arrested by the Spanish security services or in collaboration with other countries since the beginning of 2015, concluded the statement. In March, Spain’s National Court sentenced two additional Moroccan nationals to a two-year prison term for inciting terrorism. The accused had allegedly been under close surveillance since 2014, with Spanish authorities closely their online activity.

Rabat- Saudi Arabia sports authorities ordered the shutdown of a women’s fitness center in Riyadh on Friday, over a promotional workout video deemed contentious for showing a woman in a tight-fitting sportswear, while kicking a punching bag. The President of the General Sports Authority, Turki al-Sheikh, who ordered the suspension of the center’s license and the opening of an investigation, said the video contained scenes that could corrupt public morals, adding in a Twitter post that Saudi authorities “will not tolerate this.”  As for the communications advisor at the royal palace, Saud al-Qahtani, he welcomed the sports authority’s swift response, saying on Twitter that the Arabian kingdom was on the path to “moderation without moral breakdown.”    Since 2009, all-women fitness clubs that are not under the supervision of a government hospital or clinic, were closed down after leading Saudi Arabia’s clerics have condemned the gyms and clubs for “shamelessness.” They claimed that women would be tempted to leave their homes and neglect their husbands and children. The decision to close down all-female wellness centres, led a group of Saudi women to launch during the same year, a campaign called “Let Her Get Fat,” blaming the authorities for the lack of places to exercise outside the home since they cannot use men’s clubs. Amid the vast program of reform that has been spurred by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, sports authorities started granting licences for women’s gyms to encourage Saudi women to embrace healthier lifestyles.  However, licenses are only approved for gyms that focus on fitness and weight-loss activities, such as running, swimming and weightlifting. Centers that offer “competitive sports,” such as volleyball, basketball and football, will not be granted licences.

Rabat- According to BMI Research, Morocco’s current account deficit will continue to narrow in 2018 and 2019, owing to strong goods and services exports, although rising energy imports will temper the pace of improvement.  In its latest economic analysis report, BMI — a member of the Fitch Group that provides macroeconomic, industry, and financial market analysis — expects Morocco’s current account deficit to shrink to 3.1 percent of GDP and 2.8 percent in 2018 and 2019 respectively, down from 3.6 percent in 2017.  External Demand BMI attributes the improvement of Morocco’s current account status to the rapid growth of goods and services exports, driven by a “robust” demand from France and Spain, the country’s key trading partners. Together, joint demand accounted for 44.4 percent of Moroccan exports in 2016. The firm stated in a previous report that Morocco’s strategic expansion into sub-Saharan Africa is predicted to play a key role in future export growth. “About two-thirds of these exports are consumer goods, and given our expectations for private consumption to accelerate in both markets, this will result in goods export growth picking up. As such, we forecast exports to grow by 14.1 percent in 2018, up from 13.6 percent in 2017,” the report reads.   Regarding Tourism  In addition to the rapid growth of goods and services exports, the firm attributes the improvement of Morocco’s current account status to tourism industry performance. For BMI, tourism will witness a similar growth pace over 2018 and 2019.  “Similarly to goods exports, Morocco’s tourism sector relies on European visitors, with EU countries accounting for 69.4 percent of total arrivals, excluding Moroccan nationals, in 2016,” the report adds.  With Spain and France predicted as the largest contributors in this group at 40.8 percent of the total, BMI believes that the uptick in private consumption in these countries, as well as the broader Eurozone, will support a continued expansion of the sector in 2018, which will further contribute to the declining of current account deficit.  Rising Energy Costs Despite this optimistic outlook, the Fitch group predicts that rising energy imports will at most have a tempering effect on Morocco’s account status over the coming quarters. According to the study, energy products made up 16 percent of total imports in 2017, driving an increase of 8.1 percent in overall imports. BMI’s Oil &amp; Gas team forecasts that Brent will trade at an average of USD 67 per barrel in 2018 and USD 75 per barrel in 2019, up from USD 54.8 per barrel in 2017. Therefore, goods import growth will accelerate to 10.1 percent in 2018, limiting the pace of current account improvements. Previously, BMI asserted that the government’s plan to introduce renewable energy sources will effectively diminish the need for energy imports but cautioned this will take years to manifest itself. Limited External Risks  BMI’s research indicates that the risks to external stability will remain low for the foreseeable future. They attribute this to Morocco’s continued strategy of nurturing foreign direct investment, which will stabilize the country’s external funding and limit pressure on its international reserves. “Morocco’s drive to become a regional manufacturing hub, notably by attracting greater foreign investment, will result in large inflows of foreign direct investment, underpinning the stability of the country’s external funding,” the report concludes.

Rabat – The US Department of State refers to the Polisario Front as “separatists” in its 2017 Human Rights Report, marking the first time that the US has labeled the Polisario’s so-called Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) as such. The report, which included a section on human rights in Western Sahara, acknowledged that Morocco offers the right to both authorized and unauthorized peaceful demonstrations in the region. The 2017 Human Rights Report added that the Moroccan government  “tolerated activities of several unregistered organizations.” The document includes a reference to a “public commemoration” of the 2016 death of Polisario leader Mohamed Abdelaziz held in Laayoune on June 20, 2017, describing the“separatist Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic flags”  displayed in an open-air tent. On June 20, media affiliated to the separatist group reported that Moroccan authorities “forcibly broke up” a protest, “beating dozens of activists in Laayoune. The US Department report, denied these allegations, however, reaffirming that Moroccan authorities did not intervene, despite  the prominent display of so-called “separatist” SADR flags and banners describing the location as “occupied Laayoune.”. Condemning these claims, the document emphasized that there were “no reports that the Moroccan government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings,” disappearances, or violent acts in the region. The US Department of State report also recognized Morocco’s efforts to implement “positive” measures to reinforce its respect for human rights. In this regard, the report extols how the Moroccan government“continued to make travel documents available to Sahrawis,” and encouraged the return of “Sahrawi refugees from Algeria and elsewhere.” Furthermore, the State Dept. found “no reported cases of authorities preventing Sahrawis from traveling out of the country.” Furthermore, the report commends steps introduced by the Moroccan government to improve human rights in the country, including prosecution of torture cases, as the nation considers torture a crime and stipulates “all government officials or members of security forces who make use of violence against others without legitimate motive, or incite others to do the same, during the course of their duties shall be punished in accordance with the seriousness of the violence.”

Washington D.C. – Morocco has warned the United Nations about the Polisario Front’s incursions into the whole area east of Morocco’s defense wall, known as the Berm, including the buffer zone. In Morocco’s view, any presence of the Polisario militia in the area constitutes a violation of the 1991 ceasefire agreement between the two parties, as well as the Military Agreement 1 of 1997-1998, and warrants an intervention from the United Nations to prevent any change of the status quo. Morocco has threatened that it might resort to military action to preserve the status quo in case the UN fails to discharge its mission. Since Morocco stepped up its rhetoric to countermand the Polisario’s political and physical incursions into the area, it has not been clear whether Morocco’s diplomatic offensive has been based on solid arguments or the correct interpretation of the terms of 1991 ceasefire agreement. The confusion was compounded when the United Nations Secretary General’s spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarik, stated earlier this month that the UN peacekeeping mission in the Western Sahara, known as MINURSO, had not observed any illegal Polisario activity in the buffer zone. Many viewed this statement as a rebuke to Morocco’s claims regarding the Polisario’s violations of the ceasefire agreement and its attempts to impose a fait accompli in the area, in effect claiming the ceasefire area to be “liberated.” Subsequent to this statement, Morocco provided the UN with satellite pictures documenting the presence of the Polisario in many areas covered by the ceasefire. Despite Morocco having made a persuasive case demonstrating the Polisario’s violations of its commitments, the United Nations Secretariat still seems unconvinced, laying bare a clear disconnect between Morocco and the UN regarding the interpretation and implementation of the ceasefire. The disconnect became more stark when the UNSG’s spokesperson told the press on April 19 that Tifariti and Bir Lahlou, which the Polisario describes as “liberated zones,” were not part of the buffer zone. The statements of the UNSG’s spokesperson has many asking whether the United Nations is upholding the ceasefire and whether it is leaning in favor of the Polisario. If this is case, what should Morocco do to make its voice heard and pressure the United Nations into fully playing its role? The speculations that ensued since Morocco launched its diplomatic offensive were caused by the UN’s lack of resolve to call things by their name and denounce the Polisario’s violations of the ceasefire agreement. When Morocco called on the UN earlier this month to shoulder its responsibility and thwart the Polisario’s attempts to change the status quo of the region, its demand relied on a careful reading of the terms of the ceasefire agreement. Morocco not only seeks to prevent the Polisario from making repeated incursions into the Guerguerate, in the buffer zone, but it also intends to prevent the separatist movement from having any foothold in the entire area east and south of Morocco’s defense wall. Against this backdrop, it appears clear that Mr. Dujarik’s statements regarding the buffer zone were misguided and demonstrate the UN’s failure to uphold the ceasefire agreement. In addition, the UN’s failure simply fuels the Polisario’s rhetoric that the territory located outside of the buffer zone is not covered by the ceasefire agreement and can, thus, be described as “liberated zones” where it can establish part of its administration. Yet the terms of the ceasefire agreement are crystal clear and leave no room for varied interpretations. When Morocco agreed to abide by the terms of the ceasefire in 1991, it did so out of good will to facilitate the task of the United Nations and assist the Secretary General in his good offices to implement the Settlement Plan. Morocco’s withdrawal from the areas east of the berm could not and should not be interpreted as a renunciation of its rights or claims to all the area. This argument is supported by paragraphs 54 and 56 of the Settlement Plan. According to paragraph 54, “Morocco has agreed to an appropriate, substantial and phased reduction of its troops in the Territory during the transitional period to a level acceptable to the Secretary General.” According to paragraph 56, “the Moroccan troops remaining in the Territory will consist only of troops deployed in static or defensive positions along the sand wall constructed by Morocco close to the eastern and southern frontiers of the Territory.” According to paragraph 57, “Frente Polisario troops will be confined to locations to be designated before the D-Day by the Special Representative and their activities will be closely monitored by the Military Unit of MIUNRSO.” Focusing on this paragraph, there are no “liberated areas” in the whole area east of Morocco’s defense wall and any Polisario activity there must be construed as a violation of the ceasefire, requiring action from the United Nations. The structure of MINURSO’s Military Unit and its mandate provide further support. According to the terms of the ceasefire agreement, UN military officers tasked with supervising the ceasefire are located in nine sites: Four of them are located west of the Moroccan berm (Smara, Mahbas, Oum Dreyga, Awsard) inside the area under Morocco’s sovereignty, and five team sites are located east of the berm (Bir Lahlou, Tifariti, Mehaires, Mijek, Agwanit), which the Polisario claims are its “liberated zones.” Additionally, the responsibility of the nine team sites covers an area stretching between 12,000 to 47 square kilometers spanning outside and inside Morocco’s defense wall. That five teams are located in these areas leaves no doubt that the latter are covered by the ceasefire agreement and cannot by any stretch of imagination be labelled as “liberated zones.” The Polisario’s claims regarding these areas are challenged by the terms of Military Agreement 1 signed between MINURSO and the Polisario in December 1997 and between MINURSO and Morocco in January 1998. The agreement divides the area supervised by MINURSO’s military officers into five areas: a five-kilometer-wide buffer zone east and south of Morocco’s defense wall, two restricted areas (30 km east and west of the Morocco’s defense wall respectively), and two areas with limited restrictions, “which are the two remaining vast stretches of land of Western Sahara on both sides respectively.” The Polisario and its supporters claim that because the areas of Tifariti and Bir Lahlou are located 90 km away from Morocco’s defense wall, they fall out of the buffer zone and the two restricted areas, and therefore, they are “liberated zones” where the Polisario can freely build any structures and move its militiamen. However,  the  Military Agreement 1 expressly prohibits “the reinforcement of existing minefields, the laying of mines, the concentration of forces, the construction of new headquarters, barracks and ammunition storage facilities.” The Polisario has not only attempted to rewrite history and the agreements, but has also launched military actions to harass UN military officers working on the team sites located in Tifarity and Bir Lahlou. It perpetrated the latest of such incidents on March 16 in the vicinity of the Tifarity team site when MINURSO’s military officers were stopped by armed Polisario members, who fired shots in the air. It is troubling to see that instead of immediately denouncing the Polisario’s harassment of MINURSO’s military units and reporting them to the press, the UNSG’s spokesperson waited a whole month to unveil the incident. This delay stands in stark contrast to the spokesperson’s rush to point out earlier this month that MINURSO reported no illegal activity in the buffer zone. Based on this analysis, it appears abundantly clear that the action the Polisario has undertaken in Tifarity and Bir Lahlou, including the building of new headquarters and the harassment of UN military officers, constitutes a clear violation of the 1991 ceasefire agreement and Military Agreement 1. It is, therefore, incumbent on the United Nations to live up to its responsibility and denounce the Polisario’s attempts or actions that run counter to the letter of the governing agreements. The UN’s failure to uphold those agreements would warrant the inevitable decision by the Moroccan government to declare them null and void. To avoid such a political crisis, the upcoming resolution of the Security Council on the Western Sahara should make clear that the Polisario is bound by the terms of these agreements and cannot undertake any actions to change the status quo of the region. The resolution should counteract any ambiguity in the interpretation of the ceasefire and expressly state that the areas located east of Morocco’s defense wall (Tifarity and Bir Lahlou) are not “liberated areas,” but that the authority of MINURSO’s military officers extends to them as well.

Rabat – After its recent three-day visit, FIFA’s 2026 site inspection task force is expected to return to Morocco next week to hold talks with Morocco’s World Cup bid committee concerning the country’s hotel capacity and stadiums. Quoting chairman of the Moroccan bid committee Moulay Hafid Elalamy, French news agency AFP reported on Friday that the FIFA inspection delegation “noticed some deviations from the initial planned program.” Elalamy added that the FIFA task force members “asked questions about the reliability of accommodation projects,” as well as the “plans for the transformation of stadiums.” The task force arrived in Morocco on April 16 to evaluate Morocco’s assets and capacity to host the World Cup. It previously visited four sites from the rival North American bid earler in April. After expressing admiration for Morocco’s bid, the task force informed the chairman of the Moroccan bid committee of the desire by FIFA technical experts for another site visit in order to hold talks “about possible solutions for accommodation and stadiums.” During a presentation offered to the press on Friday, Elalamy said that the members of the task force “expressed their admiration” for the quality of Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup. He added that the FIFA delegation “felt the passion of the whole population” for the tournament, which “clearly highlights the fact that Morocco as a whole is a candidate.” The Moroccan official added that the task force praised both the committee’s diligence and the nation’s commitment to the effort. Elalamy summarized the positive site visit emphasizing that Morocco “is a country in full development, in full construction, with a clear vision, where the World Cup is a tool for the accelerating development projects at all levels.” Fifty-four African nations and the majority of Arab countries are expected to vote for Morocco’s 2026 bid, and the effort has collected commitments from several European countries, including France, Belgium, Russia, Luxembourg, and Serbia.

Rabat – Morocco’s bid to join the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has found new institutional support. Regional business and commerce institutes, including the Morocco-based, think tank and policy organization Amadeus Institute, announced on Friday in Abidjan the creation of a working group – the Regional Alliance for monitoring the Accession of Morocco to ECOWAS – to promote and facilitate Morocco’s membership in the 15-member economic forum.  A joint statement issued by Amadeus Institute, the Agricultural and Rural Foresight Initiative (IPAR) of Senegal, and the Ivorian Center for Economic and Social Research (CIRES) announced the creation of the alliance during a workshop held on Friday as part of the stakeholder conference under the them “Morocco in Ecowas.” The joint statement added that this collaborative approach aims to ensure that “civil societies, employers’ representatives, trade unions can appropriate the challenges of this membership in an informed and objective way.” The statement also noted that the initiative will seek to “reflect on the economic complementarities, issues of the protection of the movement of people and the macroeconomic impacts and consequences on logistics flows and trade west Africa.” The alliance members called on the ECOWAS member states and Morocco to be “ingenious in defining an open negotiating process to all actors in order to reinforce” the spirit of ECOWAS to serve the interest of all parties. Negotiations for Morocco’s ascension need to be organized in “transitional phases, capable of preserving the acquis communautaire in a 16-member ECOWAS,” read the statement. Commenting on the bid, Tanon A. Felix, Adviser of Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara, told Le360 on Sunday that Cote d’Ivoire is supportive of Morocco’s desire to join ECOWAS. During the 52nd ECOWAS Summit held in December 2017, Ouattara confirmed that the organization agreed in principle on Morocco’s admission; however, an impact study of this decision is in order.
The recently completed stakeholder conference held in Abidjan was organized by the General Confederation of Enterprises of Morocco (CGEM) in collaboration with the Ivorian Center for Economic and Social Research (CIRES). The symposium convened politicians, economic advisors and academics. Following Morocco’s readmission into the African Union in January 2017, King Mohammed VI informed Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of Liberia and Chairperson ECOWAS, of the country’s desire to join the regional economic community as a full member.

Rabat- SDX Energy’s latest discovery has exceeded expectations. The UK-based gas company announced on Friday, April 20, a new gas discovery at the LNB-1 onshore well on the Lalla Mimouna permit, estimated to contain “significantly more”  resources than expected. The North Africa-focused company revealed that the well–of which SDX owns 75 percent–was drilled to a total depth of 1,861 meters in its latest press release, adding that the new discovery area contains some 10.2 billion cubic feet of conventional natural gas and 55,000 barrels of condensate, which it says, is significantly larger than the traps typically encountered in the Sebou area.   “We are very excited about the results of this exploration well,” Paul Welch, SDX Chief Executive, said.  “It was a higher risk exploration prospect than previous drilling in Sebou, as it was a sequence that had not been previously penetrated in a similar structural location.  “We had anticipated a higher-pressure section, based upon offset drilling in the area, but the actual pressure, the thickness of the section, and the type and quantity significantly exceeded our expectations.”  The company’s management pointed out that the discovery would exceed the size required to justify development and connection to the existing infrastructure in the Sebou area.  The well, LNB-1, is the sixth discovered by the company and one of the seven wells drilled as part of its nine-well campaign in Morocco. SDX was granted a four-month extension to July 22, 2018, at its Lalla Mimouna permit, allowing it sufficient time to evaluate the results of its exploration drilling campaign.  SDX is an international oil and gas exploration, production, and development company, headquartered in London with a principal focus in North Africa.  The exploration company entered the Moroccan market in January after acquiring Circle Oil’s shares in Morocco for USD 30 million. The British company has been granted an eight-year permit to drill for gas in the Gharb basin.  In addition, the company successfully renewed their permits for the Gueddari Northwest, Gueddari South, Sidi Al Harati Southwest, and Ksiri Center sites. These permits will expire in 2019, 2020, 2023, and 2023, respectively.  In total, SDX Energy obtained licenses for seven drilling sites from the National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines, which holds 25 percent of working interests of SDX Energy’s activity in Morocco.  SDX’s portfolio also includes high-impact exploration opportunities in Egypt. The group has a 50 percent working interest in two production sites located onshore in the Eastern Desert, adjacent to the Gulf of Suez.  These production sites are characterized by exceptionally low operating costs, making them particularly resilient in a low oil price environment.

Rabat – In a bid to redeem the country’s image and soothe the increasing ire of many sub-Saharan leaders, Algeria’s Interior Minister, Noureddine Bédoui, recently paid a working visit to Conakry, Guinea.  During his 72-hour visit to the West African country on April 16-19, the Algerian Minister met with his Guinean counterpart, Abdoul Kabele Camara, to discuss immigration and the reported mistreatment of Guinean nationals living in Algeria. The meeting generated widespread political commentary throughout francophone West Africa. For many such commentators, Algeria’s seems to have stepped away from its massive and constant expulsions of sub-Saharan migrants, which have provoked many sub-Saharan governments, and engage in a diplomatic reorientation. However, not all nations are willing to make amends quite yet.  The leading Burkinabé newspaper, Le Pays, writes that “Algeria’s diplomatic jolt is a bit of a smokescreen,” an insincere move that has been a difficult sell for Algeria’s southern neighbors. The newspaper went on to characterize Mr. Bédoui’s 72-hour working visit to Guinea as a grand misstep in Algeria’s quest for continental clout. With more than 28,000 sub-Saharan migrants inhumanely deported or expelled from Algeria so far, Algiers cannot possibly expect West African leaders to believe that the nation is turning over a new leaf at this point, the report added. Furthermore, the daily underscored critics who point to Algeria’s protections for militants and criminals such as Iyad Ag Ghali, who wrought havoc and destitution in some areas on the continent. Concluding the article with a hint of ironic curiosity, the daily asked: “Is Algeria seeking to redeem itself, sanitize its image?”  Le Pays answers its own question, hinting that the country’s negative image, combined with Morocco’s deep-rooted presence in the region, may just prove to make Mr. Bédoui defunct at the outset.

Rabat – “Answering a couple of questions that were raised by various people in this room on Western Sahara: First, I can say that neither Bir Lahlou nor Tifariti fall within the buffer strip,” said UN Secretary General’s spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric during his daily press briefing on April 19, at the UN headquarters. The UN official hastened to add that the body’s meeting with the separatist front will continue to be held in Rabouni, not in Bir Lahlou, as Polisario had requested. “Second, regarding meetings with Frente Polisario: since the arrival, in late December 2017, of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Colin Stewart, MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara) has preferred to adhere with the longstanding practice of holding such meetings in Rabouni, Algeria,” the spokesperson said, reaffirming the international body’s commitment to respecting and upholding the spirit of the military agreement. As the move comes at a time when the UN has admitted to Polisario’s military activities in the region—Mr. Dujarric affirmed that MINURSO military observers were stopped by armed Polisario members in the vicinity of Tifariti during same briefing —questions are being raised about the separatist front’s respect for and or commitment to the military agreement. Why else would Polisario stop a MINURSO patrol unit and fire warning shots? Or request that meetings be held in Tifariti? Is it a calculated strategy designed to distort the terms of the cease-fire agreement? These are some of the questions that Moroccan and international pundits have been raising, especially given recent reports that the Polisario Front has moved to erect its de facto capital city in Tirafiti. If history is any guide, one commentator suggested, it seems the Polisario is now violating the terms of the agreement, having been unsuccessful in its attempts to provoke Morocco into an armed response–a move that would have considerably damaged the kingdom’s image in the eyes of the international community. The agreement states: “The Military Agreement No. 1, which regulates the ceasefire between the Frente POLISARIO and Morocco, establishes the Moroccan military wall as a line of separation between the Sahrawi and Moroccan armies pending the holding of the self-determination referendum and the determination of the final status of the Territory. It also establishes a 5 km wide ‘buffer zone’ to the east and along the 2700 km Moroccan military wall. 2. The agreement further establishes two restricted areas (30 km east and 30 km west of the Moroccan military wall respectively), where firing of weapons and/or military training exercises, redeployment or movement of troops, entry of arms and ammunition and improvements of defense infrastructures are not permitted, and and two areas of limited restriction that encompass the remainder of territory on both sides of Morocco’s defense wall.  It is undeniably true that, as Mr. Dujarric said in his April 19 noon briefing, Bir Lahlou and Tifariti are not in the buffer strip. Yet, as clearly stipulated in the agreement, until the pending referendum is held, any military action in either area constitutes a glaring violation of the cease-fire. To be sure, by creating a military and administrative bastion in areas that it purports to have “liberated,” the separatist front seeks to take advantage of the cease-fire agreement, changing the status quo which that very agreement is supposed to maintain. In his Western Sahara report earlier this month, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres demanded that MINURSO’s mandate be extended to April 2019. Shortly after, Morocco notified the UN Security Council of the separatist front’s military movements in Marhbas and Guerguerat, both of which are in the buffer strip.  King Mohammed VI subsequently informed Algeria that Morocco would not stay standing by as the separatist continued escalating tensions and provoking Moroccan military personnel in the southern province: Morocco is ready to resort to using its military might to quell the front’s provocations, the king said. And yet, despite the king’s warnings, Morocco is choosing to prioritize a political solution—through diplomacy and negotiations. To be sure, the kingdom expects other stakeholders to play their part and keep their end of the bargain. Furthermore, the UN, as the primary guarantor of the negotiation process, should show more resolve when it comes to respecting the terms of its mission. For if Morocco, too, decides to pursue a less diplomatic response, to violate or respect the agreement as it sees fit, tensions may reach untenable proportions—ones beyond the peacekeeping capacities of MINURSO or the UN.

Rabat – During a working visit to Morocco on April 20, the Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister, Stef Blok, met with several Moroccan high officials, including his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita. Speaking at a news conference at the end of the Dutch minister’s visit, Bourita and Blok both highlighted the strong and mutually beneficial bilateral relations between the two countries, citing the extradition agreement as an illustration of the strength and mutual confidence that characterizes the two countries’ diplomatic dealings. At one point during the news conference, however, Mr. Blok pointed out the unresponsiveness of Moroccan officials during the Rif uprisings, suggesting that the government and its apparatus had not been effective in responding to the grievances of the people who took to the streets.  Mr. Bourita did not take kindly to the comment, quickly drawing the line between diplomatic and internal affairs. “[The situation in the Rif] is not a diplomatic question, and cannot be subject to a diplomatic discussion; it is an internal affair, and under no circumstances can it be dealt with through discussions or interaction with foreign states,” Bourita said. He further explained that Morocco has the legal, institutional, as well administrative means and structures to handle its issues. Freedom of expression and the right to demonstration are guaranteed by Moroccan law, Bourita stated, adding that these rights should be enjoyed within the framework defined by Morocco’s legal and institutional structures. “Morocco has a transparent legal system that ensures equity and equality before the law,” Bourita elaborated, hinting that if the relevant authorities conclude that there were abuses and violations during the Rif uprisings after due process, then Moroccan institutions will adequately respond to hold perpetrators accountable. Regarding the socio-economic aspects of the situation, the foreign affairs minister stressed the country’s recent economic reforms, especially massive investments in the historically-unprivileged and undeveloped regions. He stressed that Morocco’s current economic reforms involve all its regions, and the country has competent authorities to oversee and implement those reforms as expected.  “Morocco does not need lessons from anyone, nor should discussions on this topic involve other countries,” he concluded.

Rabat – Prominent Algerian singer Cheb Khaled has once again shared his lifelong passion for Morocco and the hospitality and openness of its people during an interview that aired Algerian television. When asked about the friendship between Morocco and Algeria, “especially after Algeria’s vow of support to the Moroccan bid to host the World Cup in 2026,”  the musician said praised Morocco’s generosity and hospitality. “We are brothers, we have the same traditions and we share the same language.” Khaled told the journalist that he has “never experienced a bad situation in Morocco,” before emphasizing that the same hospitality extends to all Algerians in the North African country. The Algerian singer, who is married to a Moroccan woman, added that if ever someone is lost, be they Moroccan citizens in Algeria or Algerian citizens in Morocco, people will not hesitate to offer help and host that person with open arms. Khaled recalled a television special he watched about an Algerian who was lost  in Casablanca. With sparkling eyes, the singer said that when the Algerian citizen told a Moroccan national that he was lost, the man offered the best he can to help his Algerian brother without hesitation. He also underscored Morocco’s support to its eastern neighbor in its brutal fight against French protectorate. “Moroccan blood poured for Algeria,” he concluded. In 2013, King Mohammed VI granted Cheb Khaled Moroccan nationality.  In an interview with Tel Quel in 2009, Khaled talked about his special relationship with the King, emphasizing that he was offered with the opportunity to meet the King before his ascension to the throne.   “I had the chance to meet the King when he was prince. Since he became King, he has not turned his back on me.” “He often invites me to his house when I’m in Morocco,” he added.

Rabat – The US Department of State 2017 Annual Human Rights report, released on Friday, acknowledged Morocco’s “positive” measures to reinforce its respect for human rights.  In the report, the State Department describes Morocco’s 2016 parliamentary elections as “credible and relatively free from irregularities.” “In October 2016, the country held direct elections for the Chamber of Representatives. The major political parties and domestic observers considered the elections free, fair, and transparent. International observers considered the elections credible,” according to the 2017 Annual Report on Human Rights. The report also underscores the engagement of Moroccan women in elections, emphasizing that “voters elected a record number of women in the October 2016 elections, although very few subsequently won leadership positions as ministers or parliamentary committee presidents.” Spanning all human rights issues in Morocco, the annual report details the steps introduced by the government to reinforce efforts to promote human rights, freedom of expression, freedom of movement, and corporate social responsibility. Prison reform and steps to decrease prison torture, in particular, received favorable feedback, in addition to statues on women and immigration. According to the State Dept. report, the Moroccan government contributed to the protection and assistance of refugees, returning refugees, asylum seekers and other persons of concerns, in partnership with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations. The report extols how the Moroccan government “continued to make travel documents available to Sahrawis,” and encouraged the return of “Sahrawi refugees from Algeria and elsewhere.” Furthermore, the State Dept. found “no reported cases of authorities preventing Sahrawis from traveling out of the country.” Decline of Torture Allegations  According to the report, overall claims of torture and abuse in detention have declined in Morocco, and the government has instituted accountability efforts to address reported abuses against law enforcement. Morocco’s law considers torture as a crime and stipulates that “all government officials or members of security forces who make use of violence against others without legitimate motive, or incite others to do the same, during the course of their duties shall be punished in accordance with the seriousness of the violence.” Though prison conditions improved during the year, the report stated that Morocco’s prisons “in some cases did not meet international standards,” due to overcrowding. The document then mentioned the efforts made by Morocco’s Prison Administration (DGAPR), which reported less overcrowding as four new prisons opened in 2017. Freedom to Protest Regarding the freedom of peaceful assembly, the report commended the Moroccan law, which offers the right of both authorized and unauthorized peaceful demonstrations. According to the US State Department, law enforcement are asked to intervene only if a protest is deemed threatening to public security. “In general, officers were under orders to observe and not intervene, unless the demonstration becomes unruly or threatening. In those cases, under standard operating procedures, officers are required to give the crowd three warnings that force will be used if they do not disperse before intervening.” Curbing Violence and Rape Cases The US department acknowledged NGO and government efforts to provide funds to women associations and centers that support female survivors of violence. Government statistics from  2016 include direct support for 29 women’s counseling centers for female survivors of violence and 48 family mediation centers. The report added that the Moroccan government “led some efforts to improve the status of women in the workplace,” mentioning the law to create the Gender Parity Authority that will be operational once King Mohammed VI and the Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, appoint its members. Youth Abuses Regarding youth, the report addressed the practice of underage marriage, child labor, sexual abuse, and obstacles to birth registration. According to the annual document, the Moroccan government provides that both parents maintain the right to pass citizenship to their children, except for a few cases, including children who were born to unmarried parents, especially in rural areas, or in the cases of poorly-educated mothers. The report commended Morocco’s legal prohibition of early or forced marriage and child labor. In 2016, Moroccan law enacted a legal mandate to prevent “children under the age of 16 from working as domestic servants…strictly limiting the work of children under the age of 18.”

Rabat – The electronic music industry has lost one of its own. Swedish DJ Avicii died yesterday in Muscat, Oman at age 28.  “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii,” Avicii’s publicist, Diana Baron, confirmed in a statement. “The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given,” Baron concluded. Avicii was born on September 8, 1989, in Stockholm, Sweden. He was considered one of the best DJs in the world, having received two Grammy nominations for his work on “Sunshine” with David Guetta in 2012 and his song “Levels” in 2013. Avicii was known as a pioneer of the Electronic Dance Movement. Bergling chose the stage name “Avicii” because the word represented the lowest level of Buddhist hell. The electronic music sensation leaves a music legacy in his wake, including hit songs such as “Levels,” “Wake Me Up,” “You Make Me,” “Hey Brother,” and “Addicted to You.” The Moroccan public had the occasion of seeing Avicii perform live at the 14th edition of the Mawazine Rhythms of the World Festival in 2015. The electro house record producer fired up the OLM Souissi with his hit singles, attracting over 200,000 festival-goers. Being on the spotlight was not easy for the young artist. The high-octane life of a globally famous deejay became a strain on Avicii. He dealt with numerous health problems, including acute pancreatitis, in part due to excessive drinking. “Yeah I was drinking way too much, partying in general way too much,” he said. “Then I got a pancreatitis attack [at 21], which is very rare. So that forced me to do a 180 and stop drinking.” Avicii told Time in 2013. In 2014, he underwent surgery to remove his gallbladder and appendix. These issues eventually led Avicii to retire from touring in 2016, though he continued to make new music. Fellow musicians and artists paid tribute to the late DJ on social media including producer Hardwell, Madonna, Calvin Harris, David Guetta,  Nile Rodgers, and Dua Lipa.

Rabat – UN Secretary General’s spokesperson’s claim that the UN mission in Western Sahara  (MINURSO), “has not observed” any Polisario-linked military maneuvers in the southeastern provinces backfired when Polisario fired “warning shots” at the UN, potentially pushing the UN official to alter his earlier position. Speaking at a news conference on April 20, Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric reported that a MINURSO patrol unit was intercepted and faced Polisario gunfire on April 16. “MINURSO has informed the UN Security Council that on April 16, in the Tifariti area, MINURSO observers were intercepted by Polisario elements, who then proceeded to fire warning [shots],” the UN official said, adding that the observers were deterred from doing their job and could only resume working much later in the day. According to other reports, the UN official is finally opening up about the occasional interception of UN convoy by military elements; this week’s incident was not an isolated case. There are reports that in March, prior to Mr. Dujarric’s claim of absence of activities in the region, other MINURSO convoys were allegedly targeted and intimidated with warning signs about potential minefields they had been monitoring in the areas, thus preventing the UN mission from doing thorough observations in some areas. The moves are reportedly an attempt to bar the UN mission from freely moving in the zones where the separatist front’s military maneuvers are more blatant. Altering his early-April statements, Mr. Dujarric said that the UN Secretary-General “is more than ever preoccupied by the mounting threats” as well as the deadly attacks targeting UN blue helmets. The Frenchman added that this has been the case since the beginning of the UN mission in the area. Reacting to incident on Thursday this week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his deep concerns about the gradual “loss of respect of UN symbols.” While UN symbols and operatives were previously revered and “respected by even militant groups,” they are now being targeted due to their status as UN officials, Mr. Guterres said. Commenting on the death of UN operatives killed in service between 2016 and 2017, the Portuguese said: “UN personnel are regularly targeted by those who oppose peace.”

Rabat- The Syrian Foreign Ministry has returned the prestigious Legion of Honor to France, following French participation in the US-led airstrikes on Syria last week over the alleged chemical weapons attack.  The media office of the Syrian presidency announced yesterday that the ministry returned the award through the Romanian embassy in Damascus, saying that Syria’s al-Assad will not hold decorations from a “slave country” and “follower of the US” that supports the terrorist groups and attacks Syria. “The time of colonialism and enslaving people is over and the Syrians who stood by the Syrian army in fighting terrorism for seven years will not be terrorized by reckless and childish policies,” the presidential office said. The office of French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday that “a disciplinary procedure for withdrawing the Legion of Honour was underway.”  Former French President Jacques Chirac decorated al-Assad with the Legion’s highest rank of the Great Cross in 2001, shortly after he took power following the death of his father. Assad has been accused of carrying out chemical weapons attack on civilians in the Damascus enclave of Douma on April 5, which led US, UK, and France to launch coordinated airstrikes hitting targets at three sites in Syria in the early hours of late Saturday.

Rabat – The Head of Government presented a proposal to reform regional investment centers, ordered by King Mohammed VI, att Thursday at the Council of Ministers. The King received the Moroccan Head of Government, Saadeddine El Othmani, the Minister of Economy and Finance, Mohamed Boussaid; the Minister of the Interior, Abdelouafi Laftit; and the King’s advisors, on Thursday at the Royal Palace in Rabat. The proposals, crafted through a participatory approach with all the concerned sectors, are based on a thorough diagnosis of obstacles that hindered goals set by the King on January 2, 2002, which aimed for decentralized investment management..  “The royal vision acts as a frame of reference for the action of the regional investment centers. It is based on the conclusions of the report of the Court Audit, which evaluated the performance of regional investment centers brought to the attention of His Majesty the King in December 2017. The vision was also based on the results of analysis and a detailed study carried out by a consulting firm and supervised by the Interior Ministry. Recommendations from Commission meetings comprised under the chairmanship of the Head of the Government were also taken into consideration,” stated El Othmani in his speech.  The Head of Government noted that the reform relied on three key aspects: transforming investment centers into public institutions through participatory governance, uniting all the former regional investment commissions into one single commission to improve and harmonize decision-making processes, and simplify measures related to investment files by adopting “administrative devolution” at the regional level, as well as modern approaches and incentive laws at the central level.  Ideally, the transformation approach will deepen stakeholder engagement and integration into the investment files he process, while strengthening the support of both small and medium-sized enterprises, setting the stage for the amicable settlement of disputes between administration and investors.  With the aim to create a unified regional investment commission, the second approach affirms that decisions taken by the new proposed “united commission” would be binding on all its members, and could be appealed before the Wali of the region, or the commission chaired by the Head of Government, if necessary.  At the international level, the effectiveness of a central plan relies on the systematic simplification of the administrative procedure. It requires the implementation of laws that enforce deadlines for issuing authorizations, fighting administrative bureaucracy, and implementing human resources in conjunction with the new public administration principles.  “These are the broad proposal outlining the plan for its implementation submitted to Your Majesty, in the hopes that they are in alignment with Your Majesty’s directives and Your will to reform these centers to make them an efficient lever for promoting investment and free initiative in order to turn the regions into an engine of development, to fight spatial disparities, and to achieve economic and social prosperity for the Moroccan people under Your leadership,” concluded the Head of Government.  Upon receiving a report on the Manarat Al Moutawassit project of Al Hoceima, on October 2017, the King made an unprecedented decision to dismiss several former high officials, including the Minister of National Education, Mohamed Hassad; the Minister of Health, El Houssaine El Ouardi; and the Minister of Housing, Mohammed Nabil Benabdellah.  The King’s decision raised speculation about further dismissals, especially among members of regional investment centers.  Suspicions were particularly high following the King’s speech on Throne Day, July 23, when King Mohammed VI deemed the country’s investment centers to be problematic because “they impede the act of investing instead of serving as a mechanism to provide incentives and resolve investors’ problems at the regional level, without referring investors to central government departments instead.”

Rabat – Leila Slimani has always raised her voice in defense of women’s rights and equality in Moroccan society. When she released “Sex and Lies: Sexual Life in Morocco” in 2017, the French-Moroccan writer wanted to create a space where woman could share their daily struggles. Slimani reports stories of women trapped in a society, where sex outside marriage, abortions, and homosexuality are illegal, yet men and women, like everywhere else in the world, are having sex in secret in a state of fear and shame. “This culture of shame and lying creates lots of victims: the women who have an abortion illegally — 600 abortions per day! — The single mothers who are thrown out because they are considered shameful. As a writer, I had to use the only power I have—words—to break this silence,” the Prix Goncourt winner explains in an interview with San Francisco Chronicle published yesterday. Slimani is well-aware that the struggle for women’s rights is still a contentious topic in many predominantly Muslim societies, with a prevailing patriarchal culture that gives more rights and social recognition to its male members. “Women are doubly humiliated because they have to prove their virginity upon entering marriage by providing a ‘certificate of recent defloration.’ Women are second-class citizens in Morocco.” Referencing the #MeToo movement, which speaks out against sexual harassment and violence towards women, the successful author agrees that the movement is an effective way to win back some dignity in a society where it is “more shameful to be raped than to be a rapist.” Last month, Leila Slimani initiated a petition with several other public personalities in order to challenge an inheritance law that favors men over women. The group of signatories is demanding that women be put on an equal legal footing as men when it comes to inheritance rights. Born to a Moroccan father and a French-Algerian mother in Rabat, Slimani represents the face of Francophone countries open to a multicultural world.  Slimani majored in political science and media studies in Paris, where she acquired her French citizenship. In 2014, she published her first novel “Dans le jardin de l’ogre,” followed by “Chanson Douce” in 2016. In November 2016, the author received the prestigious Prix Goncourt for “Chanson Douce,” the most read novel in France in 2016. Translated into English as “Lullaby,” the novel quickly became a bestseller with more than 450,000 copies printed in 2016. In 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron named the French-Moroccan award-winning author and journalist, as France’s top emissary for Francophone affairs.

Rabat – The controversial withdrawal of Moroccan cyclists from the Tour du Maroc (“Tour”) has raised a lot of questions. The members of the national cycling team withdrew on Friday from the 31st Tour du Maroc two stages from the finish in protest against “the lack of means necessary to conduct the Tour in suitable conditions,” said Adil Jelloul, a member of the national team. They tried, they said, to alert the Federal Office who seemed deaf to their grievances. “We decided to withdraw to protest against the marginalization of Moroccan cyclists and the lack of necessary equipment and means necessary to conduct the Tour in proper conditions,” stated Adil Jelloul, to Moroccan Associated Press (MAP). According to Moroccan tabloid Al Ahdath Al Maghribia, the Moroccan cycling champion confirmed at Monday’s press conference that the team earns, in total, only 70 DH per day, or 2100 DH per month for the whole team. They also indicated that the Cycling Federation does not provide equipment such as jerseys, bicycles, and helmets. As for nutrition, the athletes indicated that they are only given oranges and various fruits before and after the race. It’s up to them to manage their own health. The cyclists in question will be presented to a disciplinary commission that will decide their fate, said the President of the Royal Moroccan Federation of Cycling (FRMC) to MAP. He indicated that this withdrawal was “regrettable, irresponsible and in contradiction with all of the rules,” noting that the Federal Office had to react with firmness to this protest which “should not have happened since the Federation has responded favorably to all requests from cyclists before the start of the Tour.” This is the 31st Tour du Maroc, which, in 2006, became part of Africa Tour, orchestrated by the International Cycling Union (UCI). The international event includes a total of 120 cyclists representing 20 teams from across the globe. The 2018 competition began on April 6, in Rabat and concluded on April 15, in Casablanca.

Rabat- A Ghanaian Minister’s proposal to replace Islam’s traditional call for prayer with text messaging is sparking acrimonious debates among citizens, with many calling the move a blatant violation of religious and minority rights. For the Science, Technology, Environment, and Innovation Minister, Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng, the idea for the proposal is to manage or decrease the “noise pollution” caused by the use of megaphones or loudspeakers during the call for prayer, which has been a source of complaint for many residents in the country’s capital, Accra. Speaking earlier this week at a news conference about the rationale of the proposal, the Ghanaian minister put forward the claim that replacing loudspeaker-based call for prayers with text messages or WhatsApp notifications will benefit both the environment and social cohesion. “In the house of worship, why is it that the house of worship would not be limited to the house of worship…why is it that time for prayer would not be transmitted with a text message or WhatsApp so the imam will sent WhatsApp message to everybody that the prayer time is up so appear,” the minister said. Speaking after the fact to a website the German news outlet Deutsche Welle, Mr. Frimpong-Boateng reaffirmed the government’s position. Although he admitted the move is controversial, he maintained his belief that resorting to texts on WhatsApp would prove effective in attaining the government vision. “I believe that it can help reduce the noise. It is potentially controversial, but it is something we need to think about,” he said. The move is believed to have been inspired by Rwanda, where the same law passed in March. In Ghana, however, where the Muslim population is much more significant than in Rwanda, the proposal has sparked acrimonious controversies, with the majority of Muslim community calling for the minister to step down from his position. The move particularly angered the imams, who see it as virtually impractical and improbable. Speaking to the press, an Accra-based mosque imam said that text messaging cannot be as effective as loudspeakers when it comes to waking people up for the dawn prayer. Another imam, conceding that the noise should be reduced, enquired about the practicality of said proposal: “How can I understandably text everybody who prays at my mosque for five times a day?” he asked, ironically adding that chances are that he does not even know the majority of the people who pray at the mosque, or their phone numbers. One Muslim cleric, however, welcomed the move, calling it a proposal for Muslims to adapt to the changing social norms. “It us possible for us to adapt text messages to call Muslims to prayer,” Sheikh Bagaya said. Outraged by the “unreasonable and unpractical” proposal, the spokesperson for the National Chief Imam, Sheikh Aremeyaw Sahibu, said during a radio interview that the move constitutes “a violation of our religious rights.” For Mr. Shaibu, the call to prayer is a founding tenet of the Islamic faith, a divine command that to which the community of believers must adhere. “For us, the impracticability is clear. The unreasonability is so clear…[The call for prayer] is something divinely determined, [and] beyond one’s wisdom from which we do not intend to depart,” the National Chief Imam’s spokesperson said, calling that the Environment and Innovation Minister unnecessarily controversial, as he “knew the consequences that such an act would create.”

Rabat- The growth of Moroccan mining sector has maintaind a steady pace in BMI Research Group Mining Risk/Reward Index (RRI), after clinching second place in the MENA region once again, owing to Morocco’s well-established mining industry. In its latest industry trend analysis, BMI, a Fitch Group company, presents its outlook for the Middle East &amp; North Africa mining sector, making the use of BMI’s Risk Reward Index, which provides investors, mainly mining companies and support service providers, with a clear country-comparative assessment of a market’s risks and potential rewards.  With an overall Mining RRI score of 56.3 out of 100, BMI ranked the Moroccan mining sector as the most attractive market in the MENA region, after Saudi Arabia. The Gulf country maintains the top position in the MENA region with a score of 59.5 out of 100, due to its growing gold, copper and phosphate sectors, as well as its well-established and clear mining regulatory code and stable operating environment.  According to the research firm, Morocco’s performance is supported by its established mining industry, which makes it a top global producer of phosphates, in addition to modest volumes of gold, silver, zinc, copper and cobalt, boosting its score in the “rewards” category to 49.9 out of 100.  According to Morocco’s Ministry of Energy and Mining, the sector plays a major role in the country’s economy, as it contributes by 21 percent of the value of export remittances and employs about 39,225 people.  “For centuries, mining has been one of Morocco’s most practised economic activities. Moroccan mining technologies, like copper works and steel manufacturing, were exported abroad, particularly to Europe. “Since the beginning of the twentieth century, major manganese, iron, zinc, lead and phosphate fields were discovered. The strongest point of the Moroccan industry is phosphate mining,” the Ministry states.  The firm also attributes the country’s performance to the mining code of Morocco which was updated in 2015, to increase legal clarity and encourage foreign investment. BMI points out that although the key phosphate sector is dominated by state-run companies, joint-ventures with private firms are increasingly common and foreign firms are allowed to operate non-phosphate mines.  In fact, Morocco’s newly privatized mining industry allowed the Canadian international mining exploration company, Maya Gold &amp; Silver, to initiate joint venture with National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines of Morocco, to explore and develop gold and silver deposits in the country. Over the first three quarters of 2017, the company reported the production of 384 thousand ounces of silver at the Zgounder mine, located approximately 260 kilometers east of the major port city of Agadir.  The report adds that Morocco’s relatively stable operating and political environment accounts for the solid “risks” score of 60.4. However, the research firm mentions the series of protests which began late December 2017, following the death of three local miners, while mining the underground tunnels of an abandoned coal mine in the eastern city, Jerada. BMI believes that the incidents carry significant negative risks to the sector’s outlook.  Despite the country’s high ranking, BMI places the MENA region as a whole towards the lower end of the scale, ranking fourth among five regions, with an average score of 47.9. The firm forecasts that the region will continue to perform relatively poorly in the coming quarters. “The countries’ underdeveloped mining sectors, dominated by state-owned players, and ongoing political risks will see limited improvement in the near term,” the report concludes.

Rabat- Morocco and United States signed three memorandums of understanding (MoU) in the fields of energy efficiency, trade promotion and innovative project grants on the sidelines of the fourth annual US-Morocco Trade Forum, held Thursday in Washington D.C. The first agreement, signed by the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency (AMEE) and the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (IGSD), aims to strengthen cooperation links in the research and development of environmental systems and air conditioning using reduced GWP refrigerants. Moreover, the partnership will identify ways to better calculate and compare the carbon dioxide equivalent between greenhouse gas emissions and those of fossil fuels used by air conditioners.    The second Memorandum, signed by the Moroccan Small Enterprise Assistance Funds (SEAF), the Central Guarantee Fund (CCG), the American Wise Capital, and BMCE Bank Group, aims to mobilize the resources of the Morocco Growth Fund (SMGF), an investment fund strategy that invests in innovative companies based in Morocco with strong growth potential. The initiative plans to invest in “3Dental,” an innovative Moroccan company specializing in solutions for digital dental surgery. The company has developed a comprehensive surgical system based on a patented medical device, 3D surgical planning software, and 3D printing technology to help dentists perform dental implant surgeries in safer and less invasive conditions. The third agreement revolves around the renewal of the MoU between the General Confederation of Enterprises of Morocco (CGEM) and the American Chamber of Commerce, through which the two organizations agreed to pursue their common objective of boosting bilateral trade relations. On the basis of this MoU, the two partners pledged to promote business partnerships between Moroccan and US companies and to increase trade by taking advantage of the free trade agreement between the two countries. Organized by Morocco’s embassy in the US and the U.S. Africa Business Center (USAF BC), the fourth annual US-Morocco Trade Forum strives to identify business opportunities and potential US investments in Morocco in sectors such as energy, industry, and finance.  The event featured speeches by Moroccan and American public and private sector leaders and provided an opportunity for participants to share experiences and determine a means of improving the business climate in the countries.  US-Morocco Trade Forum is an annual conference whose purpose centers on promoting trade and investment partnerships between Morocco and the United States. Previous successful forums were held in Dallas, Atlanta, and Seattle.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – The Penitentiary and Reintegration Administration organized a one-day workshop for prison officials on the “treatment of prisoners and the prevention of torture” on Wednesday, April 18.  The training session, organized in cooperation with the Dutch Embassy in Rabat, is part of a project to reinforce human rights in day-to-day management of prisons.  The general delegate of the Penitentiary and Reintegration Administration, Saleh Tamek, declared that this training session “comes within the context of strengthening the capacity of the staff of the Penitentiary and Reintegration Administration in the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment in prison institutions,” reported the Turkish based, Andalou Agency.  The event comes as a response to the debate around the recent torture allegations against security forces or prison guards. Rif activist Nasser Zefzafi, who has been detained for “undermining state security” since May 2017, once again raised allegations of “physical and psychological torture and humiliation” during his trial at the Casablanca appeals court on April 10.  In the aftermath of Zefzafi’s allegations, which include rape by the judicial police interrogators, the deputy of the Federation of the Democratic Left (FGD), Mustapha Chennaoui, addressed a letter to the Moroccan Minister of Justice and Liberties, Mustafa Ramid, calling on him to seriously consider the Zefzafi’s claims, as they constitute “a serious human rights violation.”  In his letter, Chennaoui asked Ramid about the measures that his ministry intends to put in place in order to “put an end to these violations, ensure respect for human rights, cease torture and arrange sentences for those who use it, and not return to the misconducts of the “Years of Lead.”

Rabat- Four video assistant referees (VAR) will be implemented to help main referees and technicians during the 2018 World Cup, which will take place next summer in Russia, with the participation of the Moroccan national football team. “Everything will be centralized in one location in Moscow and all the referees will be based in Moscow,” FIFA referee Pierluigi Collina explained during a training seminar at the Federal Center in Coverciano, near Florence in Italy. Over the next two weeks, 36 referees and 63 assistants will be provided with training for the World Cup in Coverciano. The training includes workshops on VAR.  Roberto Rosetti described the VAR features, emphasizing that four video assistant referees will be deployed for each match of the tournament.  “There will be four VAR officials. The VAR principal will communicate with the main referee and can suggest that he comes to verify images on the sidelines,” explained Rosetti. “The VAR assistant number one will be in charge of following the match live while the review is taking place. VAR assistant number two will be specially in charge of off-side.” Two cameras will supervise off-side players during the World Cup. A third VAR assistant will be supporting the VAR principal, focusing on the respect of protocol, good communication between the teams, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). FIFA approved the use of video analysis to help referees review play during the Russia World Cup on March 16. On March 3, the International Football Association (IFAB) was the first organization to “unanimously approve” the usage of the VAR during the upcoming World Cup in a meeting held in Zurich, Switzerland. FIFA’s recent approval guarantees the use of VAR in the upcoming tournament. According to IFAB, this move “represents a new era for football with video assistance for referees helping to increase integrity and fairness in the game.” The technology of VAR was first used during a Confederation of African Football (CAF) competition during the 2018 Total African Nations Championship (CHAN),  which took place in Morocco from January 13 to February 4. VAR has already been incorporated in football tournaments in European countries, including the U.K., Germany, and Italy, according to British news outlet BBC. FIFA’s President Gianni Infantino, who attended the meeting said, “We hope and encourage a favorable decision in this respect because we are very positive about VAR.” The 2018 World Cup is set to kickoff June 14. This year’s competition is marked by the participation of the Moroccan football team for the first time in two decades. The Atlas Lions will play their first World Cup match on June 15 against Iran, while the second game will be against Portugal on June 20. Five days later, Morocco will battle Spain on June 25.

Rabat – Moroccan authorities are considering a Dakhla megaproject to revamp for the economic outlook of the country’s southern provinces. The megaproject entails the construction of an irrigation and desalinization facility, with the cost estimated to be around MAD 1.7 billion. The Ministry of Agriculture and Sea Fishing, which is overseeing and co-financing the project, says that the facility will have an impressive annual capacity of 30 million cubic meters, as well as a windmill park as an accompanying source of energy. According to Aujourd’hui le Maroc, the project scope and magnitude would constitute unprecedented improvements for agriculture and energy production in the southern provinces. The project will cover an area of 5000 hectares, and investments will operate in two phases: MAD 1.4 billion will go to the realization of the windmill park, whereas MAD 300 million will be invested in building a state-of-the-art irrigation system. This grand project will pull Dakhla and surrounding provinces in a new and totally different direction, say sources at the Ministry of Agriculture. Once completed, “it will yield roughly 500,000 tons of ‘garden crops’ with an added value or profit of 500 million MAD per year,” said the same sources, adding that other than the project’s many direct benefits, “it will also generate 10,000 permanent jobs.” As the Dakhla area is famous for its massive arable lands, another phase of the project will entail cooperation between the government and the private sector to “adequately exploit these massive agricultural areas,” for the region’s benefit. In that regard, the Agency for Agricultural development, a subsidiary of the Ministry of Agriculture, is said to be preparing a call for tenders to attract foreign and national investors to invest in agriculture and be part of the megaproject.

by Alexandra Gritta Rabat – Islamologist Tariq Ramadan denies all accusations of sexual relations with his first two complainants, but admits to having relations with the third. Ramadan’s lawyer, Emmanuel Marsigny, has acknowledged his client’s relations with one of the complainants. To date, five women have accused Ramadan of rape, but Ramadan’s defense indicated that the third incident is not what it seems. Marie, Ramadan’s third complainant, relayed statements Thursday to French newsource Europe 1. She also provided investigators with a dress allegedly stained with Ramadan’s sperm. Tests are still being conducted to determine if there is a correlation between DNA samples. Up until now, the Islamologist denied having any relations with the first two women who accused him of rape. But when confronted with the third woman’s evidence, he admitted to having sexual relations with her, if not the kind of relation she has specified.  “My client admits having a relationship with this woman, but not one like she describes,” stated Marsigny. On another note, Ramadan is currently suffering from multiple sclerosis, but his medical treatment thus far has not been deemed “incompatible” with prison detention. Ramadan has been imprisoned just outside of Paris since February. The 55 year-old theologian had banked hopes on being released due to his health condition. According to sources, he has suffered from “multiple sclerosis” since 2006,” informed doctors in a report filed with judges on Wednesday.

While Tariq Ramadan’s current care is not incompatible with detention, experts insist that Ramadan would benefit from access to better care, including its drug treatment and four times weekly physiotherapy sessions.

Rabat– Heir to the Moroccan throne, Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan’s education will join the Royal Preparatory High School for Technical Aeronautics (CRPTA) in Marrakech. Distinct from his father King Mohammed VI who studied law, Moulay El Hassan has chosen to pursue his studies in aviation.The crown prince, celebrated as “wise beyond his years,” is preparing for entrance exams to the Royal Aeronautical School-CRPTA, said Akhbar Al Yaoum in a press release on Wednesday. As one of Morocco’s most reputed institution in the aeronautics sector, CRPTA should serve as the perfect place for the crown prince to acquire the necessary knowledge of piloting techniques.   The same source notes that Moulay El Hassan’s choice to enroll in the aeronautics school does not necessarily suggest that he would take aeronautics as a permanent major. Soon-to-be 15 years old, Moulay El Hassan has shown strong leadership skills in many occasions, such as during his participation in One Planet Summit in France alongside King Mohammed VI, which made him the center of attention among French press that commented on him being the “youngest participant” in the summit. The Crown Prince’s tact and ability to communicate with world leaders has been applauded by Moroccan and European media alike, such as the Spanish newspaper El Mundo that paid tribute to the prince following his appearance at the One Planet Summit. El Mundo described the multi-lingual Crown Prince as “gifted and a polyglot,” and hailed the fact that he studies inside the Royal Palace with a selected group of other children who come from diverse backgrounds instead of attending private schools alongside the children of other wealthy families.

Rabat- Less than two months before the final vote for hosting rights of the 2026 World Cup, Morocco has already secured the continental bloc: all African national federations, or almost all, are reported to endorse the North African bid. Beyond mere endorsement, though, there is a genuine feeling of thrill among the African federations at possibility of a second World Cup on the continent. For the national federations that have publicly pledged their votes to Morocco, a Moroccan victory on June 13 would be synonymous with an African victory. The Cameroon legend Patrick Mboma, whose country has already vowed to support Morocco, denies Morocco’s characterization as a lone bid. Morocco 2026 is Africa 2026, the Cameroonian suggested, adding that Morocco has been an African stalwart in various sectors–a trendsetter and a genuine partner for fellow African countries. “I hope that the entire continent votes for Morocco, because its bid is solid. Since its readmission in the African Union (AU) in February 2017, this country has been a sincere advocate for Africa. Its role—diplomatic and economic—is real, concrete. The African must help a fellow African,” the Cameroonian said. But, BBC warns, Morocco has still a lot on its plate, as it has not yet secured the sympathy of the whole continent. According to the British outlet’s estimates, of the 54 African voters, 49 have officially lent their support to Morocco 2026. This means that 5 voters are yet to publicly announce with which side their sympathy or loyalty will lie on June 13. Although political leaders in Liberia, Botswana, Nigeria, and beyond have reaffirmed their countries’ unfailing supports to Morocco 2026, BBC cautions that the final decision resides with national federations, some of which may decide to change course on D-day. But, as things now stand, such a scenario is rather tenuous. CAF president, Madagascar’s Ahmad Ahmad, has repeatedly stated that he hopes is for the whole African footballing world will vote for Morocco and boost Africa’s chances of being taken seriously in the international footballing community. What is more, according to Le Monde, BBC’s warnings miss something of real significance: the endorsement of Algeria and South Africa. President Albdelaziz Bouteflika might have shocked many when he announced, following Tunisia, that Algeria will also be on Morocco’s side in Moscow. As for South Africa, in spite of its ruling party’s pro-Polisario rhetoric, the recent Pretoria-Rabat rapprochement, although not full-fledged yet, heralds rosy prospects, especially with reports that some in President Cyril Ramophosa’s inner circles have important businesses in the kingdom. These may come across as trite political considerations that yield no clout in the final decision; but given the politics involved in tournament like the World Cup, diplomatic and strategic calculations are of paramount importance. “When it comes to its sports diplomacy, Morocco has good and strong partnerships with over 40 African federations,” a diplomatic source told Le Monde on the topic, arguing that politics does play a key role in votes such as the one scheduled for June 13 in Moscow. Ultimately, beyond the borders of Morocco, a Moroccan World Cup would mean a lot for those in the continent who sometimes feel left behind and ignored in international debates. Africa should stand by Morocco because victory for Morocco means victory for the continent, both in terms of prestige and pride, explained former Algerian international Anthar Yahia, saying that he is “optimistic about Morocco’s bid’s prospects.” “The continent needs to organize events of international stature. And Morocco has the required capabilities. I remember that for South Africa 2010, there were questions about organization, safety, security… but everything went so smoothly. There always are prejudices about Africa. And what more than a World Cup can fight against this sentiment?” the Algerian asked. With 54 African nations and the majority of Arab countries expected to vote for Morocco 2026, the next stop for Morocco 2026’s is Europe. And there, too, things look rather promising: France, Belgium, Russia, Luxembourg, and Serbia have already publicly endorsed Morocco 2026. So, despite the CONMEBOL shock, Morocco, which needs to convince at least 104 voters to back its bid, is doing better than many had anticipated possible back when North African kingdom announced that it would challenge the North American triumvirate in August 2017.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of State for Human Rights, Mostapha Ramid, has been accused of advising Toufiq Bouachrine’s defense to pressure plaintiffs by Moroccan newssite Barlamane.com. Amid the allegations by the Moroccan website, Ramid announced via Facebook that he would sue Barlamane.com for false reporting.  Barlamane.com suggested that Ramid advised Bouachrine’s defense to delay their client’s trial, allowing more time to pressure plaintiffs to withdraw their charges. The Minister of State has denied all allegations. Journalists reported that Ramid would advise Boucharine’s defense, also claiming that Ramid coerced lawyers in Meknes and Tetouan to defend Bouachrine’s interests. He also advocated that the Moroccan lawyers maintain the right to recourse with foreign lawyers. Barlamane.com argues that the Minister of State failed in his duty to promote neutrality in Bouachrine’s case. In response, the Minister posted to Facebook, indicating his intention to sue the site “which has been used invent lies” against him. Bouachrine is the director of Moroccan newsource Akhbar Al Yaoum. He was arrested February 24 on charges of sexual assault, rape, and human trafficking filed against him. He appeared before the court yesterday, the first of several court dates ahead.

Rabat- The Director of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in the Maghreb region, Xavier Reille, called Morocco one of the few countries in North Africa with a sound investment plan and “investment grade,” on Wednesday. Speaking with Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) on the sidelines of the “Morocco, A Gateway to Africa” conference in New York, Reille said that Morocco is one of the “best-placed countries in the World Bank’s Doing Business report, and has a good investment framework, with a high-performance banking regulation.” Reille discussed the performance of the Moroccan-based financial hub Casablanca Finance City (CFC), describing it as one of the “best” business markets in Africa in terms of attractiveness and foreign investment. The African leading investment hub installed its headquarters in Morocco, “the crossroads of continents,” according to the official website of the international firm.

Rabat- In the same way that Joseph Blatter, the previous FIFA president, practically gave away the 2010 World Cup to South Africa, FIFA’s current president, Gianni Infantino, is attempting to similarly influence the outcome of the 2026 World Cup in favor of United 2026. Infantino has created one obstacle after another to counter the momentum Morocco has been building in the last few months. He started by sending a letter to FIFA federations, asking members to remain neutral in their selection of the 2026 World Cup host.  Despite his ostensible neutrality, Infantino was acting strategically, urging the African football federations to wait on their announcements of support for Morocco’s bid. Infantino further demonstrated his United loyalties when he barred Morocco from presenting its bid to the African Confederation Congress, while simultaneously allowing the United 2026 leaders to present their credentials to the Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (COSAFA).  Having arrived in Casablanca on February 2 to attend the 40th Ordinary General Assembly of Confederation of African Football (CAF), Infantino stated, “I ask you to do everything possible to make the process as healthy as possible. It is about our credibility.” Infantino’s remarks, however, did not please CAF’s President Ahmad Ahmad. In response to Infantino’s call, Ahmad said, “We live in an era of democracy. You are free to make your decision.” The CAF president, who has been expressing his full support for Morocco’s bid from the beginning, added, “I have my position, the executive committee supports me in my position, but it is up to you to decide.” It’s no secret that the FIFA president wants to give United 2026 the bid, in order to thank the Americans for removing former FIFA President Joseph Blatter from office. Infantino also owes US Soccer Federation President Sunil Gulati for encouraging federations to support the current president during the election process. That is to say, Infantino has a large debt owed to the Americans. He knows that without Gulati’s help, he would never have won the FIFA presidency, as Jordan’s Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein was the clear favorite to win. Despite Infantino’s efforts to disqualify the Moroccan bid, more and more countries have started to voice their support for Morocco. South Africa and Kenya are the latest countries to pledge support for the Moroccan bid. To prevent Morocco from reaching the final vote on June 13, Infantino devised a five-man evaluation task force, handpicked by the FIFA president himself. Currently evaluating the Moroccan bid, the task force will submit each country’s score based on five major criteria.  Widespread speculation has worried that the task force will score Morocco’s bid poorly, without considering future infrastructural development planned across the next eight years.  Furthermore, new voting option to “abstain” has been added to the ballot, allowing FIFA members to refrain from voting due to politics, when they should be making a choice instead. Morocco published by FRMF in response, in which the North African country’s bid committee leader expressed his concerns about the fairness and transparency of the procedure.  Expressing concern alone will not make Infantino rescind his plan, and Morocco will need to do more than simply express its worries and surprise if it wants to win the privilege of hosting the World Cup. Unless some major changes take place, Morocco will be virtually out of the running before the vote even begins.  To generate a real response, Morocco could convince the 54 African soccer federations to threaten to boycott the 2026 World Cup, should Morocco be unfairly disadvantaged by the last-minute task force addendum. As it stands, Morocco’s dream to host the World Cup is perhaps wishful thinking, considering that FIFA’s current president holds all the real power, just like biased Blatter before him. We can only hope the collective federation response can generate real accountability in the football world’s governing body.

Rabat – A video of naked women in a hammam has circulated social media for two days now. The 50-second footage was taken without the women’s knowledge, shot as the filmer pretended to be on the phone as dozens women around her were getting dressed. The video aroused resentment amongst  a large number of Moroccans, who considered filming and publishing these scenes a crime and an invasion to privacy, especially as the tape showed exposed women and girls. Some commentators have called for an investigation into the subject to reveal details of this incident and identify the individual who filmed and broadcasted the video on social media. Such behavior has already taken place in Morocco. In January 2018, French tourists spending New Year’s Eve in Marrakech snuck a camera inside the bathhouse of a hammam in the Bab Doukkala area and shot videos of the naked women.  One of the masseuses noticed the suspicious behavior of the tourists as they were trying to hide the camera. The employee then rushed to inspect the culprits, discovering that they had taken several pictures of the clientele. After alerting the authorities, both tourists were taken into custody at the nearest police station and an investigation was opened to clarify the circumstances surrounding the incident.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI will convene Morocco’s Council of Ministers at the Royal Palace of Rabat on Thursday evening. Several laws and appointment activities are expected to take place during the meeting. The Council of Ministers will occur just a few days after the monarch’s return to Morocco following the recovery period for his heart surgery in France. King Mohammed VI’s private plane arrived in Morocco’s Mohammed V Airport in Casablanca on Monday night. The monarch successfully underwent surgery in January, following a minor arrhythmia on an otherwise healthy heart, according to a statement from the Royal Place on February 26.

Rabat – The chief of Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces, General Abdelfattah Louarak, is currently paying a working visit to the U.S. Mr. Louarak, who is leading an important military delegation, was received on Tuesday at the Pentagon by his American counterparts, for discussions centering strengthening the dynamic security collaboration between the two countries. The visit, coming just days after the start of the bilateral US-Morocco-sponsored African Lion exercise in the North African kingdom, showcases the strong strategic and inter-operational framework driving the U.S-Morocco military partnership. Amidst the vital national security-related topics discussed, there was a pointed emphasis on Morocco’s recent steps to reshuffle its military equipment. According to Assabah, for example, the Moroccan Army’s chief and his American counterparts at the Pentagon had intensive talks about Morocco’s desire to acquire the U.S-made F-16 Block 70 fighter aircraft. The acquisition of the he F-16 Block 70, an aircraft hailed by many security experts as the latest, most advanced state-of-the art jet fighter ever produced, is an integral part of Morocco’s bid to upgrade its air targeting, attacking, as well as air-to-air and air-to-ground response capabilities. According to some close sources, should the kingdom extend and upgrade its air forces and F16 fleet with this newest model, the Royal Air Forces will reach an unprecedented level of sophistication in integrating its armed forces’ operational capabilities. Assabah reports the extent of the US-Morocco strategic collaborations—in light of the Pentagon’s recent move to gift Morocco with a dozens of tanks—has allegedly threatened Algiers. Citing “well-informed military sources,” the newspaper alleged that Algeria has signed deals with Venezuela to “deliver a number of Russian-made anti-tank missiles (ATGM) to the Polisario Front, as a way of responding to Morocco’s acquisition of a number of modernized weaponry. While this reportedly Algeria-endorsed ATGM acquisition aspires to counter the Royal Armed Forces’ heavily armored vehicles, the newspaper went on to allege that there are further reports of Algiers-sponsored “opaque and black market deals” to arm and train the separatist group against Morocco’s modernizing and upgrading air-defense system. When the US-Morocco sponsored African Lion military exercise kicked off earlier this week, 15 partner countries convened to develop, strengthen, and boost regional capabilities in the fight against terrorism and other transnational criminal activities.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat – How to win back Moroccan brains? A recent study by Moroccan job portal ReKrute reveals how the brain drain phenomenon affects Morocco. According to ReKrute, 91 percent of Moroccan professionals aged 35 and below as tempted to work abroad, in search of better work conditions and quality of life, which includes health care and comfort.  The study suggests that motivations vary on an individual basis, as many Moroccan companies fall short of employee expectations and do not put strong efforts into winning back the qualified people who have left for other countries. Young, well-trained Moroccan individuals set their sights on western countries, such as Canada, which attracts 37 percent of Moroccan professionals, making it the hottest destination, not only for Moroccans but for many citizens of the world, ReKrute emphasized. While thousands of high-qualified Moroccans look forward to emigrating to developed countries, 74 percent of Moroccans have already spent several years in foreign countries hope to go back to Morocco to put their talents and expertise to use in the kingdom. However, even these Moroccans hesitate before returning home, due to the unstable or less-stimulating work atmospheres. It is worth mentioning that a previous report issued by Moroccan outlet Medias24, indicates that Moroccan physicians and doctors, in particular, experience tough working conditions domestically–underpaid and under-equipped–which prompts them to emigrate. “After ten years of study, we are sent to faraway regions for miserable salaries and deplorable working conditions,” one Moroccan doctor stated. Facing such prospects, Moroccan medical professionals are increasingly choosing to remain abroad, rather than address the nation’s dire need for medical services.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – Nearly 200 diplomats, chefs, and Moroccan officials will return to the historic cultural capital Fez this weekend to celebrate the 3rd Festival of Culinary Diplomacy from April 19-22. “If politics divide men, then good food brings them back together,” explained Director-General of the United Nations Office at Geneva, Michael Møller. “In a world that finds it difficult to identify with the core values of human rights, sustainable development and peace, cooking remains a shared, everyday, and universal value.”  In addition to UN endorsement, a number of distinguished guests–including the French, Tunisian, Mexican, and Spanish Ambassadors to Morocco–will convene around the table to partake in culinary delights and engage in debate under the event’s theme: “Culinary Arts and Wisdom of the World: Gastronomy and Regional Cultures of Morocco and Abroad.” Headlining the festival are three world-renowned chefs: Morocco’s Najat Kaanache, France’s Christian Tetedoie, and Mexico’s Alberto Rebolledo. Each of the three nights will explore a fresh menu that fuses Moroccan and international cuisines through distinct culinary collaborations: Moroccan-Tunisian, Moroccan-Mexican, and Amazigh-French. For Kaanache, the weekend in Fez is also about acknowledging the contributions of Moroccan women. From agricultural fields to the kitchen, women play an integral role in preserving and elevating the country’s varied and distinct cuisine.  “When we talk about food, we cannot forget the most important instrument of the country: women,” Kaanache told Morocco World News. “When you do something with food, you can say so much…It’s about bringing magical human beings into the country and showcasing the people, places, and flavors of Morocco.” Faouzi Skali, the president of Par Chemins Concepts, initiated the festival in 2016 for the purpose of promoting diplomatic meals. General Director of the Festival Oussama Skali told Moroccan news outlet Le Matin, “Our goal is to list Moroccan gastronomy as UNESCO world heritage.”

Rabat – Moroccan officials and their Ivorian counterparts signed a collaborative program in the construction sector on Tuesday in Rabat, showing that the North African country’s development model, especially its technical expertise and know-how in fields with specialized workers, is attracting the attention and admiration of many at the continental level. The agreement, which was signed by Moroccan Minister of Housing and Urban Policy, Abdelahad Fassi Fehri, and his Ivorian counterpart, Claud Isac De, aims to strengthen bilateral relations in terms of transfer of knowledge and expertise sharing with regards to urban policies, city planning, as well as housing and construction know-how. In addition to creating to a better and working coordination of Moroccan and Ivorian urban policies and territory management, the agreement is also an integral part of the kingdom rapprochement with its sub-Saharan fellows: create and consolidate strong and effective bilateral and multilateral agreements facing the continent’s common challenges. This will done through the organization, in the future, of platforms and symposiums that will convene experts and decision-makers from both countries to discuss the challenges and perspectives for their respective urban policies. Speaking to the press after the signing of the deal, the Ivorian minister stressed the historical friendship binding his country to the North African kingdom. However, he puts a greater emphasis on the many reforms that have transformed Morocco into an example and an “inspiration” for many countries in the continent. “Ivory Coast strongly wishes to emulate Morocco’s model in the housing sector,” the Ivorian minister said. Mr. Isac De further explained that Morocco’s success in building decent, highly modernized houses, as well as its investment-friendly housing sector, are some inspiring realities that have captured the attention of his country’s decision makers. He also lauded Morocco’s “genuine engagement” in helping the development of the housing sector in Ivory Coast: “the launching of projects with high and discernible social impact, notably the construction of the Mohammed VI mosque, [and] the establishment of a vocational and training complex in tourism and the construction industry” demonstrate Morocco’s efforts in assisting its West African partner. Morocco’s Housing and Urban Planning Minister, for his part, underscored the reason for the continental appeal Morocco’s thriving and flourishing real estate sector. For the minister, Morocco’s continental reputation is based on the vital and “unquestioned role that the sector has played in the socio-economic development” of the North African country. Armed with its effective policies, institutional advances, and vast human resources, Morocco is ready to avail its expertise and policy model to its partners and “brothers” on the continent, the minister said. Mr. Fehri, who acknowledged that Morocco also has its own housing and urban planning challenges, despite the laudable advances made in recent years, reiterated the Moroccan  government’s commitment to creating an environment of decent, “inclusive, and affordable housing system.” The government is currently working to bring in “more legal, institutional, and regulatory reforms” aiming to further boost the sector’s performances, the Moroccan minister concluded.

Rabat – Morocco’s business leaders’ conglomerate, CGEM, has announced the “necessity of a new social contract for a more economically prosperous and socio-politically inclusive Morocco.” On the heels of organizing several symposiums on the challenges and opportunities of Morocco’s 2020 vision, CGEM announced a conference and “ideas workshop” to discuss the nation’s new social contract on April 26.  The workshop is expected to witness the widespread participation of important stakeholders, such as the High Commission of Planning (HCP), civil society, diplomatic delegations, leading business foundations, and government officials. Prior to the April 26 event, CGEM has reaffirmed its unparalleled involvement in the transformation and modernization of the country’s socio-economic landscape. The CGEM press announcement, released on Tuesday, emphasized the urgency and “necessity to rethink Morocco’s social contract” through generating and managing resources in order to achieve King Mohammed VI’s vision of a more accountable and effective civil service. Furthermore, the contract aims to promote a more inclusive and productive society. Loyal to the King’s vision of accountability and good governance, “the new social contract will involve all relevant authorities in devising a system oriented towards a constructive and responsible social project,” the news release indicated. As for the challenges ahead, CGEM cited the need for more integration between the education system and job market requirements,  a new vision of entrepreneurship (moving away from traditional business), and an inclusive social protection system, as well as a fair and fulfilling retirement policy. According to the document, the most critical social challenge will be the promotion of institutions that guarantee a social model where citizens will be not be judged on their values and life choices. This, CGEM elaborated, “necessarily includes the regulating: the job market and social protection… education, professional training, as well as family networks.” Other proposals included initiating new employer-employee relations, involving civil society and social workers in government social policies, and a comprehensive restructuring program for country’s education system. “We cannot keep producing graduates that the job market does not need.” It added: “It is urgent to reestablish trust between the job market, government administration, and social partners to generate more jobs. Everyone is an integral part of this, and we shall perceive each other as partners, and not foes.” The document concluded that the most critical aspect of the social contract, however, will consist of devising and promoting a society that accepts and celebrates Morocco’s ethnic and linguistic diversity. “We aspire to co-create a social model that welcomes our [diverse social] characters, ensuring a future in which everyone will feel involved.”

Rabat – The Paris-based news magazine, Jeune Afrique, criticized Algeria’s repeated reluctance to assume responsibility in the Western Sahara conflict on Monday. The magazine emphasized that Algeria’s denial of its status as a party to the conflict is “fiction.” The publication, “Western Sahara: Mohammed VI and the Hypocrites,” recalled the King’s latest message to the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who conveyed his condemnation of Algeria’s involvement in the conflict on April 4. The UNSG also decried Polisario’s maneuvers east Morocco’s defense wall. “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario,” said King Mohammed VI in a letter personally delivered to the UNSG by Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Nasser Bourita, in New York. Jeune Afrique’s managing editor and the author of the article, François Soudan, described the King’s statement as the “most incriminating statement ever said by the Sherifian sovereign against the Bouteflika regime.” Soudan added that the statement is part of a specific context: “The desires of Sahrawi independence movement to relocate part of their headquarters inside a no man’s land, considered ‘liberated’ territory,” by the Polisario Front. The separatists actions, however, constitute a “casus belli” for Morocco and “violations of Military Agreement 1,” which threaten the stability of the region and the UN-led political process. The author of the publication emphasized that it is a matter of time before the United Nations invites Algeria to “the negotiating table” alongside the Polisario. Guterres’s report on the Western Sahara situation, published on March 29, urged the separatist group to withdraw from the region, and called on Algeria to shoulder its responsibility and cooperate in finding a solution to the conflict. Soudan concluded his brief analysis, saying, “As long as we have not admitted [that the Western Sahara conflict] is the consequence, not the cause” of the conflict between Morocco and Algeria,  “we will keep playing with fire for a long time.” Soudan also recommended that Algeria should engage in the UN-led political process. Algerian officials, including Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia and Foreign Affairs Minister Abdelkader Messahel, have been denying the country’s involvement in the conflict, claiming that the Western Sahara issue should be solved by Morocco and Polisario alone.

By Hajare El-Khaldi Rabat – Following their unexpected arrival in Casablanca on Monday, April 16, the five FIFA Task Force members have, reportedly, added Tetouan to their itinerary. When the task force shifted their arrival airport from Marrakech to Casablanca at the last minute, a source that facilitates planning for the task force told Medias 24 that the sudden change was tied to the delegation’s desire to assess the air connections at Morocco’s leading airport.  The five FIFA representatives reportedly landed in Casablanca at 8 p.m., before boarding a connecting flight to Marrakech. After “arriving at the Menara airport around 10 pm on a Ram flight, they carefully inspected the terminal for nearly an hour,” according to the same source. On Tuesday, April 17, the task force members inspected the ochre city infrastructure, including the Grand Stadium and the Former Harti Stadium, which will serve as training camps for the teams.  The speaker maintained, “So far, everything has been going very well, especially considering the Menara airport and the stadium are gleaming up to international standards.” The visit continued in Agadir on April 17-18, after the task force drove south to assess the quality of the country’s motorway network, which provided no “problem, as the recently built highway is well equipped with rest areas,” declared the source. The delegation will reportedly visit Tetouan during the two days planned in Tangier, a decision previously undisclosed in their program. Once again, the source revealed that the five members will evaluate the progress made in the construction of the football stadium, as well as that of Tetouan’s reception facilities.  “The choice to add Tetouan to their inspection itinerary isn’t innocent and neither is their trip by car, since it will allow them to assess the quality of the national road that connects the two northern cities,” the source shared.  The changes were justified by FIFA as a test to verify the claims of the Moroccan bid and detect any “possible flaws.” The task force will end their visit at the Mohammed V Airport, before returning to Switzerland to submit their technical conclusions that will influence the fate of the Moroccan bid.

Rabat – “Gold toasted sands clash with purple skies, creating a harmonious balance that could only be achieved in the Sahara Desert.” One the most breathtaking landscapes in Morocco has been awarded a spot on the prestigious “Travel Bucket List Experience.” The online travel agency Flight Network ranks the Moroccan Sahara the best spot “to sleep under the stars,” coming in at number 17 out of 50 destinations overall. The Canadian company has described it as “a land unlike any other” and advised the tourists: “begin this bucket list adventure by riding a camel to a campsite of choice as the sun sets.” “When night falls let yourself be swept up by the night sky of the Sahara which is storied for its brightly lit stars. Without light pollution from man-made structures, the Sahara Desert offers a view of the universe incredibly unique to the area,” added the company. “Stargazing will never be the same as the time spent in the Sahara,” concluded the Canadian agency, which ranked African safari as its number one experience on the bucket list. In 2015, the Moroccan Sahara ranked among the world’s top 10 arid destinations for desert holidays and tours, according to the British daily newspaper the Telegraph. Morocco’s tourism industry can take pride in yet another morale boost, a credible validation of those who have visited the North African country’s many fantastic destinations. The huge investment in tourism infrastructure and the exquisite cultural richness have turned Morocco into one of the most sought-out tourist destinations in the world. Formed in 2005, Flight Network is the largest Canadian-owned online travel agency. It specializes in providing global travelers with the lowest-price airfares, hotels, vacation packages, and car rentals.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat- Morocco’s Embassy in Russia is organizing “mobility booklets” for Moroccan football fans attending the 2018 FIFA World Cup, taking place June 14 – July 15.  Morocco’s Ambassador in Moscow, Abdelkader Lacheheb, announced the booklets in a statement to MAP on Tuesday, emphasizing that the information packets will provide assistance with public transportation, travel documents, and the FAN ID required by Russian authorities to attend matches.  “The validity of this identification document, which should be carried throughout the tournament, starts ten days before the first match and extends to ten more days after the final match,” Lacheheb explained. The mobility booklets will also provide brochures with information on nearby hospitals in case of emergencies, as well as locations of hotels, museums, and stadiums and information about Russian law and regulations. Flights will be organized by Royal Air Maroc (RAM) to take off from Casablanca airport to the cities hosting the matches where Morocco’s Atlas Lions will play: Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Kaliningrad, with other cities to be added in case the national team makes it to the next rounds. The Saint-Petersburg stadium will host the opening match of Atlas Lions against the Iranian team on June 15. The second scheduled match will be against Portugal team on June 20, while the Lions will faceoff against the Spanish team on June 25. For the first time since 1998, the Atlas Lions have emerged as heroes returning to the World Cup.  “We do not fear anyone,” the Atlas Lions coach Hervé Renard said following their qualification. Hopefully, the team’s current winning streak will continue into the upcoming friendly games and the start of the tournament.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat- A mother gave birth immersed in a pool of warm water in Safi on April 11, marking the first “water birth” of its kind in Morocco. Water birth is a birthing method in which the birthing mother spends the final stages of labour and delivery in a birthing pool filled with warm water. The method is said to ease stress and pain during labour, mimicking the amniotic fluid sac, where the baby has developed for nine months. The Safi patient successfully delivered her newborn in a birthing pool in the women’s clinic “Mère et Enfant Nour,” thanks to the guidance of gynaecologist, Ghita Sabra Es-souiti who shared information on this experience with Moroccan news site Media24. 
“Patients have always been hesitant about trying this little-known method, particularly in a small city like Safi,” she added, “this [water birth] was the first in a Moroccan hospital.” Es-souiti explained that the patient was very excited about trying water-birth, though the success of this practice warranted regular exercise, special diets, and medical follow-ups. The first documented water-birth in the world took place in France in 1805, when a mother who faced difficulties during her labor was taken to a warm bath where she soon gave birth. Today, water-birth offers many advantages to both the mother and baby: buoyancy promotes more efficient uterine contractions and improved blood circulation, reducing labor pain and increasing oxygen flow to the baby. It also allows the mother to shift and change positions smoothly. The warm water provides an environment similar to the amniotic sac for the baby, smoothing the child’s transition into the world. The water birthing method slightly raises risk of water inhalation for babies who experience stress in the birth canal, according to the British Medical Journal. Despite its minor risks, the method’s safety rate is 95 percent. Es-souiti remains a strong advocate for the water-birth method, as it reduces labour pain by 60 to 70 percent and ensures a faster delivery. The medical fee for water-birth in Morocco ranges from MAD 3,000 to MAD 6,000.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat- Morocco plans to tax Airbnb and Booking websites in order to offer equal opportunities for hotels and traditional travel agencies, starting 2019.  According to Mehdi Taleb, Head of Regulation, Development and Quality at the Moroccan Ministry of Tourism, Air Transport and Social Economy, the new regulations aim to bridge the gap that financially harmed more than 3,800 hotels and hundreds of local travel agencies, reported Bloomberg. “Critics say the unregulated, unlicensed short-term rental market has hurt conventional travel operations and driven up property prices, while depriving governments of revenue,” read the article.  The Moroccan authorities, who will cooperate with undercover hotel inspectors to reinforce the new rule, will also help local online travel platforms effectively compete with global websites by boosting the quality of their offers.  Taleb declared that the changes are part of the country’s efforts to tackle the “new reality which is distorting visibility for our tourism development strategies,” especially given the fact that 60 percent of the tourists visiting Morocco evade the traditional tourism market by planning their holidays online.  In Africa, Morocco ranks second to South Africa in terms of Airbnb traffic, with 20,000 users aiming to rent homes. Traditional businesses welcomed the government’s decision, but remain skeptical about its ability to “outwit” the internet and the new technologies amid economic challenges.  The owner of Auberge Dardara in Chefchaouen, Jaber Al-Halabi, told Bloomberg, “the market here is totally imbalanced because of Booking.com, Airbnb, and the informal rental sector,” he added, “many people squat with relatives so that they can rent their own homes to tourists. Poverty is the problem.”

Rabat – Each year, the beautiful city of Essaouira devotes its maze of streets, lovely beaches, and vibrant public squares to music for the annual Gnaoua World Music Festival. This summer, from June 21-23 the beach town will celebrate the festival’s 21st anniversary. “Since the birth of the festival, its unique character has given it a special place amongst cultural events, confirming to the world that Africa is more than ever a land of dialogue and creation,” states Neila Tazi, producer of the Gnaoua Festival.  The festival will be marked by the presence of award-winning “jam-band” Snarky Puppy, which will both open and close the event. One duet, in particular, will celebrate the musical heritage of the African continent: young Gnaoua artist and guembriand player Asma Hamzaoui (Bnat Timbuktu) will draw from her Malian roots to pay tribute to the Tagnaouite tradition, in collaboration with Fatoumata Diawara, who sings despite the prohibition to practice music by Islamists in northern Mali, from where she comes. Diawara refuses to sing in English or French in homage her African heritage, instead drawing inspiration from the tradition of Wassoulou singing. “They have the courage and the bravery for niche but also the love of the inheritance in common,” Tazi said. The Gnaoua Festival will also host the Project BIM Group (Benin International Musical), a collective of Beninese artists who will play some voodoo rhythms and traditional songs with electric modern grooves. The collective will share the stage with the Gnaoui master Maâlem Hassan Boussou. Gnawa festival has become a point of pride for Essaouira’s inhabitants since its founding in 1998. Faithful to its African roots, the Gnaoua and World Music Festival of Essaouira reminds us that all music originates from the cradle of humanity. The festival has always welcomed the greatest of the African scene such as Youssou N’Dour (Senegal), Amadou and Mariam (Mali), Bassekou Kouyaté (Mali), Toumani Diabaté (Mali), Doudou N’Diaye Rose (Senegal), Oumou Sangaré (Mali), Sibiri Samaké (Mali), and Baaba Maal (Senegal). With music blaring throughout the streets of the city, the thousands of people who head to the three-day festival are expected to give a major boost to the city’s tourist economy, especially in the local restaurant sector.

Rabat- When FIFA decided to appoint a special committee of five experts and charged them with evaluating and appraising the “technical merits” of the contending bids for the 2026 World Cup, there was understandable concern and suspicion that the move was part of a broader plan to thwart Morocco’s hopes of hosting the most illustrious tournament of the beautiful game.  The suspicions gained a wide following when FIFA’s president—somehow unwittingly—showed glimmers of his pro-America leanings when it comes to the hosting rights of the 2026 edition. According to recent reports, however, Morocco’s bid will allegedly not be disqualified by the task force. The task force, which arrived in Morocco on April 16, is currently engaged in a week-long tour during which the five-man committee will visit four of the 12 cities expected to host the ultimate tournament, should Morocco’s bid emerge victorious in June. Reporting yesterday on the committee’s first impressions of Morocco’s technical readiness to host the tournament (i.e. stadiums, infrastructure, hotels), Al Akhbar said that present indicators point to a certain impossibility of that Morocco’s bid will be disqualified on purely technical grounds.  While the North African bid exhibits some technical weak spots, particularly the size and “modern appeal” of the venues picked to host the matches, Morocco also presents a mountain of undeniable merits upon which many football connoisseurs agree. What is more, the country still has time to attend to many of its current weaknesses prior to the tournament in 2026, as it constructs new venues and modernizing existing structures.  Historically, Brazil in 2014, South Africa in 2010, Qatar in 2022, and even Russia 2018, adopted a construction program to renew, modernize, and also build stadiums. Given Morocco’s robust infrastructural plan for the years leading up to the tournament, any dismissal on purely a technical basis is highly unlikely. However, as with any major development plan linked to a global event, past World Cup tournaments have come with national complaints that the money should have been invested in good of the country as a whole, as opposed to building venues for a one-month long tournament. But to that claim, the organizing committee of Morocco 2026 has an answer: sound investments to benefit both the game and society at large. In other words, Moroccan officials know that they need to bring novelty and effectiveness in their way of connecting the emotional and socio-economic factors that accompany such an international celebration.  “We want to use football to change lives,” said the chief of Morocco 2026 in a recent interview with ESPN, suggesting that the investments proposed for Morocco 2026 will be allocated in a sound and long-term beneficial manner. As for the merits of the bid, Morocco’s organizational and socio-economic strengths include the established reputation of the country as a touristic hub, complete with state-of the art hotels, historical cities. Its strategic location bridging Africa and Europe (and providing a better viewing time zone for football fans) is undeniable. Morocco’s bid is not one that can be disqualified, or even ignored–at least technically. Which brings us the next advantage of the North African country: the national passion for football–such a sustained and mythical love is a sure recipe for a memorable tournament. But that would be grossly beside the point: will the task force eliminate Morocco’s bid? Or can it? Maybe it might want to, but it is arguable whether it can, or will, especially given FIFA’s recent response to Morocco’s concerns over the new body. Football’s governing body labeled the results of the task force as “not required, but influential” earlier this month. The  contradiction between the delayed announcement of the “influential” task force has let many to believe that FIFA seeks to label Morocco “technically unfit,” or a potential waste of resources for FIFA and other involved parties, in order to affect the final June vote. If the speculation proves to be true, Morocco must maximize the remaining month and a half to defend the merits of its bid and convince—as they’ve been doing for months—national football federations that voting for Morocco on June 13 is the best choice.  Hence, while Morocco 2026 should not completely dismiss the task force and its “expert opinion,” the organizing committee should be redirect its campaign to appeal to more federations, because that is all that truly matters. The South American confederation, which was expected to endorse Morocco, has just announced support for its continental representatives. This, and not the task force’s evaluation (whatever that will be), constitutes a major blow to Morocco 2026. Moroccan officials in charge of promoting the bid should make sure that this does not happen again. The task force can say what it thinks, and Morocco can do little, if anything at all, to change that. But what Morocco can do, and what it should really be focusing on, is work harder to win the hearts and minds of those who will make the final decision.

Rabat – One month after being dubbed the top investment destination in Africa, Morocco has been ranked the 3rd best place to invest in Africa. The latest annual report by the Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) underscores the country’s attractive new investment opportunities as a result of Morocco’s recent extensive economic reforms. The report, “Where to Invest in Africa,” further demonstrates that Morocco has become a priority destination for investors eyeing expansion ventures on the continent.  According to the report, the top 10 most attractive African countries for investment have instituted regulatory advances or institutional reforms, diversifying (or in some cases, expanding already-diversified) national economies. Additionally, Africa’s “Top 10” all maintain large populations with an emerging and lively middle-class. Rand Merchant Bank, which bases it assessment on market activity, the operating environment (rules and regulations), and investment attractiveness, says that, overall, “it has been a smooth ride for Africa.” Referencing Morocco’s steady presence among Africa’s economic leaders and trendsetters, the report said: “Morocco has retained its #3 rank for a third consecutive year, pulling well ahead of Ethiopia (#4) and Ghana (#5). A greatly-enhanced operating environment has served Morocco since the Arab Spring.” The report’s top 5 includes Egypt, South Africa, and Ethiopia, which respectively came in first, second, and fourth. As for the bottom five of the top 10, it includes Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Tunisia, and the Ivory Coast. However, in spite of the remarkable pace of the continent’s fastest-growing economies, the report noted that some continental giants have been struggling “to adapt to the prolonged slow-down in commodity prices and sluggish levels of production growth.”  These under-performing “regional stalwarts” include Nigeria and Algeria, which have fallen to 13th and 15th respectively.

Rabat – The Brazilian Jonas Gonçalves Oliveira, who currently plays for Benfica, leads top scorers in Europe with 33 goals scored in 30 matches. Meanwhile, Mohamed Salah’s performance has continued to improve, as he is now the second top scorer in Europe, ahead of Lionel Messi, who scored 29 goals, and Robert Lewandowski with 27 goals. In 32 matches, the Egyptian star has scored 30 goals, the last of which from the home match against Bournemouth on Saturday, leading Liverpool to a 3-0 win. The 25-year-old player, who figures among the world best footballers, is making new achievements as he is the first African player to exceed 30 goals on the English field.  As for the Golden Ball holder, Cristiano Ronaldo is enduring his worst season in La Liga since joining in 2009, currently ranked 9th in Europe with 23 goals in over 32 matches. As the most expensive player in history and a Barcelona star for the past 4 seasons, Neymar Junior is currently ranked outside of the top 10 scorers in Europe, ranked 13th with only 20 goals this past season with Paris Saint-Germain. Though the Brazilian attacker has lit up the Ligue 1 with his skills and dribbling, he needs to up his goal count. However, in the Champions League, Ronaldo remains the irresistible leader; with 15 goals, the Portuguese maintains 7-goal advantage over Wissam ben Yedder, who plays for Sevilla. Mohamed Salah and his teammate Roberto Firmino have also scored 8 goals each. As for Neymar and Messi, they have both scored 6 goals each, coming in at 9th and 10th respectively. Despite his dicey season, the Champions League golden shoe is certainly in Ronaldo’s favor, his second consecutive golden shoe and fifth overall.

Rabat – After the circulation of allegations that security authorities raped a 16-year old boy in Imzouren, a town in northern Morocco, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) published a statement earlier today firmly denying the claims. The statement referred to several Facebook pages claiming that a young boy had recently told the court that he had been raped by investigators. Contesting the claims, DGSN said that Imzouren police services did not present any minor before the judicial authorities during the 2017-2018 period.  The administrative and judicial records kept by the security services do not include any investigation with a minor of the same identity. The statement added that the national security services reaffirm that they have not received any complaints or instructions from the courts concerning the statements or the allegations. The DGSN described the claims as rumors that aim to tarnish the reputation of national security officials, emphasizing that the authorities have the right to file complaints against the people who published false information.

Rabat – Delegations from the Moroccan army and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation are currently taking part in an international meeting organized by Nigeria and AFRICOM to discuss terrorism-related issues in Abuja, Nigeria. At its Monday opening, the event convened participants from fifty countries from Africa, Europe, and the Americas. The Moroccan delegation will present its peacekeeping operations, as one of the many countries that have contributed peacekeepers to help bring stability to the conflict-stricken African nation. Since it was established in 2014, MINUSCA has deployed over 12,000 troops to the country to protect civilians, following concerns over CAR’s “security, humanitarian, human rights, and political crisis.” Earlier this month, Moroccan peacekeepers carried out a joint operation with law enforcement to rescue 15 people who were taken hostage in the village of Koumboy. The operation of the Royal Armed Forces and Central African Armed Forces led a rescue of 15 people who had been taken hostage by the so-called Lord’s Resistance Army. The hostage-taking by the rebellion groups took place on March 30, in Koumbou, near the eastern city of Obo in the Central African Republic. In October 2017, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres paid tribute to Moroccan and Cambodian blue helmets during his visit to the Central African Republic.

Rabat – Faced with the constant criticism of “ineffectiveness, inefficiency, and lack of adequate equipment” in Morocco’s public health sector, the Ministry of Health has announced a new collaborative program with foreign health practitioners. The program, initiated by the Minister of Health, Anas Doukkali, will seek the services of foreign doctors to operate in rural areas of the kingdom, a task that their Moroccan counterparts generally decline. In the province of Tata, for example, there are only 8 doctors to attend to the health problems of a population of over 120,000 people. In the initial phase of the Ministry of Health’s new program, 20 experienced Senegalese health practitioners and medical graduates are expected to start operating in Tata in coming weeks, a move that will increase the remote region’s medical staff to 28 professionals. Reports indicate that Senegalese doctors were selected after a call for applications and a thorough evaluation process that Moroccan officials, with the help of their Senegalese counterparts, launched the country’s capital, Dakar. Explaining that some other contracts have been signed with sub-Saharan doctors, as well as professionals from outside the continent, the minister added that additional foreign doctors will be joining Morocco to operate in other far-away provinces. And according to Al Ahdath Maghribia and Al Massae, the first outlets to report on the story, the Minister of Health also justified his decision in terms of a desperate step that was needed to end “the health desert” ailing many enclaved and rural regions and provinces in Morocco. Earlier this year, the health ministry organized a test with the aim of recruiting 32 health professionals for work in rural areas. Sadly, however, the test organizers received no applications, say some sources at the ministry. Deploring Moroccan doctors’ refusal to work in places that need them more, Al Ahdath Maghribia decried that many highly-trained Moroccan doctors choose to migrate in France for “better opportunities,” exacerbating the already-serious brain drain befalling many sectors. The newspaper added that 53 percent of the medical professionals who stay in the kingdom prefer to work in the private sector, an option that brings “juicier opportunities” than the “decaying public sector.”

Rabat – The Head of the Bar Association in Rabat, Mohamed Barikou, issued a note on Monday, urging his lawyer colleagues to “dismiss all documents or files presented in the French language to every court and demand their translation in Arabic.” The note calls for lawyers in Rabat demand Arabic translations for all legal documents originally presented to the courts in French, to ensure the application of justice: “I invite you to dismiss all documents published in French language and demand for their translation in Arabic,” Barikou stressed, underscoring the application Rabat’s Administrative Court of Appeals’ latest decision, which launched on January, 31, 2018. Initially presented in June, 2017, the appeals court calls for a ban of the French language in all legal documents, describing its use by Morocco’s state institution as “illegal” and “unconstitutional, as it is not included in the country’s law.” The court also references the fifth article of Morocco’s Constitution, which recognizes Arabic as the official state language, and calls for the ban to be applied in line with a previous request conjointly made by National League of Arabic Language and former head of the Bar Association, Abderrahman Benamrou.

Rabat – The criminal chamber of Casablanca’s Court of Appeals has decided to postpone further investigation into the Taoufik Bouachrine case. The director of Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum currently stands accused of hefty charges, including involvement in human trafficking and sexual harassment and rape, The representative of the public prosecutor has rejected all requests made by Bouachrine’s defense team. One of the defense’s foremost requests was to render the accounts of Afaf Berrani, one of the complaints, invalid for use as evidence during the trial, report Moroccan media. Berrani is a young woman who filed and retracted a complaint against Bouachrine, accusing him of sexually harassing her. Berrani then accused the judicial police of “falsifying” her statements, and claimed that she had not actually been assaulted. However, in response to her contradictory statements, she was charged with false testimony, and a video of her accusing Bouachrine of assault was screened at a press conference.  The representative of the public prosecutor has asked that the defense to write out their requests and send a copy to the lawyers of the complainants for approval. Bouachrine is scheduled to appear before the jury on April 18.

Rabat – There is good news on the horizon, something that will likely soothe the “excruciating pain of waiting” that Adidas and Moroccan footballing authorities have inflicted on Moroccan fans: we now know the date of the official unveiling of Morocco’s World Cup kits. Or, we almost know the date. While many—if not all—of the qualified teams for the Russia 2018 World Cup have already unveiled their kits the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) and Adidas, in contrast, have still not launched those of the Atlas Lions, provoking outcry and anxiety among the North African squad’s fans. The German company has allegedly promised that the national squad’s Russia 2018 kits will “be available in May,” which still leaves two weeks—or more—before this desperate and anxious suspense reaches its final phase, according to Moroccan news outlet Le 360. The German company told the Moroccan newspaper that FRMF contacted them later than their other partners, thus explaining why there has been such a protracted delay in the production and official presentation of Mehdi Benatia and co’s jerseys. “Our engagement with Morocco’s Royal federation came later than the ones with our other partner federations, which caused the delay in the conception and production process,” Adidas said. The reason that Adidas is now giving contradicts an earlier statement in which the German giant expressed its “concerns over forgery” as the primary reason for the delay. In the statement, the company said that it was “waiting for the appropriate moment” to officially disclose Hervé Renard’s boys’ Russia 2018 equipment. So, now that Adidas and FRMF have decided that May is the “appropriate time,” the Atlas Lions fans will hope that they mean early May, and not later. The Moroccan national team is scheduled to play three friendly games against Ukraine, Estonia, and Slovakia ahead of the official start of the World Cup on June 14.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – Morocco has extradited UK national Renwick Haddow to the US after a long criminal saga, finally sealing the USD 36 million fraud case.  According to a press release by the US Department of Justice, Haddow allegedly engaged in “schemes to defraud victims by making material misrepresentations and misappropriating investment funds” in several entities, controlled by him, including Bitcoin Store Inc. and Bar Works Inc. Haddow, who touted the professional backgrounds of unexisting senior executives, represented Bitcoin Store Inc. as an online user-friendly platform for purchasing, selling, and storing digital currency that generates millions of dollars in gross sales, while in reality the company’s bank accounts received less than USD 250,000 in incoming transfers in 2015.  “Haddow concealed his interest in Bitcoin Store and fabricated the purported ‘experienced team of leading investment professionals’ working at the company,” the US Department of Justice added, “in connection with Bar Works, Haddow adopted the alias ‘Jonathan Black’ to further hide his role in the schemes.” In 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) joined the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York in filing charges against Haddow for stealing more than USD 180 million over a decade ago in a Ponzi scheme, in which non-existent companies generated profits for old investors by acquiring new companies.  The defendant, who was arrested in Morocco on the basis of a provisional arrest warrant, appeared on the Southern District Court of New York on Friday, April 13.  Haddow, aged 49, has been charged with two counts of wire fraud for the Bitcoin Store and Bar Works schemes, facing up to 40 years in prison.

He continued,“I would like all Moroccans and Africans of the world support them at the beginning of this joint adventure, and we will all go very far together.”  The French-Moroccan actor further reminded Moroccans not to forget their candidature for the organization of the 2026 World Cup. Taghmaoui praised the Lions’ captain, Mehdi Benatia, who has been having a rough couple of days following controversy surrounding a penalty awarded to his Italian team club Juventus, resulting in the loss of a match to Real Madrid last week. “To this great man, this great player, this great captain of the national team of Morocco, Mehdi Benatia, we sincerely are very lucky to have you for the 2018 Russia World Cup,” stated Taghmaoui. Benatia, also known as “El Capitano,” responded with,“Thank you my brother for your message!

Rabat – The holy month of Ramadan is just around the corner, and the Moroccan government has started preparing its markets to meet the demands of citizens during the holy month. During a meeting of the Interministerial Commission on Monday, Minister in Charge of General Affairs and Governance Lahcen Daoudi said that Moroccan markets will be supplied with all the necessary products, which will be made available at reasonable prices during the holy month of Ramadan.  Daoudi said that the meeting served as an opportunity to evaluate the state of supply in the country, including fruits, vegetables, and cereals to last throughout the month. Daoudi also emphasized the importance of strict monitoring to avoid manipulations, which prevent fair competition in accordance with Law 31-08 enacting consumer protection measures. In March, Moroccan astronomer Hicham El Issaoui predicted that Morocco will observe the holy month of Ramadan beginning May 17, 2018. El Issaoui, who graduated from Dar El-Hadith El-Hassania for Higher Islamic Studies in Rabat, has predicted that Ramadan will begin in Morocco on Thursday, May 17, 2018. In addition to El Issaoui’s Ramadan prediction, some other Middle Eastern sources predict that Ramadan will start on Tuesday, May 15. However, the Ministry of Islamic Affairs will not confirm the official start day until astronomers first observe the crescent moon in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. Ramadan lasts from 29 to 30 days depending on the observance of the crescent moon and on relevant astronomical calculations. Next month, Muslims around the world will take part in rituals, including fasting and nightly prayers.   The Ramadan break-fast, known as ftoor, also serves as a special celebration for families to gather together and share a meal after a whole day of fasting.

Rabat – The US Armed Forces and the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces, along with allies and partners from 15 countries representing Africa, Europe, and North America, arrived in Morocco yesterday for joint military exercises, known as African Lion. These annual exercises are a combined multilateral exercise, are designed to improve the interoperability and mutual understanding of each nation’s tactics, techniques and procedures. Approximately 900 US military personnel from various units of the US Armed Forces participate in the multilateral training with units from the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces, as well as contingents from Burkina Faso, Canada, Chad, Egypt, France, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Mali, Mauritania, Senegal, Spain, and Tunisia.  “African Lion is a clear demonstration of the strong bond between our militaries,” said Lt. Col. Winston Tierney, who served as the lead planner for the exercise and is now serving as the acting task force commander. “This robust, reliable relationship is the cornerstone to shaping the security environment in the region.” The exercises include military training in command-post activities, academics, and field training, all of which focus on fighting violent extremist organizations. Aviation training, a humanitarian civic assistance mission, and a senior leader dialogue will also be included in the joint exercises. Lt. Col. Tierney emphasized that African Lion is an exceptional opportunity for the US Armed Forces to develop relationships with other nations and build trust in the future. “African Lion 18 is a unique opportunity for us to get to know each other, to train together, and to provide a greater level of trust [for] when we operate together in the future,” the lieutenant added. “This exercise is a true force multiplier as it promotes regional cooperation and grows the ability of African militaries to work effectively together.” In addition to the exercises taking place in Morocco, Tunisia will host a field training exercise accompanied by a senior leader dialogue which will address the lessons learned from the exercise. All US Forces will return to their home bases at the conclusion of the exercises on April 27.

Rabat – After years of delay, law 103-13 on the Elimination of Violence Against Women will enter into force this August, criminalizing all forms of gender-based discrimination, including public harassment, sexual assault, and cybercrimes. The Moroccan parliament released the final draft of the law on February 22,  verifying that “The law shall enter into effect after six months of its publication in the Official Gazette.” Morocco World News received an unofficial English translation of the law, translated by the international non-profit women’s rights organization, Mobilising for Rights Associates. This law introduces the new provisions and the amendment of several  articles in the penal code. Perpetrators of sexual harassment in public spaces, which includes the use words, acts, or signals of sexual nature for sexual purposes, will be punished in accordance with Article 503-1-1  of the penal code, or “considered as a perpetrator of sexual harassment crime.” Subsequently, those accused will receive jail time for one to six months, as well as a fine ranging from MAD 2,000 to 10,000. Written letters, phone or electronic messages, records, and images of sexual nature for sexual purposes are also covered in the article. “Such punishment shall be doubled if the perpetrator is a work colleague or one of those in charge of order or security of public places or else.” The new provisions on cybercrimes will punish suspects who intentionally, “by any means whatsoever,” broadcast or disseminate a combination of false allegations, statements, and pictures that seek to harm an individual’s private life or reputation “without prior approval.” The law stipulates sentences of to one to three years in prison, as well as a fine ranging from ranging 2,000 to 20,000 MAD. For many years, Moroccan women, human rights activists, and NGOs from across the country have urged the government to adopt a law that would protect women’s rights and criminalize harassment. Several recent incidents have sparked national attention, including a video of two Moroccan men sexually assaulting a young girl in the street and a similar assault incident filmed on a Casablanca bus in August 2017. Public protests erupted in major cities throughout the country in the weeks that followed the Casablanca bus incident, with protesters demanding an end to rape culture and the protection of women’s rights to public space and safety. The full official translation of the law with modified provisions can be found here.

Rabat – Morocco’s 2026 World Cup Bid committee received the FIFA Task Force delegation and other representatives of the FIFA administration on Monday. The five-member task force will spend three days in several cities around the country in order to evaluate Morocco’s assets and capacity to host FIFA’s massive tournament. FIFA’s Task Force will visit stadiuims, training camps, fan sites, and media centers in four Moroccan cities: Marrakech (April 16-17), Agadir  (April 17-18), Tangier (April 18-19), and Casablanca (April 19), according to a press release published by FIFA on April 7. In a statement published by Maghreb Arab Press, Moroccan bid Chairman Moulay Hafid Elalamy announced, “Thanks to the Kingdom’s strategies, led by HM the King and embodied by a whole people, Morocco is ready to welcome the members of the FIFA Task Force to our land of football.” He added that the country will offer FIFA and the football fans a remarkable tournament, stating that the World Cup in Morocco “would be a source of pride” and a “formidable catalyst for development.” FIFA’s Task Force committee includes Chairman of the Audit and Compliance Committee Tomaž Vesel; Chairman of the Governance Committee Mukul Mudgal; Member of the Organising Committee for Competitions Ilcho Gjorgjioski; FIFA Deputy Secretary General (Administration) Marco Villiger; and FIFA Deputy Secretary General (Football) Zvonimir Boban. The Task Force visit followed Morocco’s recent letters addressed to FIFA, expressing the country’s concerns over the scoring system. Royal Football Federation addressed its first letter to FIFA on March 25, regarding Morocco’s concerns about the fairness and transparency of the procedure. “To my surprise, the scoring system was finally sent to us on March 14–24 hours before Morocco submitted its file and two days before the deadline for the submission of applications to FIFA,” wrote the FRMF president. Lekjaa explained that this system adds “several technical criteria that were not part of the original regulations,” adding that some principles “have never been transmitted to FRMF in the preparation process of the Moroccan bid.” On April 3, FIFA responded to convey that the aim of the Task Force is to “determine whether the bids meet the requirements in terms of infrastructure and revenue-cost criteria.” FIFA’s arguments, however, were not enough to convince Morocco’s FRMF. “We have taken note of your answers, but unfortunately they have not resolved these concerns and we are still convinced that the scoring system does not comply with the requirements of the bid rules,” reads the recent letter of President of FRMF Fouzi Lekjaa to FIFA. Lekjaa continued, saying that Morocco was surprised this measure surfaced only 48 hours before Morocco submitted its bid. “The late distribution of the scoring system cannot be justified merely by the fact that it was communicated as soon as possible to the candidates,” he added.

Rabat – With Polisario’s recent escalation east Morocco’s defense wall in Western Sahara, Morocco has warned of a firm response to any further “provocations” from the separatist group. Moroccan experts on the subject shared with Morocco World News incisive analysis on the ongoing crisis and recent escalations in Western Sahara. Recently, tensions have been mounting between Morocco and the separatist group on the Western Sahara question, following repeated violations of the United Nations 1991 ceasefire agreement, which ended the 42-year war between Morocco and the Algerian-backed movement. For more than four decades, United Nations secretaries general and personal envoys have been attempting to end the situation, including its goal to relocate its “defense headquarters” in the restricted zone of Bir Lahlou, an area approximately 240 kilometers away from the Moroccan southern province of Es-smara. Outside of warnings and concerns over the situation, the United Nations and the Security Council have not done enough to make Polisario aware of its dangerous acts in east Morocco’s defense wall, according to Abdelfattah El Fatihi, a Western Sahara and Sahel expert, in an interview with Morocco World News. El Fatihi went on to say that Polisario has been defying the ceasefire agreement and “has not complied with international resolutions” since the issuance of last year’s report, which urged the front to withdraw from the Guerguerat buffer zone. Subsequently, the United Nations “has not been firm” in implementing its decisions to pressure Polisario, which has caused it to advance its separatist ideology, including the expansion of its facilities into new restricted areas such as Mhabes, Tifariti and Bir Lahlou, in northeastern Western Sahara. 
He added that, facing a lack of UN deterrent measures to push the front to comply with its international resolutions, Morocco can only resort to a military intervention to defend its territorial integrity and sovereignty in southern provinces “as long as the UN and MINURSO are no longer able to implement Security Council resolutions in the region.” On April 2, Stephane Dujarric,  the spokesperson of the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, ruled during a briefing at the UN headquarters in New York that his colleagues from the UN mission, which controls the ceasefire agreement, have not detected any military activities in the region. The statement, however, came in contrast to Gutteres’s first draft of the April’s report, as well as in a second statement to the Security Council, which was obtained and reported by the Associated Press on the same day. In both statements, Guterres warned the separatist group of their illegal actions in Guerguerat, asking them to withdraw from the region as they did in April 2017. In his second statement, reported by the AP, Guterres also urged the two main parties to the conflict-Morocco and Polisario-to refrain in order to avoid further escalations in the region, which could hinder the settlement process. When asked about the denial of the UN spokesperson, Moroccan analyst and academic Reda El Fellah believes that there can be two possibilities behind the UN’s reaction to Polisario’s maneuvers. “The first one is that the MINURSO is not following the situation east of the security wall for some reasons linked to its ability or its unwillingness to do so.” Referring to the second reason, El Fellah did not exclude the possibility that MINURSO, under the new head of operations [Colin Stewart], is influenced by external pressures that work to disturb the facts and insert discrepancies in the UN discourse and position.” The Moroccan analyst elaborated upon his argument, emphasizing that “some agendas inside the decision-making bureaucracy, in addition to lobbies inside US and Europe, are pushing for a different path, including the translocation of the Tindouf population and its headquarters east Morocco’s defense wall,  as well as the imposition of recognition of the so-called “liberated lands” in order to invoke a pseudo-right to exist as a state.” 
According to El Fellah, Morocco’s reaction would be more severe after the Security Council’s awaited report on the Sahara question. Polisario is actively soliciting the involvement of other parties, including the African Union, to the conflict. However, the United Nations Personal Envoy, Horst Kohler, stressed in his briefing presented to the UN Security Council last month in New York that the United Nations is the only body that has the legitimacy to contribute to an acceptable solution to the conflict. Furthermore, Kohler said that all of EU and AU officials he met reaffirmed their full support to the United Nations. Kohler’s statements were echoed by Guterres in his first draft of the April’s report, stating that the United Nations is the only body that has the power to help solve the decades-long conflict. Both observers contacted by MWN commented on Kohler’s report, emphasizing that it is in line with the new dynamic driven by the new secretary general towards a political and mutually-accepted solution. According to El Fatihi the first draft is balanced and respects Morocco’s position. He added that this document reaffirmed that the UN is still in control of the conflict, as opposed to what the front has been seeking to implement: involving the African Union, which is dominated by a group of forces supporting the separatist plan. El Fatihi said that the report appears to be similar to the previous reports that are in favor of Morocco’s position on the conflict. The United Nations Secretary-General issued his report on the Western Sahara situation on March 29. In his report, Guterres urged the separatist group to withdraw from the region, and called on Algeria to shoulder its responsibility and cooperate in finding a solution to the conflict. Algerian officials, including Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia and Foreign Affairs Minister Abdelkader Messahel, have been denying the country’s involvement in the conflict, claiming that the Western Sahara issue should be solved by Morocco and Polisario alone. In response to Algeria’s claims, Morocco has contested Algeria’s denial,  calling on its eastern neighbor to shoulder its responsibility in the conflict. “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario,” said King Mohammed VI in a letter personally delivered to the UNSG by Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Nasser Bourita, in New York on April 4.

Rabat – Hakim Ziyech had a rough night. The supporters of Ziyech’s team, Ajax Amsterdam, did not respond well to their 0-3 loss to ESV Eindhoven this past Sunday night, attacking the players’ bus after the game. In a video circulated widely on social media, the international Moroccan player can be seen trying to calm the situation, as Amsterdam supporters angrily surround him. Following the incident, the 25-year-old football sensation made some radical changes to his public persona, erasing all of his pictures with his Dutch Jersey and replacing his profile picture with one in which he is wearing his Moroccan jersey.   In a previous Interview with the Moroccan sports media Lionsdelatlas, Ziyech expressed his wish to leave Ajax. “I think I’m ready [to leave], I’ve said it many times, it’s not new. I want to challenge myself and develop myself, so maybe it’s time to go further and find a new challenge, ” he said without mentioning his future destination. The football star has his pick of offers. According to several media sources, the board of the Roman football club Roma As is attempting to recruit the star of Ajax. Inter Milan is also reportedly prepared to make a EUR 15 million deal with Ajax to steal Dutch team’s key midfielder.  Hakim Ziyech joined the football academy school of SC Heerenveen in 2003, and was able to make his senior debut for the team on August 2, 2012, during the third qualification round for the UEFA Europa League against FC Rapid Bucuresti. In 2014, Ziyech left Heerenveen for FC Twente, where he signed a four year contract. The footballer also played for the Netherlands under-19, under-20 and under-21 teams between 2012 and 2014. Born and raised in the Netherlands, Ziyech chose to represent Morocco instead. On October 9, 2015, the footballer made his debut for Morocco in a friendly game with the Ivory Coast, which ended with a 0-1 loss for the Lions. The attacking midfielder has been delivering great performances with both the Moroccan national football squad and Ajax. In the previous months, Ziyech helped the Moroccan team qualify for the 2018 World Cup. Morocco finished unbeaten during the qualifiers phase, defeating some of the most talented teams in Africa, including Gabon, Mali, and Cote d’Ivoire.

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat – A member of the Oulad Mesnaoui troop died after being shot in the head during a tbourida demonstration at the Festival of Roses, organized in Settat. During this year’s Festival of Roses, held each year in the Settat region, a horse rider was struck in the head by a bullet. He was killed upon impact.  The Rose Festival is held every year in Machraa Ben Abo, and this year marked its sixth annual edition. The event was supposed to continue through Tuesday, but after the incident, the organizers cut the festival short out of respect for the deceased’s family. Tbourida is a regional tradition, but the horseman’s recent death raises pertinent concerns regarding the lack of safety of such demonstrations.  Tbourida, also known as the “Powder Game” or “Fantasia,” is a type of synchronized horseback riding; essentially, it is a stylized cavalry charge. The tradition was first inspired by Morocco’s wartime history, as a way to commemorate its fearsome cavalry of old. Today, tbourida serves as a touchstone of Morocco’s historical imagination, sparking  many works of art and stories. Particularly popular in the rural regions of central Morocco and in the southern provinces, tbourida is considered a contest of endurance, speed, and elegance. Events are held during both religious and national holidays. In them, horses and riders adorn costumes, including specialized saddles and harnesses, as well as pearl-encrusted guns and curved daggers.  As a way of displaying their horsemanship skills, riders gallop in a line formation and fire their muskets into the air simultaneously, at their captain’s command. Then horses are then presented in front of a panel of judges. Due to the incredible precision the sport requires, errors on the part of the riders are quite common, and can result in misfires, falls, and unfortunately, even death.

Rabat – Morocco’s World Cup Bid is spreading its influence across the African continent. The Football Federation of South Africa has joined the list of the international countries expressing their willingness to vote for the African bid on June 13. The president of the South African Federation of Football (SAFA), Danny Jordaan, promised Morocco’s bid committee that he will “personally lobby” Africa’s football leaders before the vote. Jordaan has also promised the Moroccan bid that he will be personally engaged in attracting support from the Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (COSAFA). “It is an old myth that Africa doesn’t have the capacity and naysayers should stop using the political argument. Africa hosted the best FIFA World Cup ever and with good support, Morocco can emulate South Africa,” said the SAFA president. Joseph-Antoine Bell, a former Cameroonian international football goalkeeper, has also endorsed Morocco’s bid, emphasizing that Morocco has all the assets to organize a spectacular tournament.  Quoted by SAFA, Bell said “when South Africa talks on the continent, the rest of the continent listens hence it is vital for South Africa to support Morocco. South Africa has the experience and Morocco will use this experience to win the 2016 bid.”  SA will support Morocco’s 2026 FIFA WC bid, Jordaan.

Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Nasser Bourita, told the press after the Arab Summit attended by Prince Moulay Rachid that “the summit has unanimously affirmed its support” for the Moroccan bid and called upon all states to provide full support for Morocco. Many countries have already expressed their full support for the Moroccan bid, including Lebanon, Palestine, Nigeria, Qatar, Botswana, France, Luxembourg, Russia, Belgium, Tunisia, Egypt, and Algeria.

Rabat- Thousands of residents living in the Spanish enclave of Melilla are complaining about the lack of mobile signal coverage provided by Spanish network operators, leading many to grudgingly accept the expensive cost of Moroccan operators.  The Spanish daily Melillahoy reported earlier today, that thousands of residents living in different areas of Melilla such as la constitución, Mayorazgo, and La Quinta, are left without mobile coverage, which prevents them from making toll-free phone calls and connecting to the internet. Alternatively, many people purchase plans from operators in Morocco, which they say provide the city with stronger signals than those in Spain. “We do not understand how the Moroccan operators forcefully reach all parts of Melilla, while the city has several Spanish antennas. There are areas where coverage is very low or non-existent,” one resident of the enclave said. Despite better connections, many complained about the expensive costs of Moroccan operators. One resident explained that the calls through Moroccan operators are billed as if they were abroad.  For this matter, Melillians voiced their concern to the media and urged the Spanish authorities to take effective action.  The main mobile network operators in Spain are Yoigo, Vodafone, Movistar, and Orange. As in most of Europe, voice and data coverage are generally good in urban areas while connections are hardly accessible in rural and remote areas.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – The London Stock Exchange (LSE) hosts the third edition of ‘Morocco Capital Markets Days’ on Monday, April 16.  Organized by LSE and the Casablanca Stock Exchange (CSE), in collaboration with the Moroccan Embassy in Great Britain, this annual event aims to promote Morocco’s financial position by introducing UK investors to the business opportunities that the North African country has to offer.   In addition to presentations by Moroccan and British experts and discussions on the African financial market, this event will witness the introduction of the “Ambition 2021” action plan developed by CSE, which aims to inject a new dynamic into the Moroccan stock market and contribute to the construction of a more attractive financial center.  “Ambition 2021” redesigns the market to integrate the CSE in the African financial hub, thus facilitating access to capital and meeting the needs of international issuers and investors. This plan is structured around three axes: powerful market infrastructure, better financing for the Moroccan economy, and better consolidation for Casablanca’s regional position.  Implementing this plan would set the stage for an integrated, solid, open, and appealing stock market platform that meets the international standards.Morocco offers investors a competitive platform for export, macroeconomic stability, political security, access to a market of more than one billion consumers, ambitious sectoral strategies, and a business friendly-environment.  Earlier in March, the Moroccan Embassy in London and the British Developing Markets Associates introduced London to Morocco’s potential in several sectors, such as renewable energies, tourism, education, and finance; through the Moroccan-UK Trade and Investment Forum. Currently, over 200 Moroccan companies export their products to Great Britain, and nearly a hundred British companies are present in Morocco, such as GlaxoSmithKline, Shell, British Airways, and Unilever.

Rabat- The 28 European Union member states have approved a mandate instructing the European Commission to open new negotiations to include Western Sahara in the EU-Morocco fisheries deal and to consolidate the partnership between the two parties. Earlier today, the Council of the European Union adopted the negotiations mandate, ordering the commission to include the adjacent waters into the new fisheries deal, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported, quoting a European source. The source added that the mandate states that “the waters off the coast” of the region will be “covered by the fisheries partnership between Morocco and the EU.” According to MAP, the negotiating mandate falls within the framework of a joint statement issued by Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, on February 27, 2018. The statement came in response to the ruling handed by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on the EU-Fisheries Agreement, which decided that the fisheries agreement between the EU and Morocco is, “valid insofar as it is not applicable to Western Sahara or to its adjacent waters,” adding that, if the EU and Morocco included the Western Sahara region in their agreement, it would violate certain rules of “international law applicable to relations between the EU and Kingdom of Morocco.” The Moroccan and the European Union officials reiterated their commitment to the strategic partnership and their determination to preserve and strengthen it. Both parties have agreed to further reinforce their political dialogue and preserve the stability of trade relations.

Rabat – Authorities discovered large amounts of poultry droppings used to fatten up herds on a breeding farm near Aguelmous in the Khenifra province. In the fight against the usage of chicken excretions as livestock feed, headed by Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture, authorities seized copious amounts of droppings from a farm located at Aït Saîd Aït Amii, in the commune of Aguelmous in the Khenifra province, reported the Moroccan daily newspaper Al-Massae on April 16. As Aid Al-Adha draws nearer, the question of how to fatten herds has become even more relevant, seeing as after Ramadan, many goats, camels, and sheep will be sacrificed and eaten. According to Al-Massae, the commission that seized the chicken droppings was comprised of the Caid of Aguelmous, representatives of the Royal Gendarmerie, Auxiliary Forces, the Delegation of the Ministry of Health, the Dictorate of the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Chief of Veterinary Services in Khenifra. Together, they searched the farms’ stables and stores. There, they found 50 25-kilogram bags of chicken poop in the same area where the conventional feed was being stored. This was in addition to another 30 bags that were uncovered in other locations around the farm.  Al-Massae reported that members of the commission alerted the prosecution, and that a further investigation has been opened. The bags of droppings were seized by the officials, with the prosecution’s express permission. The discovery of the farm’s droppings bags has put the Minister of Health in a tight spot with the National Office for Food Safety (ONSSA). The campaign against the use of “animal waste” for herd nourishment has become very critical in recent years, as it affects the health of those consuming meat.

Rabat – The 29th Arab Summit has buoyed Morocco’s chances of hosting the world’s premier tournament. On Sunday, prominent Arab leaders confirmed their unanimous support for Morocco’s 2026 bid. Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita told the press after the Arab Summit attended by Prince Moulay Rachid that “the summit has unanimously affirmed its support” for the Moroccan bid and called upon all states to provide full support for Morocco. The 29th Arab Summit took place on Sunday in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Prince Moulay Rachid represented King Mohammed VI at the summit, which convened head of states and governments, representatives of Arab nations, and officials of various international and original organizations. The decision of the Arab summit to support Morocco’s bid came a few weeks after Saudi Arabia’s decision to lend its support for the three-nations North American bid  (USA/Canada/Mexico). On April 3, the chairman of the Saudi general Sports Authority (GSA) Turki Al Sheikh met with Carlos Cordeiro, President of the United States Soccer Federation, to express Saudi Arabia’s country’s endorsement of the joint American bid. “I was pleased to meet Mr. Carlos Cordeiro, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, and chairman of the United 2026,” the Saudi official said on Twitter shortly after his meeting with the chairman of the North American joint bid. Al Sheikh’s meeting with the president of the US Soccer Federation followed a series of tweets, in which he emphasized that Saudi Arabia will vote for the bid that will serve its interests. “Friendship and fraternity have been very detrimental to the Saudis…what really matters to me is that the 2026 World Cup needs to be hosted in the best conditions,” the Saudi said in mid-March, tacitly suggesting that United ‘26 was the Saudi federation’s choice. Al Sheikh has also politicized Saudi Arabia’s decision, criticizing Morocco’s neutrality the Gulf crisis between the Saudi Arabia coalition and Qatar. In a mid-March tweet, Al-Sheikh wrote, “Some people went astray. If you want support, you should seek it in Riyadh. What you are doing is wasting your time. Now ask the pseudo-state to help you,” referring to Qatar. However, Morocco has been offering to mediate a solution between the Gulf countries, reaffirming its neutrality to avoid escalation.

Rabat – Algeria is maintaining its position regarding the Western Sahara conflict, shirking its responsibility to put an end to the critical regional security issue. Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia echoed a statement made by his Foreign Affairs Minister, Abdelkader Messahel, who claimed that Algeria should not be involved in ending the forty-year conflict. Ouyahia reiterated in a press conference that tension between Morocco and Algeria is caused by the Western Sahara question. The Algerian official said that “Moroccans want to make Algeria a part” of the ongoing issue, whereas the solution lies between Morocco and Polisario, not Algeria.

The official added that his government will not be “dragged” into the conflict by the Moroccan press, noting that his country acts with “wisdom” when dealing with international issues under the leadership of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Ouyahia’s statements came a week after a similar statement made by Messahel. Both officials were responding to Morocco’s repeated requests that Algeria shoulder its responsibility and cooperate more fully in the political process. On April 4, King Mohammed VI addressed a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, also calling on Algeria to fully engage in meaningful actions that will lead to a resolution of the regional conflict. “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario,” said the King in his letter, which was personally delivered to the UNSG by Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita in New York. When asked about his opinion regarding the King’s letter during an interview given to French TV channel France 24, Messahel said that Morocco “claims” that the Western Sahara conflict is “a matter between Algeria and Morocco, whereas it is not the case. “It is a case between Morocco and the Sahrawi people, and between Morocco and the decisions of the United Nations,” the foreign minister argued. “Negotiations” on this situation have always been between “the Polisario representatives and Morocco, it will not change,” he claimed. Messahel went on to say that Algeria has responded to Morocco’s letter to the UNSG. In a statement published by Agence France Press (AFP), a source at the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that “Algeria’s support of the Sahrawi people and its legitimate representative, the Polisario Front, does not mean that it should be involved in negotiations” between Morocco and the separatist group. The narrative of Algerian officials has been challenged in recent days by the tragic crash of an Algerian military plane that was on its way to the Tindouf camps. Among the 257 people who died in the crash, 26 were members of the Polisario Front. The identity of the Polisario members was unveiled by the Ould Abbes Secretary of the ruling National Liberation Front, during a TV interview. The move drew the wrath of Algerian media, which accused him of “divulging state secrets”, and described is as “intolerable mistake” and a “failed public appearance” that amounts to treason.  Regional tensions have escalated in recent months due to Polisario’s repeated provocative military movements east of Morocco’s defense wall. In response to the Polisario’s maneuvers, Morocco has requested immediate intervention from the United Nations Security Council. Morocco has also warned that it would defend its territorial integrity and repel any further escalations in the region, including the use of Moroccan military forces if appropriate.

Rabat – Spain has positioned itself among EU countries to lend greater support for the proposal adopted by the European Commission to negotiate a new fisheries protocol with Morocco.  The Spanish daily La Opinion reported this week that Spain seeks to move the renegotiation process forward “as soon as possible” in order to avoid any period of suspension that could have negative consequences for the fishing sector and the workers who benefit from this important economic activity. “The Government of Spain supports that negotiations with Morocco begin as soon as possible to ensure the interest of our fleet in the Atlantic waters of Morocco to avoid any possible suspension of activity,” Fisheries, Food and the Environment Minister Isabel García Tejerina said during recent senate discussions on the issue. The head of the Department of Fisheries also added that Spanish authorities maintain a “constant dialogue” with the relevant industry agencies and the affected autonomous communities that work with both the European Union and Morocco to “closely monitor” the country’s fleet, in compliance with the relevant components of the international law. The minister pointed out that the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA), in which the waters of Western Sahara are not included, continues to remain in effect until July 14 following its recent validation by the EU Court of Justice in February. The Spanish official explained that in order to renew the agreement and adapt it to the provisions of the recent ruling of the EU court, a negotiation mandate will be discussed in the Fisheries Group of the Council of the European Union. Any new mandate or protocol will then be taken to the Council of Fisheries Ministers (AGRIPECHE) next week for its approval, providing a

Rabat – Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso will meet with King Mohammed VI in Brazzaville as part of the international Blue Funds Conference that will take place on April 25 in the Republic of the Congo. “I am pleased to announce the presence of the King of Morocco at the first Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Congo Basin Climate Commission and the Blue Basin Congo Fund,” said the Congolese leader. The King is expected to arrive on April 23. The summit will convene 16 African leaders who will discuss the implementation of the Blue Congo Basin Fund, a project conceived in part at the COP22 in Marrakech that provides support to the countries of the Congo Basin to create a “shift in their economies from reliance on forest-based resources to much greater use of renewable river and water-based resources,” according to the Brazzaville Foundation for Peace and Conservation.

The Congo Basin region aims to be an environmental sustainable platform for economic development which benefits the countries and the diverse peoples of the basin. A critically important component of the program is the preservation of the forests within the basin countries.Deforestation is now a priority issue for all nations in the region. The project will also fund hydroelectric projects, water treatment, and irrigation of arable lands. The founding agreement of this fund was signed by twelve countries on March 9, 2017 in Oyo in the Republic of Congo.

Rabat- Morocco will finally launch its first Islamic bonds, better known as sukuk, after Bank Al Maghrib (BAM) and the board of Higher Council of Ulemas’ top experts gave approval to five participatory banks to set up their Islamic finance subsidiaries one year ago, Bloomberg reported.  Sukuk is the Arabic name for financial certificates defined by the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI), as “securities of equal denomination representing individual ownership interests in a portfolio of eligible existing or future assets.” Hicham Talby, who heads the financial sector department at the Ministry of Finance, said the financial instruments will be operational this year and will include four different formulas: Ijara, Wakala, Musharaka, and Murabaha. “The government is conscious that we must develop and complete as soon as possible the operational, legal, and regulatory aspects of Islamic finance,” Talby said in a recent interview with Bloomberg.  As Morocco’s first sovereign debt is taking some time to be issued, Talby expects the process to be much faster for the next three planned sukuk issues,” though he declined to comment on the exact timing of the first issuance. The government originally adopted legislation allowing Islamic banking and insurance in January 2014, with local reports suggesting that there were plans to establish the first fully operating Islamic bank by the end of 2016, after the government signed an agreement with the Islamic Society of Private Sector Development. Moroccan lawmakers have argued that there was a delay in authorizing Islamic banks.   Furthermore, the country’s banking experts believe establishing Islamic banks would pave the way for a new finance industry, open doors for more investment opportunities within and outside the region, and reinvigorate Morocco’s sluggish economy.  Islamic finance is based on religious principles that avoid interest and monetary speculation. The industry has grown rapidly over the past decade – growing 10 to 12 percent annually, according to the World Bank – as it broadens its investor base across the Middle East, North Africa, and Southeast Asia.

Rabat – Al-Hilal Football Club of Saudi Arabia has decided to give up on Moroccan football player Achraf Bencharki just a few months after he signed a USD 5 million contract with the club. On Saturday, several Moroccan news outlets including Lions de l’Atlas reported that the newly elected president of Al-Hilal FC, Sami El Jaber, announced that the departure of Bencharki “is one of his priorities.” Al-Hilal fans have been allegedly accusing Bencharki of delivering “disappointing” on-field performances, especially given his transfer cost from Wydad of Casablanca. During his last game against the Saudi team Al Ahli, Bencharki missed several key passes and potential goals which angered Saudi fans. Bencharki’s performances have been making international headlines after the CAF Champions League final game. The multi-position player helped set up a fabulous goal against the Egyptian Al Ahly on November 4.
During the game, Bencharki sent an assist to Oualid El Karti, who scored the winning goal for Wydad of Casablanca at the 69-minute mark.
The talented footballer also played a key role in helping the Moroccan team win the continental title during the African Nations Championship (CHAN 2018). Bencherki’s transfer to the Saudi club made football headlines in the past month and created a heated debate between those who support his move and those who wanted him to turn down the lucrative Al-Hilal FC contract.

Rabat – Prince Moulay Rachid arrived in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia to represent King Mohammed VI at the 29th summit of the Arab League, which opens today with the participation of prominent Arab leaders. The summit offers the Arab leaders an opportunity to discuss ongoing regional security issues, including the escalation of the Syrian conflict, the Saudi-Iran conflict, turmoil in Libya and the Israel-Palestine question. The ongoing Qatar-Gulf crisis is also expected to take center stage during the summit. The crisis has presented significant challenges to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) as it attempts to deal with economic and security issues. The Saudi government is pursuing significant economic reform efforts to diversify the kingdom’s economy. The summit’s participants will also discuss issues that undermine the unity and the stability of the Arab world. Prince Moulay Rachid will deliver a speech on behalf of the Monarch and he will also hold a set of bilateral talks with several Arab leaders. Upon his arrival at the Abdelaziz Air Base, the Prince was greeted by Prince Saoud Bin Nayef Bin Abdulaziz, Emir of the Eastern Region, Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador to Morocco, Abdelaziz Ben Mouhieddine Khouja, the commander of the Air Base King Abdulaziz Sector-East, Major General Aid Ben Barrak Al Outaibi, as well as members of the Moroccan delegation to the Arab Summit and members of the Moroccan Embassy in Riyadh. The Arab Summit, which traditionally takes place in March, was postponed to April over concerns that it would interfere with the Egyptian presidential elections.

Rabat – Adam and Eve are widely believed within the monotheist communities to be the first humans who ever existed. They represent the very first couple that led to the current mankind on Earth.  This belief has come from various interpretations of biblical texts. Unfortunately, this traditional biblical story has often caused conflicts, especially in traditional societies. It has negatively affected the teaching of scientific theories regarding the origin of humanity.  It has also lowered the status of women and, as a consequence, it has created gender inequality within religion. The extent of these social problems raises the question of how to reconcile such beliefs with reason in order to mend the relationship between science and religion. An objective reading of the root text of this creation story is necessary to examine its traditional interpretation. Bereshit, the first chapter in Genesis of the Torah mentions the creation of “the” Adam (h?-’?-??m) at verse 1:27. The word Adam is written with the Hebrew definite article (h?-) in the original text where it refers to the first human creatures as being male and female. God asked these humans to live on Earth and to procreate under his blessing (1:28). Then, Adam received the so-called breath of God (2:7).  Afterwards, what is believed to be the first woman “’iš-š?h”, later named Eve, appeared from Adam’s side or rib (2:22). This reading leads to a series of questions:    2. What is the difference between the female human in verse 1:27 and Eve, the woman      from verse 2:22    3.Why is this first female human nearly absent in the traditional version? The missing details in the traditional version are largely due to the misogynistic belief that women are not equal to men. The religious texts refer to the female equally created as male by the name of Lilith and describe her as a rebel and sterile. They even demonize her because of her supposed disobedience to men. However, this version does not exist in the original text of the Torah. It is important to note that the scriptures and the definitions of religious rules have been interpreted from a male’s perspective. The absence of women in interpreting religious texts has led to some misogynistic analyses.  This story of the origin of humanity is one example among many that seemingly justifies inequality between men and women. Women as equal to men is perceived as an evil plan that should not be allowed and the version of the woman being created from Adam’s rib has been interpreted as meaning that women are subordinate to men. As a result, women’s rights to equality have been corrupted because of the three monotheist religions. These anti-feminist texts have not only stigmatized women and led to gender-based discrimination, they have also created a controversy between science and religion. This debate has divided the scientific communities into “the evolutionists” and “the creationists.”  One side advocates the belief in evolution’s theory of natural selection, while the other advocates divine creation. The theory of intelligent design emerged to combine both scenarios by considering the existence of an intelligent designer who created and continually monitors the species’ evolution.  This religion-science controversy has caused some traditional societies, such as certain Muslim countries, to remove any explanations about the origin of humanity other than creationism from their schools’ curricula. However, such attitudes are primarily justified based on inherited beliefs and are not necessarily religiously motivated, as Eve isn’t even mentioned in the Quran. Finally, original sin seems to still be an issue. Currently, taking from the tree of knowledge means stripping women of their rights due to religious reasons while rejecting any other ideas even if they have been empirically proven. Scientific theories should be taught in schools, regardless of religious and traditional beliefs. Religious texts should be fully revised and should involve women so that the interpretations are balanced by having both male and female perspectives. Humanity and faith both need science in order to thrive and to progress.

Rabat – Following recent enormous security escalations and the ensuing humanitarian crisis in the long-running Syrian civil strife, the Moroccan government has issued a statement that firmly condemns the use of chemical weapons and the resort to air strikes, reiterating the Kingdom’s diplomatic negotiations, and calling for a cease-fire between the parties involved. The ministry of foreign affairs called upon all involved parties to favor a political solution won through diplomatic means. The statement further condemns any resort to military strikes, reiterating Morocco’s commitment to a diplomatic, peaceful, and political solution. As a country that has always promoted the respect of international law and acted accordingly, the statement read, Morocco deeply deplores the humanitarian escalations as well as the targeting and killing of innocent civilian populations. “Past experiences have taught us that military options, including air strikes—no matter how justified or proportionate—only make it more difficult to find a political solution, deepen the suffering of civilian victims and heighten their anti-West sentiment,” the statement said. Moroccan government also exhorted the primary stakeholders in the military conflicts to opt for “appropriate consultations” and refrain from actions such as bombings, air strikes, and the use of chemical weapons, saying such military actions generally result in “misunderstandings and indignation.” While admitting that necessary and bold steps are needed to win the fight against extremism, intolerance, and terrorism, Morocco’s government remains convinced that the means that are being deployed do not serve their intended purpose, as they “only deepens extremist sentiments” and create fertile grounds for terrorism and its vengeful agenda. “The Kingdom of Morocco considers that the solution to the Syrian crisis can only be political, and hopes that reason will prevail with a view to finding a solution to the crisis that preserves the national unity of this country and the dignity of these populations.”

Rabat- A 28-year-old Palestinian man has died and more than 223 are wounded after Israeli soldiers responded with live gunfire to the thousands of Palestinians who staged a mass protest along Gaza’s sealed border with Israel for the third consecutive Friday, Gaza Health Ministry said. The clashes that erupted between stone-throwing Palestinians and Israeli soldiers took place in multiple spots along the border while tear gas, live bullets, and plumes of black smoke from burning tires filled the air in some areas. Most of protesters were injured east of Gaza City, while only two were hurt in clashes near Al-Bureij in central Gaza. The death toll brings the number of protesters killed to 36, with more than 1,500 wounded by Israeli fire since March 30, which marked the launch of the 6-week-long demonstration demanding the right of return for Palestinian refugees.  Israel’s violent attacks in Gaza have led once again to an emergency UN Security Council meeting on Friday, just hours after the violent clashes.  The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the emergency meeting of the UN Security Council that “the recent violence in Gaza has resulted in many needless deaths and injuries,” reiterating his call for an “independent and transparent investigation” into the recent violence in Gaza.  “This tragedy underscores the urgency of relaunching the peace process for a two-state solution that allows Palestinians and Israelis to live in two democratic states side by side, in peace and security, within borders recognized by all,” the UN chief said, appealing to those who believe more action that could lead to more casualties.  Other UN members have also expressed their concerns about the current situation in Gaza, noting that the risk of escalation is very real.

Rabat- The US, UK, and France launched coordinated airstrikes hitting targets at three sites in Syria in the early hours of Saturday morning, in response to Bashar Al-Assad’s alleged chemical weapons attack on civilians in the Damascus enclave of Douma over a week ago.  “A short time ago, I ordered the United States armed forces to launch precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapon capabilities of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad,” Trump said at the White House.  “A combined operation with the armed forces of France and the United Kingdom is now under way. We thank them both. This massacre was a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use by that very terrible regime,” he added.  As Trump was making his White House address, large explosions were heard in the capital Damascus, with footages showing missiles streaking over the night sky in Syria. A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 14 avril 2018  US Defense Secretary James Mattis said, “Right now this is a one-time shot and I believe that it sent a very strong message” to the Syrian regime, adding that the strikes would continue until the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons ends. In his speech, Trump warned Russia and Iran not to stand by their ally in Damascus.  “Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path or if it will join with civilized nations as a force for stability and peace,” Trump argued.  Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the US strikes had hit the Syrian capital when the country “finally” had a chance at peace.  Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi condemned the strikes, saying that “the attack is the blatant violation of international laws, as well as ignoring the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria,” according to Iran’s state news agency.  The military strikes occurred after US President Trump warned Syria’s Bashar al-Assad that there will be “a big price to pay,” over chemical attack on a rebel-held town in eastern Ghouta which has killed dozens of people earlier this week.

By Zoubida Senoussi Rabat – Hervé Renard appears in the latest edition of Hola! Maroc as you rarely seen him. In contrast to his typical reticence when it comes to his private life, the French coach has opened up to the magazine to discuss his values, coaching, and love for the African continent. Renard is featured on the cover of the Moroccan magazine with the woman who shares his life, Vivan Dièye (the widow of Bruno Metsu, former coach of Senegal’s national team).  “In Africa I feel free. This continent brings me exceptional recognition, I don’t think I can live anywhere else,” he said to Hola! The one to whom the Moroccan people owe their qualification to the 2018 World Cup received the people’s magazine in his residence in Senegal. During this interview, Renard discussed his debut as a player and as a coach, shared his life values, and expressed his expectations for the Moroccan team. “From an early age, football has punctuated my life. Much later for eight years, parallel to the end of my career as a player and the beginning of that as a coach, I served as the head of company. It’s an experience that taught me a lot,” he said. “My education taught me that you can’t get anything without work. My mom always told me this life lesson. The value of men, respect, and trust are the most important adjectives to me. It does not matter where you came from or where you grew up. Help others, without interest, without expecting anything in return.” Despite rumors that he’s leaving the Moroccan team, Renard links his future in Morocco to the results that the national team will achieve in Russia next June. He believes that the Lions’ team “needs to improve its ball possession, as well as its ball recuperation techniques in order to compete with other teams” at this summer’s World Cup in Russia.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – Morocco’s golfers are getting their clubs in order ahead of two international golf tournaments for Golf Week 2018. Rabat’s Royal Golf Dar Es-Salam will host the 24th Lalla Meryem Golf Cup and the 45th Hassan II Trophy, bringing together top golfers from around the world from April 16-22, 2018.  Organized by the Hassan II Trophy Golf Association, the tournaments welcome over 250 international athletes, both male and female, to the Rabat’s elite golf course.  The event’s trailer, released online earlier this month, offers aerial views of the golf course itself and promises top-notch talent, sportsmanship, and competition. One hundred forty-four professional golfers will compete for the coveted gold dagger in the men’s tournament, while 126 professional golfers will compete for a “minaudiere” during for the women’s event.   Since 2010, both golf tournaments have been integrated into the PGA European Tour and the Ladies European Tour. According to the press release, the two events will be broadcast live on five continents and, based off figures from Golf Week 2017, the events hope to reach over 450 million viewers.  Morocco is the only country on either of the women and men’s European circuits to welcome both men and women to golfing tournaments in the same city, at the same interval, and at the same golf course. Rabat will welcome international golfers such as Agathe Sauzon, Meghan Maclaren, Amandeep Drall, Danny Willet, Thomas Pieters, Victor Dubuisson, and Andy Sullivan. Morocco’s 22-year-old rising star, Yassine Touhami, will be contending for the Hassan II Trophy after qualifying earlier this month at the Atlas Pro Tour in Mohammedia.  Morocco’s own history with golf goes back more than 100 years. The country’s first golf course, the Tangérois, was established in 1914. It still exists today under the name of the Royal Country Club of Tangier. The Hassan II Trophy was first created in 1971, and has welcomed contestants from across Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. The Lalla Meryem Cup was founded in 1993. Both events were hosted in Rabat until 2011, when they moved to Agadir. The tournaments were reinstated in Rabat in 2016. In recent years, Morocco has been establishing itself as an international golfing destination. At the 2017 World Golf Awards held in Cartagena, Spain, Morocco was named the best place to golf in Africa. “Golf is part of the development initiated by sports in Morocco,” said Prince Moulay Rachid, the Chairman of both the Hassan II Golf Trophy Association and the Royal Moroccan Golf Federation.  “Morocco aims to equip itself with high-performance and attractive infrastructures, so from Tangier to Dakhla and from Rabat to Saïdia, dozens of golf courses have emerged, both giving rise to vocations for young people and also in attracting consequential numbers of tourists eager to discover the Moroccan courses.” The final awards ceremonies for both the Hassan II Trophy and the Lalla Meryem Cup will be held on Sunday, April 22. .

Rabat – Criticizing the Polisario Front and Algeria, the general director of the Observatory of Geopolitical Studies (OEG) of Paris, Charles Saint-Prot, said that the separatist group has been always a “ghostly” movement dependent on Algeria. In an interview given to French radio Kernews, Saint-Prot emphasized that Algeria is “obsessed” with undermining Morocco’s territorial integrity. “We will not solve this problem if we ignore this truth,” said Saint-Prot. The French expert described Polisario’s maneuvers east of Morocco’s defense wall as provocative, recalling Algeria’s contributions to the separatist actions. He added that the Algerian regime has also spread propaganda about Polisario, using vast amounts of funding. The French expert also characterized separatist fiction backed by Algeria as “deflated,” resulting in the escape of a large number of people from the Tindouf camps. Hundreds of Sahrawis reportedly fled the Tindouf camps in Algeria last week, escaping alleged murder threats from Polisario supporters in the region. The threats come in response to Sahrawi condemnation of the recent Polisario Front escalations east Morocco’s defense wall. The OEG director added that the conflict is threatening the stability of the region and that of Europe. Saint-Prot emphasized that the Moroccan Autonomy Plan is the right solution to end the 40-year conflict. The statements by the French expert follow remarks made by Algeria’s Foreign Affairs Minister Abdelkader Messahel, who claims that his country should not shoulder any responsibility in the conflict. Messahel said that the Western Sahara question is an issue between Morocco and Polisario, noting that Algeria should not cooperate in finding a solution. Regional tensions have escalated in recent months due to Polisario’s repeated provocative military movements east of Morocco’s defense wall.  In response to the illegal Polisario actions, Morocco has requested immediate intervention from United Nations and Security Council. Morocco has also warned that it would repel any further escalations in the region.

Rabat – Algeria and the Polisario Front were publicly “embarrassed” after the plane crash that claimed the lives of more than 200 people, including 26 members of the separatist group on Wednesday, according to Algerian news source TSA. TSA criticized the Secretary-General of Algeria’s National Liberation Front, Djamel Ould Abbes, noting that the official “has revealed information that should have been kept secret for several reasons.” The website added that this information is an embarrassment to Algeria and the Polisario Front. The Algerian news website added that the SG of the party made “too many mistakes,” announcing on a national television channel that 26 members of the Polisario were among the victims of the crash in Boufarik, while Algeria continues to deny any direct involvement in the conflict around Western Sahara. Ould Abbes was the first to reveal this additional information, as the balance sheet of the national army only mentioned the deaths of 257 people, without other details. The SG statement pushed the state to publish a communiqué confirming the presence of 26 separatists in the military flight.  “Did the FLN SG measure the consequences of his mistake?” asked the news source. “His only concern has always been to prove to public opinion and his opponents that he is well-placed in power, in other words, to appropriate the status of the president’s man?” The crash occurred on April 11. shortly after the plane took off from Boufarik military airport near Algeria’s capital Algiers. The list of the victims of the crash includes army staff and their families, in addition to many members of the Polisario Front. Morocco World News has obtained a list of the members of the Polisario Front who were among the passengers of the military plane. According to international media, the plane was en route to the Tindouf camps, before its ultimate destination of Bechar. The incident followed statements from Algeria’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Abdelkader Messahel, who said that the Western Sahara conflict is a question should be solved between Morocco and Polisario, without Algerian input. Messahel also reiterated his country’s full support for Polisario’s members. However, Messahel said that Algeria should not cooperate in finding a solution to the decades-long conflict.

Rabat – The French Agency for the Promotion of Higher Education, Hospitality, and International Mobility, “Campus France,” is ranking Moroccans as the largest foreign student body in France during the 2017 academic year. The number of Moroccan students in France stood at 38,002, or 43.9 percent of foreign students in 2016-2017. This reflects an increase of 17 percent compared the 2011-2016 period. After the Moroccan student community, which contains the most foreign students in France, the Chinese student population constitutes 28,760 individuals, while Algerians stand at 26,116. Tunisians are third with 12,390 students. Moroccans also rank 6th among foreign PhD students in France (991) in 2016-2017. France is ranked 4th among host countries of international students behind the US, the UK, and Australia and ahead of Germany. Forty-five percent of foreign students in France come from Africa, 19 percent from Europe, 16 percent from Asia-Oceania, 9 percent from America and 4 percent from the Middle East, according to Campus France.

Rabat – A report by Family Optimise, a British NGO that studies daily life and its patterns, has recently released a study that indicates an increasing of women in Morocco are choosing to remain single until later in life, with over 60 percent of women at a marriageable age said to be single and more career-oriented. The British NGO indicates that the figures capture a slow but assured change in some formerly entrenched social practices, especially with regards to traditional notions of the “rightful place of women in society.” The number of single women has increased by 4.6 percent, says Family Optimise, adding that a whopping 60 percent of Moroccan women–approximately 8 million women–are single or ‘unmarried.’ By and large, the study’s results suggest that Moroccan women are increasingly inclined to marry in their late twenties or early thirties, with many of them valuing their personal careers, and saying that a late marriage is usually a springboard to a successful and “fulfilled personal and family life,” particularly when it comes to raising children with an education that can guarantee them success later in life. Commenting on the trend, Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath Al Magrhibia reports that the results place Morocco in the category of countries in the Arab world where there are discernible steps to challenge societal notions and taboos regarding gender and society. The newspaper documents that with 60 percent in Morocco, only Lebanon and Iraq (85%) and Tunisia (81%) outperform the Kingdom in the now-growing trend of single women. Lagging behind are Saudi Arabia (36%) and Qatar (41%). Perhaps even more surprisingly, Al Ahdath Al Magrhibia further reports that as things now stand in Morocco, marriage is 27 for men and 28 for women, indicating the fading or waning weight or families and tradition on decisions concerning private and intimate choices, explains the newspaper. Estimates also reveal that interfamilial marriages have drastically decreased, dropping from 33 percent to 21 percent. The trend is confirmed by the latest statistics from the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) which found that the country has been experiencing a considerable decrease in the number and practice of early marriages. According to HCP, Morocco’s average marriage age is now 26, up from 20. The same source also indicated that this new trend has been a driving force in decreasing Morocco’s fertility or reproduction rate. “Mentalities are changing” the report concluded, explaining that as result of advanced education, Moroccan women are growing to be more assertive and expressive: they want to be present as integral part in the public debate and shape society, not just as mothers or daughters, but rather as financially autonomous and politically independent individuals.

Rabat – The Moroccan League for Citizenship and Human Rights (LMCDH), an NGO advocating for human rights, has recently slammed the precarious state of public health in Morocco, denouncing the lack of health personnel, obsolete equipment, and rampant corruption in many public hospitals. Moroccan newspaper Assabah reported earlier today that the LMCDH made its concerns known in a “very long news release” that was reportedly addressed to relevant authorities. The human rights NGO fiercely criticized the “sorry and very degrading state” of medical treatments in Moroccan public hospitals. It also reported that the sector is witnessing the resurgence of contagious diseases like tuberculosis, which were long believed to have been eradicated from Morocco’s “medical landscape,” causing “a serious cause for alarm for the country’s health sector.” The document also raised the stakes for collective action from concerned stakeholders, pointing out that other than the dispiriting resurgence of tuberculosis, there also is a rampant increase in cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, kidney failure, mental diseases, and cancer. And according to the document, this worrying state is primarily fueled by “a gradual retreat of the health ministry when it comes to promoting prevention, protection, and health education programs.” The newspaper added that LMCDH’s concerns were already raised by the Court of Auditors, which recently published an annual report that also decries “continuous malfunction in the majority of hospitals and health centers” across the country. Following up on the Court of Audit’s report, the NGO pointed the extreme scarcity and obsolescence of health materials, the shortage of health personnel, and the mismanagement of existing materials, adding that in many instances, the already-bad situation worsens when many qualified doctors forsake their posts at public hospitals to spend the bulk of their working hours at their own clinics. If such practices are not mended, the sector will “unfortunately remain in a situation where a simple appointment for a doctor’s consultation can take up to 10 months,” the document concluded, calling upon relevant authorities and health practitioners to “converge efforts” so as to tackle the persisting precariousness of the country’s public health sector.

Rabat – The South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) has officially announced its support to the three-nations North American host bid for the 23rd annual 2026 World Cup. The 42 voices of the Confederation of North, Central American, and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) has still not officially announced their final decision. Morocco’s campaign to collect the support of global football federations for its bid to host the football world’s biggest event has been fruitful thus far. Two months before the FIFA vote, Morocco has already collected 103 votes of support out of the total 207 global federations that will vote in June. African football federations have offered unanimous support for Morocco’s bid, in addition to several Asian, European, and Middle Eastern countries, including Russia, Luxembourg, France, Serbia, Belgium, Qatar, Palestine, and Saint Lucia. The 2026 Bid Evaluation Task Force will officially visit Morocco from April 16-19, to evaluate “technical aspects” included in the bid book.

Rabat – Following the publication of Amnesty International annual report, “The State of the World’s Human Rights 2017/2018,” Amnesty International Morocco accused the El Othmani government of instrumentalizing religion to violate scores of human rights. In a report published on April 13, Assabah said that the executive director of Amnesty International Morocco, expressed the human rights organization’s concerns over the Moroccan government’s use of religion for its own political ends. The newspaper reports that the executive director the NGO’s Morocco branch, Salah Abdellaoui, made his remarks during a conference on Thursday, April 12. Speaking about the “rampant” human rights abuses, Mr. Abdellaoui reportedly criticized the government for its inflexibility on some articles in the civil and criminal codes. Singling out the state of death penalty in Morocco, Salah Abdellaoui allegedly said that the government refuses to take bold steps to abolish capital punishment because of its desire to maintain its in power, especially as Moroccan officials reportedly fear that such “revolutionary moves” would unsettle some conservative circles, undermining their authority. According to Mr. Abdellaoui, while it harbors the ideological and emotional needs of a minority of the population, maintaining the death penalty frustrates the aspirations of the majority of Moroccans. He also explained that the government’s resolve to keep some people “retarded in the criminal code” so as to “toy with Moroccans’ emotions and lure them in believing that keeping the law on death penalty is the surest way to prevent high criminality rates.” In its 2017 report on the death penalty, Amnesty International pointed out that despite the existence of some positive signs mainly motivated by “recent judicial reforms,” Morocco and North Africa in general are still faced with the reality of “disturbing trends” that do not favor for human rights. The report documented that, although Morocco has witnessed no execution in recent years, death sentences are still being issued. In addition, of the 90 people who were sentenced to death by 2017, over 15 death sentences were issued just last year alone. In its general 2017 annual report, the group mentioned the repression of political dissent and the bleak prospects of freedom of expression, saying that the prevalence of “Islamic tenets” in the country’s laws and legal system prevents officials from a bold commitment to allowing more fertile grounds for the advancement of human rights. This is not the first time that such claims are directed at the Justice and Development Party-led government. Since rising to the realm of the executive in 2011, the party has constantly been criticized for its Islamic leanings and a vision of society which opponents claim constitutes a major impediment to the consolidation of a secular way of life in Morocco.

Rabat – In their race to Kiev, four of the world’s best clubs will have to showcase their best skills and strategies and work harder than ever in order to secure an access card to the final match. The royal club, Real Madrid, headed by the former football star Zineddine Zidane will face German club Bayern Munich in the Champions League semi-final.  Following Real’s triumph over Juventus 3-0 in the first quarterfinal match, Madrid eked out just enough points to secure a quarter-final pass, losing to the Italian club 1-3 in the second quarterfinal. Real Madrid and Bayern have met for 24 time in the European cup, with each club winning 11 times. During the 2016-2017 season, the royal team kicked out the Germans in the semifinals by securing major wins with total accumulated goals at6 to 3. Prior to that in 2013-2014,  Real crushed Bayern 5-0. Could it finally be time for the Germans’ revenge?  On the other hand, As Roma, who faced FC Barcelona during the quarter-final, has shown great performances thus far, as they have managed to perform a ROMA-NTADA—3-1, against the unbeatable Spanish club, after suffering a prior 4-1 defeat.  It seemed like an impossible situation for a comeback, but in football everything is possible…especially when the Argentinian star Messi can barely be seen on the field. Historically, Liverpool has beaten the As Roma club 3 times, lost once, and tied once. The last time the two teams met on the field was in March 2002. With so much at stake, it is difficult to determine who will have the skill, speed, and luck to move on to the final round; the two teams are well-matched. The NSK Olimpiyskyi stadium will host the biggest European event on May 26 in Kiev, Ukraine.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – Colin Dye, senior leader of Kensington Temple in London, calls for more religious freedom in Morocco after being allegedly denied entry to the country.  Dye reportedly arrived at the Fes-Sais Airport on April 6, but was stopped and interrogated overnight regarding his previous informal meetings with Moroccan Christians, reported the evangelical periodical Christianity Today.  Despite the intervention of three Moroccan human rights lawyers, Dye was allegedly put on a plane to Rome the following day, and was informed that he was barred from entering the country.  “Morocco officially has freedom of religion, but in practice it is a conservative Muslim country. Although spontaneous conversion from Islam to Christianity is not illegal, the criminal code prohibits attempts by non-Muslims to ‘shake the faith’ of citizens from Sunni Islam,” read the article.  Dye, who has been assisting church leaders in Morocco, said that he was only in the country to meet evangelical house church leaders in Morocco for prayer and encouragement without facing any obstacles for the last three months.  “I am asking for Morocco to put its own constitution into practice and allow freedom of religion,” protested Dye.  Chapter 220 of the Moroccan criminal code effectively punishes whoever tries to shake a Muslim’s Islamic faith or convince them of converting to another religion. However, the article only officially refers to punishment for those who evangelize the poor and children. According to the 2016 International Freedom Report, an estimate of 99 percent of the Moroccan population are Sunni Muslim, while other religious minorities, including Shia Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Bahais, constitute less than 1 percent.  The number of Moroccan Jews is estimated at 3,000 to 4,000, of which 2,500 reside in Casablanca, while the Rabat and Marrakech Jewish communities each officially account for only 75 people.

By Zoubida Senoussi Rabat – The Embassy of Japan announced its new project, “Protection and Assistance to Urban Refugees in Morocco,” at a reception on Friday in Rabat. With the help of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the Moroccan family Planning Association, this new project aims to help refugees in their integration into Moroccan society by providing access to healthcare and to job services. Moroccan society is keen to create new jobs. The Japanese Ambassador to Morocco, Takuji Hanatani, believes that refugees can make a positive contribution to the job market by creating small enterprises that employ Moroccans. “There are two reasons why Japan is supporting this very important project: to build a multicultural society and to strengthen security for refugees,” said Takuji Hanatani to Morocco World News, adding that Japan has “contributed to Morocco’s evolution for over 50 years.” Takuji Hanatani also told MWN that the Japanese government donated US 220,000 to finance the “Protection and Assistance to Urban Refugees in Morocco.” “The human dimension is very important for the sustainable development of Morocco,” he concluded. During this gathering, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees advisor, Jean-Paul Cavalieri has taken to the stage to talk about the needs and the expectations of refugees. “Healthcare is the first thing that refugees need in Morocco.They come to us in aim of a social security,” he said, pointing out that this is the first priority of the new project. Cavalieri expressed his gratitude towards the Japan government “for the unconditional support through this program that will hopefully answer refugees’ expectations and help them to rebuild themselves in our very own Morocco.” The real challenge is to guarantee the right of integration, according to Ftouhi Abdelkader, President of the Moroccan Family Planning Association, who expressed his concerns regarding a “discriminatory society.” “We need to make sure that refugees feel safe in Morocco. To do so, we need to provide psychological coaching, medical caravans, workshops and awareness days,” he said. As he presented the program, Ftouhi emphasized the need to help urban refugees in their socio-economic journey and in their professional training as an important axis for prosperity. Japan’s government continues to support Morocco by funding social and cultural projects that strive to strengthen relations between the two countries. In 2017, the Japanese government donated MAD 2.2 million to three Moroccan associations involved in several fields, including women’s economic empowerment, sustainable agriculture, and education.

Rabat- Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter is not yet done with his crusade against football’s governing body. After expressing his discontent at the “important authority” that FIFA has handed its special Task Force for the 2026 World Cup, the former Swiss official is now questioning the objectivity and neutrality of the entire FIFA apparatus for the 2026 bidding procedures. After first publicly expressing his endorsement of Morocco’s bid on Twitter on February 22, the Swissman joined, along with a plethora of African and other national federations, the voices of dissent questioning FIFA’s neutrality in the 2026 procedures, accusing the body’s president and his inner circles of favoring the North American bid. Upon expressing his dismay and frustration at the Task Force earlier this month, Blatter tweeted that Africa, through Morocco, deserves a second World Cup after South Africa in 2010. And in an interview this week with Reuters, the former FFA chief reiterated his position, saying that he is “shocked” that FIFA executive committee is turning a blind eye on a binding decision that was passed under his tenure. Blatter thinks that it is unfair, incomprehensible, and “shocking” to allow a five-man team to disqualify a fitting bidder and leave it with no chance of defending its chances and merits before the FIFA Congress. “There is a movement that will take away from the congress the possibility to decide on the candidates by imposing a kind of special committee called task force… that could even decide who will be a candidate or not. That is impossible,” Blatter said. In defense of the principle that the best bid should be the sole responsibility of the FIFA Congress (which is made up of all national federations), Blatter opined: “You cannot deny one of the candidates [the right] to go to Congress. That is a principle and I stick to this principle.” Blatter’s comments to Reuters have been interpreted by a number of observers and analysts as a tacit reiteration of his support for Morocco 2026 bid, his belief that the North African country, though not ideal, has the potential and expertise to host the footballing world’s most popular and celebrated competition. For Blatter, rather than be subjected to the “technical inspection” or the appraisal of a biased and uncalled-for special committee, Morocco’s bid should be given the right to defend its merits before the FIFA Congress, as stipulated in FIFA’s current regulations. The former FIFA official’s comments come at a time when the dissent and frustration at FIFA president Infantino’s possible pro-United 2026 bias is gathering momentum. When Morocco complained about the lack of transparency and timely communication towards its bid, FIFA answered that the decision to appoint the task force was motivated by the governing body’s concerns over “elephant stadiums,” suggesting a veiled disparagement of the North African bid which still requires substantial construction works. The Task Force is expected to visit Morocco, April 16 – 19. The special committee will assess the “technical merits” of four cities (Agadir, Casablanca, Marrakech, and Tangier) that are expected to host World Cup games should Morocco 2026 win the bid.

He added that Morocco is one of the region’s most important phosphate producers, with investments that will peak at USD 20 billion by 2025, through Morocco’s phosphate company, the OCP Group, which has launched twinning programs with Indian companies, highlighting the various investment opportunities in the Moroccan market that can serve as a business base for India. For his part, Singh Tumar noted that India, in addition to its great assets in the fields of mining and energy, also allocates considerable funds to develop clean energy, another field that has benefited from India’s strong knowledge base. In this regard, he called for promoting relations between Morocco and India, expressing the Indian government’s willingness to share its expertise with the Kingdom through a bilateral cooperation commensurate with the existing partnership between the two countries.

Rabat – Cannes Film Festival has picked Meryem Benm’Barek first feature film “Sofia” to feature in the lineup “Un certain regard,” announced Thierry Frémaux, general delegate of the festival, on Wednesday, April 12. “Sofia” is the first Moroccan film to be chosen by the famous festival since Nabil Ayouch’s “Much Loved” in 2015. “Sofia” is the first feature film by Franco-Moroccan filmmaker Meryem Benm’Barek, whose short film “Jennah” (her thesis project at INSAS in Brussels) won the 2014 Grand Prize at the Rhode Island Festival. The cast includes Sara Elmhamdi Elalaoui (“Much Loved”), Sarah Perles (“Burnout” by Nour-Eddine Lakmari), Hamza Khafif, the Belgian Lubna Azabal (“Exiles,” “Paradise Now”), Faouzi Bensaidi (“The Blissful”), Nadia Niazi, and Saïd Bey. Written by Benm’Barek, the script tells the story of a single mother who is desperately searching for the father of her unborn child to avoid being reported to the authorities by the hospital. In an interview with Cineuropa, the director explained that the idea of ??Sofia came to her “because she missed something in the representation of women in the Arab world.” “Very often in films, Arab heroines are under the influence of male domination, presented as a victim of patriarchy, this interpretation, although fair at certain levels, seems to me insufficient, but I think we should take into account the social and economic context,” she said. The 71st edition of the Cannes film festival will take place from May 8-19, featuring big names and its reputed global outlook. According to the international press, this year’s lineup has a notable absence of female directors.

Rabat – Morocco’s government spokesman, Mustapha El Khalfi, has reiterated Algeria’s responsibility in the Western Sahara conflict, emphasizing that this responsibility is supported by historical facts, data, and positions that date back more than forty years. After Thursday’s cabinet meeting, El Khalfi told the press that Algeria is responsible for several issues, including the founding of the separatist front, and the continued representation the Polisario at the African Union. El Khalfi also condemned Algeria’s provision of arms, financing, and accommodation to the separatists, deploring Algeria’s hostilities to undermine Morocco’s territorial and national integrity at the international level. According to El Khalfi, Algeria’s position is contradictory to its claims of defending the right to self-determination and exposes an intention to undermine the territorial integrity of the country, adding that the Moroccan people, under the leadership of King Mohammed VI, have been firmly facing this hostility. El Khalfi also referred to Algeria’s position in opposition to former UN Personal Envoy Peter Van Walsum, who characterized the Western Sahara independence as unrealistic, emphasizing that an “independent Western Sahara is not an attainable goal.” His statement angered Polisario and its main supporters, including South Africa and Algeria. In 2008, Van Walsum also expressed his support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, noting that it is the right way to end the conflict. On April 4, King Mohammed VI addressed a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, calling on Algeria to fully shoulder its responsibility in the search for a solution to the regional conflict. “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario,” said the King in his letter, which was personally delivered to the UNSG by Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita in New York. Algeria, however, has been denying and ignoring its responsibility, claiming that it should not cooperate in finding a solution for the regional conflict. During an interview given to French TV channel France 24, Algeria’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel said that Morocco “claims” that the Western Sahara conflict is “a matter between Algeria and Morocco, whereas it is not the case. It is a case between Morocco and the Sahrawi people, and between Morocco and the decisions of the United Nations.” “Negotiations” on this situation have always been between “the Polisario representatives and Morocco, it will not change,” he claimed. Over the past months, Polisario’s escalation in the east Morocco’s defense wall has intensified tensions in the region, with Morocco calling on the UN and the Security Council to pressure the separatist group to withdraw from the region. Morocco has also warned that its army militias  will not hesitate to repel any further escalation from the Algeria-backed Polisario Front. Earlier this week, an Algerian military plane crashed while it was on its way to the Tindouf camps, laying bare Algeria’s deep involvement in the Western Sahara dispute. Among the 257 people who were killed in the crash, 26 people were Polisario members.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI will serve as the special guest for the international Blue Funds conference that will take place on April 25, in Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo. The conference is expected to convene leaders from the Congo Basin (Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, DR Congo, Republic of Congo, Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia) and other regions on the continent, as well as international partners. They will discuss the political, social, and economic challenges threatening biodiversity and sustainable development in the Congo Basin. This year marks the first international iteration of the regional conference which has received significant international support from Morocco since its inception Mr. Gakosso said in late March that the King’s invitation to the conference aimed to acknowledge and honor Morocco’s tireless  commitment—through the King’s personal efforts—to support sustainable development and socio-economic prosperity in the Congo Basin. The Congolese ambassador also met with Moroccan foreign affairs minister, Nasser Bourita, to discuss the “sincere friendship, fraternity, and solidarity” that characterize the bilateral ties between the two countries. The ambassador said on the occasion that “Morocco has been playing a central role in terms of giving more international resonance this [Blue Funds] project.” As King Mohammed VI is also expected to attend the Arab League Summit in Saudi Arabia on April 15, the Brazzaville Conference will be the monarch’s second international convention since his surgery in late February in Paris. Some reports state that the Blue Funds summit serves as an initial indicator of the King’s personal determination to promote Morocco’s Africa-centered diplomacy, as the monarch is reportedly planning a series of visits to other sub-Saharan countries.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat- Moroccan Engineer Meyssane Alj Hakim was named leader by US Manufacturing Institute during its 2018 STEP Ahead Awards ceremony, which took place April 9 – 11 in Washington D.C. The ceremony, which hosted a number of prominent personalities, including members of Congress, celebrated women’s accomplishments in the manufacturing industry with formal gala on Wednesday, April 11, at the National Building Museum in Washington D.C. The Science, Technology, Engineering and Production (STEP) Ahead initiative emphasizes women’s accomplishments and the significant roles they play in the success of the manufacturing industry. Since its inception, the STEP Ahead Awards “have impacted more than 300,000 individuals, from peers in the industry to school-age children…we have honoured 672 women who are making a difference in their companies and communities,” STEP Ahead organizers stated on the Manufacturing Institute’s website. Alj Hakim who is currently an Engineer at Intel Corporation, is among the 130 women participants this year, thirty of whom are emerging leaders in the manufacturing industry. She was chosen for her exceptional leadership skills to become a leader of the Manufacturing Institute’s STEP Ahead, the first woman in the Arab world to hold the title. The leading engineer has played a key role in the promotion of the American advanced technology economic sector in Silicon Valley. Alj Hakim graduated with a master’s degree in engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 2015, and her expertise include leadership, finance, optimization analytics, data analysis, and the economics of production.  Since 2016, Alj Hakim has worked as a supply chain analyst at US-based multinational technology company Intel Corporation. Her position dictates the development of mathematical models for the testing of operational strategies, coordination of supply readiness efforts for end-of-life products, and management of cross-functional special programs.

She was also a student researcher at New York City Polytechnic School of Engineering in 2013, where she worked on an accident notification system for motorcyclists dedicated to finding solutions to reduce deaths by motorcycle accidents.  Alj Hakim’s STEP Ahead award serves as an inspiration to all young women who wish to pursue their education and careers in manufacturing or any other field. The Executive Director of the Manufacturing Institute, Carolyn Lee, told MAP in a statement, “The women we honor [in the STEP Ahead Awards] bear the potential to inspire the next generations of manufacturers…I believe that the more women and girls hear about the stories of what modern manufacturing really is and about what’s possible, the more they will dare to dream about what they can achieve in the manufacturing sector.”  Headquartered in Washington D.C., the Manufacturing Institute is a platform for world-class manufacturing talent that aims to close the skills gap and improve the manufacturing workforce by offering education and training to individuals in the field. The STEP Ahead Awards launched in 2012, at the initiative of the Manufacturing Institute and the US National Association of Manufacturers.

Rabat- English musician and former Led Zeppelin lead singer Robert Plant shared photo souvenirs of his Moroccan adventures on his official Facebook page. English musician, songwriter, former lead singer of the rock band Led Zeppelin, took to Facebook to share three photos of Moroccan products: a berber carpet, Jaouda milk, and a poster of Berber-amazigh musical group “Oudaden.” “Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness,” Plant captioned the images, quoting American writer Mark Twain. 
Morocco’s diverse, colorful culture continues to spellbind travelers from all walks of life and areas of the world. In recent months, American TV host Ryan Seacrest and his girlfriend model Shayna Taylor enjoyed their trip to Morocco’s mystical Sahara Desert dunes, and the mother of  football star Cristiano Ronaldo, Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, raved about Moroccan couscous during her mini-vacation in the red city of Marrakech. Hollywood also remains enamored with the kingdom’s charm, as illustrated by directors’ penchant for filming in the region: Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Gladiator (2000), The Sheltering Sky (1990), Game of Thrones (2013), Prison Break (2015), Sherlock (2016), and The Nine (2017).

Rabat- A new early warning satellite system reveals dangerous reservoir shrinkages in India, Iraq, Spain, and Morocco, where water in one of its most important dams reached alarming levels. Despite the recent rainfalls, which increased the storage dam capacity up to 58.8 percent, the World Resources Institute (WRI) declared that Morocco might still face a water shortage in the coming summer months and beyond. The alarming report is mostly based on the water shrinkage at Al Massira Reservoir, on the Oum Er-rbia River in Settat Province, which has shrunk by 63 percent between 2015-2017, thus reaching its lowest level since the drought of 2005-2008, which affected more than 700,000 people and decreased grain production by 50 percent.  Al Massira, second largest dam in Morocco after Al Wahda, supplies water to the agricultural sector, which absorbs 33 percent of the labor force, in the Doukkala area, Casablanca-Settat region, and other cities. “While the reservoir’s levels keep decreasing, demand for its water keeps increasing,” stated the report. The report predicts that water levels at Al Massira would further deteriorate by the large water transfer project to Marrakech, which is expected to be fully operational in 2018.   Climate change is also expected to further diminish water supply, resulting in water stress and competition over scarce resources. According to the World Bank, urban water demand is expected to increase by 60 to 100 percent in most of Morocco’s large cities b 2050.  Earlier last month, Morocco’s Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, declared that the government is in the process of crafting a national water plan through 2050, in order to solve water shortage problems in several regions.

Rabat – Following information there were Polisario members among the people killed in the recent Algerian military plane crash, some Algerian outlets are furious at Ould Abbes Secretary of the ruling National Liberation Front, known as FLN, who first revealed the information in a TV interview. Abbes’s revelation sparked the wrath of many in Algeria, with some critics even accusing him of “divulging state secrets” and showing to the international community that Algeria is indeed backing and hosting the Polisario front, contrary to the regime’s official narrative. Whereas Algiers stresses that the Western Sahara question should resolved without its involvement, explaining that the search for a common ground or political solution only concerns Morocco and the Polisario Front, this incident points to Algiers’ deep involvement in the regional dispute. In such a context or denials and opaque diplomatic moves, FLN Secretary’s interview was a blow to Algeria’s position. And that is why Algerian news outlets, have been writing scathing articles about his “irresponsible and reckless attitude” Reporting on FLN Secretary’s interview and the information that the death toll included Polisario members, Algerian news outlet TSS wrote that in light of Algeria’s official narrative about its position in the escalating tension in Western Sahara, the Secretary’s move is an “intolerable mistake” and a “failed public appearance” that amounts to treason. The outlet, like many in Algeria, berates FLN Secretary for “revealing states secrets and embarrassing Algeria and the Polisario Front” before the international community. Earlier this month, King Mohammed VI sent a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres saying that Algeria is militarily and logistically backing the Polisario Front, and that there can be no mutually beneficial political settlement if Algiers does not put an end to its double dealings in the Sahara issue. The King’s letter said that Algeria “hosts, arms, and brings diplomatic support” to the separatist front. This was, however, vehemently denied by Algerian diplomacy, with the Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel firmly claiming that his country is not involved in the Sahara question. Mr. Messahel said that Algeria should not be expected to have a part to play in discussions over settlement. “Algeria is a longtime backer of Polisario,” the New York Times reported yesterday, adding that “a military official in Algiers said that the Polisario members killed in the crash had probably been receiving medical treatment at government hospitals.”

Speaking at the weekly meeting of the Governmental Council on Thursday, April 12, the government chief affirmed that his cabinet’s departments are working their hardest to curb unemployment, adding that winning this challenge is dependent upon the mobilization and cooperation of all.  “We give great importance to employment, of both men and women, through the quality of training, while taking into account future occupations and technological developments,” El Othmani said.  “We have identified several priorities under the Executive Program 2018-2019, which requires further action in future financial laws, and this is what we will consider to make governmental sectors focus on more,” he added.

Rabat – Decathlon Solar, the biannual international green buildings contest, will host its first African competition in Morocco in 2019, according to a joint press release by Mohamed VI Polytechnic University (M6PU) and the Institute of Research for Solar and New Energies (IRESEN), the organizers of the contest’s Africa edition. In their announcement, Mohamed VI Polytechnic University and the Institute of Research in Solar and New Energies (IRESEN) said that twenty teams had been selected to participate in Solar Decathlon Africa. With its aim to raise awareness about environment-related topics, Decathlon Solar Africa seeks to promote and develop the “green buildings” model. Following an open call for applications, the contest organizers announced that 20 teams from 40 different universities have been selected to compete in Ben Guerir in September 2019. According to the organizers, the event’s primary objective is to encourage participants to develop and build environment-friendly and sustainable buildings with high energy performance, and using solar energy as their only energy source during the entire length of the project, which is one year and a half. The goal is to promote a culture of sustainable development in the way we approach housing and daily life, the press explained. The contest will witness the participation of teams from 15 countries across four continents, including teams from Morocco, Senegal, Turkey, Germany, and the US. Participants will cover as diverse as architecture, engineering, innovation, renewable energy, and social consciousness. While the winning prize amount will be decided after the first phase of the contest, M6PU and IRESEN have promised to provide a USD 50,000 in financial assistance to all the contesting teams. The contest is expected to produce  “a solar village” which will subsequently be presented to the public. “The main rationale behind the organization of Decathlon Solar Africa is to help students, especially African students, gain the practical experience and skills needed in the fields of sustainable or green building and energy efficiency, in addition to the integration of renewable and new energy sources in the construction sector,” it added. The organizers also said that this African edition seeks to valorize local resources, “reinforce continental capabilities” in the relevant sectors, and “propose models for sustainable and green housing for ‘the cities of tomorrow.’”

Rabat – Personal Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General Horst Kohler held talks on Tuesday with Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov on the Western Sahara and Polisario. A statement from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted that, during the meeting, the two officials stressed, “There are no alternatives to a political settlement of the Western Sahara dispute in line with relevant UN Security Council resolutions.” Kohler and Lavrov also emphasized the need for the development of a mutually acceptable solution to end the conflict to “promote the general improvement of the situation in North Africa.” In the meeting, the Russian minister expressed his country’s full support for the efforts conducted by UNSG Antonio Guterres, the UNSG personal envoy, and the United Nations Mission in the territory, known as MINURSO, with “its key role in maintaining regional stability.” Kohler also met with the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister and Special Presidential Representative for the Middle East and Africa, Mikhail Bogdanov, on “the full range of issues” related to the Western Sahara settlement process. Though there was no explicit mention of the subject, the timing of the meeting indicates that key discussion topics likely included Polisario’s recent incursions into the area east Morocco’s defense wall in the Western Sahara and Morocco’s corresponding threat of military force to prevent any change of the status quo. Earlier this month, Morocco informed the Security Council that it will consider any Polisario’s attempt to change the status quo of the region as “casus belli” (cause of war) and would resort to all available means, including the use of military force, as prevention. Regional media reported last week that Morocco had informed Algeria, via a European diplomat, that it was prepping to take military action against the Polisario. A report published by Moroccan news outlet Assabah on Thursday claimed that France allegedly informed Algeria that it would not oppose limited military strikes by Morocco against the Polisario. Kohler Attempts to Preserve the Political Process The timing of Kohler’s meeting with Russian officials–just less than three weeks before the Security Council is due to renew MINURSO’s mandate for one year–might signal that he is seeking Russia’s help in persuading Morocco to take the military option off the table. Kohler has held several meetings with international officials, including African Union and European Union representatives.  In January, Kohler held talks about the conflict with AU Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat in Addis Ababa. The UNSG Envoy also met with Rwanda’s President, Paul Kagame, who is also the president of the African Union. Kohler’s meetings with the African leaders followed his official meeting with the EU’s High Representative Federica Mogherini, on January 9, in Brussels. Recently, the UNSG and his personal envoy, reassured Morocco that the UN is the only body that has the legitimacy “to lead the political process” to reach a consensual solution in the Western Sahara conflict.

Rabat – Mehdi Benatia was very upset after the elimination of the Juventus against the Real Madrid on Wednesday, April 11, in the Champions League. The author of the offense that led to Cristiano Ronaldo’s liberating penalty kick didn’t hold back, saying some harsh words about the very controversial confrontation. “I’ve played in a lot of football games; I’ve seen a lot [of games] on television …You just can’t call for a fault on this kind of action. It is annoying for us, given the efforts we made,” the captain of the Moroccan team said to BeIN Sport. “It’s a game that must end in extra time. I am disgusted by the football world. When you make efforts like that, a referee can’t afford in the 93rd minute to give you a penalty and kill the job. I did everything not to touch him. Never did I intend to take him down, I never meant to push him,” he added. “El Capitano” must keep his head in the game, especially for the three additional pre-World Cup friendly games. Alongside The Atlas Lions, Mehdi Benatia will battle the Ukrainian, Estonian, and Slovakian teams only a week prior to the kickoff for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.  The international player did his utmost to help Moroccans during the 2018 World Cup Qualifiers. The football player netted a great goal against Cote d’Ivoire on November 11, 2017. The game finished with a 2-0 win for the Atlas Lions, who secured a place for the 2018 World Cup second round that will take place in Russia from June 14, 2018, to July 15, 2018.

Rabat – The Coordination of Relatives of the Victims of the Gdeim Izik incident addressed a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General on Tuesday, expressing concerns over the link Guterres that drew between the Gdeim Izik incident and Western Sahara conflict in his annual report on the Western Sahara. The 2010 incident occurred on the outskirts of Laayoune, when a group of Moroccan security forces were killed by Polisario members while dismantling the Gdeim Izik camp, where people had been living in protest of the unemployment and lack of opportunities in the city of Laayoune. In addition to eleven deaths, over 70 people were injured. In his latest report on the Western Sahara situation, Guterres said in paragraph 16 that the separatist group Polisario wrote 16 letters, deploring the “illegal detention of the co-defendants in the Gdeim Izik case and the death of one Gdeim Izik prisoners.” “We deem that this paragraph of the report lacked balance, was in favour of one party to the detriment of the other, which deprived it, in our opinion, of the credibility and honesty that should guide the UN’s dealing with the various conflicts and issues,” reads the letter, which was quoted by Maghreb Arab Press. The President of Coordination, Ahmed Atartour, said of the incident, “this description calls into question the neutrality of the report, since this is a political description that the Secretary General should not have adopted or used.” The letter further criticizes the report for calling the perpetrators of the crimes “activists,” emphasizing that the “activist” term is in no way compatible with their “legal status in the case since they were sentenced to criminal acts.” The Coordination has also criticized the report for ignoring the victims of the camp Gdeim Izik. “These are our sons whom the said criminals killed and urinated on in a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and the various international human rights instruments. Our sons have suffered these barbaric acts as they tried to dismantle the camp in a peaceful way under the law,” reads the letter. The coordination has recently urged the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to forward the letter to Guterres via the Moroccan representatives to the UN in New York. On July 29, 2017, Sale’s Court of Appeal handed verdicts ranging from two years to life imprisonment against 23 suspects involved in the Gdeim Izik incident. Charges included “forming criminal gangs and violence against public forces that led to their death with premeditation, the mutilation of corpses, and complicity.” Last December an additional suspect, Mohamed  El Ayoubi, was sentenced in abstentia to 20 years without bail, as a health condition prevented him from attending court. Widely hailed as “fair” by international organizations, defendants were fully informed of th accusations of serious crimes of intentional violence, which caused deaths, injuries, and serious material damage against them throughout the 2017 trial, according to the Leadership Council for Human Rights. The defendants were first charged by the Moroccan military court in 2013, with sentences ranging from 20 years to life imprisonment. However, following Morocco’s military justice system reform in July 2015, the judiciary decided to summon the defendants for an additional civil court case.

Rabat – The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (BERD) is assisting Morocco’s National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) in evaluating its network capacity to absorb more power from renewable energies.  BERD is currently selecting consultants who will assist the country’s grid operator, ONEE, in accessing the capacity of the very high voltage (VH) and high voltage (HV) networks, as well as that of the medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) grids, in order to absorb increasing volumes of power supply from renewables.  “The assignment aims to ensure that the network injection capacity will be sufficient to preserve the VH, HV, and MV networks’ security and balance, and that the power generation and transmission system performance will not be technically and economically degraded once new renewable energy generation centers are commissioned,” declared BERD, as quoted by PV Magazine.  BERD’s assessment is part of the country’s plan to increase the share of renewable energies, in its total installed power generation capacity, to 42 percent by 2020, and 52 percent by 2030.  Morocco’s total primary energy consumption has increased by 5 percent since 2004, with an increase of 3.6 increase per capita. About one third of this consumption is devoted to electricity generation, which amounted to 36,500 gigawatt hours in 2015.  The North African country produces 28,000 gigawatt hours of electricity, while the rest is imported from Spain.  Morocco seeks to boost its production capacities, which currently stands at 6,500 megawatts, to 14,500 megawatts by 2020, with solar and wind energies each representing 2 megawatts, according to a US International Trade Administration report.

Rabat – Morocco remains mobilized to defend its territorial and national integrity, Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, said Thursday in Rabat. Morocco’s “protest against the separatists’ breaches was shared by the United Nations, which called the Polisario Front to withdraw from Guerguerat and not to change the situation in the buffer zone,” El Othmani pointed out at the weekly cabinet meeting. The recent report of the UN Secretary-General, he said, was “generally positive” and responded to Morocco’s requests not to change the situation in the buffer zone. El Othmani recalled the message that King Mohammed VI sent to the UN chief, in which he warned “against the consequences of these dangerous developments on the next stage,” adding that Morocco will strongly defend its rights and sovereignty in this region, which must remain a buffer zone. He also reiterated Morocco’s position, which refuses any attempt to transfer civilian and administrative units and facilities or to receive ambassadors in the region, as these practices violate existing agreements. In this regard, El Othmani hailed the initiative of the Moroccan political parties that signed the Laayoune Declaration in this southern province of the country, in the presence of local and regional elected officials, war veterans, and representatives of the various associations of civil society. The Laayoune meeting sends a strong and clear message of unity throughout Moroccan society when it comes to such causes, he concluded.

Rabat – The Inspector General of Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces General Abdelfattah Louarak is currently representing the North African country at a security meeting in Washington, D.C. On the occasion, General Louarak co-chaired the 10th annual session of the U.S-Morocco Security Advisory Committee held April 10 – 12. Traveling to the US with an important Moroccan army delegation, the Moroccan army general also held important meetings with some key Pentagon military strategists, with the aim of maintaining and furthering the recently growing US-Morocco strategic relations. As General Louarek’s visit also follows an important delivery of US military support to Morocco, Moroccan officials seized the opportunity to discuss the prospects of improving regional national capabilities, as well interoperability with their American counterparts. The issues discussed during the Moroccan General’s visit also set the ground for the 2018 edition of African Lion, which is “an annual, bilateral US and Moroccan sponsored [military] exercise designed to improve interoperability and mutual understanding of each nation’s tactics, techniques, and procedures,” according to the program’s website. This year’s edition of the African Lion exercise is expected to take place in mid-April in Morocco’s southern regions, said a military source. Morocco-US military cooperation is has been experiencing an definitive moment, especially as the North African country, which is currently engaged in comprehensive programs to revitalize its military equipment and upgrade its air and naval response capabilities, recently acquired an important number of US-made equipment.

Rabat – Miriem Bensaleh-Chaqroun, who is the acting chair of the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM), criticized Morocco’s tourism industry for its lack of effectiveness and efficiency in satisfying the growing demands of the sector. She pointed out that Morocco’s tourism is “incoherent” and “dysfunctional,” elaborating that the sector is in desperate need of a “new business model” to resolves some its inconsistencies and adopt new ways of dealing with challenges. Mrs. Bensaleh-Chaqroun made her remarks during an international symposium on tourism organized by the Council for Development and Solidarity (CDS), an independent think tank working in collaboration with the CGEM. Speaking at the symposium, the chair-woman of CGEM said that measures of “good governance and disintermediation” needed to be implemented in a sector struggling to rise up to the “challenges of the digital world.” She called for more involvement from the government, saying that an industry that employs 500,000 needs to be given all the necessary means to “tackle its numerous incoherencies and structural fragilities.” Of the structural problems ailing Morocco’s tourism industry, Mrs. Bensaleh-Chaqroun especially berated the “overcapacity in hotels” and other tourism-related facilities; “managerial inconsistencies in handling the growing demand,” and the existence of “neglected destinations.” “While Marrakech is overcrowded with more 71,000 hotel beds, Casablanca cannot even host 5,000 visitors. And although we have good airport connectivity with services from and to 63 countries and 112 airports, some destinations like Ouarzazate are ignored,” she said, adding that Morocco is still promoting and focusing on tourist trails or sightseeing tours whereas more and more customers are shifting to short city-breaks. But for all her concerns about the structural failures and managerial mishaps of Morocco’s tourism, Mrs. Bensaleh-Chaqroun is hopeful about the sector’s prospects. “Morocco attracts over 11 million visitors annually, and we are since 2013 the first destination for tourism in Africa. So the prospects for 2018 are rosy,” she said. Speaking about her idea of a “new business model to further promote and develop the sector,” the businesswoman proposed the creation of specialized, tourism-focused research centers as well as tourism-centered foundations to ensure public debates on the various impacts (social, ecological, economic, psychological, etc.) that tourism can have on society at large. Other speakers at the symposium also endorsed the idea of a more responsive and digitized tourism industry. They also underlined the “transversal role” of tourism in a country’s economy, saying that the sector is “a lever for strong and inclusive development.”

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat – After the volatility that the national economy experienced after the fourth quarter of 2017, when GDP increased by 3.8 percent, then decreased by 2.6 percent during the first three months of 2018, GDP is expected to accelerate throughout the second quarter of 2018.  Morocco’s Higher Planning Commission (HCP) in charge of economic, demographic, and social statistics has good news for Morocco’s economy. HCP forecasts an increase to GDP as a result of an increase in international trade and rising world demand for Morocco’s goods and services, which is expected to boost the economy by 5.1 percent despite the notable slowdown in non-agricultural value add year over year in comparison with its performance in 2017. This increase during the second quarter of the year will not only cover the export of leather, textile, and aerospace industries but will also enhance industrial investments and consumer expenditure by 3.7 percent, in addition to boosting consumer goods imports and capital accumulation by 3.6 percent. The non-agricultural sectors will benefit from an improvement in the business climate in both emerging and advanced economies, as well as from significant increases in international trade. With respect to national trade, the rise in oil price may hinder its growth as it hit USD 63 per barrel in comparison with 2017 where it peaked at USD 51 per barrel. HCP expects industrial manufacturing to increase by 2.7 percent and foresees a decline by 1.9 percent in the rate of value added metals processing due to a decrease in external demand as well as the national price of phosphates. Non-agricultural value add is expected to achieve 3.2 percent which will play a part in the acceleration of the national economy by 3 percent during the second quarter of 2018. On the other hand, during the first quarter of the year, national economic growth was characterized by a slowdown of 2.6 percent due to the decline in agricultural value add by 0.5 percent versus the same quarter in 2017, where it hit 3.8 percent. During the same period, the slowdown persisted in terms of monetary base whose rate stalled at 5 percent compared to its performance, 5.5 percent in 2017, as well as electronic and electricity equipment sector which decreased by 13.4 percent. In contrast, the MASI and MADEX indexes have seen progress as the two increased at 14.8 and 14.5 percent throughout the first three months of 2018. The chemical industry was also reported to have expanded to 123.2 percent, followed by hardware and software industry which has increased by 65 percent, mining by 42.5 percent, hospitality industry by 38.7 percent, and at last holding companies which have also steadily increased by 34.2 percent. The synthesis of the aforementioned analytics suggest that the second quarter of 2018 should be a positive one reflecting various shifts in the components of GDP as the economy adapts to continuous changes in supply and demand.

Rabat – As an essential source of job opportunities and inclusive development, tourism is a key economic activity in Morocco, Zoubir Bouhoute, Director of Local Tourism Office (CRT) in Ouarzazate told Morocco World News, on the sidelines of the International Symposium on Tourism held on Wednesday in Rabat. MWN chatted with Bouhoute about Morocco’s tourism strategy, the challenges facing the sector, the tourism potential in Ouarzazate, and the city’s readiness to host games of the 2026 World Cup. Speaking about the event, Bouhoute said that the symposium was organized to underscore the importance of the sector, emphasizing that tourism serves as a pillar of the national economy. Tourism, a Pillar of Morocco’s Economic Growth “The tourism sector plays an important role in promoting tourist-hub areas in Morocco, spreading the culture, values, and history of each region,” said the chief of Ouarzazate’s CRT. He emphasized that international tourists can also promote Morocco’s tourism sector, adding that those visitors are “ambassadors” who can positively encourage their friends and family to visit Morocco if provincial tourist offices “served them well.” According to Bouhoute, the sector served as a backup plan to fix trade imbalances that the country has been facing over the years.  Tourism in Morocco provides MAD 70 billion annually, an income that contributes to creating a balance and avoiding trade deficit. He added that the country would be able to avoid all economic obstacles if it could further develop this sector, stressing the necessity of innovative digital governing solutions. Bouhoute noted that the tourism world has been witnessing an increasing shift towards digitalization: “Travelers now rely on the internet to book their flights and hotels. They are no longer relying on traditional procedures, like travel agencies.” Regarding challenges facing the sector, the tourism expert emphasizing that the country still has work to do in order to overcome these challenges. He said that the sector is connected to infrastructure, transport, and other economic activities. Therefore, the government needs to enhance efforts to provide the sector with the assets it needs to achieve more development. He added that government support is essential, adding that the cabinet needs to cooperate in the promotion process. “Despite the proximity between Morocco and Europe, there is a lack of air transport, linking between Morocco’s regions and European countries.” Bouhoute added that airline companies should also contribute to the promotion of tourism in Morocco by incentivizing travel offers. Looking forward, he believes Morocco’s provincial offices for tourism will need to devise creative and innovative strategies to attract more tourists, including further digitalization and advertising. Ouarzazate is Ready to Host 2026 World Cup Games Bouhoute noted that the country has all the necessary assets to host the massive tournament.   The tourism director the 2026 tournament would help in the development Ouarzazate, greatly increasing the number of tourists to the region. In reality, all regions of the country would benefit from important infrastructure projects, and the construction of these projects would create job opportunities throughout the country. Morocco must now up its efforts to increase its chances to host the tournament, according to Bouhoute. Speaking about the readiness of Ouarzazate, the CRT director said that the proposal to organize some of the  2026 World Cup games in Ouarzazate would have a positive impact. Though Bouhoute mentioned that the city could accommodate 3000 people in various hotels, he believes the city must expand its investments to properly mobilize for such a huge number of tourists. But these investments, too, would create more employment opportunities. Business Challenges in Ouarzazate Despite its excellent diversity, the city has experienced difficulties attracting investors. In response the Ouarzazate tourism director said that his office is visualizing a digitalization strategy that would contribute to the development of the region.This could serve as an incentive to business travelers and investors.  Hospitality, good governance and tourism management are also essential to the success of tourism sector, he added. Ouarzazate’s Faithful Tourists The CPT director also shared some of Ouarzazate’s tourism statistics with MWN. Moroccan nationals are taking the lead in Ouarzazate’s tourism, followed by French tourists. In January, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the French tourism indicated the highest growth, representing 11.95 percent of total arrivals in Ouarzazate. French visitors from January to November 2017 reached 29,195 tourists, up from 22,220 in 2016. Bouhoute added that the Spanish visitors follow the French, though the city of Ouarzazate has seen an increase in Chinese tourists in recent years, according to the CPT’s director, who added that the Chinese market recorded “spectacular performances in 2017, following the removal of visa requirements for Chinese tourists.

By Zoubida Senoussi Rabat – “Tourism has contributed for many years to Morocco’s wealth, both material and immaterial,” said the President of CGEM, Miriem Bensalah-Chaqroun, at the International Tourism Symposium on Wednesday, April 11. Organized by the Council for Development and Solidarity (CDS) in Rabat, the International Tourism Symposium gathered more than forty panelists including President of CDS Mohamed Benamour, President of CGEM Miriem Bensalah, Minister of Tourism Mohamed Sajid, Former Minister of Economy and Finances Salaheddine Mezouar, among other sector experts. The tourism industry is stagnating, and the objectives of the “Vision 2020” government strategy seem difficult to reach. Each panelist highlighted tourism as a vector of Morocco’s influence, as well as its role as a lever for strong and inclusive growth. They also emphasized stability and security as major concerns tied to tourists expectations. “This Symposium is a new contribution of the CDS to the debate on national issues. The CDS defends and promotes its values by organizing various events including symposia, forums, and debates with Moroccan and foreign personalities,” Mohamed Benamour said to Morocco World News. “Tourism has been established as a national priority and is considered a strategic sector and a major component of our economy,” he added. “Tourism is a terrific land-use tool, and our territory from Tangier to Lagouira is rich in its activities, its landscape, its heritage, its culture and its gastronomy. It is up to us public actors and economic actors to work together, collectively to improve the attractiveness, influence and cohesion of our country,” he concluded. When it was her turn to speak, Meriem Bensalah-Chaqroun shared some quantitative data to highlight the current position of tourism in Morocco. “We have gained more than 6 million tourists in fifteen years, which makes us the premiere tourist destination in Africa. We’re currently at 11 million tourists, though we have unfortunately stagnated since 2010,” she said. The businesswoman expressed concerns about the development delays of the sector “which is in a situation of overall inaction because of governance complacency.” She also advises the government to “cease investing in areas that are no longer productive”. Meanwhile, Minister of Tourism Mohammed Sajid spoke about the failures of the seaside strategy. “Even though tourism is one of the first sectors that implemented a strategy, the Azure Plan, with six huge resorts, did not work well,” he admits. As the Symposium went on, the panelists continued to examine Moroccan tourism and what it has to offer in the face of changes in the sector. Many speakers referred to the “digital revolution” as one of these major changes, including the former Minister of National Education and Tourism, Luc Chatel. “The real revolution during these past 10 years was the digital revolution. We experienced three types of advances in the way consumers research and secure services: First, the use of TripAdvisor, second the introduction of AirBnb, and the third the increased popularity of online reservations through sites such as Booking.com,” he said, adding that we’re currently witnessing a fourth digital advance: artificial intelligence products such as speaker and voice assistants such as Google Home. Chatel concluded that these changes have shaken up consumer behaviour patterns. When it comes to challenges and difficulties faced by tourism,  Abdelmalek Alaoui, CEO of consulting firm Guepard Group, brought up two main threats to the sector: “the trade of received ideas” and “the pre-eminence of certainties.” Alaoui also shared his colleagues’ opinions about the digital revolution. “We continue to fight with first-generation weapons while the world has changed. We need to move towards digital,” he said supporting his remarks referencing that billions of dirhams that have been spent on traditional advertising campaigns have proven to be about as effective as “throw[ing] water in the desert.” It has become clear that the key to successfully promoting tourism is with a digital strategy. “Build it, and it will come”, he concluded. We can’t talk about tourism without culture. The symposium has invited Neila Tazi, Vice President of the Representatives House and President of the Gnaoua festival to cover this very important topic. “We need to combine tourism and culture,” she strongly said, adding that “Morocco doesn’t take culture seriously,” as she continued her argument by explaining that “only 2 million tourists have visited all cultural and patrimonial sites in the country.” The purpose of this event was to make proposals for Morocco to become “a top travel destination” and for the sector to be transformed into “a leading component of the Moroccan economy.” In order to achieve this, several roundtables were led by experts who provided operational responses to the challenges experienced in tourism development.

Rabat- Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita arrived in Berlin on Wednesday, April 11, to meet with his German counterpart Heiko Maas. The talks between the Moroccan minister and his German counterpart revolved around bilateral cooperation, relations between Morocco and the European Union and the territorial integrity of Morocco, a governmental source said. The same source added that the head of the Moroccan diplomacy does not plan to meet the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Sahara, Horst Kohler, whose offices are in Berlin. “There will be no meeting between the two men in Berlin. The working visit of Nasser Bourita is exclusively reserved for the German authorities,” the governmental source told the Moroccan media le360. Bourita’s visit to Berlin comes after his visit to Paris, where he met the French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Tuesday, April 10, as part of the Moroccan diplomat’s European tour, which aims to strengthen the partnership and exchange between Morocco and European countries related to the latest developments in the Sahara issue following Polisario’s illegal maneuvers east of Morocco’s defense wall. Through this move, Morocco demands international support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan and calls on the UN and the international community to act in response to Polisario provocation, in order to maintain security and stability in the region. Germany, which has friendly relations with Morocco, will join the UN Security Council in 2019 as a non-permanent member.

Rabat- After Moroccan authorities have approved the import of Russia’s beef products a few months ago, they gave the green light to open Morocco’s national market to Ukrainian chicken and meat. The State Service for Food Safety and Consumer Protection of Ukraine recently announced that Ukraine and Morocco have agreed on a veterinary certificate for the export of meat and poultry products from the Ukraine.  “The State Service on Food Safety and Consumer Protection of Ukraine and the competent authority of the Kingdom of Morocco have agreed to a veterinary certificate for the export of meat and poultry products from Ukraine to Morocco,” a statement released by Ukrainian Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food said.  The statement added that “Morocco is a priority African country for Ukraine in the field of bilateral agricultural trade development.”  The commercial exchange between Ukraine and Morocco in 2016 amounted to USD 221 million.  According to the Royal Institute for Strategic Studies, bilateral trade remains characterized by its concentration on a limited number of products. Ammonia, wheat and energy products are the main products imported by Morocco from the Ukraine, while phosphates, fishery products and canned vegetables are the main products exported by Morocco to the Ukraine. Diplomatic relations between Morocco and Ukraine were formally established in June 1992, shortly after Morocco’s recognition of Ukraine’s independence in December 1991.

Rabat – Judicial Police in Errachidia seized 700 kilograms of cannabis during the arrest of three suspects for an alleged connection with a criminal ring involved in drug trafficking. The arrest operation led to the seizure of 700 kilograms of hashish, two bottles of tear gas,  a sum of money, a quantity of cocaine wrapped in a cigarette paper, two false license plates, and the vehicles used for the transport and smuggling of drugs, according to a statement by the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). The statement added that the suspects, who were arrested in a car carrying drugs, “fiercely” resisted the police members using tear gas. To stop the suspects, a member of the law enforcement fired a warning shot. Investigations revealed that two of the suspects are the subjects of several search warrants for international drug trafficking, while the third suspect has a criminal record that includes an assault resulting in death and previous drug trafficking. The defendants were placed in custody for further investigation and to determine other possible suspects involved in drug trafficking.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat- A one-day art exhibit in the US city of Philadelphia will celebrate artwork from Morocco and other countries infamously deemed “shitholes” by the US President Donald Trump. Launched by Le Chapeau Project, this gallery will feature contemporary artists from more than 15 countries, such as Haiti, Mauritius, Tanzania, Tunisia, and Morocco. The exhibit aims to promote self-representation for artists of the aforementioned nations, while challenging the negative narrative and imagery put forth by the US president. “The audience will get a unique chance to dive into ‘shitholes’ like never before!” the organizers sardonically proclaimed.  Established in 2018, Le Chapeau Project promotes emerging contemporary artists often excluded from exhibition in typical art galleries, through one-day only art galleries around the world, and diverse art genres such as painting, printmaking, sculpture, photography and film.  Founded by French-Tunisian Fatene Ben-Hamza, who currently lives in Casablanca, and American Steve Garguilo, who currently lives Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, this project “takes off its hat” to remarkable talent in all corners of the globe.  “Steve Garguilo and myself were inspired to launch this project after the ‘shitholes’ remarks earlier this year. As extensive travelers and members of several communities such as TED and TEDx, we thought that the best answer to such remarks would be to showcase the talents these so-called ‘shithole’ countries produce and give them a platform to contribute to a more positive narrative,” Ben-Hamza told Morocco World News.  Although the initiative revolves around emerging countries, it has recently received great encouragement in the US, from those who applaud the organizers’ creative response.  “The feedback we received led us to understand the importance of creating more powerful platforms for cultural understanding, for dialogue–and the urgency to bring these to as many people as we can,” added the organizers.  Three artists have been selected so far to represent Morocco in the city of brotherly love: Zineb Ben Jeloun, Dina Ben Brahim and Mamoun Belghiti.  Earlier in January, President Trump reportedly made derogatory comments while referring to developing countries generally and Haiti specifically, during an immigration policy meeting, saying: “Why do we want all these people from ‘shithole countries’ coming here?” In the aftermath of these remarks, the African Union asked President Trump to respond and apologize. The Pan-African organization received a “friendship letter” in response, addressed to leaders of the states gathering at AU summit in Addis Ababa in January.

Rabat – Though Cristiano Ronaldo’s bicycle kick goal against Juventus certainly ranks among the most beautiful goals scored in the history of football, former Moroccan international player Mustapha Hadji believes that his scissor kick is as beautiful as Ronaldo’s. Ronaldo’s goal against Juventus in the first leg of champions’ league quarter-finals remind us of the best bicycle kick goals in history: Rivaldo’s amazing 2001 hat-trick against Valencia, Cameroonian Patrick Mboma’s all-star kick at Stade de France, the unexpected goal of Amara Simba with PSG against Mulhouse in 1990. February 17, 1998– an unforgettable date for Moroccans, when Morocco’s national team faced off against its Egyptian rival in Burkina Faso at the Africa Cup of Nations, pulling out a one-goal victory with an overhead kick by Hadji in the 90th minutes of the game. In an interview with France football, Hadji relives the past and narrates the moment before the kick: “Either the ball ended at Ouarzazate, or it ended in the nets” Hadji said, adding “I am at the penalty spot. The ball is pretty powerful. There, I do not think–I take off and I launch it with everything I got.” After Ronaldo’s recent rocket, Hadji and his colleague couldn’t stop comparing it to Hadji’s historic ‘98 kick.  “The main difference,” Hadji says “is that for Cristiano’s, the ball falls back to the small net, while mine retains power and a straight trajectory.”  “It was a goal scored at the last second. I have always been blessed by Allah against Egypt. Nowadays, the Egyptians still welcome me very well at their home despite this goal, which will remain my best achievement.” As for Hadji, he reiterates that he was constantly practicing the goal in training. “Frankly, I did it [the bicycle kick] constantly in training.” The star added, “[Another] one I like to watch is [that of] Marco Van Basten.” Watch Hadji’s Bicycle:  Watch Ronaldo’s Bicycle:

Rabat – French Minister of Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian has allegedly warned his Algerian counterpart that France would not oppose Morocco’s military intervention against Polisario’s illegal maneuvers east of Morocco’s defense wall. Moroccan newspaper Assabah reported that the Security Council could also give Morocco a green light for a limited military intervention against the Algeria-backed Polisario Front, which has been attempting to relocate parts of its facilities east Morocco’s defense wall. Le Drian has also warned Algeria against any actions that would likely cause further escalation in the region, a diplomatic source told Assabah. The unidentified source further said that Le Drian’s statement came before an official meeting between King Mohammed VI and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday at the Elysee Palace. “If the Polisario does not withdraw from the buffer zone, as provided by the ceasefire agreement, Morocco has the right to respond with firmness,” Le Drian told Messahel. According to the same source, Messahel failed to influence France position on the situation in the region as a result of Polisario’s attempts to change the status quo.  According to the same source, Messahel reportedly held a meeting with the staff of Algeria’s army to inform them of France’s position and its support for Morocco’s military intervention. In an interview given to French TV channel France 24 on Tuesday, Messahel reiterated Algeria’s support for the separatist group, claiming that the Western Sahara conflict is an issue that should be solved between Morocco and Polisario. He added that Algeria should not cooperate in finding a solution to the decades-long conflict. On April 4, King Mohammed VI addressed a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, calling on Algeria to fully shoulder its responsibility in the search for a solution to the regional conflict. When asked about his opinion regarding the King’s letter during an interview given to French TV channel France 24, Messahel said that Morocco “claims” that the Western Sahara conflict is “a matter between Algeria and Morocco, whereas it is not the case. It is a case between Morocco and the Sahrawi people, and between Morocco and the decisions of the United Nations.”

Rabat – Almost two months after the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that Morocco could continue its fisheries partnership and trade dealings with EU–as long as the business did not include the Western Sahara– EU decision-makers have decided to open subsequent procedures to review and “modify” the clauses of ECJ’s ruling, reported Moroccan news site Aujourd’hui earlier today. According to Aujourd’hui, April 13 and 16 are two “important dates” that will have a significant bearing on Morocco’s relationship with the EU, as they will mark intensive discussions between Moroccan diplomats and their EU counterparts. During the first phase of negotiations on April 13, Moroccan officials will meet with the Committee of Permanent Representatives (Coreper 1) to discuss and clarify different positions sparked by the ruling. The first phase will also set the ground for the important policy decisions that will later be adopted or amended by the EU’s Council of Ministers, with the goal of discussing potential modifications to the ECJ’s decision. The second phase will occur in parallel to the meeting of EU’s Council of Ministers, beginning April 16. Within the parameters of the council’s mandate, ministers will “discuss, amend, adopt, and coordinate” agriculture and fisheries-related policies, as well as international agreements binding EU members and third-party states. More specifically, regarding Morocco-EU Fisheries Agreement, the council will discuss whether the European Commission should be given the green light to negotiate with Moroccan officials the new terms of the Fisheries Agreement. Although none of the decisions derived from these phases will be binding, they will provide legal and legitimate grounds for contesting and modifying prior rulings. As the Council of Ministers is made up of ministers from EU states, the direction of each state’s domestic and international policy already imposes a substantial impact on the council’s decisions. According to Aujourd’hui, this phase will particularly be determining for Morocco’s diplomacy, as it will involve convincing “neutral or abstaining” EU member states of the “legitimacy” of Morocco’s position regarding the Fisheries Agreement. It is expected that the opening of new negotiations will be beneficial for Morocco, as the Commission has notably had already lent its support to Morocco’s position prior to ECJ’s February ruling. Moroccan officials, though conscious of the complexity of the situation, are said to be confident about the prospects of the country’s position. “Of course, ECJ will again have a say in the final decision; but as long as Morocco is given the opportunity to defend its position, everything will be fine,” a source within the inner circles of the proceedings told Aujourd’hui. “Moroccan diplomats have handed [to relevant EU bodies] all the documents and data indicating that the lionshare of the financial benefits of the agreement goes to the southern regions,” the report concluded.

By Zoubida Senoussi Rabat – Moroccans Living Abroad (MRE) are invited by the Ministry Delegate in Charge of Moroccans Living Abroad and Business of Migration, in partnership with Sultan Moulay Slimane University, to attend Spring University’s “Morocco, Land of Cultures” on April 10-14, in Beni Mellal. This event aims to preserve the identity of Moroccans residing abroad and strengthen their ties with their country of origin, as a part of the ministry’s strategy to develop cultural activities in order to better meet the needs and expectations of the Moroccan community abroad. Hundreds of young Moroccans from different countries around the world aged 18 to 25 are invited to discover and explore the offerings of Beni Mellal, in partnership with students from Sultan Moulay Slimane University.  Spring University aims to highlight the diversity of Moroccan heritage, wealth, and assets in the Beni Mellal-Khenifra region, with its strategic location and ideal climate. For five days, the students will come together to participate in conferences and debates led by Moroccan researchers and experts, highlighting the wealth of the region and its cultural heritage. Some of the week’s themes include the evolution of science throughout the history of Morocco, the national cause, Moroccan youth and national identity, and the history and culture of Morocco. The Spring University is similar to the Al Akhawayn University event, Winter University, which was organized in Ifrane under the theme of “Living Together,” in December 2017. Both programs aims to preserve Moroccan identity for the new generations of Moroccans living abroad, strengthening their links with their country of origin and consequently, the contributions to their home societies.

Rabat – A recent survey about happiness in Morocco, showed unambiguously that the people of the Sahara region are the happiest and the merriest in the whole country, followed by Casablanca.  Indeed, this region since its recuperation by Morocco in 1975 by the means of the peaceful and massive Green March, big cities have sprawled from the sand dunes and Morocco has invested the equivalent of 40 billion dollars in infrastructure, almost to the tune of 1 billion dollars a year building roads, hospitals, schools, airports, ports, desalinization plants, power plants; creating heat-resistant agriculture, sand dune-stabilization programs, plant nurseries, agronomy labs, etc. Not to forget, of course, providing free housing, subsidized food, free medical care and thousands of jobs for the Sahrawi people in the region or elsewhere in the country. Morocco has, also, facilitated local and national elections in the territory, and even opened the door to the Polisario supporters to demonstrate and express their point of view openly in the major cities and for independence activists to move in and outside the country freely. In 2006, to break the political deadlock, Morocco proposed a large autonomy (Moroccan Sahara Autonomy Proposal)[i] for the region under Moroccan flag and sovereignty. Since the late 80s of the last century Morocco built a defensive wall to protect the region and, as a result, the Polisario has been militarily paralyzed on Algerian territory living off international aid and been fully quarantined by the Algerian army, to use as a means to blackmail Morocco, when necessary. If today the refugee population of Lahmada is allowed to move freely they would all  come to Morocco on foot, without hesitation. Algeria, the main support of the Polisario, is incapacitated. Its president, Bouteflika is in a wheelchair unable to move or for that matter even to speak, since some years ago after a heart attack. Now the Front de Libération Nationale -FLN-, state party and mouthpiece of the omnipotent and omnipresent army is asking him to be the official candidate of the military establishment in the upcoming presidential elections, for a fifth term on a row. Of course, it is the army that will rule, as ever, with its 40 generals in the command behind the incapacitated president, to embezzle, as ever, the little money that is left in the country and place it in Swiss bank accounts. Practically speaking the Algerian government is still buying social peace through subsidized food and fuel and some jobs,  but soon this will cease and people will come out into the streets to demand change and accountability and an Algerian revolution will ensue, similar to the Iranian revolution of 1979 in intensity.[ii] Algeria has built its political survival partly on declaring its animosity to Morocco since the time of President Boumedienne and created for this purpose an organization called Polisario to hinder Moroccan  development and progress. But much to its dismay, Morocco used this bellicose sentiment to fuel its development and become a regional power in Africa where it is pouring billions of dollars in a south-south cooperation scheme that will undoubtedly create wealth for the African Nations and Moroccan people alike. Morocco rode the fearful Arab Spring successfully with Mohammed VI proposing a constitution in 2011 that would ultimately lead to power devolution slowly but surely. Since the Islamists of the Parti de la Justice et Développement -PJD- have been ruling the country on end. Like all the countries of the world, Morocco has its own internal problems, but everything is in the open and everybody knows about everything. Discontent is allowed, as long as it is peaceful. This has happened in Alhoceima with the Hirak, the government responded by firing all the officials that were sluggish in the realization of the development of the region and has earmarked 1 billion dollars for the implementation of social and economic programs . The activists of the uprising have been rounded and imprisoned and are being tried and will soon be sentenced, but everyone knows, deep down, that afterwards they will be pardoned by the king. Another uprising has since occurred in the poor mining city of Jerada in the east, the government is promising to attend to the urgent needs of the population through a development program. In a word Morocco is in perpetual dialogue with itself.  Morocco is the most stable country of North Africa, let alone the Arab world. It is currently ruled by the Alouite monarchy that has been around since the 17th century. This dynasty has gained much in historical legitimacy doubled with religious legitimacy because its monarchs besides being the heads of state, the are, also, The Commanders of the Faithful, amir al-mu’mini. The monarchy is sometimes criticized openly, but it is, all the time, held in high esteem and respect because it is the symbol of unity and the strong identity known as tamaghrabit, that binds all Moroccans together be they Amazigh or Arab, Muslim or Jew and poor or rich. Since some time ago, the Polisario,  pushed by the Algerian generals has been steadily provoking Morocco, on a daily basis. First they occupied, the Guergrate Border check point hindering the passage of Moroccan trucks into Mauretania. The UN duly chased them out of this place. Now in violation of  the 1991 ceasefire they are moving into the buffer zone with their weaponry and trying to build habitations on what they call “liberated territories,” Morocco would not allow this fait accompli and has, as such, informed the UN and Algeria that it will duly kick out the Polisario militarily from the buffer zone, if necessary. In preparation of this unwanted campaign Morocco is beefing up its forces in the region and strengthening its national front. In this regard, the political parties have held a high-profile meeting in Laayoune on April 9, 2018 that has unanimously issued a declaration comprising 15 points stating that Moroccans, one and all, will stand together to defend national territorial integrity.  Morocco World News, as to what regards this national meeting of all political forces, be they partisan or other, writes:[iv] “To condemn Polisario’s actions in the east of Morocco’s defense wall, members of political parties and cabinet officials signed the Laayoune Declaration on Monday, April 9, as part of their meeting in the southern city Laayoune, at the request of Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. Laayoune hosted demonstrations on Sunday and Monday, bringing together leaders of political parties, MPs, elected officials, Cheikhs (tribal leaders), dignitaries and Sahrawi leader-activists, with the aim of showing their mobilization behind the government and their resolve to defend their country’s territorial integrity. In the Laayoune Declaration, the signatories laud the leadership and the policies led by King Mohammed VI in defense of Morocco’s territorial integrity and inalienable rights at all levels. In addition, the declaration highlights the plans for sustainable economic development and regionalization that will benefit the provinces.” While for the electronic publication North Africa Post, the text of the declaration  calls on the UN to act swiftly to avoid war in the region:[v] “The text summarizes the position of the Moroccan political class, which condemns “the maneuvers of the opponents of our territorial integrity at all levels, especially the latest hostile acts of the Polisario aimed at establishing a new reality on the ground”. The Declaration denounces in this connection the Polisario’s attempt “to transfer certain of its civilian and military elements from Lahmada in Algeria to the buffer zone, with the support of Algiers, in blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement and obvious disregard of the will of the United Nations and the Security Council resolution”. The Declaration also denounces “the stubbornness of the Algerian regime, which persists in creating arguments and pretexts to perpetuate this artificial tension.” The text on the other hand calls on the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in the Sahara (MINURSO), and through it the international community, to take “firm, rigorous and dissuasive measures to compel the Polisario to withdraw from this (Buffer) zone and put an end to its attempts to establish a new reality in this area.”” It might be the case that Algeria gripped with so many internal difficulties concerning the economy and the succession or not succession of the incapacitated president,  would duly want to export its problems to the region to get some relief from its numerous headaches. But while all Moroccan would volunteer to defend their country, no Algerian would come out in defense of the Polisario Front, especially now. So If I were the Polisario, I would not bank  much on Algerian volatile support, instead I will come to Morocco  to settle down in the flourishing Sahara region and lead a happy and peaceful life. Will they heed this advice. Only time can show. You can follow Professor Mohamed CHTATOU on Twitter: @Ayurinu End notes: [i]  Full text of the plan: (PDF) (Report). Moroccan Authority.

Rabat- Following a massive campaign that portrayed the North American trio as the ideal and “superior bid” to host the 2026 World Cup, there are new concerns about the reported spotlessness of United 2026.  According to a recent ESPN report, in addition to the army of weaknesses that could play against United 2026 in Moscow on June 13, Mexico’s questionable suitability to host World Cup matches marks yet another slap in the face for the North American trio. According to the preliminary observations of the FIFA Task Force, the supposedly ideal bidder is not as “ideal” as we thought after all. It has two big flaws: the pervasiveness of organized crime and the threat of violence directed at female football fans, as well as prevailing human rights abuses in Mexico City and elsewhere in the country. Even Ergon Associates, the human rights advocacy group that prepared parts of United 2026’s bidding document, pinned down various security concerns regarding Mexico’s suitability to host ten World Cup games. “The majority of women in Mexico City have experienced some form of sexual violence [including verbal harassment and unwanted touching] in their daily commute,” Ergon wrote in the document it prepared for United 2026. In addition to gendered violence in public, there are also indications of anti-gay chants and slurs in packed stadiums during matches. The document further elaborated on the availability of “several documented reports of violence” directed at varying groups, including reporters and women, among others. Citing many instances of murder and verbal and physical threats against reporters, Ergon said that Mexico “is one of the world’s most dangerous places.” But Mexico is not the only source of the trio’s diminishing hopes of winning the hearts and minds of the footballing community. In this regard, Ergon also indicated that poor international support for Trump’s America could prove a major hindrance in convincing federations to lend United 2026 their support. While the US would to host all games from the quarter finals onwards should United 2026 win on June 13, Ergon notes that there are “reports [in the US] of law enforcement unfairly targeting minorities and migrants,” as well as  “potential discrimination and travel restrictions from certain states.” Effectively, if United 2026 is victorious, many football fans will not be able to witness the tournament’s quarterfinals matches, due to their countries of origin.  So, President Trump’s so-called “Muslim ban” and the recent US bill requiring the social media history of US visa applicants could also weigh in favor of Morocco’s bid in the footballing community. With Morocco increasingly portrayed as the ‘darling’ or the favorite bid of many national federations and an overwhelming number of football stars, the only probable obstacle remains the assessment of the Task Force. Next week, it will be Morocco’s turn to endure the stringent scrutiny of FIFA’s trusted experts. Taking into account the growing unpopularity of United 2026, should Morocco successfully pass the Task Force, the balance seems to be ineluctably swinging in Morocco’s favor.

Rabat- Reiterating Algeria’s support for the separatist group Polisario Front, Algerian Foreign Affairs Minister Abdelkader Messahel claimed that the Western Sahara conflict is a question that should be solved between Morocco and Polisario. Messahel reiterated that Algeria should not cooperate in finding a solution to the decades-long conflict. On April 4, King Mohammed VI addressed a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, calling on Algeria to fully shoulder its responsibility in the search for a solution to the regional conflict. “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario,” said the King in his letter, which was personally delivered to the UNSG by Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita in New York. When asked about his opinion regarding the King’s letter during an interview given to French TV channel France 24, Messahel said that Morocco “claims” that the Western Sahara conflict is “a matter between Algeria and Morocco, whereas it is not the case. It is a case between Morocco and the Sahrawi people, and between Morocco and the decisions of the United Nations.” “Negotiations” on this situation have always been between “the Polisario representatives and Morocco, it will not change,” he claimed. Messahel went on to say that Algeria has responded to Morocco’s letter to the UNSG. In a statement published by Agence France Press (AFP), a source at the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that “Algeria’s support of the Sahrawi people and its legitimate representative, the Polisario Front, does not mean that it should be involved in negotiations” between Morocco and the separatist group. The Algerian Minister’s allegations stand in stark contrast to the statements made by several founding members of the Polisario, such as Bachir Al-Dkhil, a former Polisario official who fled the Tindouf camps and settled in Morocco. In an interview with Moroccan news outlet Yabiladi last March, Al-Dkhil said that in 1974, one year after the establishment of Polisario, Algeria took control of the front and used to serve its agenda against Morocco. In the interview, Dkhil explains how the Algerian government seized the opportunity to hold the second Polisario congress in Algiers, in order to oust many of its founding members, including its first Secretary General Oueli Mustapha Sayed, and replace Saharawi representatives from the Tindouf camps in south-eastern Algeria. “New people who had nothing to do with the cause of the Sahara were appointed to key positions, including a dozen men who formed the heart of the Polisario Intelligence Bureau. They were all Sahrawi Algerians from Tindouf and they controlled everything,” Dkhil is quoted as saying. The former founding member of the Polisario said that Algeria’s goal is not the independence of the Sahara; it rather seeks to use this territorial dispute as a card to weaken Morocco. “I repeat that the latter does not want the independence of the Sahara. It just wants to weaken Morocco and knows that if the Sahara gets independence, separatist demands will be born in the heart of resource-rich Algerian regions, such as Tindouf and Hassi Bechar,” he added. Recently, regional tensions have escalated due to Polisario’s repeated provocative military actions east of Morocco’s defense wall. Morocco has been urging the United Nations and the Security Council to put an end to Polisario’s maneuvers in the region, emphasizing that the country will not hesitate to repel any further escalation from the Algeria-backed Polisario Front.

Rabat – According to the latest statistics issued by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on April 9, Moroccan nationals once again constituted the largest group of foreigners acquiring citizenship in an EU Member State in 2016, with over 101,300 citizens  naturalized.  Out of this figure, 89 percent of Moroccans obtained citizenship in Spain, Italy, or France, while the rest acquired citizenship in Belgium, the Netherlands, or Germany.  Moroccans comprised the largest demographic naturalized in Spain, representing 36.5 percent of all naturalization cases. They were also the largest group to be naturalized in Italy and France, at 34.8 percent and 17.5 percent of national cases, respectively. According to Eurostat, Moroccans have ranked first in terms of naturalization in the 27 countries of the European Union, followed by Albanians, Indians, Pakistanis, and Turks. Albania ranked second with over 67,500 new citizens, mostly in Italy and Greece. India took third place with over 41,700, mostly in the UK. The report said that in 2016, around 995,000 people acquired citizenship in a Member State of the European Union (EU), up from 841,000 in 2015.  “Of the total number of persons obtaining the citizenship of one of the EU Member States in 2016, 12 percent were former citizens of another EU Member State, while the majority were non-EU citizens or stateless,” the report says.

Rabat – The Association of the Missing People at the Hands of Polisario (APDP) has informed the Spanish government of criminal acts committed by the separatist group against the Sahrawi populations, who continue to suffer unbearable living conditions in the Polisario-run Tindouf camps in Algeria. The president of the association, Dahi Aguai–who is also a former victim of Polisario violence in Tindouf–sent Spain’s Ministry of Justice a detailed document on Tuesday, unveiling torture and disappearances acts perpetrated by the Polisario Front in the camps. In a letter addressed to the Spanish Prime Minister, Aguai explained the torture and violence committed in Polisario prisons in the Algerian territory, noting that some of the torture suspects fled to Spain. “We have filed a complaint against them at Spanish courts, because we have great confidence in the Spanish justice and government,” said Aguai. He added that the Polisario uses political cover to protect the people involved in criminal acts who are circulating freely in several European countries using Algerian diplomatic passports. Aguai said that among the victims who were targeted by the separatist groups, there were also Spanish nationals, emphasizing that he witnessed the disappearance of five Spanish soldier-prisoners, while recalling the attack led by the Polisario Front against the Spanish boat “Tagomago.” The file sent to the Spanish Ministry of Justice includes photos of the torturers, torture victims, and Sahrawis reported missing; descriptions of Polisario torture practices; and a list of the 294 individuals recorded missing while serving time in Polisario jails. In 2010, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the Spanish authorities expelled the Polisario representative in Madrid, following the front’s terrorist attack on Spanish trawlers “El Junquito” and “El Tagomago.” In December 2007, the Spanish National Audience accepted a complaint against Polisario leaders and Algerian security and army officers for “genocide, torture, enforced disappearances, illegal detention and serious violations of human rights.” The list of the suspects involved in committing terrorist acts includes Ibrahim Ghali, leader of the Polisario Front, who was featured in a 2017 documentary about the front’s violation of human rights and the involvement of Polisario leader Ghali in the said crimes. On Tuesday, Moroccan newspaper Assabah reported that hundreds of Sahrawis fled the Tindouf camps for fear of being murdered due to their activism against the separatist ideologies in Mahbes, Tifariti, Bir Lahlou, and Guerguerat. The Algerian-backed Polisario has been continuously attempting to relocate its illegal facilities to the region In March, a group of Sahrawis in the Polisario-administered Tindouf camps launched a campaign to denounce the unbearable living conditions imposed on the inhabitants. The movement, “Sahrawi Initiative for Change,” aims at defying the “archaism” and the “mummification” of the Polisario’s leadership, who have been accused of total detachment from the reality of the camps. The movement pushes for a radical change in approach to find a solution to the crisis that the Sahrawi populations in Tindouf have suffered for more than four decades.

Rabat – According to “a close diplomatic source” who allegedly spoke to Le 360 under conditions of anonymity, King Mohammed VI is expected to attend the convention of the Arab League in Saudi Arabia’s capital city. The same source said that the King had received a formal invitation to attend the Riyadh summit prior to his trip to France for health reasons. The Arab summit, which generally takes place in March, was postponed to April over concerns that it would interfere with Egyptian presidential elections. The summit is set to witness a wide participation of Arab leaders, kings, princes, etc., with the objective of discussion pan-Arab matters. Although the Royal Cabinet is yet to issue a confirmation of the King’s presence at the Riyadh Arab summit on April 15, the source reported being confident that the Monarch, as the acting leader of Al Qods, will be joining his fellow Arab leaders to discuss about the crucial and recurring problems confronting the Arab world. The source recalled that Morocco had declined hosting the 27th edition of the summit in Marrakech in 2016, and that King Mohammed VI subsequently missed the 2017 edition in March last year, explaining that such factors are strong indicators why the Monarch will decide to join up with fellow Arab leaders on April 15 in the Saudi Capital. Given its strategic and strong military relationships with Saudi Arabia, but also its constructive neutrality in the Riyadh-Doha diplomatic rift, Morocco is believed to be a trusted ally of many fellow Arab countries in the Gulf, and elsewhere. King Mohammed, who was hosted yesterday by France’s Emmanuel Macron, has not been engaged in diplomatic dealings since his surgery on February 26 in Paris. And should the monarch make it to the 29th Arab League summit, the occasion will be his first major official and state-related appearance in months. There are also reports that the King will resume his Africa agenda after the Arab League summit. After the pan-Arab conference in Riyadh, and in a move to give some momentum to the now seemingly slow Moroccan diplomatic offensive in the rest of Africa, the same source concluded, King Mohammed will pay a number of visits to many sub-Saharan countries.

Rabat- The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) will launch a program on the prevention of extremism through youth empowerment in four countries, which will include Morocco, UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay said on Monday, April 10.   Speaking at the opening of the plenary session of UNESCO’s Executive Board, Azoulay said that the program will be launched in two weeks in Morocco, Jordan, Libya, and Tunisia.  Funded by the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) and Canada, the project is considered a vital move towards engaging youth in the prevention of violent extremism.  The launch of this program comes after UNESCO had recently released the findings of a study on youth radicalization through social media. Azoulay noted that a guide for educational communities to help in the fight against anti-Semitism will be published shortly. “Around culture, arts, sport, there are spaces for dialogue to be created, even in the most strained situations, because these forms of activity transcend violence, and allow youth mobilization by opening the dialogue,” Azoulay explained.  A launch event will be organized at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris on April 24, in the presence of Azoulay, and the Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT), Vladimir Voronkov.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat- After the previous “World’s Oldest Man,” Francisco Nuñez Olivera passed away at the age of 113, 112-year-old Japanese man, Masazo Nonaka, has taken up the title in the Guinness World Records. Flashing the world’s oldest smile to the camera while taking bites of the cake offered to him on the occasion, Masazo Nonaka celebrated 112 years. Nonaka won the title “World’s Oldest Man” per the official Guinness records certificate he received on Tuesday, April 10, in his hometown, Ashoro on the island of Hokkaido in Japan. Nonaka was born on July 25, 1905. Today, he is precisely 112 years and 260 days old.  Guinness World Records notes that Nonaka was born just months before Einstein published his major theory of relativity. In 1931, Nonaka married Hatsuno with whom he has five children. Nonaka, whose family owns and runs a 105-year-old Japanese onsen (mineral bath and spa), owes his longevity to soaking in hot springs coupled with eating sweets. However, his granddaughter Yuko Nonaka had a different perspective, as she emphasized that, “he lives his life in a way that doesn’t bring him stress,” and “if he doesn’t want something, he’ll make sure everyone knows about it.” The super-centenarian spent the early days of his retirement sumo-wrestling, reading newspapers, and eating all kinds of sweets. He now spends his time surrounded by his family and cozied up with his pet cats of whom he is very fond. His granddaughter told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that, although he uses a wheelchair to move around, his general condition is good. It took the Guinness World Records senior consultant Robert Young an extensive research process to confirm that Nonaka is indeed the “World’s Oldest Man.” “Mr Nonaka’s achievement is remarkable… he can teach us all an important lesson about the value of life and how to stretch the limits of human longevity,” expressed Guinness World Records Chief Editor, Craig Glenday. The all-time “Oldest Person Ever” title still belongs to Jeanne Louise Calment from France who lived for 122 years and passed in 1997. As a note, Guinness Records is conducting  research to find the world’s Oldest Living Woman.

Rabat- To paraphrase the great George Orwell, some miracles are more miraculous than others. Such was Roma’s theatrical display against the Messi-led and Valverde-coached boys from Barcelona. But where to begin with a game that witnessed the humiliation of a coach and a squad I’ve been lauding as unbeatable for the past few months?  One thing is certain: Roma’s comeback is a footballistic earthquake, and one that can be ascribed to Valverde’s tactical mishaps. When I watched the game, there was an overwhelming sense that Barça was not Barça, that the whole game was some huge set up, perhaps the biggest April Fools’ joke?  “Is this Barcelona?” fans around me kept asking themselves as the giant Catalans were laughably ineffective in what will surely be remembered as their most mediocre performance in a defining Champions League tie. No wonder, then, that the Stadio Olimpico fans were as enthused as Messi and Iniesta were dejected. Yes, encouraged by the mad and enraptured crowd that came to support their city’s gladiators, Roma’s squad looked like Jesus walking on water, in dogged defiance of all the laws of physics. In a purely biblical sense, then, Roma’s unthinkable comeback is perhaps modern football’s closest rendition of the Gospel’s Resurrection: faith, when true and sustained, can move mountains and overpower, like Joshua in Jericho, the most impenetrable forces. As their coach tirelessly warned in the scores of previous press conferences, Roma kicked off as they had expected: An early first goal to shatter the confidence of Barcelona, to force Valverde into conceding the unlikeliest tactical blunders. Dzeko’s goal, like that of Camp Nou, saw a low-range ball  make it through Barcelona’s staunch defense before bringing the first goal home. With that early first goal, Dzeko gave Roma some room for hope; Italian fans, thrilled as ever, kept pushing their team to overpower Barcelona, in all senses of the word.  No crosses from Semedo or Jordi Alba, no tantalizing display of passing accuracy, no moments of godlike skills and divine inspiration with which Messi alone can stun his opponents: for the whole first half, Barcelona looked more like a mid-table team than the unstoppable leader of what is arguably Europe’s most intense league. To top it all off, the midfield–the typical bastion of Barcelona’s hitherto unchallenged supremacy–resembled a Roma-dominated playground, with Iniesta and Rakitic moving with raw zeal of kids playing in the street. And so, when the French referee called for the end of the first half, the footballing world started thinking what no one but Roma’s coach had dared to believe before the game kicked off: this Roma may–indeed can–make history tonight. And make history they did! “We’ll play our strongest line-up giants Barcelona. We must play with passion, heart and belief right up until the final whistle if we want to do the unthinkable. We have the duty to give it everything,” Roma’s coach Eusebio Di Francesco said in the press conference before the match. Di Francesco’s men took heed of his words: as the second half kicked off, determination and belief propelled Roma forward, allowing them to outmuscle Barcelona in all possible ways. Having stifled and overwhelmed Iniesta and Co. in the midfield, the inspiring Strootman – De Rossi – Nainggolan trio gained momentum, forcing Barcelona to surrender and concede another goal. And yet, for all the bravery and unbelievable consistency that Roma showed, Ter Stegen—what a goalkeeper he is!—kept delaying the Italian momentum. Barcelona was outnumbered, bullied; in a sense, there was a feeling that the two teams had flipped: scaring opponents into stupid and intolerable blunders is a trick that Roma took right out of Barcelona’s playbook. So when Dzeko, again, made his way through Pique and Umtitti, the Spaniard knew that the only way to deny the Bosnian a second goal was to foul the Roma forward. At which point, the referee decided that there was a penalty—and there clearly was one. The Stadio Olimpico erupted in chants and slogans, practically transforming into Capua. With a score line of 2-0, Roma was boosted, emboldened, and invigorated. What seemed far-fetched and improbable was now within inches of attainability: Barça was no longer unstoppable. So Roma kept pushing, wilder and more boisterous than before. Meanwhile, Barcelona looked like a beleaguered army that had given up on the idea of launching an offensive. And, like many other teams humiliated in the past ten years, they resorted to defense, praying the gods of the game would be sympathetic to them by preventing Roma from scoring the winning goal. But Barcelona should have known better: the gods, in their irreproachable fairness, are more often than not on the side of those who, singularly focused on their desired outcome, give it their utmost. Iniesta’s facial expression said it all when Kostas Manolas scored his defining header at the 83rd minute. By then, it was clear that Barcelona could do little to score a goal to change the whole night. Messi was unusually uninspiring with the ball; Suarez was lackadaisical, flippant, and unbelievably unreliable. In conceding that third goal, Barça bid farewell to its very triumphant recent past; ahead, lies the painful memory of a wasted opportunity. For Messi and Co., yesterday signaled, as clichéd as that may sound, the beginning of the end of an era. “It is really tough. It seems untrue,” Iniesta said afterwards, adding that it is almost unacceptable to be defeated in a season and at a moment when everyone thought they were at their best. Barça, like countless giants before, fell when no one could even conceive that they could be beaten, much less humiliated by one of the “underdogs” of the tournament. For Roma and many others, it is a night to remember, to recall the beauty of one of the most extraordinary comebacks in the history of the competition. “This win is one of the best I have ever experienced since joining Roma,” De Rossi said, hailing Roma’s coach as the one who believed and helped the squad make the difference that was needed to propel the Italians in their first semi-finals in decades. “It wasn’t luck,” said coach Di Francesco, pointing out that his side has the depth and talent needed to play the final in Kiev, their season’s goal. Roma topped a group that consisted of Chelsea and Atletico Madrid. They have just humiliated one of Europe’s greatest teams. They have an impressive goalkeeper in Alison. Can anyone dare say that they’re still an underdog?

Rabat – A video depicting Palestinian teen protester Ahed Tamimi’s prison interrogation was released on Monday by the teenager’s parents. The footage shows the 17-year-old being threatened and coerced by her Israeli interrogators into “cooperating with the authorities.” According to Tamimi’s father, Baseem Tamimi, who released the video to the public, the footage shows an interrogation session that took place on December 26, 2017,  just a week after Israeli authorities arrested the tean for slapping two Israeli soldiers in her West Bank village. In the long excerpts–about two hours total–released to the public, two Israeli interrogators are shown threatening and intimidating the teen to “confess.”  Perhaps most notably, the video shows the two interrogators making suggestive and flirtatious comments about the teen’s body, fair skin, and “eyes of an angel.”  “My little sister is blonde and her eyes are like yours,” one of the interrogators says in the footage, further asking the 17-year-old girl: “How are you in the sun? Like my sister? Red, red, red?” Throughout the whole interrogation, though, and in spite of the threats and intimidation to which her interrogators subjected her, Ahed remained resolutely silent, showing her interrogators that their techniques would not get her to “cooperate” with them. “I choose to remain silent,” was the only sentence she uttered in the whole footage. At one point in the video, the two interrogators, determined to “break her silence,” threatened to detain her relatives and friends if she “does not say something.”  “We will arrest everyone in the video,” one of them said, referencing the teen’s viral soldier-slapping video. He added: “I don’t want to have to bring those children here… You say something, maybe we won’t need to.” According to Dawoud Yusef, an activist advocating for the rights of Palestinian prisoners, the intimidation and harassment portrayed in Ahed’s interrogation revealed “a textbook example of the interrogation tactics” used to coerce and threaten “Palestinian children who are being prosecuted in both Israeli civil and military courts.” These interrogation techniques, Mr. Yusef elaborated, include the “use of petty violence,” long and exhausting interrogation sessions, verbal threats targeting both children and their parents, and sleep deprivation. According to Ahed’s father, his daughter was subjected to interrogation sessions that lasted for 12 hours. On one occasion, he explained, the teen activist was deprived of 40 hours of sleep before being forced into the routine of harassment and intimidation that characterized her interrogations. Icon of Resistance “The intended effect of these techniques is to break the child’s ability to resist the interrogators, and to provide them with the desired confession or information,” Dawoud Yusef commented. Following the release of the footage, Ahed’s father expressed his pride in his daughter determination to remain silent. For him, her silence is a symbol of Palestinians’ refusal to kowtow to “the occupiers.” He said that the interrogators’ techniques did not succeed in “[breaking] the symbol that Ahed has created through her resistance to the occupation.” “We want to reiterate Ahed’s message and the message of her generation: we are not victims, we are fighters for the freedom of our people… We want to tell mothers and fathers that their children are strong and can confront and fight this occupation,” Baseem said, before concluding that “There is no peace under this occupation and no silence under this occupation.”

Rabat – Munir El Haddadi doesn’t take no for an answer.  The Moroccan-Spanish football player wants to represent Morocco in the 2018 World Cup in Russia at all costs; he appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAS) on Tuesday, according to the French sport media Eurosport. For months, the Royal Moroccan Federation (FRMF) has been attempting to convince International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) to give the 22-year-old international player the right to represent Morocco. However, the FIFA Players’ Status Committee rejected the request of the dual Spanish-Moroccan athlete to play with the Atlas Lions. In response, El Haddadi and the Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) appealed to the CAS. They are hoping the Lausanne-based arbitral tribunal to make a decision “in mid-May,” just one month before the start of the World Cup.  Spain will battle Morocco in the first round, along with other group B competitors, Iran and Portugal. Born to Moroccan parents in Spain, the youngster represented Spain at the youth level and made a brief appearance as a substitute in an international game against Macedonia with the Spanish national team in 2014.  Unfortunately, his substitute appearance ruined his chance to represent the Moroccan national football team, according to the FIFA eligibility committee. El Haddadi currently plays for the Spanish club Alaves, where he is on loan for the 2017-2018 period.

Rabat- Moroccan pop star Saad Lamjarred has been declared absent at the Tribunal of Grande Instance in Paris, ducking his summons from the lawyer of alleged rape victim, Laura Prioul, on April 9.  His court date has been rescheduled for June 4. Last month, Prioul’s lawyer requested a medical expert, aiming to establish a link between the rape she reportedly suffered in October 2016, in Paris and the deterioration of her state of health since. In an opinionated article, Media Part attributed Saad Lamjarred’s absence to “a hangover due to a big anniversary party in the night club l’Arc Paris two nights before the audience.” A video of the Moroccan singer celebrating his birthday while standing next to a bottle of vodka has also been circulating on YouTube. 
In the meantime, Prioul continues her battle against cyber bullying. She has opened up to French television about her constant struggle since filing a complaint against the Moroccan pop singer, reporting the hateful comments she has faced which portray her as the villain of the story on a daily basis.

By Zoubida Senoussi Rabat – Maroc Telecom’s Smart Days have returned for a new round of rich exchanges around the discovery and study of global digital trends. Morocco World News attended the event, alongside researchers, experts, entrepreneurs, web influencers, and journalists, who gathered Tuesday at the Maroc Telecom headquarters in Rabat to learn more about “Digital Transformation in Morocco and Africa.” For this occasion, Maroc Telecom welcomed two renowned international experts to share their knowledge on digital revolution: Gilles Babinet, multi-entrepreneur and the first president of the National Council of Digital in France and Rebecca Enonchong, Cameroonian entrepreneur, and president of AppsTech, a multinational software development company. As the first speaker to take the stage, Babinet discussed challenges faced by African companies since the digital revolution. “We are actually witnessing the third industrial revolution, embodied by the digital transformation, which generates huge gains in opportunities,” explained the expert, adding,  “Several sectors are now affected by this phenomenon such as tourism, hospitality, insurance, finance and even health.”  According to him, the richest companies are those who give their technology for free.The French entrepreneur concluded that we need to “replace hierarchy with technology.” For her part, Enonchong focused on how the digital revolution has transformed Africa, including the regulatory and financial issues that have accompanied digital changes.   “To successfully implement an effective digital transformation model covering all sectors of activity (i.e. public service industries and services, finance, technologies), Africa should rely on its many strengths,” she said. “We can especially quote: the strong mobile breakthrough, the relatively nascent legal provisions governing technologies, and the fast appropriation of technologies” explained the President of AppsTech who is very optimistic for the future of digital in Morocco and Africa. The telecommunications giant, Maroc Telecom, launched its “Smart Days” gathering last year in Rabat to bring together major Moroccan and African players in the field of digitization. The meeting enables the general public to exchange knowledge and learn about the latest developments in the world of technology and communications.

Rabat- The 5th annual Euro-African Ministerial Conference on Migration and Development will take place on May 2, in the ochre city Marrakech. Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation reported in a Monday statement that the event will bring together ministers and high-level representatives from the European Union and Africa, to “rethink the dialogue and define its priorities for the period 2018-2020.” The statement adds that the conference comes as part of the 2006 political commitments of partner countries from North, West, and Central Africa and Europe to build a comprehensive, concerted, and balanced approach on migration management. This high-level conference, which is supported by the current Presidency of the Rabat, will see the adoption of the multi-annual cooperation program, the Marrakech Declaration and Plan of Action.   This new program will extend the current strategic framework of the Rome Program by laying down the political guidelines for the coming years and the modalities of their implementation.

Rabat- Contrary to reports on the supposed uncertainty and instability of Morocco’s construction industry, L’Economiste reported on April 10 that the country’s real estate sector is in fact experiencing a period of thrill and boom, especially given the increasing number of construction projects around the country. Despite some hints of harsh working conditions and delayed payments, the industry as a whole is not seeing/experiencing the bleak and uncertain times observers had projected for its 2018 performances. For L’Economiste, construction projects are booming across the country, which is a signal that there is more room for hope than there is for alarm. While some of these observations are correct, existing data nonetheless cast doubt on an over-optimistic reading of the country’s construction sector, say sources with a good knowledge of Morocco’s real estate market. For example, they pointed out that important shareholders in many ongoing projects of constructing industrial sites are still waiting for the MAD 42 billion that the government promised to inject in those projects. “The government tops the list of worst payers, which sometimes puts the sector in a bad situation, as 80 percent of the sector’s turnover come from public projects,” L’Economiste acknowledged. In addition to delayed payments, some have also pointed to huge delays in the signing contracts or agreements between the government and investors. In 2017, for example, there were genuine prospects of signing and implementing an extensive “contract-program” to overhaul the entire construction sector and rejuvenate its productivity by 2022. If signed, the program would accelerate the sector’s competitiveness by injecting an additional MAD 81 billion in the industry and creating 1.2 million jobs in the long run. The contract remains to be signed, however, and such lapses and protracted delays “impede investments and job security,” the outlet wrote.

Rabat – Morocco’s new Minister of Health, Anas Doukkali, has announced his determination to extend “universal health coverage” to the majority of the population, especially those from low-income backgrounds with low prospects of health insurance. Doukali made the announcement yesterday, during an informal meeting that also served as a belated celebration of the International Health Day (April 7). At the event, the new minister reiterated his department’s ambitious plan to devise and implement a health insurance system to cover approximately 90 percent of the population by 2021. The objective of the plan, said Mr. Doukali, is to make Moroccan healthcare inclusive and supportive of Moroccans from poor and disadvantaged backgrounds. In order to effect such  bold measures to help huge sections of the population, teams in charge of implementing the new system will be working under, and guided by the slogan “Health for All,” the minister noted. For Anas Doukali, as the right to health care provisions is a “universal right,” and establishing an inclusive and affordable system is among the pillars of good governance, inclusive access to health care is also “one the top priorities of decision-makers.” The minister reiterated his determination to keep and rekindle the existing medical assistance program, System of Medical Assistance (RAMED).  RAMED, which has been in use for nearly six years, has been helpful in extending health coverage to over 60 percent of the population. Although these figures are “honorable,” Doukali noted that there still is a lot of work to do in order to establish “an ambitious system, as the national health coverage is still at an embryonic stage.” Doukali explained that the main goal of officials in the health sector will be to boost the responsiveness and effectiveness of RAMED, such that future objectives can be attained in a more timely and efficient manner. RAMED is currently set up to be an outlet through which the government would lend enormous support to those unable to afford health coverage. This new and aspirational assistance system will underpin a belief echoed by the minister that,  “policy and decision-makers are doubly responsible and integral stakeholders in the transformation of their country’s health system.”. In its efforts to meet or satisfy the requirements of the Millennium Development Goals, Morocco will have to integrate and “federate” all the necessary efforts to ensure that its citizens’ “rights to health and well-being” are accorded paramount importance, the minister concluded.

Rabat – For Moroccans, April 9 is a day to remember . The date marks two symbolic events for Morocco: the commemoration of two “historic” visits paid by late King Mohammed V to the cities of the north – Tangier and Tetouan in 1947 and 1956. In 1947, the late Sultan of Morocco traveled to Tangier, where he delivered  a patriotic speech, defying protectorate authorities and emphasizing the Moroccan people’s attachment to their country’s territorial integrity. In his speech, given in the Mendoubia Gardens of Tangier before the representatives of the colonizing authorities in Tangier, the late King clearly articulated the will of the Moroccan people to recover their independence. He delivered the same message on April 10, at the Great Mosque of Tangier, calling on the nation to remain committed to the precepts of Islam, emphasizing the anchoring position of Morocco to the Arab-Islamic world. Ten years later in 1956, Sultan Mohammed V  travelled to Tetouan on April 9, where he announced the independence and unification of the North and South of Morocco. The declaration followed the return of the Sultan, after a stay in Spain, where he had held negotiations for Morocco’s independence. On April 7, 1956,  the declaration and an annexed protocol under which Madrid recognized the independence of Morocco and its sovereignty over its entire territory was signed.  Commemorating the royal visit of the late Sultan, the High Commissioner for resistance veterans and members of the Liberation Army described the visit as a break between two eras: that of the struggle waged by the Royal Palace and the pioneers of the National Movement against the the French Protectorate and that of the claim of the right of Morocco to its independence before the international community. Colonial authorities stood against the aspirations of the King and Moroccan people, territorial integrity and the attachment values. However, the colonizers could not deter the Sultan and the resistance army’s determination towards their main goals: freedom and independence. Mohammed V’s visits to the northern cities demonstrated the unity of Morocco and marked the opportunity for the nation to claim its freedom and sovereignty loud and clear, according to the High Commissioner. The visits also demonstrated the activism of Moroccans and their mobilization behind the late King to defend the integrity and sovereignty of Morocco. Both events represent a call for Moroccans to do their utmost to defend Morocco’s territorial integrity and preserve the historical facts of Morocco’s resistance against protectorate powers.

Rabat – French President Emmanuel Macron received King Mohammed VI in an official visit at the Elysee Palace on Tuesday afternoon.  A YouTube video published by a fan reveals King Mohammed VI processing across the courtyard of the Elysee, accompanied by royal fanfare.  At the palace entrance, the King is greeted by Macron, and the two enter the palace together. The two leaders last met at the One Planet Summit on climate change in Paris in December 2017. This is King Mohammed VI’s first official appearance since he underwent a heart surgery in late February in Paris.  The King’s official meeting with his French counterpart comes amid increasing tension in southern Morocco as a result of Polisario’s incursions in the buffer zone, east of Morocco’s defense well, as well as its attempts to change the status quo of the region through the transfer and establishment of part of its militias and its so-called “Ministry of Defense” to the area west of Morocco’s defense wall. France is Morocco’s chief ally and its staunchest proponent in the Security Council negotiations regarding the Western Sahara territorial dispute. As such, it has repeatedly expressed its support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for the Sahara, which it considers the “most appropriate” to helping the parties to the dispute to reach a mutually acceptable political solution.   Later this month, the United Security Council will adopt a new resolution to renew the mandate of the UN mission in the territory for one year, and Morocco will certainly count on France to support its efforts aimed at pushing the UN body to adopt a strong resolution  to end Polisario’s attempts to change the status quo of the buffer zone.

There are various traditions concerning the origin of this celebration; however, in recent years, the celebration has gained in popularity among Ashkenazi Jews around the world – thanks to the large Moroccan Jewish communities – and the festive nature of the celebration. Although currently, the Jewish community in Morocco numbers no more than 5000, the tradition remains vibrant. Furthermore, thanks to the educational efforts of the student-run Mimouna Association, Muslim student groups in various universities across the country are starting to rediscover and enjoy the tradition. In the United States, Mimouna likewise has been picking up steam in the last few years. Indeed, there is now even an app, that allows people interested in participating in a celebration to connect to Moroccan Jewish hosts. There is likewise no shortage of articles covering celebrations all over the country, even in cities where Moroccan Jewish communities are relatively small. The interfaith, intercultural, appeal of the holiday is only part of the story; the truth is, there is no shortage of interfaith efforts that go on year around. Yet Mimouna remains distinct and special; it is touched by magic. Precisely because the holiday is specifically Moroccan, rather than yet another generic effort at the Jewish-Muslim dialogue among American communities, many of which are not in touch with their ethnic or religious identities, there is the appeal of a long history and tradition of the holiday. The question on everyone’s mind of course is: “How did the Moroccans manage to do it so organically, without having to rely on endless lectures on the importance of coexistence and interfaith dialogue?” Indeed, for a nation where citizens of different religious and ethnicities live harmoniously side by side, sharing delicious food, and similar tastes in music and fun, seems like the most natural thing in the world. For communities, which  live far apart from each other, and which have never shared such experiences to begin with, the continuity of Mimouna may appear mysterious, even miraculous. The Jewish communities in Morocco themselves, however, enjoyed continuity for several understandable reasons. The more ancient community of the Jewish Amazigh shares the same dialects and customs with their Muslim counterparts, and indeed, at times appears indistinguishable. The highly educated Sephardic Jews, fleeing the Spanish Inquisition in the 1492, and who found a safe haven in Morocco, led distinct cultural lives from their Southern brethren; however, in the end, they likewise became a significant part of the culture. Morocco, located at the intersection of three continent, has always been a bridge of different cultures and religions. For that reason, coexistence and tolerance of various backgrounds came naturally; most Moroccans of any background prided themselves on being cosmopolitan and open-minded, frequently knowing multiple languages, and being involved in trade and other activities that made them particularly worldly. Moreover, the King has traditionally maintained a connection with the Jewish community, historically interjecting on their behalf in the instances of anti-Jewish episodes. The King would also traditionally have a position for an adviser of Jewish background. King Mohammed VI is no exception; his counselor Andre Azoulay, in addition to his financial background, is also known for his cultural patronage and support for interfaith projects. Likewise, Morocco’s new constitution specifically includes its Jewish heritage as part of the country’s identity, and offers it distinct recognition and protection. Likewise, when the king undertakes personal projects, such as the restoration of the country’s 167 Jewish cemeteries, this example sends a signal to the rest of the country, about the importance of respect for different faiths, and for collegiality among neighbors, despite whatever differences – and because of them. Indeed, Morocco is both uniquely situated, due to its inherent diversity, and important role as an intercultural bridge – and specifically led in the direction of coexistence. Mimouna arose as a result of these conditions, and Morocco’s history and paths. Such celebrations are possible due to concerted efforts of many generations to continue to learn about each other’s cultures and respect each other’s traditions – and even enjoy them, without sacrificing one’s own distinct identity and religion. Morocco’s protections for its various groups have been stronger than many, if not to say, most other countries’, historically, not because it was a complete melting pot of assimilated peoples with no strong cultural heritage, but precisely because its citizens have always retained a strong connection to their own communities, while fully embracing a larger national identity and destiny. To be sure, none of these developments have been straightforward or easy. With the creation of the State of Israel, the majority of the Moroccan Jewish community left the country. Others looked for better financial opportunities in France and the United States. With the dwindling Jewish communities scattered among several cities in Morocco, retaining Jewish customs have been increasingly difficult, and for a while, it seemed like they were at a risk of being forgotten. At the same time, extremist influences from the outside started penetrating Morocco, and battling these ideological influences, which promote bigotry and hatred, has been a major priority, but also a struggle. Likewise, the Middle Eastern media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict created the potential for additional tension, seeking to inflame passions rather than to inform diverse perspectives on the unfolding events from 1948 onwards. Through it all, however, Morocco never became a tyrannical dictatorship like Syria and Iraq under Ba’ath party. Jews who have left the country retained their Moroccan citizenship. Many of them, and their descendants, return regularly to Morocco for pilgrimages to religious sites, or to visit remaining family and friends. Increasingly, there looks to be potential for future educational exchanges, and Jewish students coming to spend a semester learning in Moroccan universities. The country is ripe for investments and opportunities, and being Jewish is not an obstacles. Whether or not some portion of Jews with Moroccan roots will ever return to live in Morocco remains uncertain; however, the constant flow of observant and exploring Jews with a strong connection to their roots and national heritage keeps traditions like Mimouna from dying out. It is in fact the inherently MOroccan element that makes it so strongly rooted and compelling to everyone who partakes on it on an annual basis. In the United States, by contrast, the holiday seems to have taken on a life of its own.  Besides the fact that most of the American Jewish population is Ashkenazi, and most of the Moroccan communities are concentrated in several big cities, the popular appeal of the holiday is growing even outside the traditional circles.  Cultural exploration is a wonderful antidote to the accusations of cultural appropriations; the more people learn about Mimouna and the special Moroccan heritage, the better it is for everyone. However, the question is – what happens if the holiday is adopted by groups with separate agendas, not interested in learning about or promoting Moroccan culture and values of tolerance, but rather, content with spreading generic messages, or utilizing the holiday which has been an achievement of many centuries of communal cultural advances, to facilitate soulless and bland imitations? What if Mimouna, thanks to the disinterest and utilitarianism of cynical self-promoters, is sucked dry of its cultural attributes to become yet another stab at multi-culti interfaith efforts, which mean nothing and everything at the same time? Worse yet, if Mimouna is popularized as nothing more than just another opportunity for Jewish-Muslim dialoguing,  and its background and history are forgotten, will this not go a long way towards cheapening the value and meaning of the holiday, and in fact, being destructive towards the way the holiday’s message is interpreted? Not only Morocco may end up being denied its own cultural heritage, but Mimouna may become so universalized that it eventually becomes nothing more than another commercial occasion for thoughtless get togethers and partying, actually putting off, rather than attracting, potential participants. In response to first signs of such eventuality, evidenced by groups seeking to host Mimouna with only a hint of “Moroccan flavor” (and no real interest in Jews, Moroccans, or the heart of its traditions),  Moroccan Americans in New York, led with admirable alacrity towards putting it all together on short notice by its founder and president Simo Elaissaoui,  set out to infuse Mimouna, its first event ever, with the depth of Moroccan spirit. Despite being planned as a small private event, it attracted a diverse crowd of Moroccan Muslims and Jews of assorted backgrounds to a lovely restaurant called Bab Marrakech in Brooklyn.  The attendees partook in a delicious authentic Moroccan dinner, followed by the inevitable sweet tea and traditional holiday desserts. The biggest attraction of the memorable occasion was Innov Gnawa, a Grammy-nominated “Moroccan blues” group based in the US, which plays traditional Jewish-themed gnawa music, along with Itamar Borukhov, a Bukharan Israeli musician, who is considered to be one of the most famous jazz performers in the world. They were quite a treat, and had the whole restaurant either dancing or filming the whole experience on video. Some participants, filled with joyous Moroccan fervor, even jumped on the chairs, where they continued dancing. The crowd danced like no one was watching (though everyone actually was) and had fun like the holiday would never end. It achieved exactly what it was supposed to do – brought people together to engage in a positive and uplifting experience, while exposing the newcomers to an unforgettable reflection of Moroccan spirit and identity. Because there is an interest and dedication towards preserving the authenticity of the holiday (as well as giving credit where it’s due), the appeal of the holiday for what it is – a lively, slightly crazy, occasion to fist and rejoice in the end of a somber reflective period – is bound to carry on, grow in numbers and scale, and by next year, attract more people than ever before, not to participate in meaningless symbolic gestures, but to get a taste of the real Morocco, discover something new, and hopefully come back for more.

Rabat – Hundreds of Sahrawis have reportedly fled the Tindouf camps in Algeria, escaping alleged murder threats from Polisario supporters in the region. The threats come in response to Sahrawi condemnation of the recent Polisario Front escalations east Morocco’s defense wall. Moroccan newspapers Assabah reported on Tuesday that hundreds of Sahrawis fled the Tindouf camps for fear of being murdered due to their activism against the separatist ideologies in Mahbes, Tifariti, Bir Lahlou and Guerguerat, where illegal Polisario facilities have been located. Polisario has been continuously attempting to relocate their facilities to restricted zones since last year. According to the news source, Algeria has been pushing the separatist group to punish anyone with ideologies opposed to the Polisario’s political stance. Polisario did not hide its intention to get rid of Sahrawis who contest their illegal aspirations.  Bachir Mustapha Sayed, a representative of the front, claimed that Sahrawis who would challenge Polisario deserve to be punished without “mercy or sympathy.” “Anybody who splinters from the Polisario, or seeks to establish a new organization will deserve no mercy or sympathy from our side, nor appreciation of his idea,” Sayed said. In March, a group of Sahrawis in the Polisario-administered Tindouf camps launched a campaign to denounce the unbearable living conditions imposed on the inhabitants. The movement, “Sahrawi Initiative for Change,” aims at defying the “archaism” and the “mummification” of the Polisario’s leadership, who have been accused of total detachment from the reality of the camps. The movement pushes for a radical change in approach to find a solution to the crisis that the Sahrawi populations in Tindouf have suffered for more than four decades. The movement’s founders have also released a statement asking the camp population to support them massively and openly in order to defy the separatist group, which has been accused of illegal embezzlement and resale of humanitarian aid on the black market, according to Al Ahdath Al Maghribia.

Rabat- Steve Nacim was apprehended by the FBI in New Jersey on March 23, 2018, after successfully evading capture for 16 years in his native Morocco. He faces charges in a United States court of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, bank fraud, and conspiracy to commit bank fraud worth USD 2.8 million (about MAD 25,677 million). Nacim, 50, returned to the US last month, where he is a naturalized citizen, and handed himself over to the authorities.  Following a federal arrest warrant issued on July 31, 2002, by the United States District Court of Newark, New Jersey, Nacim fled to Morocco. The FBI maintained tabs on Nacim during the intervening years, reminding him that he would still face charges in the US if he ever  returned. The US and Morocco do not have an extradition treaty, making it impossible for US authorities to apprehend him in Morocco. “Over the years we had contact with him to remind him he was still wanted in the US,” said FBI special agent Ed Koby to NJ.com.  On the day of Nacim’s arrest, the FBI operating in Newark took to Twitter to share the suspect’s profile. @FBINewark arrested fugitive Steven Nacim who was wanted since 2002 for wire and bank fraud. pic.twitter.com/EBLHeEBVXk — FBI Newark (@FBINewark) March 23, 2018  The FBI website also released a brief statement the same day, reviewing the charges against Nacim and reminding the public, “that indictments contain only allegations of criminal misconduct and that defendants are presumed to be innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.” Nacim was believed to be a part of a larger criminal syndicate, Middle Eastern Criminal Enterprise (MECE). He, along with several accomplices, ran Computer 3000, a company that worked between New Jersey and Casablanca, Morocco.  Nacim is accused of using fraudulent cheques to purchase computer equipment and electronics, which were subsequently shipped to Morocco. Computer 3000 targeted and defrauded small businesses, so its illegal activities would be more difficult to detect.  Allegedly, Nacim operated with two accomplices: Mohamed El Cohen, 46, and Abdesslem Reda El Cohen, 37, both of whom are at large believed to be in Morocco, according to the Daily Mail. “I want to thank the hard-working special agents and law enforcement officials who have been involved with this investigation over the past 16 years,” stated Acting Special Agent in Charge Bradley W. Cohen of the FBI. “Their unwaning efforts and dedication led to the arrest of Mr. Nacim which will now allow for the criminal justice process to continue in this case.”

Rabat- To condemn Polisario’s actions in the east of Morocco’s defense wall, members of political parties and cabinet officials signed the Laayoune Declaration on Monday, April 9, as part of their meeting in the southern city Laayoune, at the request of Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. Laayoune hosted demonstrations on Sunday and Monday, bringing together leaders of political parties, MPs, elected officials, Cheikhs (tribal leaders), dignitaries and Sahrawi leader-activists, with the aim of showing their mobilization behind the government and their resolve to defend their country’s territorial integrity.  In the Laayoune Declaration, the signatories laud the leadership and the policies led by King Mohammed VI in defense of Morocco’s territorial integrity and inalienable rights at all levels. In addition, the declaration highlights the plans for sustainable economic development and regionalization that will benefit the provinces.  The signatories also commend international support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan and call on the UN and the international community to act in response to Polisario provocation, in order to maintain security and stability in the region.  Here follows the full text of the Declaration of Laayoune:  “Reflecting the firm, lasting and renewed national consensus of all the components of the Moroccan people, the various political bodies, the representative institutions and the forces of society in the defense of the unity of our homeland and its territorial integrity and in countering any and all machinations aimed at harming the sovereignty on any part of our country from Tangier to Lagouira;  Taking into consideration the great concerns at the sovereignty, political and popular level regarding the developments of the question of the Moroccan Sahara, especially the actions of the separatist front that must be confronted with the required determination, firmness and vigilance with regard to the areas of our country located east and south of the security wall in the so-called ‘buffer zones,’ which our country has voluntarily, and in a sovereign decision, placed under MINURSO control in response to the international community’s desire under the 1991 Ceasefire Agreement, to remain empty in order to avoid direct contact with Algeria;  Based on the national responsibility in defending our national unity and territorial integrity as one of the firm constants that unite the Moroccan people; and being aware of our historical and political responsibility during these delicate circumstances that require concerted efforts, unified ranks and uniting around the supreme interest of the country, we, the political parties of our country, are happy to meet here in the steadfast and emerging city of Laayoune in this national mobilisation meeting, which includes many of our leaders, high-ranking members, and MPs and territorial collectivities’ elected officials, and all other organizational bodies and activists in the Kingdom’s provinces and regions, especially the region of Laayoune-Sakia-Lhamra and Dakhla-Oued-Eddahab;  In full awareness and unwavering determination, the leaders of parties, the parliamentarians, the elected officials, the elders, the dignitaries and the many leader activists from the Sahara, addressing the national, regional, continental and international public opinion, they:  1. Condemn and reject the machinations and actions carried out by the enemies of our territorial integrity at all levels, especially the recent acts of hostility by the Polisario aiming to create a new reality through attempting to transfer some of their civilian and military elements from Lahmada, in Algeria — and with the encouragement of this latter — to the buffer zones, in flagrant violation of the cease-fire agreement and in total ignorance of the will of the United Nations and Security Council resolutions; 2. Commend the leadership steps and the wise policies led by His Majesty the King, may God glorify Him, in defense of our inalienable rights at all levels, praise the tenor of His Majesty’s message to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the latest developments in the region and note with pride the successes of His Majesty the King at the continental and international levels, in such a way that strengthens the position of our country in the continent and worldwide and protect its territorial integrity. 3. Commend the national consensus in the face of these provocations, a consensus that translates the awareness and vigilance of the Moroccan people against the maneuvers of the enemies, and that affirm that we are all determined to confront any machinations aimed to change the current and historical situation of these regions; 4. Draw the attention of the United Nations to the necessity to avoid complacency towards these provocative actions, and to deal with them in accordance with the responsibility of maintaining security and stability — which we share with the UN the keenness to ensure in our region — and call on MINURSO, and through it the international community, to take firm, resolute and deterrent measures to force the Polisario to withdraw from these areas and to remove all manifestations of their attempts to create a new reality in the region; 5. Reaffirm attachment to the peaceful, political and lasting solution agreed upon under the auspices of the United Nations being the sole framework to seek a solution that guarantees the protection of the rights of our country and the maintenance of peace in our region; 6. Considering that the only option to end this artificial conflict lies in the autonomy plan under Moroccan sovereignty proposed by the Kingdom as a framework for negotiation, which the international community has described as serious and credible, and which continues to receive the support of a growing number of countries; 7. Urge the international community to act in order to put an end to the suffering of our brothers who are held against their will in Lahmada camps, away from their land and their families in tragic circumstances and in complete deprivation the most basic human rights, and call on the international community to pressure Algeria and the Polisario to enable the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to conduct a census according to international standards; 8. Commending the patriotic feelings and loyalty towards the allegiance ties and the Alaoui Throne as well as to His Majesty the King, may God glorify Him, shown by the populations of these provinces, their elders and tribes. Also commending their positive and efficient contribution to the political, democratic, and development processes under way, in our country. Thanks to this dynamic, these provinces have become an essential pillar in edifying this new and modern Morocco, through their endeavours within the territorial communes, parliament, and different chambers. According to the Minurso census they constitute the majority of the populations of the Sakiat Al Hamra and Oued Dahab provinces. They indeed and realistically are the true representatives of the will of the citizens in these provinces. A will they have expressed many times in elections the transparency of which has been attested to nationally and internationally. To be commended as well the positive role played by the civil and human rights societies, in these regions, in social development, and the defense of the territorial integrity nationally and internationally. 9. Expressing pride towards the multidimensional progress in these provinces that will embark on an even more sustainable such dynamic thanks to the development model initiated by His Majesty the King, may God glorify Him. These provinces will thus become an economic hub that will serve as a pioneering model of integrated development in this part of the kingdom, through a more sustainable use of its natural resources. The local populations will be the main beneficiary of such a dynamic in a context of confidence in the future. 10. The necessity to put the southern provinces at the forefront of the advanced regionalization and to hasten this process with the aim of achieving autonomy of these provinces. 11. The necessity to consolidate the official diplomacy and the popular one led by political parties, parliament, trade unions, NGOs, and the business community in order to strengthen coordination and diversify the communication channels with different counterparts, and influential decision makers, notably in Europe, the United States, Asia and Africa. 12. Renew commitment to bank on our parties relations with different counterparts in brotherly and friendly countries with the aim to set up influential groups supporting our countries interests and thwarting adversarial theses. 13. Condemning yet again the Algerian regime’s hand behind this artificial issue and its continuation while mobilizing all its resources to harm our country regionally, in the African continent and internationally. We regret the Algerian regime’s lack of positive response to our country’s call, expressed by His Majesty the King and the political parties, to clear the atmosphere between our two countries in the best interests of our two peoples. We thus invite anew our brothers in Algeria to depart from yesterday’s conundrums and reminisce the otherwise shining moments of our common fight away from the Cold war aftermath that has borne this artificial conflict in our region. Its repercussions thwart the edification of the Maghreb Arab as much as it hinders progress and cooperation between our two brotherly countries. 14. Strengthening the internal front in terms of democracy, development and socially by encouraging the endeavours of all parties and components of our society to pursue the mobilization and vigilance in order to uncover all maneuvers hatched by our country’s enemies. 15. Setting a political front to defend our territorial integrity that has been and always will be a point of unanimous popular consensus and mobilization out of loyalty to the history and in deference to the martyrs, as well as to the eternal Al Massira sermon. The challenges and misdeeds of the enemies will only strengthen our resolve.”

By Mark Mahon Rabat-William Penn once said, “Avoid popularity; it has many snares and no real benefit.” Penn was a Quaker and the colonial era founder of the city of Philadelphia. He didn’t have the opportunity to live tweet his travels but perhaps he knew the drawbacks of fame even in the late 1600s. Facebook announced last week that the personal data of about 87 million users was shared with the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Some 300,000 people had installed the This Is Your Digital Life quiz that had made the data harvesting possible. Alas, there is a cost to something that is “free.” Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, along with personal blog websites allow us to tell our stories to a larger and larger audience. Fundraising platforms like Kickstarter allow us to fund our dreams, from building a school library to funding the filming of a self-made movie. The website CaringBridge allows us to follow the medical condition and recovery of friends and family members. We can connect instantaneously to colleagues across the globe. But how much is too much? If we’re mad at Facebook for letting us down by allowing a third-party firm to aggregate details of our lives shouldn’t we be disappointed in our own role in facilitating the whole affair? For young adults and teens, social media platforms on mobile devices are the go-to avocation throughout the day. Data from 2015 indicated that teenage Americans spent about nine hours a day using digital media, from watching online music videos to gaming to social media browsing. 2017 data for Morocco indicates that about 21 million Moroccans access the internet via mobile devices, a dramatic rise in just the past five years. Back in 2014, survey data collected from 1,000 Moroccans indicated that a majority (53%) spent at least four hours per day using the internet. The mobile device is fast eclipsing the living room TV. My space over shared space.  Facebook has the most daily active users compared to other social networks. The company’s $40.6 billion in sales in 2017 came overwhelmingly from advertising revenue. So how the company’s advertisers react to the data breach affair will be interesting to observe in the coming months. Happier of Not? A recent study from San Diego State University utilized data from over one million 8th, 10th, and 12th-graders in the U.S. The research indicated teens that spent more time on social media platforms, or gaming and texting, were not as emotionally happy as teens who spent equivalent amounts of time engaged in sports or other activities centered on direct person-to-person interactions. Another study funded by the Centers for Disease Control found that the life satisfaction and self-esteem of teenagers fell dramatically after 2012, paralleling the significant growth in mobile phone access among teens and young adults. In 2015, a social media usage report was presented at the Arab Social Media Influencers Summit. Seven thousand respondents over age 15 across the Arab world were surveyed. Results showed the ambivalent feelings concerning social media. 57 percent of respondents agreed with the phrase, “Social media made me a happier person.” But only 44 percent agreed with the phrase, “I trust social media.” Everything in Moderation In a 2017 interview, Moroccan singer, composer and social herald Saida Fikri noted the often vacuous nature of online content that attracts the attention of young Moroccans: “Our youth live in a fake fame: videos clips with rented cars and too many lies that have nothing to do with their reality.” A wisdom that is relevant to young and old who access social media to connect with friends or to experience a different reality that somehow seems more exciting than our own. The trend is for even more digital media usage. The Global Digital Report 2018 estimated the number of social media users worldwide in 2017 at 3.2 billion, up 13 percent from 2016. In response to the data harvesting crisis, Facebook founder and chief Mark Zuckerberg articulated a vital point that is as relevant to people who access social media tools as it is to corporate officers in the digital media industry. “That we’re not just building tools, but that we need to take full responsibility for the outcomes of how people use those tools as well.” Striking a balance between the natural urge to engage with other humans and the need to better scrutinize those who have the ability to access our personal lives will require discipline on a higher level by everyone involved. Facebook reportedly now has about 15,000 people working on security, third-party compliance and content review issues for the company. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before the U.S. House Commerce Committee on April 11 and before a U.S. Senate joint committee later this week. Countless social media users will be viewing live coverage or receiving news updates of his testimony via Twitter, or perhaps on Facebook. An update worth receiving.

Rabat – French Montana is expanding his repertoire. The Moroccan rapper, songwriter, actor and philanthropist is set to launch his first clothing collection with Moroccan influences. The 33-year-old artist has created 65 Morocco-inspired pieces for the British brand BoohoMan which will be available on its website on April 12. The brand-new collection will feature “bold tropical and leopard prints, influenced by both the Mediterranean and Moroccan cultures”, according to The Daily Mail. Montana’s will offers basics like tracksuits and fashion-forward t-shirts, with clothing prices will ranging from GBP 10 to 60. Beside his undeniable love for fashion, Montana has been busy doing what he loves more than anything: music.  The artist has been working on a new track called “Corazon” for Maître Gims’ new album, featuring the Congolese rapper himself and rap sensation Lil Wayne. Last month, the Moroccan-American hip hop recording artist opened up about his volunteer work in Uganda, where he helped the associations Mama Hope and Global Citizen to improve the citizen health situation. During his time, he visited a hospital where he met woman and children without healthcare.  “God was giving me signs that I had to do something to help these people,” he said.  With the help of superstars P. Diddy and The Weeknd, he raised over $500,000 to benefit the Suubi Health Center. Montana continues his service in his hometown Casablanca, through his work with the PanAfrican Movement and CARE Morocco, which ensures that the children of Casablanca have full access to a quality education and healthcare.

Rabat -A picture worth more than a thousand words. If this saying were to be applied to anything situation today, it could apply to the relations between Morocco and Saudi Arabia. In recent weeks, millions of Moroccans grew wary of and frustrated with Saudi Arabia after Turki Al Sheikh, chairman of the Saudi General Sports Authority, expressed his support to the United 2026 World Cup bid. A picture showing Al Sheikh with Carlos Cordeiro, the president of the United States Soccer (footabll) Federation, earlier this month came to reinforce the feeling that Saudi Arabia was perhaps mulling to turn its back on Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid and support the US-led bid. ?? ????? pic.twitter.com/KbXMcJlw8K — Saad Hariri (@saadhariri) April 9, 2018  Millions of Moroccans believed that Saudi Arabia’s new leadership is retaliating against Morocco following its decision to remain neutral in the ongoing Gulf crisis pitting Qatar against Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt. However, the picture showing King Mohammed VI along with Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman and Lebanese Prime Minister, Saad Hariri, in Paris comes as a reminder that relations between Morocco and Saudi Arabia are much deeper than many analysts can grasp and they are strong enough to overcome any misunderstandings that may occur between the two long-standing allies. The picture comes to clear all the doubts and misgivings that have clouded the relations between Morocco and Saudi Arabia since the outset of the Gulf crisis last June, and signals that Saudi Arabia is not ready to give up on its privileged and intergenerational relations with Morocco. The timing of the picture might also give a glimmer of hope about the prospect that Morocco can play a significant role in bridging the gap between Qatar and its neighbors and put an end to the Gulf crisis.

By Sarah Goodman  Rabat – Viktor Orbán claimed victory in Hungary’s general election on Sunday, April 8, solidifying his third term as the nation’s prime minister. Preliminary figures suggest that his far-right party, Fidesz, also won a strong majority in the Hungarian parliament. Fidesz won 133 of parliament’s 199 seats in Sunday’s election. With 97 percent of the votes counted (aside from those cast absentee), the party stands poised to reclaim the two-thirds majority it won in the country’s previous two elections, as well as the necessary number to ratify amendments to Hungary’s constitution. Moreover, such strong political support strengthens Orbán’s hand when negotiating with the European Union. This is the third successive term for Orbán, who first took office in 2010; he is the longest-serving Hungarian prime minister since democracy was restored to Hungary in 1990, following the exit of the Soviet forces. Despite recent success at the polls, Orbán remains one of the most controversial heads of state in Europe. Far from being hailed as a stalwart of democracy, both he and his party have been mired in corruption allegations and scandal.  The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which monitored the April 8 election, released a public statement affirming that the election was “professional and transparent,” while noting that “intimidating and xenophobic rhetoric, media bias and opaque campaign financing constricted the space for genuine political debate, hindering voters’ ability to make a fully-informed choice.” Outside the Fidesz headquarters in the Hungarian capital Budapest, Fidesz party supporters celebrated, singing anthems and waving flags. Orbán joined his supports in song, before proclaiming it a “great day for Hungary.” He claimed mordantly there would yet be “a big fight ahead” and that his election victory was an opportunity to defend Hungary’s borders. Indeed, talk of the Hungarian border dominated the nation’s 2018 election. Although dissatisfaction with health services and the education system simmered in the background, Orbán and Fidesz cast immigration as the decisive issue.  Although Muslims comprise merely 0.4 percent of the total Hungarian population, both Orbán and Fidesz routinely reference the ostensible threat posed by the “Muslim invaders.”  Orbán has emerged as one Europe’s most outspoken critics of migration, and is known for his hard-line policies toward men, women, and children seeking asylum in the European Union. However, Orbán’s caustic rhetoric long predates the most recent election cycle: in March 2017, AFP reported that Orbán emphasized “preserving ethnic homogeneity” as a key component of Hungary’s economic success. In February 2018, Orbán called on the EU to reimburse Hungary for the cost of securing its borders, claiming to be “not only protecting [Hungary], but Europe as well.” Earlier this year, Hungary came under fire from the United Nations for peddling “xenophobia and racist rhetoric.” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein admonished the Hungarian Prime Minister by name at a summit in February. Yet despite external pressure from outside groups, Orbán’s consolidation of political power for a third successive term seems unlikely to effect a change of tone.  The 2017 French, Dutch, and German elections all seemingly bucked the populist groundswell credited with inspiring Brexit and buoying Donald Trump into the White House a year earlier.  However, conservative victories during the 2018 Italian election in March and over the weekend in Hungary suggest that the anti-immigrant, anti-European Union season has not yet run its course.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat- Leading a delegation of political parties and cabinet officials amid demonstrations in the southern city of Laayoune, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has called for unified response  from all political parties, in the face of the separatists’ provocations.  Political parties, cabinet members, and civil society groups all gathered on Monday in Laayoune, lead by El Othmani, to denounce the Polisario Front’s illegal maneuvers in restricted zone east of the Moroccan defense wall and corresponding violations of 1991 ceasefire agreement. Opening the meeting, El Othmani praised Laayoune, and its  “blessed presence of its tribal, political, civil and economic institutions.” Throughout the meeting, El Othmani reiterated that Morocco stands firm against the provocations manifested by members of the separatist group, emphasizing that the meeting, with its focus on the territorial integrity of the region, united across political parties and civil society groups, is “the right response to Polisario’s provocations and manoeuvres in the buffer zone.” “[The meeting]is a strong message that insinuates territorial integrity as a national consensus,” El Othmani insisted and added that “Morocco declares to the entire world that we are one front on a transparent national mission.” “The battle is ours and we are all in one trench. Armed and guided by the leadership of his majesty the King, we will march with poise and foresight.”  El Othmani stressed that it is the responsibility of all citizen to defend the country’s territorial integrity and dispel Polisario’s attempts to spread the fake news about Morocco. Moreover, “Morocco condemns the desperate attempts shown by separatists who wish to secure their foothold in the [buffer zone].” At last Thursday’s weekly cabinet meeting, El Othmani stated that Morocco has “sounded the alarm” about the violations that Polisario has committed and possible violations in other regions particularly Tifariti and Bir Lahlou.

Rabat – Finland has opened the trial of Moroccan asylum seeker and alleged radical Islamist, Abderrahman Bouanane, who is responsible for stabbing two people to death and leaving eight others injured in Turku, southwestern Finland, on August 18, 2017.   The defendant was led to a provisional courtroom in a Turku prison on Monday, to face charges of two accounts of terror-related murder and eight accounts of attempted murder with terror-related motives, reported the Associated Press.  According to the same source, police authorities declared in February that Bouanane is an Islamic State’s sympathizer, whose crimes were “motivated largely by hatred after heavy bombardments by the Western-led coalition in Syria.” The Finnish National Bureau of Investigation revealed in August that Bounane, 23 years old, falsely identified himself as a 17-year-old Abdelrahman Mashkah, upon his arrival to Finland in 2016 and sought asylum as an unaccompanied minor.  During his first hearing in August, Bouanane confessed, from his hospital bed, to carrying out the attacks, but denied having any lethal intentions or terrorist motivations in mind.  “(My client) admits to manslaughter and injuries. But based on what the investigator has presented thus far, the crime was not necessarily with terrorist intent,” said Bouanane’s lawyer, Kaarle Gummerus, during the first hearing.  These crimes are believed to be the first terror-related attacks in Finland. The Finnish intelligence service received a tip-off earlier in 2017 regarding the alleged attacker’s religious radicalization. However, Bouanane, who had no previous criminal record in Finland, was not in the service’s list of the 350 people monitored in the terrorism prevention program.  If proven guilty, Bouanane could spend a lifetime in jail, as sought by the prosecutors.

Rabat – Morocco’s Head of Government and Secretary General of the Justice and Development Party (PJD), Saad Eddine El Othmani, reiterated Morocco’s firm determination to face the “unacceptable provocations” and incursions perpetrated by the Polisario east of the Moroccan defense wall, including Guerguerat, Bir Lahlou, and Mahbes. Speaking at the opening of the party’s regional congress at the end of the week in Beni Mellal, El Othmani said that “Morocco categorically rejects the policy of the fait accompli that the separatists vainly try to impose in this area as well as the violations committed at Bir Lahlou, Tifariti and Guergarate.” El Othmani recalled, in this regard, the written statement of King Mohammed VI to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The monarch was keen to express, on behalf of all national forces, “Morocco’s firm and resolute rejection of these provocations and unacceptable incursions.” These provocations constitute a threat to the cease-fire and a violation of international law and United Nations resolutions, as well as seriously undermine the political process carries out under the auspices of the United Nations. The Moroccan official called for the mobilization of the government and all national forces behind King Mohammed VI to defend Morocco’s territorial integrity. Commenting on the economic and social aspects, El Othmani reviewed the efforts made to promote sustainable and integrated development that benefits all regions of Morocco, while highlighting the particularities and the potential of the Beni Mellal-Khénifra region. The regional secretary of the party, Abdellah Moussa emphasized, for his part, the importance of the active participation of citizens in political life to achieve the intended objectives related to the improvement of socio-economic development conditions, the consolidation of democracy, and the rule of law.

Rabat – The first round of the race-hard-or-go-home championship, the 2018 World Touring Car Cup (WTCR), clocked out in Marrakech on Sunday, with Gabriele Tarquini taking home the ultimate victory. During the first race on Saturday, 25 pilots competed under the names of the brightest auto manufacturers in the world, including Honda, Audi, Volkswagen, Seat, Alfa Romeo and Hyundai.  After 20 laps of intense focus and tension, Gabriele Tarquini from the Hyundai team, managed to take the lead with a 1.338-second lead on his teammate Thed Bjork. Rob Huff from the Volkswagen team finished 3rd, 2.823-seconds behind Tarquini. The Moroccan driver, Mehdi Bennani, raced with the fabulous Volkswagen Hatchback Golf GTI, unfortunately not performing as expected; he finished 9th, 15.025 seconds behind the first-place pilot. The second race was a bit more competitive, with the opening race winner comes at the last position, while hometown favorite Mehdi Bennani came in second, just 0.890 seconds behind of Jean-Karl Vernay. Tarquini made a great comeback during the third race, again placing first, ahead of his team-mate Yvan Muller. Meanwhile, Bennani finsihed sixth. The home hero Bennani maintained his positivity and ambition, promising better results in the upcoming races. “It’s a very good result to start with,” said Bennani, adding, “we need something very strong to start the championship and to start with a podium and points means we can be there and we will be fighting. “It was very tough for sure because I started a bit in the middle for both [Sunday] races but I tried to manage not to have big contact, for sure we had some small contact, but I can finish the race and I can score points and keep fighting.” Bennani continued by thanking his fans for their support and trust, and by offering them his second-place win as a token of gratitude for their encouragement.“It was very good because this is the only way I can thank people for trusting in me and to support me from here and far away. I am very happy that I can give them a little bit of thanks with this second position and I hope it’s going to be better and better during the year.” The event was marked by Hyundai’s first appearance as a circuit racing sponsor, entering into one of the fastest-growing categories in motorsport. The newbie has shown great performances so far, as evidenced by its great results during the races, topping off the first three places of the WTCR’s third race with its all new Hyundai I30 N. The next scheduled races will be hosted in Hungaroring, Hungary, on April 28-29.

Rabat – Morocco’s army continues mobilizing high-level military reinforcements, including military trucks and other equipment, to deter any future provocations by the Polisario after months of its escalation in buffer zones of Western Sahara, in southern Morocco.  A new video, showing convoys of military vehicles allegedly heading south, was widely shared this Sunday on social networks.  The Moroccan daily Al Massae reported on April 9, that General Abdelfattah Louarrak, Inspector General of the Moroccan Royal Army (FAR), gave his instructions for the delivery of military equipment and reinforcements to the combat units settled in the southern provinces of the country.  Meanwhile, news sources close to the Polisario expressed the front’s “readiness to respond to any Moroccan move that would undermine the liberated territory or change the status quo.” The newspaper also reported last week that Morocco will use its high-resolution surveillance satellite, launched in November 2017, to monitor Polisario’s movements in restricted zones, including Mahbes, Tifariti, Guerguerat, and Bir Lahlou.  The newspaper added that images taken by the satellite dubbed Mohammed VI-1, are forwarded to General Abdelfattah Louarrak, Inspector General of the Moroccan Royal Army (FAR), and Nasser Bourita, the Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs, as well as other security and military authorities.  Since December 2017, Morocco has informed the United Nations of the “provocations” of the separatist group in buffer zones of Western Sahara.  In addition to defying the United Nations and its 1991 ceasefire agreement through its continuous presence in the restricted buffer zones, the separatists have reportedly established tents in the restricted zones and announced the relocation of their military facilities to Bir Lahlou, another area of the buffer zone, located 230 kilometers from the Es-Semara provinces in Moroccan territory.

Rabat- A giant carcass of a whale washed ashore Casablanca’s Zenata beach located in Ain Harhoura on Sunday, April 8. A video shared by Akhbar Al Yaoum on Monday shows men and women gathered around the huge whale carcass, while children took the chance to climb on top of it and play. The whale was over 20 meters in length (around 65 feet), and professionals identified the mammal as a blue whale belonging to the baleen whale species, whose weight can reach 140,000 kilograms. The same source indicated that the whale might have beached or could have been accidentally hit and killed by a ship cruising the ocean, before the current carried it on to shoreline. Throughout history, cetacean stranding, or beaching, has been a common phenomenon in different seashores around the world, when whales and dolphins and other aquatic mammals accidentally strand themselves on land and typically die of dehydration. Definitive reasons behind cetacean stranding have not yet been identified, though  the behavior could stem from natural causes or from human-related factors, according to the International Whaling Commission. Morocco’s Ministry of Maritime Fisheries and the Association of Integrated Resource Management (AGIR) previously announced their collaboration to protect cetaceans from “accidental fishing” by fishermen who capture the species by mistake in lieu of their intended market fish.

Rabat- Moroccan athlete Mohamed El Morabity of the TGCC team, won the first stage of the 33rd edition of the Marathon des Sables (MDS-2018) on Sunday, in Morocco’s Timgaline, located  in the Province of Tinghir.  The 25-year-old athlete finished the 30.3-kilometer race in 2 hours, 11 minutes, and 30 seconds, outpacing his older brother and team-mate Rachid, who is a five-time winner of Marathon des Sables.  Nearly 1,300 international runners convened in Morocco’s south to take part in the grueling desert race, which kicked off on April 6 until April 16, under the initiative of Atlantide Organization.  Since its launch in 1986, almost 20,000 people have taken part in the race, which features several competitions open to walkers and runners over a distance of about 250 kilometers.  The event took place under the auspices of the Moroccan Ministry of Tourism, according to a statement released by the organizers.  In order to participate in the race, candidates were required to be over 18, and present a medical certificate issued by the organization stating their ability to participate.  Over the past years, the marathon has long been marked by a series of victories recorded by Moroccan athletes. Most notable was Lahcen Ahansal who miraculously won the title ten times. Nine of those wins occurred in a consecutive winning streak that last from 1999-2007.

Rabat – It was a dramatic moment when the Israeli Judoka, Timna Nelson-Levy, won the gold medal in the Agadir Grand Prix in Morocco.  Timna ascended the podium proudly, with the flag of Israel flying and the Israeli anthem blaring in the stadium. It was a familiar practice in international sports competitions, but this time it was of special importance. The playing of the Israeli anthem in Morocco, a Muslim country and a member of the Arab League, indicates Morocco’s uniqueness in the Arab and Muslim world and its ability to portray official Israeli national symbols such as the anthem and the flag. Morocco is moving between its commitment to the Arab official position, which opposes open ties with Israel, and its desire to strengthen its standing in the international community, which calls for occasional official contact with Israel. The connection between Moroccan Jews in Israel and the Jewish community in Morocco is at the core of the Israeli-Moroccan relations. In the 1990s, liaison offices were opened in Rabat and Tel Aviv, but since the failure of the Camp David summit and the outbreak of the second intifada in 2000, they have not maintained official diplomatic relations. Official interaction with Israel provokes criticism in Morocco and other Arab countries and may harm the standing of the kingdom in the Arab world. Anti-normalization movements in Morocco are at the forefront of the opposition to Israeli-Moroccan ties, while the protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict is in the background. The stalemate in the peace process does not allow both countries to realize the full potential of their relations. However, there is a limited number of collaborations that can be carried out without infringing on Morocco’s ability to portray official Israeli symbols. This is the result of the routinizing effect; that is, making the Israeli-Moroccan connection become a routine. This is possible thanks to the consistent movement of official and unofficial delegations, including tourists, between Israel and Morocco, allowing for the maintenance of bilateral ties in areas such as health, education, communications, culture, and parliamentary. The two countries also sometimes work together in different international forums. The widening coverage of the delegations in the media and social networks in Morocco and Israel is also contributing to the routinizing effect. The Moroccan media expresses great interest in the delegations that visit Israel and follows them closely. The coverage, even if not always positive, encourages open and courageous dialogue in Morocco on issues related to its ties with Israel and Israel’s relations with the Arab and Muslim world. The routinizing effect is particularly evident in sports, especially in relation to Judo. For example, in May 2015, Israel’s Judo team was detained at the Moroccan airport for hours before being allowed to enter the country to compete. In November 2017, Israel’s Judo team landed in Marrakesh to compete in the World Championship, despite the fact that a few days earlier Morocco announced that it would not allow the team’s arrival. In both cases, Israeli participation was made possible due to the intervention of World Association President Marius Vizer. In 2017, Morocco even allowed Judoka Ori Sasson to wear the Israeli symbol, while a month earlier he was denied the ability to wear it in a competition in Abu Dhabi. The result, as was manifested in the Judo contest in Agadir, is that the Moroccan public is not as sensitive as it used to be about delegations visiting Morocco or Israel. The routinizing effect manages to stretch the boundaries of cooperation step by step. An Israeli national anthem that is publicly played in Morocco is not something that Moroccans or Israelis are accustomed to; this is a positive development. Morocco, for its part, chooses to be part of the international community and to pay the price of its ties with Israel in return. However, Israel-Morocco relations still have great potential to develop, and its realization depends on advancing the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

By Hodna Nuernberg Rabat – It’s not every day you see props in the Oval Office, but when Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman sat down with U.S. President Donald Trump on March 20, three large charts were front and center. Trump opened the meeting, which took place in the midst of bin Salman’s two-week-long, coast-to-coast U.S. tour, by declaring Saudi Arabia “a very great friend and big purchaser of equipment and lots of other things.” Seconds later, the U.S. president unveiled a series of large show-and-tell-style charts detailing the billions of dollars’ worth of weapons, vehicles, and military equipment that Saudi Arabia has agreed to purchase from the U.S. Trump’s fumbling display of diplomacy – at one point nearly nicking the Crown Prince with the edge of the poster board chart – turned out to be a remarkably effective piece of stagecraft. Arguably a congenital buffoon, Trump has demonstrated a willingness to open himself to ridicule on stylistic grounds. His outrageous soundbites, idiosyncratic grammar, and puerile claims about the size of not only his hands but also of his nuclear button have been gleefully seized upon by many a commentator, in effect shifting the conversation from substance to style. Trump’s diversionary tactics appeal to an American public eager to be entertained and have helped deflect serious, sustained criticism of his policies. And indeed, as commentators made hay out of the president’s ham-handed show-and-tell, the troubling implications of the billion-dollar weapons deals were largely absent from mainstream analysis. The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, launched in 2015, threatens to provoke what the U.N.’s humanitarian chief has called the worst humanitarian crisis in half a century – every ten minutes, a child in Yemen dies from preventable causes, according to UNICEF’s most recent Humanitarian Situation Report, published in February 2018. The Crown Prince looked on with a mollifying smile as Trump shuffled through his charts and rattled off each major deal’s dollar amount. But Mohammed bin Salman, the 32-year-old son of King Salman and next in line to the Saudi throne, is no stranger to political stagecraft. A self-styled “disrupter,” bin Salman is eager to recast his kingdom as a moderate Muslim nation shaking off the long shadow of Wahhabism, the ultraconservative form of Islam that is Saudi Arabia’ state-sponsored religion. His U.S. tour is designed to accomplish just that, while also shoring up the kingdom’s international legitimacy and reasserting its role as a regional leader. And it seems to be working: the Crown Prince has been hailed as Saudi Arabia’s great young reformer and the best hope of changing the face of Islam across the globe, even as he risks destabilizing the region with the intervention in Yemen, an on-going diplomatic crisis with Qatar, and reports of widespread human rights abuses – seventeen of the detainees held during his 2017 “anti-corruption” crackdown were allegedly hospitalized, including one who later died in custody. Bin Salman’s buoyant public image is a testament to his ability to leverage highly visible – but, thus far, largely superficial – reforms centered on the expansion of women’s rights into proof of a “decisive journey towards civilization, modernization and development,” as columnist Mamdouh AlMuhaini put it in an editorial for Al Arabiya. The kind of neo-colonial language invoked in AlMuhaini’s piece has been echoed in a wide range of Western media, from The New York Times and The Telegraph to CNN and Fox News. Much as colonial France found in the image of the subjugated indigenous woman the perfect justification for the “civilizing mission” of empire building, bin Salman seems to have appropriated the cause as a kind of laissez-passer into the very epicenter of American cultural influence. He will, after all, cap off his whirlwind tour of the U.S. by a meeting with Oprah Winfrey, media mogul, queen of daytime T.V. and quintessential American woman. Of course, lifting Saudi Arabia’s ban on women drivers is big news. The ban was bitterly fought against by women’s rights activists, many of whom risked harassment, intimidation, and detention to further their cause, and there will be significant benefits for many Saudi women thanks to their increased mobility and greater access to economic opportunities. Yet, the timing of the decree that lifted the ban – simultaneously reported on Saudi state T.V. and announced at a major media event in Washington – would seem to suggest careful calculation. Meanwhile, the Crown Prince has left the kingdom’s male guardianship system – Saudi women, who are considered perpetual minors under the law, must seek permission from a male relative to travel, study abroad or marry – fully intact. Women have long served as props for imperialism and waging war. Lord Cromer, the British consul general to Egypt from 1883 to 1907, is an instructive example. By all accounts a typical Victorian colonial administrator, Cromer considered the Islamic world to be inherently inferior to the West and located the subordinate nature of Islamic culture in its treatment of women. Arguing that Islam degraded women through the veil and gender segregation, he believed liberating Egyptian women from the clutches of Islam was the only way to bring Egypt into modernity. Nonetheless, upon his return to England – where he found the woman’s suffrage movement in full swing – Cromer wasted no time in founding the Men’s League for Opposing Woman Suffrage. In more recent times, the rhetoric of feminine deliverance has been pressed into service for the U.S. War in Afghanistan. In 2001, then-First Lady Laura Bush famously delivered a radio address in which she warned against the menace of terrorists and Taliban operatives who would “threaten to pull out women’s fingernails for wearing nail polish.” Nearly sixteen years later, President Trump, previously a staunch opponent of the war, was persuaded to escalate U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan after his National Security Adviser presented him with a 1972 photo of miniskirt-wearing Afghan women as proof that the region might once again be induced to embrace “modern” Western values. In a world where espousing some form of Western feminism is increasingly understood as integral to the march toward modernity, women have also become props in the pursuit of international legitimacy. And as Mohammed bin Salman’s swooning U.S. tour proves, the West is only too ready to succumb to such stagecraft. So, what’s up next for bin Salman? Rumor has it he’ll be making a television appearance with Oprah, who is eager to discuss the Crown Prince’s more liberal stance on women’s rights.

Rabat – Mohammed Abdennabaoui, president of the Prosecutor General’s Office, received on Saturday in Fes the shield of the International Union of Lawyers (UIA), the state news agency MAP reported.  The shield was presented to Abdennabaoui on the sidelines of an international symposium on the evolution of the legal profession. The symposium was organized by the UIA, in partnership with the Bar Association of Fez. Speaking on this occasion, Abdennabaoui stressed that “the new fields of action of the lawyer and the non-traditional roles he is now called to fulfill, including arbitration and drafting acts, require more of attention, precision and responsibility.” For this matter, Abdennabaoui called for the modernization of the organs and mechanisms related to the exercise of the legal profession, including the need for being “rational, circumspect and open to other experiences.” As the world undergoes substantial changes in society and therefore, legislation and jurisprudence, the Attorney General of the King pointed out that lawyers’ bars are required to be more involved in order to master and accompany this new globalized context where the law intersects with numerous other aspects of society. “Despite the effectiveness of ongoing training in developing the intellectual and professional capacities of the lawyer, so that he can accompany changes in legislation, it remains insufficient to give [the lawyer] total control of new laws,” Abdennabaoui said, emphasizing the need to encourage the specialization of lawyers, which is able to help preserve the rights of all parties. He added, “The independence of the judiciary, which is certainly a fundamental pillar in the establishment of the rule of law, can not fully fulfill its role in achieving justice and equity without a defense solidly organized, free, in compliance with the law and attached to the professional ethics.” The President of the Public Prosecutor’s Office also stressed that the organization of the Fez conference facilitates the professional commitment of lawyers and consolidate the ties between them, believing that meetings such as this will likely contribute to the development of the profession and attainment of the aspirations of the participants.

Rabat – Amid the ongoing and unprecedented crisis surrounding the Polisario’s attempt to change the status of the buffer zone in an area west of Morocco’s defense wall in Western Sahara, a statement made by a Polisario leader seemed to lay bare the contradictions of the separatist movement and the long-held belief that it is the sole representative of the Saharawis. The Polisario official, Bachir Mustapha Sayed, leveled criticism recently at a new initiative in the Tindouf camps called the “Sahrawi Initiative for Change.” Members of the initiative have been seeking to hold a constituent assembly to foster programs that seek to improve the living conditions in the camps, to better engage with those Sahrawis living there, and to explore alternative ways to end the Western Sahara conflict. “Anybody who splinters from the Polisario, or seeks to establish a new organization will deserve no mercy or sympathy from our side, nor appreciation of his idea,” Mr. Sayed said. The comments sent a clear message to the region: In addition to expelling dissidents and prohibiting associations and movements other than its own self-appointed affiliations, the Polisario seems determined to repress any dissension or opposition to its hardline positions and rhetoric. The Polisario has long sought to attract international sympathy for its movement by selling itself as the sole legitimate representative of the “oppressed Saharawi people.” Mr. Sayed’s recent statements, however, are a scathing verbal assault on Saharawis who feel attached to Morocco as a unified nation and to those who express their opinion related to Morocco’s sincerity in finding a solution to the dispute and ending the dire conditions of the people stranded in the camps. Many outside observers are seemingly unaware that there are a growing number Saharawis who do not see the Polisario as a legitimate representative of the people of Sahara. But these Saharawi voices are harshly silenced, squashed, and charged with treason for sympathizing with “the enemy.” Former Polisario Police chief Mustafa Salma Ouled Sidi Mouloud spoke to Morocco World News about Mr. Sayed’s video and its implications for any Saharawis who dare to challenge the legitimacy of the separatist movement. Mr. Salma, who was first imprisoned and then expelled from Tindouf in 2010 for daring to suggest that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan can serve as a genuine roadmap towards a peaceful settlement, told Morocco World News that the separatist is not ready to negotiate any political solution to the dispute or accept any challenge to its rule over the Tindouf camps. “This statement gives a clear idea about the contradictions of the Polisario. It demands that Morocco allow the Sahrawis to determine their fate. Meanwhile, the Polisario’s view in this video shows that it refuses that any Sahrawi express their opinion against it and considers them rogue, dissidents whose ideas deserve no sympathy,” Mr. Salma said. And so, whereas Morocco has been expressing its wholehearted support for a mutually beneficial political solution, the separatists seem inflexible in their rhetoric: Amplify and exaggerate the claim of victimhood, and disparage all Moroccan efforts towards ending the crisis. The strategy being to ultimately discredit Morocco’s Autonomy Plan in the eyes of the international community. “The problem is that the person who uses this rhetoric is the one in charge of human rights in the Tindouf camps,” Mr. Salma concluded, suggesting that the Polisario says it wants a solution while its actions are aimed at ensuring the impossibility of a political and mutually beneficial solution. Salma went to add his belief that the Polisario can by no means allow other dissenting Saharawis to express themselves freely and establish organizations or political parties that challenge their supremacy. “To open the way for the inhabitants of the camps to establish civil organizations would pave the way for political pluralism, which would challenge Polisario’s claim that it is the legitimate representative of the Saharawis. And this possibility has been long ruled out and rejected by Algeria, because democracy in the sense of pluralism would cause the Polisario to lose its status as the sole representative of the Saharwis and this is a red line,” he added. Mustapha Salma, who has been deprived from seeing his family for the past 8 years, said it is “surprising to see the report of the UN Secretary-General which mentions no violations of human rights in the Tindouf camps when the Saharawis are deprived of their rights of assembly and freedom of expression.” “The report of the UN Secretary-General cannot reflect the reality of human rights violations in the Tindouf camps for the simple reason that there is no civil society organization that can monitor and report them,” he noted.

By Zoubida Senoussi Rabat – When Moroccan humorist Amine Radi saw the widely-circulated video a man physically assaulting a woman in public near Agadir, it stirred up a question that has dominated his recent reflections: why do Moroccans refuse to talk about sex? In a new video published in his Facebook account on Thursday, Radi points out that even just the word “sex” “ makes people want to die.” “Where I come from, “sex” is either a shameful word or a forbidden word,” he said. For Radi, the lack of dialogue surrounding sexual activity carries grave societal consequences. He links the prevalence of  sexually transmitted diseases to the lack of conversation Rather than addressing these issues, he explains that, “For many people, sex has become a disease.” He goes on to explain that he promotes dialogue about sex, not the act itself, as critics have previously charged. Radi wants to break down this taboo, especially after seeing the recent video of a sexual assault in Morocco and the indignation that followed.   “When a  woman was assaulted in front of a camera it shocks a lot of people, but when it is behind the scenes no one cares and no one talks about it…it’s a cultural problem,” said the comedian, before firing off several examples of highly-publicized rape cases and other “unspeakable” acts, such as the incident of donkey bestiality in Sidi Kacem in  August 2017:. “They already raped a donkey; they went after women, men, and even chairs.” Released on Thursday night, the video has already reached more than 170,000 views and 2,400 shares.  “Yes you’re absolutely right, we need to include sex education in schools so that young people understand and learn to respect each other, I do not believe that there is a Moroccan woman who has not suffered sexual harassment either verbal or body, frustrated society.” said a web user, “Sad reality, it’s hard to be a woman in this society, hope that people will understand your message” commented another one.  Radi has to face criticism as well. Many people think that he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. “I do not agree with that because rape occurs all over the world besides the United States where they say “the American dream” is the number 1 in the world for the number of rapes committed per year followed by South Africa, India and European countries NOT FROM ALL ISLAMIC COUNTRIES”. Through his video, Amine Radi wants “wake people up” to the issue and make sure that they understand that talking about sex is not a shame.

Rabat – The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has broken its silence to criticize FIFA’s 2026 Evaluation Task Force. CAF President Ahmad Ahmad shared the same sentiment as former FIFA president Sepp Blatter, stating that the 68th FIFA Congress to be held in June is the only legitimate body to select the location of the 2026 World Cup. In an interview with Radio France Internationale, Ahmad described the task force as a “step backward.” It is up to the FIFA Congress alone to vote for the submitted 2026 World Cup bids, added Ahmad. Ahmad further said that the role of the Evaluation Task Force is limited to analyzing the applications and collecting information that would then be sent to the association presidents who will vote on June 13. Earlier this month, Blatter criticized the decision of the world football governing body to empower a delegation to evaluate the bids to host the 23rd quadrennial tournament in 2026. On his Twitter account, Blatter said that only “the congress shall decide on the attribution of the World Cup 2026–and not any sub-committee or task-force.” Blatter added that all of the bidders–Morocco and the three-nations North American bid–have the right to “make a presentation” during the June 13 FIFA Congress in Moscow. In a statement released on April 7, FIFA announced that its evaluation committee will officially visit Morocco from April 16-19. “As part of the ongoing bidding process of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and following the submission of the bid books, the 2026 Bid Evaluation Task Force will visit the respective member association,” read the statement from FIFA. The task force visit comes following the recent correspondence to FIFA from the Royal Morocco Football Federation (FRMF) expressing the association’s concerns over the site evaluation scoring system. The FRMF addressed two letters to FIFA regarding Morocco’s concerns about the fairness and transparency of the new procedure announced by the world football governing body. The letter condemned the new measure, stating that “several technical criteria that were not part of the original regulations” were never transmitted to FRMF during the preparation process of the Moroccan bid. FIFA responded to convey that the goal of the task force is to determine if the bids meet the requirements in terms of infrastructure. Most of the criteria used for the 2026 task force evaluation process are not sine qua non, meaning they would not lead to the exclusion of a particular bidder if the criteria is not met. The “objective” factors may constitute “the evaluation of the bidder.” FRMF went back to contest FIFA’s argument in a follow-up letter. “We have taken note of your answers, but unfortunately they have not resolved these concerns and we are still convinced that the scoring system does not comply with the requirements of the bid rules,” reads the recent letter from FRMF President Fouzi Lekjaa to FIFA.

Rabat – The question of inheritance in Islam has been sparking tense debates throughout Morocco. Activists created a petition on the grassroots action site Avaaz.org last month, seeking to abolish certain inheritance practices such as taasib, or “residues” in English. According to the Hadith (reports of the Prophet’s statements and actions) and fiqh (Islamic legal interpretation), the taasib is the residual inheritance following a bequest. Assabat are typically distant relatives of the deceased owner of the estate, who benefit after the immediate family members have received their respective shares.  However, modern-day activists believe that taasib is unfair, stating that the immediate family deserves the entire inheritance and should not be legally obligated to split residual funds with distant family members, who often have weak connections to the immediate family. Furthermore, women activists argue that when a family loses the father, his relatives, including his father and brother, typically do not financially support the children or their mother.  The petition reads, “[The] Moroccan family is most often reduced to just parents and their children… in the current social context, the rules of the taasib have become unfair, as uncles do not take care of their nieces, nor do cousins take care of their cousins…Generally, men do not take care of relatives far from their family, even if they are alone and poor.” Thus, immediate family members deserve the bequest “leftovers” more than anyone else.  The appeal has already garnered backing from thousands of activists. So far, 6,661 people have signed on in support.  A Cry for Reform According to the Qur’an, male relatives are to receive double the inheritance of women in most cases.  A son inherits twice as much as a daughter, and similarly, a brother inherits twice the share of his sister. (However, in cases of uterine brothers and sisters, their shares will be equal.) This gender inequality has been a point of contention for many women in Morocco. Activists and feminists around the region have been increasingly lobbying to end the taasib practice, and to seek broader gender equality in inheritance, as evidenced by ongoing calls for reform in Tunisia. In conjunction with International Women’s Day (IWD) on March 10, Tunisians marched for the right to equal inheritance.  “Women are often very involved in taking care of the needs of their families. They are sometimes the sole supporter, and many must also financially assist their husbands,” reads the petition. Some Moroccan women are demanding reforms of the traditional inheritance system, and have continued to show determination in defending their stance. In March, the issue of gender equality resurfaced in conjunction with the resignation of Islamic scholar Asma Lamrabet from the Mohammadian League of Scholars (Rabita Mohammadia des Oulemas). In her press statement, shared with Morocco World News (MWN), Lamrabet confirmed that her resignation stemmed from her push for a progressive, reformist, and depoliticized interpretation of Islamic Law to “operate a new approach to the question of women’s rights in Islam.” Lamrabet has called on people to support her stance and the “legitimate rights of women for a just and equal Morocco.” Another Moroccan religious scholar, Mohamed Abdelwahab Rafiki, also know as Abou Hafs, recently shared similar sentiments with MWN: “In the society we are living in nowadays, taasib is unfair to women and girls.” Reinforcing his argument, Abou Hafs said that it is unfair to distribute a family’s hard-earned wealth among distant relatives. When asked about critics’ opinions regarding  Shari’a law, Hafs said that many things in Islamic law have changed over time, such as widespread gender segregation. Bouchra Abdou, an activist and a feminist, also affirmed Hafs’s statement. She voiced her opinion to MWN, emphasizing that the inheritance through taasib is unjust to women. As one of the signatories of the petition to end taasib, Abdou said that estates should go directly to the obligatory heirs (including daughters), without involving assabat at all.  “In some cases we see that the daughters are the ones who expanded the families’ wealth, thus it is unfair to distribute their fortune among other people,” Abou stated. Abdou also discussed gender equality in inheritance with MWN, expressing her full support of women’ rights to inherit the same shares that men do. Can Petitions Abolish Ordinance from Allah? The petition to abolish taasib remains contentious among some Moroccan scholars of Islamic jurisprudence. Abou El Wafi, an adoul, or public notary, from the city of Sale, told MWN that he is against the petition, echoing the statement made by Moroccan Islamic scholar Ahmad El Raissouni: “[religious] obligations cannot be canceled by petitions.” Unlike the Hadith and fiqh, which people consider liable to human interpretative, the Qur’an is considered the sacred and perfect direct word of God, and therefore, less amenable to interpretive changes. However, many religious scholars resist all alterations in religious interpretation, even when it is drawn from Hadith or fiqh. The Moroccan adoul added that, “canceling aspects of inheritance through taasib will not solve women’s issues and gender equality in Morocco.”  He added that the question of inheritance is therefore linked to religion, and “we cannot rework framework that is imposed by Islam.” Last week, Raissouni said that the petition is calling for the abolition of the obligations ordained by Allah, and emphasized that the inheritance clauses are obligatory, referencing the surah Al-Nisaa: “These are settled portions ordained by Allah, and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.”  Abdelghani Harmachi, a Moroccan lawyer, reiterated the same sentiments in an interview with MWN. “It is impossible to change divine provisions,” stated the lawyer, fully denouncing the petition. Referring to gender equality in inheritance, the lawyer completely denied the push for reform. “When we get an inheritance case, we deal with it based on what is imposed in the Shari’a law. The Qur’an is valid in every era and area.” Hicham Armidi, a researcher and PhD candidate in Islamic Studies and Law in Mohammed V University shares the same viewpoint as Harmachi.  Armidi said that Allah has provided women with all the rights they need, including financial support (nafaqah). The provision of financial support is one of the commandments given in  Islam and mahr (a mandatory payment), and comes in the form of money given by the groom to the bride at the time of their marriage. Beyond the Petition In 2015, Morocco’s National Human Rights Council (CNDH) urged the government to rewrite its family code and establish equality between men and women within the context of inheritance. The council to has also been pushing the government to allow women to pass their citizenship to their foreign husbands. Recently, the Minister of Solidarity, Women, Family and Social Development, Bassima Hakkaoui, emphasized that the government will soon codify this right in the family law. On the sidelines of the 62nd UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW62), held in March in New York, Hakkaoui said, “Borders should not deprive people of the right to nationality.” On Wednesday, the minister elaborated upon Morocco’s work on marital citizenship procedures.

Rabat – To say that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman –MBS- is blunt is truly an understatement through and through.  During his recent visit to the US, he gave the reputable magazine The Atlantic an interview in which he did not mince his words and spoke candidly on a host of issues never brushed upon, any time before, by a Saudi official, let alone a prince.  For many observers, this prince is truly “a riot” and an unconventional Arab politician. For some political analysts, on the other hand, he is a guy “formatted” by Americans to reform the traditional and patriarchal Middle East, while for the emasculated youth of the region, he is an inestimable hope to enter modernity at long last. Will he succeed? In his above-mentioned interview, he dealt openly with a number of taboos and walked bravely into no go areas, mainly: – Recognition of Israel, – Recalcitrant Iran, – Bothersome religious Fundamentalism, – Guardianship of women, etc. Recognition of Israel MBS is the very first Gulf Arab leader to recognize the existence of Israel on its “own land” officially. A real first worth taking note of and following up. He declared clearly: “I believe that each people, anywhere, has a right to live in their peaceful nation. I believe the Palestinians and the Israelis have the right to have their own land. But we have to have a peace agreement to assure the stability for everyone and to have normal relations.“ and went on to say: “Our country doesn’t have a problem with Jews. Our Prophet Muhammad married a Jewish woman. Not just a friend—he married her. Our prophet, his neighbors were Jewish. You will find a lot of Jews in Saudi Arabia coming from America, coming from Europe. There are no problems between Christian and Muslims and Jews. We have problems like you would find anywhere in the world, among some people. But the normal sort of problems.” In the past all those who tried to come close to this country were eliminated physically: President Anwar Sadat. He paid with his life on October 6, 1981 his historic visit to Israel on November 19, 1977. Nevertheless, the visit shook the status quo and led to the Oslo Accord between the Palestinians and The Israelis; According to Efraim Karsh, writing recently in The Jerusalem Post, the visit was undeniably fruitful: “As it turned out, the visit proved to be the most important single political event in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, culminating in the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty of March 1979 and the attendant shattering of the Arab world’s uniform rejection of Jewish statehood. And while Sadat’s successor, Hosni Mubarak, held a far more restrictive view of the agreement, the Israeli-Egyptian peace has successfully weathered many regional crises (from the 1982 Lebanon war, to the “al-Aksa Intifada,” to the 2014 Gaza conflict), paving the road to the October 1994 Israel-Jordan peace treaty and the yet-to-be-completed Israeli-Palestinian peace process launched with the September 1993 Oslo accord.” However one wonders why on earth is MBS recognizing Israel without anything in return? What is the gain? Well, actually, Saudi Arabia has something in return: the Israeli nuclear umbrella and the determination of the latter to strike at Iran sooner or later, with the help of the US. Up to now Saudi Arabia and Israel were bound by a “cold” alliance that was in the closet but now  has come out into the open dramatically: “Israel is a big economy compared to their size and it’s a growing economy, and of course there are a lot of interests we share with Israel and if there is peace, there would be a lot of interest between Israel and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and countries like Egypt and Jordan”. MBS needs Israel to fight the Iranian looming danger in the region. Iran has a massive, well-trained army and most of all probable nuclear capabilities. In the past, Saudi Arabia used to admonish any Arab country that befriended directly or indirectly Israel, which was referred to in the official rhetoric as kiyan sahyouni i.e. “Zionist entity” and, of course, not recognized as a full country. Politicians who made friends with Israel were either killed: President Anwar Sadat, or labeled as traitors: King Hussein of Jordan and King Hassan of Morocco and attempts to kill them were foiled by their able intelligence institutions. So, unlike any other Saudi official MBS is openly extending a hand to the Israelis. Of course he knows that he will be on the hit list of every extremist there is in the Muslim world as well as that of Iran and its handy men, cronies and client states. MBS is undeniably scared to death by the Mullahs of Iran and their secret plans to take control of his country. He is right when he says that the Iranians want to control the world, he actually meant the Muslim world. They made it clear from the very beginning of their revolution in 1979 to want to export their ideology, religion and might to the rest of the Muslim world. In this, they are no different from the Saudis, who, themselves used their money to export Wahhabism to the rest of the Muslim world and vestiges of that still exist today. MBS knows that and he is lying about that flat. Saudi Arabia was well behind al-Qaeda and a myriad of other organizations bent on spreading fundamental Islam by means of coercion and terror, but they failed utterly. Their failure is indeed double: firstly, many foreign Muslim organizations took their money and delivered nothing and may Muslim countries showed publicly allegiance but hated the guts of Saudis and laughed at their gullibility. Secondly, Saudi Arabia squandered billions of dollars on an educational system that was mainly religious in curriculum, philosophy, approach and finality, and ended up spawning more extremism instead of kick-starting any scientific renaissance in the country, in the least. Today Iran is close to making an atomic bomb that will allow it to become a member of the nuclear club and what is more, it is, also, able to manufacture its own weapons and has, somewhat, become self-sufficient in many other areas, while Saudi Arabia is dependent on the West and the rest of the world for all its armament and everything else.  Today, more than ever, Saudi Arabia is feeling alone and fragile. The Arabs cannot help. Its army is handicapped and its  performance in Yemen is below the average, not to say really catastrophic. In the past, Saudi Arabia relied on Egypt for protection, today  Egypt is totally entangled in its own domestic problems with the army busy keeping the lethal Salafists at bay. In this environment, Saudi Arabia needs Israel to do the donkey work, not to say the dirty work for it: strike and cripple Iran and probably allow the rise of a liberal government in lieu of the  Mullahs, but this is easily said than done. Israel would need America to undertake the suicidal mission of régime change in this country. Besides the regular army, most of the defensive work will fall on the Revolutionary Guards, a lethal army that has for mission regime protection, not to forget the Basij (eleven-million strong paramilitary volunteer militia.) The war on Iran is not going to be a leisurely stroll but a bloody campaign that would destabilize the whole region and put at risk oil production.  Saddam in his “whirlwind war” against Iran also known as Qadisiyyat Saddam: “Qadisiyyat Saddam, a deliberately emotive reference to the famous Arab victory over the Persians in the seventh century” in the words of Ian Black, Middle East editor, of The Guardian newspaper. This deadly war lasted eight years 1980-1988 and both Iraq and Iran paid a dear human cost (over one million lives) and a high material price (billions of dollars) with no result whatsoever. Is Iran a rogue nation? For MBS Iran is a rogue country that wants “to control the world,” this is a figure of  speech (exaggeration) accepted in Arab rhetoric with the expressive intent to deliver a stern message but does not make sense elsewhere. Iran and Saudi are engaged in a deadly feud to control the Muslim world since 1979, if not before. Israel is part of the picture because it has its own agenda for controlling the Middle East and removing, sooner than soon, an existential threat that is Iran. The United States wants to protect Israel, in the first place as well as its vital interests in the region. MBS says that Khameini is worse than Hitler: “I believe that the Iranian supreme leader makes Hitler look good.” This is, obviously, another exaggeration to get the Europeans on board, a task which would be difficult to achieve, not to say impossible, because they all have economic interests in Iran and besides Iran did not commit any atrocities or crimes against humanity, as it were. On the contrary, it helped the West topple Saddam. In his demonization of Iran, MBS goes on to say forcefully: “But the supreme leader is trying to conquer the world. He believes he owns the world. They are both evil guys. He is the Hitler of the Middle East. In the 1920s and 1930s, no one saw Hitler as a danger. Only a few people. Until it happened. We don’t want to see what happened in Europe happen in the Middle East. We want to stop this through political moves, economic moves, intelligence moves. We want to avoid war.” If both America and Israel engage in a war against Iran, would Saudi Arabia finance totally the onslaught? Does it have the means or would it be tempted, yet again, to round the rich of the country, quarantine them in the Ritz Carlton Hotel, once more, and demand payment for their release? Would this work again if undertaken? Fundamentalism  In the interview with The Atlantic MBS seems to deny that the Saudi state has actually adopted Wahhabism  as state religion since its creation in 1930 and that the establishment has since duly sponsored hundreds of religious associations and organizations that were entrusted with spreading austere Islam worldwide. The local chapters of Wahhabism still exist today and function according to action plans previously laid out by these state institutions. “No one can define Wahhabism. There is no Wahhabism. We don’t believe we have Wahhabism. We believe we have, in Saudi Arabia, Sunni and Shiite. We believe we have within Sunni Islam four schools of thought, and we have the ulema [the religious authorities] and the Board of Fatwas [which issues religious rulings]. Yes, in Saudi Arabia it’s clear that our laws are coming from Islam and the Quran, but we have the four schools—Hanbali, Hanafi, Shafi’i, Maliki—and they argue about interpretation.” His denial does in no way take away the responsibility from the state for adopting this tribal form of Islam: austere and inhuman. Criminals had no fair trial and some of them were executed publicly by severing their heads with swords: a practice  reminiscent of the Middle Ages. Women are kept away from public space and have to wear an integral veil called khimar. They could not drive and could not travel without male guardianship maharim, who could even be an underage son. These strict rules and many more were enforced by a religious police or rather a vice squad called mutawwa’ which on behalf of the state, enforces Sharia law in respect to religious behavior (morality) and is , often, seeing beating people, in public, for failing to go to prayer on prayer times. Everybody knows for sure that current fundamentalism became a powerful Islamic current after the Iranian revolution of 1979 that brought Shiism to prominence and power.  Afraid of the world repercussions of the Shiite Islamic school of thought, the Saudis empowered their state organizations such as: Rabitat al-‘alem al-Islami (World Islamic League), founded in 1962 by, the then, Crown Prince Faisal bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud.  The Oxford Dictionary of Islam says that “the group has acted as a mouthpiece for the Saudi Arabian government, which finances it.” The organization propagates the religion of Islam, encouraging Da’wah and conversion of non-Muslims, and promotes apologetics against criticism of Islam. The organization funds the construction of mosques, financial reliefs for Muslims afflicted by natural disasters, the distribution of copies of the Quran, and political tracts on Muslim minority groups. Since coming to power MBS, under pressure from the US, is trying to repel this austere form of Islam by allowing women to drive and to go to such public spaces as football stadiums, but he has still a lot to do to shed fundamental religion for good. The reforms undertaken by this young statesman are a revolution, a massive revolution that will change the socio-religious landscape of the whole Middle East and by extension  the Muslim world. As such, things that were taken for granted, for ages, as corruption, embezzlement, power abuse, patriarchy, male domination, etc. will have to cease to make room, later on, to some form of democracy in a prelude to the end of oil bonanza. MBS’s Vision 2030 is an ambitious action plan to sever dependency of the country on oil. MBS shock treatment MBS wants a modern Saudi Arabia not in appearance only such as food, dress, idiom, but, mainly, in belief and practice of modernity, equality and equity. To achieve this goal, dear to him, he chose the shock treatment approach. Will he vanquish the dark forces of tradition, tribalism and patriarchy to drag Saudi Arabia fully into the third millennium or will he fail and things will return to reactionary Arab normality, after all the Arab Spring withered in spite of many youth uprisings in the whole Middle East?

Rabat- Austria’s right-wing government is considering a headscarf ban for girls in nurseries and elementary schools, as a move to give children equal opportunities and prevent the emergence of “parallel societies,” Chancellor Sebastian Kurz says.  “The veiling of small children is something that definitely has no place in our country,” Kurz told reporters after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.  “A few decades ago we did not have this in Austria and now it occurs primarily in Islamic kindergartens but also here and there in public establishments of Vienna and other cities.”  “Our goal is to confront any development of parallel societies in Austria,” the chancellor added.   The upcoming draft law, which is included under the “Child Protection Act,” would be ready by the summer, according to Education Minister Heinz Fassmann, who regards the new bill as a “symbolic act in protecting Austrian culture from some Islamic influences,” even though the number of children in the kindergartens and primary schools affected by the bill is still not clear.  Kurz also argued that there is no religious rule ordering girls to wear Islamic headscarves at a young age; in many Islamic cultures, it becomes required for girls only when they reach puberty. “We want to make sure that children grow up free and that they are not pulled into these [Islamic] mechanisms,” Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache of the far-right Freedom Party said.  Last year, Austria implemented a controversial law entitled “Anti-Face-Veiling Act,” under which the government banned full-face veils in public spaces, courts, and schools, and prohibited police officers, judges, magistrates, and public prosecutors from wearing headscarves. Those found in breach of the law must pay fines up to EUR 150. The ban sparked many protests in January, when thousands of people took to the capital city of Austria, Vienna to express their rejection of the ban on full-face veils in public spaces.  Protesters have reportedly been accusing the government of perpetuating Islamophobia and sexism.

Rabat – The Moroccan southern city of Laayoune is expected to host demonstrations on Sunday and Monday, bringing together members of political parties and cabinet officials, with the aim of showing their mobilization behind the government and their resolve to defend their country’s territorial integrity.  In its weekend edition, Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported that the city of Laayoune will receive Moroccan delegations, including civil groups, political parties, and cabinet members, with the aim of denouncing the  Algerian-backed Polisario Front “illegals actions” east of Morocco’s defense wall. Al Ahdath added that the decision to stage these demonstrations resulted from consultation between different stakeholders nationwide and Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani.  Moroccan authorities have stepped up their diplomatic offensive in order to isolate the Polisario and prompt the United Nations Security Council to shoulder its responsibility and prevent the Polisario from altering the status quo of the buffer zone and the vast area east of Morocco’s defense wall.  At Thursday’s weekly cabinet meeting, El Othmani stressed that Morocco “totally and categorically rejects the separatists’ attempts to impose the fait accompli in this buffer zone and to introduce changes, be it civil, urban or military, he went on, noting that this position is based on international law and the conventions concluded thereon.”  El Othmani expressed his disappointment with the continued violations of the separatist front in Guerguerat, stressing that “Morocco, which has sounded the alarm about violations committed or possible ones in other regions, particularly in Tifariti and Bir Lahlou, has always ensured the strict application of the 1991 ceasefire agreement, which grants a special status to this region and makes it a buffer zone.”

Rabat – A recent study published this week reveals that the informal economy represents roughly 20 percent of Morocco’s gross domestic product (GDP), excluding agriculture and 10 percent of formal imports.   On Thursday, the General Confederation of Enterprises of Morocco (CGEM) released the findings of its joint-study on the informal economy and its impact on the competitiveness of companies, conducted with the firm Roland Berger in 2014. According to the report, the informal sector, which includes all non-agricultural economic activities conducted underground without the authorization of the relevant authorities, sees the highest proportion of job creation, with 2.4 million informal employees, representing nearly half of the working population.  This shadow economy constitutes 54 percent in textiles and clothing, 32 percent in road freight transport, 31 percent in construction, and 26 percent in the food and tobacco industry. The report, which only includes entities engaged in legal but informal activity, highlights that informal economic operations generate almost MAD 170 billion in untaxed revenues, although it is difficult to obtain a precise estimate. The study notes that this hidden part of economy creates a shortfall for the state in terms of tax and social contributions.  The study also points out that Moroccan companies are losing profitability by limiting investment and innovation, while end-consumers are also suffering from non-compliance with hygiene rules and usage of substandard goods, adding that employment in this sector is associated with “insecurity, instability, lack of social benefits, and low average wages.”  The study, which involved professional federations, business leaders, and government representatives, as well as a steering committee representing the main sectors of Morocco’s economy, aims at making the formal sector more attractive than the informal one to guarantee more competitiveness for Moroccan companies. It also aims at analyzing the informal sector and measuring its impact on businesses to better formalize the economy.  The government has already taken some steps towards formalizing the economy after introducing a new bill in 2016 that requires contracts for domestic workers and includes efforts to expand social security benefits to more workers.  Morocco’s attempts to shift more employees to formal payroll systems, will likely help boost government fiscal receipts, fight against corruption, and improve worker protections.

Rabat – The 2026 Bid Evaluation Task Force will officially visit Morocco from April 16-19, announced the football world’s governing body on Friday. “As part of the ongoing bidding process of the 2026 FIFA World Cup™ and following the submission of the bid books, the 2026 Bid Evaluation Task Force will visit the respective member association,” read the statement from FIFA. The FIFA delegation will visit four Moroccan cities: Marrakech (April 16-17), Agadir  (April 17-18); Tangier (April 18-19) and Casablanca (April 19). According to the international body, the cities have been selected “after consultation with the respective bid committees.” The visit aims at clarifying “technical aspects” included in the bid books of the two competitors. “The visits to the member associations represent only one part of the overall assessment process implemented by the 2026 Bid Evaluation Task Force.” The Task Force visit will follow the recent letters that Morocco addressed to FIFA, expressing the country’s concerns over the scoring system. FRMF addressed its first letter to FIFA on March 25, regarding Morocco’s concerns about the fairness and transparency of the procedure. “To my surprise, the scoring system was finally sent to us on March 14–24 hours before Morocco submitted its file and two days before the deadline for the submission of applications to FIFA,” wrote the FRMF president. Lekjaa explained that this system adds “several technical criteria that were not part of the original regulations,” adding that some principles “have never been transmitted to FRMF in the preparation process of the Moroccan bid.” On April 3, FIFA responded to convey that the aim of the Task Force is to “determine whether the bids meet the requirements in terms of infrastructure and revenue-cost criteria.” The international body added that FIFA “simply provides a methodology for assessing and documenting the extent to which bids submitted meet these requirements in certain key areas.” Most of the criteria used in the 2026 Task Force are not sine qua non, which results in the exclusion of a bidder if it is not respected. These“objective” factors constitute “the evaluation of the bidder.” FIFA’s arguments, however, were not enough to convince Morocco’s FRMF.  “We have taken note of your answers, but unfortunately they have not resolved these concerns and we are still convinced that the scoring system does not comply with the requirements of the bid rules,” reads the recent letter of President of FRMF Fouzi Lekjaa to FIFA. Lekjaa continued, saying that Morocco was surprised this measure surfaced only 48 hours before Morocco submitted its bid. “The late distribution of the scoring system cannot be justified merely by the fact that it was communicated as soon as possible to the candidates,” he added. FIFA’s Task Force committee includes Chairman of the Audit and Compliance Committee, Tomaž Vesel; Chairman of the Governance Committee, Mukul Mudgal; Member of the Organising Committee for Competitions, Ilcho Gjorgjioski; FIFA Deputy Secretary General (Administration), Marco Villiger; and FIFA Deputy Secretary General (Football), Zvonimir Boban. According to FIFA’s statement, the committee members are not allowed to give interviews during their visit. The international organization added that it will publish the evaluation reports after the conclusion of the evaluation process.

Rabat – Morocco has reportedly informed Algeria that the country is ready to intervene militarily if the Polisario Front continues to refuse the United Nations and Morocco’s call to withdraw from east of the Moroccan defense berm. The Middle East Eye reported on Friday that Morocco conveyed the message through an unidentified European ambassador to Algeria. “Morocco has informed Algiers by diplomatic channel that it will intervene militarily in Western Sahara if the Saharawi forces do not withdraw from the buffer zone,” located east of the Moroccan defense wall. Quoting the unidentified source, the Middle East Eye reported that “It would have been preferable for Rabat” to transmit this message via the Moroccan Ambassador in Algiers, or by the Moroccan Foreign Minister and not “via a third state.” Morocco, however, has been clear about Algeria’s responsibility in the Western Sahara conflict. In a written message addressed to the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, King Mohammed VI stated that “Algeria bears a full” responsibility in the conflict. “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario.” Morocco has been urging Algeria to shoulder full responsibility in Western Sahara, including in the unbearable situation in the Tindouf camps, over the past year. The North African country has also been pushing its eastern neighbor to contribute to finding a solution to end the political conflict that has been ongoing for more than 40 years. In a statement published by Agence France Press (AFP) on Friday, a source at the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that “Algeria’s support of the Sahrawi people and its legitimate representative, the Polisario Front, does not mean that it should be involved in negotiations” between Morocco and the separatist group. Recently, regional tensions escalated due to Polisario’s repeated provocative military movements east of Morocco’s defense wall.  In response to the illegal Polisario actions, Morocco requested immediate intervention from United Nations and Security Council. Morocco’s Ambassador to the UN, Omar Hilale, sent a clear message to the Security Council on April 1, emphasizing that Polisario’s actions in the region is a “casus belli,” or justification for war.

Rabat – Moroccan peacekeepers with the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) carried out a joint operation with law enforcement to rescue 15 people who were taken hostage in the village of Koumboy earlier this month. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported today that a joint operation of the Royal Armed Forces and Central African Armed Forces led a rescue of 15 people who had been taken hostage by the so-called Lord’s Resistance Army. The hostage-taking by the rebellion groups took place on March 30 in Koumbou, near the city of Obo, east of the Central African Republic. Moroccan blue helmets and the Central African Armed Forces decided to raid on the so-called resistance army after a man who managed to escape the attack on the village told them of the hostage-taking operation. After an exchange of gunfire, the joint operation managed to rescue the kidnapped individuals. This operation was announced by the spokesman of the Central African government, Ange Maxime Kazagui, in a joint press conference with MINUSCA held in the capital of Bangui on April 2, added MAP. Kazagui added that “the hostages are doing well and the joint forces remained determined in their mission.” Morocco is one of the many countries that contributed peacekeepers to help bring stability to the conflict-stricken African nation. Since it was established in 2014, MINUSCA has deployed over 12,000 troops to the country to protect civilians, following concerns over CAR’s “security, humanitarian, human rights, and political crisis.” On September 22, 2017, the anti-Balaka militia–a largely-Christian terror group based in CAR– attacked a patrol of the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (FAR), as the FAR soldiers were conducting an escort mission for a UN logistics convoy. The attack took place 100 kilometers west of Bangassou, where the FAR contingent had been operating, added MAP. In an additional incident on July 25, two Moroccan peacekeepers were killed in an ambush by the anti-Balaka group in Bangassou, 700 kilometers east of the capital, Bangui. This attack came after another Moroccan soldier was killed on July 23. The three soldiers were among the contingent of Moroccan soldiers ambushed by the anti-Balaka contingent.

Rabat- Santiago Agrelo Martinez, the Spanish Franciscan archbishop of Tangier and migrant rights activist, has compared Europe’s migration policy to that of the Nazi regime.  Martinez, who served as archbishop for ten years in Tangier, said during an interview with the Spanish daily La Voz de Galicia, that today’s society is adopting “an attitude similar to that of the Germans at the time of the concentration camps.”  Admitting that sometimes he “exaggerates,” the human rights advocate noted that the migration issue “touches him personally,” as he considers migrants like his family.  “They are victims of life and the place where they were born. That is why they have had to suffer a continuous ordeal,” Martinez explains.  “We need a human society, in which we feel responsible for others,” he said, adding that hiding our heads in the sand can only lead to “suicide,” while “the problem could be solved if society really pays attention to it.”   Born in the town of Rianxo in the autonomous community of Galicia, Martinez is known for criticizing the migration policies of the European Union, including fences erected along Ceuta and Melilla borders.   He was named archbishop of Tangier by Benedict XVI in 2007, after serving as a parish priest in the diocese of Astorga and a professor at the Theological Institute of Compostela.

Rabat – Morocco’s bid influence continues. On Friday, President of Egyptian Football Federation Hany Abo Rida announced his country’s support for Morocco’s 2026 bid to host the 23rd FIFA World Cup. Abou Rida, who is also a member of the FIFA Council, announced his country’s support in an interview that aired on the local TV channel, LTC.

Rabat – Complainants in the Taoufik Bouachrine case allegedly suffered “threats and pressure,” Public Prosecutor of Casablanca’s Court of Appeal Najim Bensami told Agence France Press (AFP) on Friday. Bouachrine, who was arrested on February 23, is facing charges of sexual harassment, gendered violence, and rape. Police said that they have 50 videos backing the charges facing the prominent journalist. The police have further hinted that the said videos were recorded by Bouachrine himself. The public prosecutor said that the court has information that “confirms that the complainants are under pressure and threats from the ‘entourage’ of Bouachrine.”  Bensami further said that the alleged victims were offered a financial arrangement to withdraw their complaints. “It is our duty to protect them from the moment they appeared in the seized videos,” said the public prosecutor, adding that the court considers the complainants victims of the crime, “even if they do not file complaints.” During his trials, Bouachrine’s lawyers made the case for their client’s innocence, claiming the video evidence the police claims to possess has been “falsified.” “If the defense considers that the procedures were not respected, it has only to request the cancellation of the recording minutes to the court,” said the public prosecutor. He added that charges against Bouachrine are based on videos seized by police during his arrest. On Thursday, Bouachrine’s fourth trial saw tensions escalate between his defense team and the court, with his lawyers emphasizing that documents and videos were “falsified.” The alleged suspect will appear before the court again on Wednesday, April 11.

By Zoubida Senoussi Rabat – His last show “Maintenant ou Jamel” has not gone unnoticed: on Friday, April 6, the “Academy of Molières” nominated Jamel Debbouze for the “Molière of Humor,” one of several prestigious awards that annually honors the best artists and live shows in France. In this category, the French-Moroccan comedian will represent his new stand-up comedy show, “Maintenant ou Jamel,” directed by Mohamed Hamidi. After six years of absence, Debbouze has made a successful comeback on his favorite playground: the stage. Very close to his audience, the 42-year-old comedian talks about his fears, his role as a father, and his career. The committed artist mocks some political figures, such as Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump, while also discussing subjects like racism and terrorism. The Paris native has starred in many movies, including the historical movie, Days of Glory, which he also co-produced in 2006. Debbouze also inaugurated his own comedy club in 2008, opening opportunities for amateur stand-up comedians. Every year, the comedian organizes “Marrakech du Rire,” which serves as a “link between cultures,” uniting hundreds of stand-up fans for the world’s premier Francophone stand-up comedy festival.

Rabat – The Royal Football Federation (FRMF) has reiterated its firm position on FIFA’s 2026 Task Force, emphasizing that FIFA’s arguments are unable to “dispel” Morocco’s concerns on the new scoring system. “We have taken note of your answers, but unfortunately they have not resolved these concerns and we are still convinced that the scoring system does not comply with the requirements of the bid rules,” reads the letter of President of FRMF Fouzi Lekjaa to FIFA. Lekjaa continued, saying that Morocco was surprised this measure surfaced only 48 hours before Morocco submitted its bid. “The late distribution of the scoring system cannot be justified merely by the fact that it was communicated as soon as possible to the candidates.”  On March 25, FRMF addressed a letter to FIFA regarding  Morocco’s concerns about the fairness and transparency of the procedure. “To my surprise, the scoring system was finally sent to us on March 14– 24 hours before Morocco submitted its file and two days before the deadline for the submission of applications to FIFA,” wrote the FRMF president. Lekjaa explained that this system adds “several technical criteria that were not part of the original regulations,” adding that some principles “have never been transmitted to FRMF in the preparation process of the Moroccan bid.” On April 3, FIFA responded that the aim of the Task Force is to “determine whether the bids meet the requirements in terms of infrastructure and revenue-cost criteria.” The international body added that FIFA “simply provides a methodology for assessing and documenting the extent to which bids submitted meet these requirements in certain key areas.” Most of the criteria used in the 2026 Task Force are not sine qua non, which results in the exclusion of a bidder if it is not respected. These“objective” factors constitute “the evaluation of the bidder.”

Rabat- No more crazy hailing! Casablanca taxis will now display their travel directions on rooftops. Good news for people looking to get a taxi amid road traffic in Morocco’s busy economic city, Casablanca! Casa’s cabs are starting to install small screens atop their roofs to indicate upcoming destinations. The screens also inform potential passengers when the taxi is full and when the driver’s shift has come to an end, making it easier for people to reach their destinations more quickly and efficiently. Credit for the innovation goes to the rising Moroccan company “LED RED,” whose members suggested the idea. Thanks to their team, the screens have been recently installed in six taxis–five cabs and two grand taxis–and more are yet to come. “All the driver needs to do is type the chosen destination through a GPS application for it to automatically display the location on the screen,” president of LED RED, Adil Shaibi told the Moroccan HuffPost website, in an interview. On its official Facebook page, LED RED shared several photos of the smart-looking taxis roaming the streets of Casablanca:   Hopefully, more screens will be installed in the future so other cities in Morocco can benefit from this innovative initiative.

Rabat – France’s national carrier Air France warned customers planning to travel on Saturday, April 7, of possible flight delays or cancellations due to another staff strike over pay involving pilots, cabin crew and ground staff. “Due to the confirmation of the strike for Saturday April 7, our flight schedule for this day will be disrupted,” the company said in a statement. The airline’s management said that some 30 percent of total Air France flights will be cancelled on this day, while it will maintain 75 percent of its long-haul flights, 65 percent of its medium-haul flights in and out of Paris’s Charles de Gaulle airport and 70 percent of short-haul flights going to and from the capital’s Orly airport. Some flights departing from or going ahead of Morocco are among the cancellations. The flights Paris-Casablanca (AF1597) and (AF1596) as well as flight Paris-Rabat (AF1358) have been cancelled. The French airline forecasts other disruptions as six other strike days will occur this month, recording the highest cancellation rate since the start of a series of one-day strikes in February. “A call for strike has been issued by several Air France staff unions for Saturday 7, Tuesday 10, Wednesday 11, Tuesday 17, Wednesday 18, Monday 23 and Tuesday 24 April 2018,” the statement adds. This Saturday marks the fifth day of strike, initiated by worker unions who demanded a 6 percent pay rise, which the airline has refused to meet, saying that it cannot offer more than a 1 percent pay rise to staff. “We can’t give out money that we don’t have,” Air France CEO, Jean-Marc Janaillac told RTL radio on Friday, April 6. “I need to ensure Air France has a future, and to go any higher than that would jeopardize the company’s future,” Janaillac said. French daily La Tribune, reported that each strike day costs the company over EUR 25 million, adding that flights disruption will likely dissuade customers to book flights with the company during the upcoming lucrative summer holiday season.

Rabat – Spanish infantry commander and a former veteran of the Western Sahara guerilla, Iglesias Coto, has openly condemned the Algerian-backed Polisario Front’s maneuvers in Western Sahara, calling the  creation of Polisario a “big mistake.” During a recent conference organized by Spanish authorities on the Sahara conflict, Coto said that Polisario was the worst outcome of the Sahara War. Coto, who was quoted by Spanish news source La Nueva Espana, said that the “revolutionary ideas of the Polisario Front were born in the ‘60s in Madrid, where notable Sahraoui children came to study.”  Several Spanish media outlets reported on Polisario’s involvement in criminal acts back in the 1970s. In October 1974, Polisario members, including the newly-appointed “prime minister” of the Polisario Front-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), Mohamed Ouali Akeik, committed terrorist attacks against Spanish citizens at the Pohsboucraa site near the Moroccan city of Laayoune. Polisario also carried out attacks on phosphate conveyor belts in Laayoune, between 1974 and 1976, in an attempt to stop phosphate mining. Additionally, the separatist group engaged in violent attacks on Spanish fishing vessels, the Moroccan army, and French nationals in the area. Polisario continued targeting Spanish citizens during the 1980s, claiming the lives of 300 civilians, according to Spanish news website La Opinion de Tenerife. After Western Sahara’s return to Moroccan sovereignty in 1975, the Polisario used the assassination of Spanish civilians as a tactic to pressure Spain and punish the state for signing a fishing agreement with Morocco in 1976, which tacitly recognized Western Sahara as Moroccan territory. The Spaniard also denounced the separatists’ violent attitudes and criticized the front’s “proximity to Marxist Algeria.”

Rabat – Speaking at the 18th Ministerial Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement in Azerbaijan, a  Moroccan delegation reiterated Morocco’s call for Algeria to bear full responsibility and cooperate in the UN-led political process aimed at helping the parties to achieve a mutually acceptable political solution.  The Moroccan delegation’s remarks came in response to Algeria’s refusal to cooperate in the settlement of the territorial dispute.   Earlier today, Agence France Press (AFP) quoted a source from the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who stated that “Algeria’s support of the Sahrawi people and its legitimate representative, the Polisario Front, does not mean that it should be involved in negotiations” between Morocco and the separatist group.” In response to this statement, the Moroccan delegation participating in the conference on April 3-6 said: “Algeria has to respond to its imprescriptible responsibilities in the Moroccan Sahara conflict.”  The Moroccan delegation added that “Algeria’s responsibility is clear, it is confirmed at all levels: militarily, financially, humanitarian and politically.” The UNSG submitted his annual report to the Security Council on the Situation on Western Sahara this week. In the advanced copy of the report, which was made available on March 31, Guterres denounced Polisario’s activities and called on Algeria to increase its engagement in the political process. On Wednesday, King Mohammed VI addressed a written message to the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, reiterating that Algeria bears a “full responsibility” in the Sahara question.

Rabat – Whereas Mohammed V Airport frames itself as an international hub and Africa’s best, the travel website e-Dream recently ran a survey that knocked the Casablanca-based airport off its pedestal and dubbed it “the world’s worst airport.” As should be expected, eDream’s move provoked the wrath of Moroccan airport authorities who immediately replied to the website’s ‘outrageous provocation.’ The office National des Aéroports (ONDA), which is the body in charge of monitoring Moroccan airports, issued a statement in which it directly attacked the website’s categorization of Mohammed V as the “world’s worst airport,” calling the ranking “subjective and unsubstantiated”. “This agency [eDream] operates through a system of online booking of flight tickets, hotels rooms, and rental cars. Its conclusions are therefore based on the personal opinions and comments written by its users,” ONDA said in the statement, underscoring the fact that the conclusions reached thereof are dubious and inconsequential as “they are not based on the usually rigorous scientific approach used in surveys.” ONDA most specifically lambasted eDream’s sample, deeming it unrepresentative and skewed. Elaborating further, ONDA cited the example of what it deems a more “qualified” and “serious” survey: Airport Service Quality (ASQ). As a reminder, ASQ, which is Airports Council International’s sub-branch associated with appraising service qualities at airports around the world, is reputed to be the world’s leading quality survey for airports. It annual surveys generally consist of a pool of over 600,000 individuals while the questionnaires are presented in 41 different languages around, all of which ONDA presents as more credible and reliable. “This program [ASQ] ranked Mohammed V Airport of Casablanca as the best airport in Africa in terms of services available for customers,” the statement noted, further explaining that ASQ’s conclusions constitute the best reply to a “buzz website that deals with a serious and important topic in a flippant, amateurish, and unscientific manner.” ONDA further hinted that it may consider lodging a legal complaint against eDream if it continues to endorse and disseminate such “outrages.”

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – After a 35-year moratorium on cinemas, both men and women in Saudi Arabia will be able to attend theaters on April 18, when the American blockbuster “Black Panther” will open in Riyadh. The gulf nation has a complicated, at times fraught, relationship with Western media. Despite the state-sanctioned observance of ultraconservative rules for moral and social behavior, Saudis still are keen consumers of foreign films and television shows. Nearly 70 percent of the kingdom’s 32 million people are under 30; in the affluent, oil-rich nation, economists estimate that the younger generation could eventually generate nearly USD 1 billion in box office revenue. Thirty-two-year old Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, has been breaking with the country’s restrictive past, since he was named heir to the throne in June last year. The new movie theater initiative is but one example of the Crown Prince’s efforts to liberalize the country’s strict codes of conduct and diversify its economy, which is almost entirely dependent on oil. Last year, Saudi women were allowed to attend football matches for the first time and, starting in June of this year, women will also be allowed behind the wheel, ending a ban on female drivers. Although “Black Panther” afforded black actors a groundbreaking opportunity to challenge stereotypes that limit Black representation in Hollywood and the mainstream media. Some Saudis speculate that the latest move by the regime may prove to be somewhat less-than-revolutionary. Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, Saudi comedian Hisham Fageeh remains circumspect about the degree to which the Saudi state will actually abet theaters in disseminating new cultural media. “Do they want it to be very vanilla, mild content … and just the existence of cinemas in itself is considered subversive?” Regardless of skeptics and critics, the gulf government struck a deal with the US company AMC Entertainment to deliver silver screens to 40 Saudi cities over the next five years, up to 100 cinemas by 2030. Saudi newspaper Sabq reported that the AMC’s first cinema, located in Riyadh’s King Abdullah Financial District, expects crowds with its 620-seat capacity. Next on the program, Saudi viewers will be treated to screenings of the “Avengers: Infinity War” beginning April 26. Saudi audiences can also look forward to live entertainment, as Disney on Ice and Cirque du Soleil will touring in the kingdom soon.

Rabat – The Mohammed V International Airport of Casablanca is once again making the headlines, this time as the “World’s Worst Airport.” The Airports Council International recently ranked Casablanca’s Mohammed V International Airport as the best in Africa and one of the global leaders for good customer services, a recent traveler-driven survey has reached the opposite conclusion. “What are the best and worst airports you ever visited?” a traveling website recently asked a pool of travelers. According to eDream, the survey consisted of a sample of over 50,000 travelers, focusing on the quality of services such as “shopping opportunities, restaurants, and departure lounges.” “For eDream users, the world’s worst airport is Casablanca’s Mohammed V Airport,” the website reported, further noting that of all the airports included in the survey, Casablanca, whose rating stood at 3.21 out 5, “got the lowest score.” Casablanca is followed in the top three “world’s worst airports” by Rome’s Ciampino Airport and Berlin’s Tegel Airport, with ratings of 3.21 and 3.30, respectively. On the other side of the spectrum, Germany has three airports in the top ten, and Singapore, Zurich, and Istanbul were picked as the three most-liked airports by eDream users. Whereas Singapore is reputed for the boundless shopping and touring opportunities the airport provides to its numerous visitors, Zurich was hailed “as one of the most beautiful airports of the world.” Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport was applauded  for its excellent and well-integrated Metro-Airport system. If anything, eDream’s survey is set to unnerve and possibly shatter the confidence that Mohammed V Airport exhibits on its website, so a rejoinder is highly likely. According to the Office National des Aéroports (ONDA), Casablanca’s airport is, along with Johannesburg, Cairo, and Cape Town, among the four busiest and “more important” airports in Africa. With annual traffic reaching 2 million passengers, as well as 50 flight companies linking 80 destinations, Mohammed V witnessed an increase of over 11 percent in its annual traffic in 2017, with positive feedback from travelers, as well as international validations, ONDA reported.

Rabat – The PSA Kenitra plant, which is the Moroccan subsidiary of the French PSA Peugeot Citroen, is expected to be close to full operational capabilities this year, a company representative and Morocco’s Ministry of Industry announced at a press conference on Thursday in Casablanca. In its initial plan, PSA Kenitra was supposed to be operational by 2020, with an annual output of roughly 200,000 cars. However, at yesterday’s press conference, the Minister of Industry, Investment, and Commerce, Moulay Hafid Elalamy, announced that the Kenitra plant will be operational in 2018, stating that all the requirements were met earlier than expected. “The project is ahead of schedule. The two Kenitra plants have already been built and are now undergoing trial operations,” the minister said, adding that the factory’s first motor was built and sent to France where, after undergoing series of diligent trials, it gained “all the required validations.” He also mentioned that the project already has 1,500 engineers and qualified workers, a number which the minister said is “a bit above what PSA asked for.” While the prototype of a Kenitra-made car is set to be out by July 2018, the company is expected to be fully operational by 2019, one year earlier than originally planned. Mr. Elalamy expressed his joy that such a remarkable project could be achieved within so short a span, underscoring his hope that the project will be a game-changer for the Moroccan and African automobile markets. “Kenitra has exceeded our expectations,” the minister noted. He explained that the main rationale behind the PSA-sponsored project in Kenitra is to transform and rejuvenate Morocco’s mobile industry, make it competitive and present in the global market, and “vitalize local sourcing.” Also speaking at the conference, PSA Africa-Mideast Representative Jean Christophe Quemard spoke profusely about his satisfaction regarding the pace and strategic significance of the project, saying that such a success is due to the fact that “both parties kept their end of the bargain.” He said that his company is “proud to announce that the first Kenitra-made car has already been assembled” and is set to be presented to the public in the months to come. He noted that PSA’s presence in Kenitra is founded on “a unique strategy and a vision of extended partnership with Morocco.” “PSA is doing in Morocco what no other automobile group has realized in Africa,” he stressed. By the time the two plants begin full operations in 2019, it is estimated that over 2,000 direct and 20,000 indirect employment positions will be generated. Meanwhile, at the start year 2019 alone, annual output is estimated to be 100,000 cars, with predictions that the output may reach the planned output of 200,000 cars by 2020. For Mr. Quemard, given the wide range of partnerships that PSA is seeking to establish between Moroccan engineering universities and their French counterparts, the PSA Kenitra subsidiary will be a pivotal point in helping the country realize its dream of becoming the undisputed hub of “sustained mobility” in Africa and beyond.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – A Bulgarian justice approved the extradition of terrorism suspect Naufal Zahri to Morocco on Thursday, April 5. The district court of Haskovo in Southern Bulgaria approved a request from Rabat-Interpol for the extradition of  Moroccan national Naufal Zahri to his country of origin, reported the Bulgarian site the Sofia Globe.  Zahri, who was arrested at the Bulgaria-Turkey border in February 2018, after presenting false identification claiming to be of Syrian origins, was allegedly in possession of an explosive belt, hand grenades, firearms, and ammunition.  The Bulgarian authorities established his real identity and arrested him on the basis of a search warrant issued by the Interpol-Rabat office under the jurisdiction of the national bureau of Interpol (BCN). The suspect admitted to prior awareness of the search warrant against him in Morocco, as he lived in Syria, where he used to work in the Department of Mechanical Engineering attached to the General Directorate of Lily Bearings. He cited the position as the reason behind his escape.  Zahri alleged that he was only involved with Daesh as a cleric to support his family, but denied committing any attacks.  Zahri’s lawyer, Anton Popov, previously declared that the suspect prefers to be tried in Bulgaria and serve any prison sentence there, out of fear of torture in Morocco: “He fears being killed in prison in Morocco.” The 35-year-old suspect faces charges of affiliation to the Islamic States in Iraq and Syria, raising funds and participating in training for the terrorist organization, belonging to an organized crime network, recruiting for Daesh, and the illegal use and possession of firearms directed against national security and public order in Morocco.

Rabat – Algeria has refused calls from Morocco and the United Nations to cooperate in settling the Western Sahara conflict, sidestepping calls for its engagement in conflict negotiations. In a statement published by Agence France Press (AFP), a source at the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that “Algeria’s support of the Sahrawi people and its legitimate representative, the Polisario Front, does not mean that it should be involved in negotiations” between Morocco and the separatist group. Morocco and the United Nations have been calling on Algeria to cooperate in the conflict, including the situation in the Polisario-run Tindouf camps.  On Wednesday, King Mohammed VI addressed a written message to the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, reiterating that Algeria bears a “full responsibility” in the Sahara question. “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario,” the King stated. The UNSG submitted this week his annual report to the Security Council on the Situation on Western Sahara. In the advanced copy of the report, which was made available on March 31, Guterres denounced Polisario’s activities and called on Algeria to increase its engagement in the political process. Recently, regional tensions have escalated due to Polisario’s repeated provocative military movements in the buffer zones, east of Morocco’s defense wall. Morocco has been urging the United Nations and the Security Council to put an end to Polisario’s maneuvers in the region, emphasizing that the country will not hesitate to repel any further escalation from the Algeria-backed Polisario Front.

By Zoubida Senoussi Rabat – One of the world’s highest paid celebrities is now paying for his crime. Bollywood bad boy Salman Khan is facing some real time in jail. According to the BBC, the Indian actor was sentenced on Thursday to five years in prison and INR 10,000 (MAD 1,418) by a court in Rajasthan for poaching rare antelopes from his car window back in 1998, while filming in Jodhpur.   This complaint has been filed by the local Bishnoi, “a community who reveres and worship the blackbuck,” adds the same source. The 52-year-old actor’s lawyers will appeal the decision. An urgent bail hearing was scheduled for Friday. “We are studying the judgment–it just came as a surprise, as the entire investigation, and facts of this case were the same as those for which Salman was acquitted by the High Court of Rajasthan in two [other] cases,” one of his lawyers said to the source. On social media, the “Saajan” actor has been receiving a lot of support from his fans. The hashtag #WeLoveYouSalmanKhan is actually trending on Twitter, where he has more than 32 million followers and another 15.3 million on Instagram. Khan has a long and troubled relationship with the law. In 2015, Bollywood’s sweetheart was found guilty in a deadly hit-and-run accident and received a five-year prison sentence. The case was later dropped by a higher court for “a lack of evidence.” Difficulties with the justice system aside, Salman Khan has been busy pursuing his acting career. Last year, the heartthrob was filming the movie “Tiger Zinda Hai” in Morocco, an event that attracted Moroccan fans of the star in Essaouira, where part of the shooting took place.

Rabat – The first cinema in Saudi Arabia is set to open in Riyadh on April 18, a few months after Saudi authorities allowed public cinemas to operate within the Arabian country, lifting a ban that has been in force for more than 35 years, local media reported, citing official sources on Wednesday.  US giant AMC Entertainment was the first to be granted a licence to operate cinemas after it signed a non-binding agreement in December with Saudi Arabia’s vast Public Investment Fund to build and operate movie theatres across the kingdom. “The granting of the first licence marks the opening of very significant opportunities for exhibitors,” Information Minister Awwad Alawad was quoted as saying in the statement. According to Saudi state media outlets, AMC Entertainment, which will face fierce competition in the future from other operators such as the leading operator in the Middle East, Dubai-based Vox Cinemas, is expected to open 40 cinemas in 15 Saudi cities over the next five years.   According to Saudi’s culture and information ministry, up to 2,000 screens in more than 300 cinemas will be established within 12 years. Movie theatres in Saudi Arabia have been banned for the past 35 years, as they were considered a threat to religious and cultural identity, as “they corrupt morals and values,” as stated by the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Abdul-Aziz Ibn Abdullah al-Sheikh.  However, the move to reopen cinemas, comes as a part of an ambitious reform plan initiated by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in April 2016, under the Vision 2030 banner, despite discontent of ultra-conservative circles. The industry is expected to contribute about USD 24 billion to the economy and create more than 30,000 permanent jobs.  In addition to stimulating the local film industry, this decision confirms the authorities’ desire to make the entertainment sector an element of social transformation in a country governed by a rigorous form of Islam.  The project, which was highly-welcomed by the filmmaking community, is also a part of a comprehensive reform program aimed at reducing the country’s dependence on oil.  Like most public spaces in the Al-Saud kingdom, movie theaters will have separate sections for men and women, as well as a section for families.

Rabat – Moroccan critic Mokhtar Mechbal has won the Sheikh Zayed Award in the category of “arts and critical studies,” the Sheikh Zayed Book Award Foundation recently announced in a statement. The award, which celebrates its twelfth anniversary this year, was awarded to the Moroccan critic for his book that revolves around the rhetoric of argumentation, “In the Rhetoric of Al Hajjaj: Towards a Rhetorical Approach of Al Hajjaj and the Analysis of Speech,” published in 2017, by Konouz Al Maarifa in Amman. The award honors intellectuals, researchers, and writers, who have made remarkable contributions and innovations in language, literature, social science, and modern culture. During this competition, two other Moroccan writers and researchers were shortlisted for the twelfth edition of the Scientific Committee of the Sheikh Zayed Book Award, making the cut with just 19 other finalists out of the 44 long-list nominees.  Mechbal is set to receive his prize along with the winners in the other award categories, during a ceremony on April 30, which will occur on the eve of the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair. The awards presented are worth AED 750.000, the equivalent of nearly MAD 2 million.  The winners of the Sheikh Zayed Book Award could also see their titles translated into English, French, and German, following a deal signed last February with the prestigious Frankfurt Book Fair to encourage publishing houses to translate more of the winning works. “This partnership is aimed at encouraging translations from Arabic into other languages ??and spreading Arab culture in the West, thus strengthening the position of the Sheikh Zayed Book Award among international awards as an incubator of Arab culture and promoter of dialogue among civilizations,” said Saif Ghobash, the UAE Director General of the Department of Culture and Tourism.

Rabat – Completing a working visit to Morocco, Mali’s foreign affairs minister said in a press conference held yesterday in Rabat that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan regarding the Sahara question is “serious and credible.” Mali’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tiéman Hubert Couibaly reiterated Mali’s endorsement of the UN process in Western Sahara. He also underlined the historic and friendly ties that bind his country to Morocco, a relationship exemplified by a number of bilateral agreements signed between the two countries just a few weeks ago. Commenting on Morocco’s recent efforts in guaranteeing a politically feasible settlement of the Western Sahara Question, Mr. Coulibaly said that the Kingdom’s efforts were “serious,” “credible,” as well as respectful of the parameters of the UN Security Council-sponsored observation mission in the region. Regarding his country’s position on the Sahara dispute, Mr. Coulibaly spoke in terms of constructive neutrality,” hinting that the UN, as the body in charge of convening the involved parties, should extend its mission and ensure “an amicable settlement” of “this long-standing conflict.” Mr. Coulibaly deplored the social, economic, and psychological costs associated with deteriorating security situations, such as the one in some militarized regions of Western Sahara, saying that they [militarized campaigns] impede governments’ efforts and commitment to development and peace. He insisted that we [Africa] now more than ever need to ensure “a peaceful and conflict-ridden continent.” Seizing the opportunity to address his Moroccan counterparts—Minister Nasser Bourita and  Delegate Minister Mohcine Jazouli—at the press conference, Mr. Coulibaly expressed his gratitude for Morocco’s continuous strategic and financial support in helping Mali’s efforts to tackle its currently fragile security mechanism and restore political stability and economic development.

Rabat – From the quarterfinals onwards, the Champions League is sure to be drama of the highest proportions!  Whoever thought of calling this tournament “Champions League” was right: it is, to the utter excitement and delight of fans and curious viewers, a battle of titans. From what could have been an otherwise-mundane mid-week, the games bring fans a fleeting–though seemingly infinite–bliss. This week was no different, adding to the most unforgettable moments of the game, the legendary memories that we’ll speak about for years and generations to come. There is no better way of putting it—great Champions League matches have an incredible way of infusing the ordinary and the familiar with a kind of jubilation brought on by very few experiences. Zidane is on Fire and Ronaldo is Back: Who can stop them? Tuesday night was magical–even by Zidane’s boys’ own stellar standards. That majestic win against the ‘Old Lady’ will surely go down in history as one of Real Madrid’s most mouthwatering victories. Even NBA star LeBron James weighed in: “Are you not entertained?” he tweeted after Ronaldo’s breathtaking bicycle kick. Guided by the boisterous winning spirit that the team has carried since they humiliatingly routed Neymar and his mates, the effectiveness that Zidane’s boys brought to the field paid out in the very first minutes of the game. By the third minute, Ronaldo, comfortably situated inside Juventus’ box, received a pass from the elegant Isco; the Portuguese, clinical as ever, scored what is so far his fastest Champions League goal. After conceding his first goal, Juventus pressed high, kept the ball, and crowded the midfield, making Real appear more like Manchester United at times. But to no avail: the Varane-Ramos wall was spotless and impassable. 1-0 for the first half, but Allegri’s boys–given their superior control and possession at this stage–could still dream of a tie, perhaps even victory. But their equalizer never came, in spite of Dybala’s numerous runs in the midfield and Douglas Costas’s many feints and crosses… Instead, Juventus received Ronaldo’s best night of the campaign: that bicycle kick goal! Buffon was completely helpless, watched the ball fly into his goal. He appeared to be complaining to the football gods, asking them what he’d done to have to face Ronaldo in what is most probably his last Champions League appearance. Buffon will never forget Cristiano Ronaldo—the Portuguese has been an absolute nightmare to the Italian! Incredulous, shocked, at a loss with the absolute beauty that his veteran center-forward had just scored, Zidane put his hands on his head, unable to adequately celebrate. How do you even celebrate that kind of goal? “What the heck have I just seen?” the Frenchman’s facial expression seemed to suggest. “It is one of the most beautiful goals in the history of the game,” Zidane said shortly after the match, adding: “That is what Cristiano Ronaldo can do; that is why he stands out from the others.” Wonderful, daring, impeccable (and I did not think I’d be using such words to describe Ronaldo this season), the Portuguese’s outrageously delightful move stunned the Italians fans so much so that they gave him a standing ovation, the ultimate tribute for an otherworldly performance. The moment bore striking similarities with Real Madrid’s own fans’ acknowledgement of Ronaldinho’s devastating skills. “All-time great overhead kick,” the Telegraph said, of Madrid’s second goal. The accolade was obviously overstated, it seemed to overlook the fact that many goals like this have been scored before. But the exaggeration is pardonable, for brilliance has that eerie ability of erasing history: it imposes itself on the mind and, in the heat of the moment, obscures everything else. And by the time Marcelo scored the third, it was all done for the Italians. “Now, it will be impossible,” Juventus Coach Massimiliano Allegri said after the game, meaning that his team can forget about the rest of this year’s campaign. Madrid did it again. They crucified a disciplined and frightening Juventus that many thought could perform the miracle that the Neymar-led Paris boys failed to achieve. Many argued before the game that Juventus had all the resources and the required stamina to end Zidane’s dream of salvaging his season. “Allegri and his boys will not allow a second humiliation in a row,” some suggested.  But whoever said that logics applied to Real Madrid in the Champions League? The question now is: Will they win a third in a row? Kloop’s Tactical Flexibility Thrashes Manchester City Kloop demanded bravery and adventure from his players before the Manchester City test. The German coach, quite reasonably, knew that in spite of the exquisite and impressive play his front three (Mané, Salah, Firmino), have exhibited throughout the season, it takes more than quality to outshine a team with City’s footing. To clobber England’s best team, Anfield needed a wild and beastly force of will. “If you are brave, if you are ready to make mistakes, if you are ready to enjoy the work and your attitude is at the highest level, if your character is at the highest level, then you have a chance. And that is the only thing I need,” Kloop encouraged, hinting that defeating “the best team in Europe” required as much skill as dogged determination and, more importantly, an unquenchable desire to outperform yourself.  To beat “a team that runs through you like a warm knife through butter,” the German continued, “You need to use the spaces… Be there, don’t wait, be lively.” And lively they were. Their invincible instincts tamed an otherwise-excellent side, facilitating a first-half rampage of 3 goals in 30 minutes of play. Led by an immaculate midfield and an unstoppable front three, Liverpool looked indomitable at every turn—even their usually-unimpressive defense had a glorious aura of impassibility. Salah, injured, may have left the pitch earlier than expected; but it was his imperious left foot and his unperturbed composure in the face of City’s threatening squad that propelled Liverpool towards what Anfield can remember as its most momentous European victory in a decade. And although Firmino did not score, his boyish enthusiasm and his tireless contributions were just as important. 2-0 down after Chamberlain’s stunning thunderbolt at the 20th minute, Kloop could have told his boys to defend, to revert to a Mourinho-inspired humdrum way of playing, to focus on keeping a clean sheet rather than looking for another goal. But such a move would be unlike Kloop: he revels in offensive and beautiful football, which is what he might have meant when he said that the match against City was “an opportunity for football.” And it was, despite City’s wanting first half. Kloop’s strategy has always been based on a forward-looking philosophy that advocates stifling and suffocating your opponents by subjecting them to a plethora of attacks and counterattacks. And the German coach got his reward when, after thirty minutes down, Sadio Mané brought the third goal home, upon receiving a royally magnificent cross from Salah. A calamitous night for Pep Guardiola; a moment of unrivaled elation for Jürgen Kloop; a stellar memory for Liverpool fans: But make no mistake about it, this tie is not tied yet.  Beating Premier League teams 4-0 or more, though challenging a task, is not impossible for City’s squad. But again, this is the Champions League, and it is Kloop’s Liverpool. In the other two games of the week, things went as expected. Barça kept being Barça by vanquishing Roma 4-1, while Bayern, although they struggled for it, showed the vibrant and perpetually energetic Sevilla that the game need not respect the veterans. But with 2-1 in the first leg, Bayer should be careful, for the Spaniards can come back–just ask Mourinho and Man United!   So we almost know who will make it to the next round. But hey, this is football: it thrives on uncertainty and implausibility. Guardiola said that his side can come back, that he is unreservedly sure that City will give their fans an incredible show. We’ll find out soon enough. As for us, watchers and fans alike, it is this mindset of shattering the most insurmountable obstacles, of keeping hope alive until the last whistle is blown, that draws us to the incomparable beauty of the beautiful game.

Rabat – The United States has once again reaffirmed its support for Morocco’s autonomy initiative regarding the Western Sahara question, designating it as a “serious, credible and realistic” end to the conflict. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported on Wednesday night that the United States reaffirmed its support for Morocco’s plan, emphasizing that it “is able to satisfy people’s aspirations to manage their own affairs in peace and dignity.” “We maintain that the Autonomy Plan is serious, credible and realistic, and represents a bold approach to finding a definitive settlement to the Sahara issue,” added the US Department of State. The country’s support came amid escalation by the Algeria-backed Polisario Front in the buffer zones east of Morocco’s defense wall. Both the Moroccan cabinet and the United Nations have called for  for the immediate withdrawal of the separatist group. On Wednesday afternoon, Bourita met with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to pass along a written message from King Mohammed VI. Bourita said that the monarch had also held talks with Guterres and shared his concerns regarding the situation in Bir Lahlou and Tifariti, where Polisario has been carrying out illegal military actions. The King  stressed that such actions violate the ceasefire agreement and UN resolutions and “seriously compromise the political process.” The monarch also reiterated that Algeria must bear full responsibility in the conflict: “It is Algeria that host, arms, backs up and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario.” Recently re-elected Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi has also expressed his support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. The Egyptian president received Morocco’s President of Parliament, Habib El Malki, in Cairo, Egypt. During their meeting, Al Sisi expressed his country’s determination to raise to a higher level the centuries-old relations between the two countries. El Malki briefed the Egyptian President about the regional developments that threaten the Morocco’s territorial integrity, including the repetitive incursions by the Algeria-backed Polisario Front into the buffer zone and its ongoing attempts to change the status quo of the region. El Malki stressed that Morocco is committed to defending  its inalienable rights and sovereignty and remains determined to repel any provocations by the Polisario.

Rabat – On Thursday, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani informed his cabinet during the weekly meeting that Morocco has resolutely decided to respond with firmness the maneuvers of the Algeria-backed Polisario Front. “Morocco has sounded the alarm and warned against any attempt to change the status quo in the region,” said El Othmani in response to Polisario’s violations in buffer zones east of Morocco’s defense wall. He added that the country firmly rejects the separatists’ attempt to impose the fait accompli policy in the buffer zone. The Moroccan official also reiterated Morocco’s compliance with the provisions of the 1991 ceasefire agreement. “This is a Moroccan region but, in agreement with the UN, Morocco has accepted that a  buffer zone be established there, for the sole purpose of easing tension.” El Othmani informed his cabinet of King Mohammed VI’s letter to the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, describing the correspondence as a “clear message” to the separatist group. The prime minister expressed his cabinet’s full readiness to counter any future violations of the ceasefire agreement. El Othmani said that some media close to the Polisario are attempting to spread “rumors and inaccuracies” about the content of the report. According to El Othmani, those allegations are “part of the media war” against Morocco’s position on the conflict. In the advanced version of his annual report on the conflict, Antonio Guterres expressed his concerns about Polisario’s renewed presence in the buffer zone and urged it to evacuate.  El Othmani stressed that Morocco is committed to its strong position and that all Moroccans have shown their patriotism and readiness to defend their country’s territorial integrity.

Rabat – Former head of FIFA Sepp Blatter slammed the decision of the world governing football body to hire a Task Force to evaluate the bids submitted to host the 23rd World Cup in 2026. On his Twitter, Blatter recalled a fundamental principle adopted by FIFA in 2011. This principle indicates that “the congress shall decide on the attribution of the World Cup 2026–and not any sub-committee or task-force.” Blatter added that all of the bidders–Morocco and the three-nations North American bid–have the right to “make a presentation” at the congress, referring to the 68th FIFA Congress, to take place on June 13, in Moscow. Blatter’s statements came in response to FIFA’s latest Task Force measure, which will carry out an evaluation of adherence to new bid requirements prior to the FIFA vote in June. Just recall a fundamental principal in FIFA: Decision taken in 2011: the congress shall decide on the attribution of the World Cup 2026 – and not any sub-committee or task-force. Each candidate must have the right to make a presentation at the congress. #Morocco #USA #FIFA #CAF — Joseph S Blatter (@SeppBlatter) April 5, 2018   On March 25, the Royal Football Federation (FRMF) addressed a letter to FIFA regarding  Morocco’s concerns about the fairness and transparency of the procedure. “To my surprise, the scoring system was finally sent to us on March 14–24 hours before Morocco submitted its file and two days before the deadline for the submission of applications to FIFA,” wrote President of FRMF Fouzi Lekjaa. Lekjaa said that this system adds “several technical criteria that were not part of the original regulations,” adding that some principles “have never been transmitted to FRMF in the preparation process of the Moroccan bid.” Subsequently, the Moroccan federation will not accept FIFA’s substantial changes to the original requirements at such a “critical and late stage of the application process.” FIFA responded that the aim of the Task Force is to “determine whether the bids meet the requirements in terms of infrastructure and revenue-cost criteria.” The international body added that FIFA “simply provides a methodology for assessing and documenting the extent to which bids submitted meet these requirements in certain key areas.” Most of the criteria used in the 2026 Task Force are not sine qua non, which results in the exclusion of a bidder if it is not respected. The objective factors that are part of “the evaluation of the bidder.”

By Zoubida Senoussi Rabat – Nadir Khayat – the Moroccan superstar “RedOne” – had a lot to say about his career, the music industry and more importantly his special bond with the late King of Pop, Michael Jackson. In an exclusive interview with the Arab media “Khaleej Times,” the Moroccan-Swedish songwriter opened up about his collaboration and friendship with international superstar Michael Jackson. The Grammy winner was in the recording studio with the King of Pop several times before his 2009 death and says the experience was like no other. “From the musical aspect, he’s a genius. He knew everything there is to know about music. A lot of times, I tend to direct the artist, but with Michael, before I was about to say what I was about to say, he knew what I was going to say,” Lady Gaga’s producer said, before revealing some interesting facts about Jackson’s love for Morocco. “He cared about how you are as a person; he wanted to know about your brothers and sisters, your mum, your country. He told me he’d been to Morocco, he loved Morocco. He told me he loved Moroccan food and wanted to meet my mum; he said he wanted to meet the mum who made this person, because (he said) you’re a beautiful person and he said he wanted to taste her food,” added RedOne. The singer of “Thriller” was supposed to come to Morocco to visits Khayat’s family after a concert in London. “Unfortunately that didn’t happen,” he lamented RedOne continues to shine in the American music industry following the success of his 2017 international hit “Boom Boom,” already viewed more than 110 million times on Youtube. The video–shot in Marrakech, Chefchaouen, Tetouan, Merzouga, and Cabo Negro– features the Puerto Rican singer Daddy Yankee, Moroccan rapper French Montana, and American singer Dinah Jan. RedOne, not only produced the song, but also sings in the chorus. More recently, RedOne announced that he sent a song to FIFA to secure the official 2018 World Cup anthem. The producer has chosen American diva, Lady Gaga to perform his track for the World tournament.

Rabat – Speaking to UN-accredited press in New York, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita shed light on Polisario’s serious incursions in the restricted buffer zones east of the Moroccan berm, displaying evidence of Polisario’s ongoing presence in the region. During his briefing on Wednesday, Bourita informed international press of King Mohammed VI’s letter to the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres. In his letter, King Mohammed VI expressed his concerns over Polisario’s violations of the ceasefire agreement, “which could hinder and undermine the region’s security and the ongoing settlement process under the auspices of the United Nations.” Bourita told the press that Morocco’s reaction to the illegal maneuvers carried out by Polisario in Western Sahara is a “clear message that Morocco has conveyed today to both the presidency of the Council and the UN Secretary-General.” The official also warned the press that the situation is “serious,” as it shifts the legal and historical status of the zone east of the defense structure. The minister also criticized the separatists’ provocative actions, including their attempts to receive Head of UN mission in Western Sahara, Colin Stewart, in the buffer zone, as opposed to the Polisario-run camps, in Tindouf, Algeria. Bourita also pointed out that Morocco has provided the United Nations with proof and evidence of the presence of the Algeria-backed separatists in the region, which MINURSO previously denied. The minister also blamed Algeria for pushing and encouraging Polisario to change the status of the region. “By sharing this information, Morocco has made it clear that it cannot accept such a change. If the international community, the Security Council and the United Nations do not shoulder their responsibility, Morocco will assume its responsibility to avoid such a change, and to prevent such a challenge to international law and UN resolutions, and…to peace and stability in this region.” “Morocco cannot allow this change, and leave this area, which was entrusted to the United Nations, in the hands of a military movement with dubious connections,” he concluded.

Rabat – In a statement made to French sports newsource L’Équipe, the president of the French Football Federation (FFF) has confirmed his support for Morocco’s candidacy for the FIFA 2026 World Cup. Noel Le Graet, the President of FFF, confirmed France’s support of Morocco’s World Cup bid for FIFA 2026. Graet declared, “I cannot imagine not supporting a country so near to us. Africa has only ever hosted one World Cup in all of FIFA’s history (in South Africa in 2010)—that is not a lot. Morocco is ready, even if it does not have some of the resources that it’s adversaries do. France is only one voice, but maybe it can inspire others to also support the Moroccan bid.” The former President of France, Francois Hollande, had already expressed France’s support of Morocco back in March, but Graet’s reiteration of the sentiment makes the alliance all the more official. On April 17, Morocco will welcome members of the Task Force, who will evaluate its candidacy for the World Cup. The Task Force will be comprised of five experts who will consider the country’s infrastructure (e.g. roads, airports, amenities), ranking various factors on a scale of 1-5. Morocco anticipates receiving at least two out of five points in each of the categories, which would qualify it for the final round of its bid, during which the 207 FIFA member countries will select a winner.  The host country for the 2026 World Cup will be announced on June 13, 2018, just prior to the beginning of the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has addressed a new written statement to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, calling on Algeria to fully shoulder its responsibility in the search for a solution to end the regional conflict over Western Sahara. On Wednesday, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita passed along the King’s message to Guterres during their meeting at the UN headquarters in New York. Bourita said that the King expressed “on behalf of the country’s lifeblood, irrespective of their backgrounds, Morocco’s firm and resolute rejection of these provocations and unacceptable incursions.” The King also stated that “Algeria bears a full” responsibility in the conflict. “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario.” Morocco has been long urging Algeria to shoulder full responsibility in Western Sahara, including in the unbearable situation in the Tindouf camps. The North African country has been also urging its eastern neighbor to contribute to finding a solution to end the political conflict that has been ongoing for more than 40 years. At the end of this month, the UNSG will submit his annual report to the Security Council on the Situation on Western Sahara. In his first draft of the report, which was made available on March 31, Guterres denounced Polisario’s activities in the buffer zones of Western Sahara, urging them to withdraw from the region as they did in April 2017. Bourita’s visit came in response to Polisario’s maneuvers in the region. The Moroccan official traveled to the US to hold talks with senior officials in the US and to inform them of the “serious developments,” which could hinder the settlement process under the auspices of the of UN. Bourita also met with US Secretary of State John J. Sullivan on Tuesday. During the meeting, Sullivan reiterated his country’s position on the Western Sahara conflict. Sullivan expressed his gratitude to the Moroccan official and Moroccan people for their “strong partnership and friendship with the United States on shared priorities, including the fight against Daesh,” Sullivan spokesperson Heather Nauert said at the end of the meeting between the two officials.

By Zoubida Senoussi Rabat – “Tariq Ramadan-Gate” isn’t over yet.  An investigation between Mediapart and the Belgium website le Vife have discovered a Belgian-Moroccan woman who cashed in a large sum of money–EUR 27,000, to be exact–in exchange for her silence on the controversial Islamologist Tariq Ramadan.  The woman claims to have been Ramadan’s mistress for five years, ending in 2013. But in a 2014 video, analyzed by Mediapart, she described her relationship with the Islamologist as “destructive,” and referred to Ramadan as “a manipulator.” At the time of the video’s release, she promised to lead a “real fight” against the Islamologist and claimed that he had “trapped” several women. In 2015, the woman created multiple online publications, questioning Ramadan’s towards women. She also posted many videos explaining her misadventures with the “intellectual” man. After Ramadan paid her EUR 27,000, the woman pledged not to defame him on the internet anymore, or to denounce his publications. She also agreed to cease sending “insulting and/or threatening messages” to the Islamologist and his relatives. This case adds to Ramadan’s two recent rape allegations. On January 31, Ramadan was arrested following two accounts of rape filed against him in 2017.  Last month, a French woman of Moroccan origin also filed a rape claim against Ramadan. The 40-year old complainant accused the Islamologist of nine accounts of rape over a span of one year and a half, from February 2013 to June 2014, in Paris, Roissy, Lille, London, and Brussels. Ramadan fully denies the accusations and deems them to be part of a “campaign of lies launched by adversaries—a sentiment shared by his supporters.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat- During the first meeting of the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) on Wednesday,  April 4, Morocco’s head of government Saad Eddine El Othmani called for stronger measures against all forms of corruption. Throughout the meeting, El Othmani stressed the importance of taking strict measures to counter corruption in the country, underscoring the deep-rooted complexity of corruption, as well as its serious threats on Morocco’s development. The head of government underscored the role of NACC in fighting corruption by implementing pertinent strategies to enhance national transparency and positively influence the daily lives of Moroccan citizens. He also noted that alongside King Mohammed VI’s personal project of eliminating corruption in Morocco, the 2011 constitution dedicates an entire chapter to promoting principles of accountability and integrity in the kingdom. Referencing King Mohammed VI’s accession anniversary statements in 2016, he clarified that “combating corruption concerns society and the state along with its institutions,” adding that the nation must continue “accelerating the legal mechanisms to fight this serious phenomenon and criminalize all of its forms to slap away the hands of corrupters.” El Othmani highlighted the success of his government’s efforts to counter bribery, the rate of which  decreased in 2017. He also called for more efforts to boost trust between citizens and government. In the process, El Othmani hailed the role of men and women in the media industry in raising awareness of corruption and pinpointing its many hidden facets:  “The important role of media in tracing similar phenomena should be acknowledged, and in turn, we have sources specialized in monitoring all media reports related to determining [corruption] issues.”  El Othmani concluded by emphasizing  that eliminating corruption is a long-term goal that cannot be achieved without patience and extensive efforts, and that the NACC continues to serve this purpose.

Rabat – Since its readmission in the African Union, Morocco’s diplomacy has increased its focus on the African continent. This Africa-oriented policy of Morocco’s newfound diplomatic assertiveness is especially manifest in the North African country’s status as the second African investor in the rest of Africa. However, Morocco’s “African turn” has been impeded by the slowness with which its ECOWAS membership request is being treated, especially given the rhetoric from some countries claiming that Morocco’s ECOWAS membership would be harmful for the organization. To thwart the growing suspicions regarding Morocco’s eventual admission within the regional body, the Amadeus Institute and the Prospective Agricultural and Rural Initiative (IPAR) organized a conference on March 29, in Dakar, Senegal. Under the theme “Morocco’s ECOWAS Bid: Foundations, Common Stakes, and Perspectives,” participants discussed the possible costs and benefits of Morocco’s bid. In a statement shared with Morocco World News, the Dakar conference organizers expressed their satisfaction at the success of the event, saying that the “conference was an opportunity to hold a sincere dialogue with the involved parties” and important stakeholders in the ECOWAS region. The conference was marked by the presence of political parties, government officials, consumer organizations, civil society groups, investors and representatives of the private sector, as well as researchers from Moroccan and Senegalese think thanks, the statement said. “Discussions explored, without any sort of complacency, political, social, and economic, and security impacts that Morocco’s membership would have on ECOWAS’ member states. While acknowledging the legitimacy of Morocco’s membership request, participants underlined that a series of important questions were sidelined and need to be addressed,” the statement read, adding that a host of participants demanded that both parties (Morocco and its ECOWAS counterparts) agree on “some specific accompanying social measures.” According to the Amadeus Institute and IPAR, the Dakar conference was an opportunity to realize that Morocco’s success in its ECOWAS bid will depend on the organization of a broad “social debate” in Morocco and the ECOWAS area. “Conscious of the lack of communication regarding this crucial issue, the Amadeus Institute and IPAR are calling for the initiation of a regional dialogue between all the involved parties: states, civil society, private sector, and academia.” For the organizers of the Dakar conference, initiating this much-needed broad social dialogue “will allow [Moroccan officials and their ECOWAS counterparts] to plainly explain the stakes and perspectives of Morocco’s bid to society at large, thereby answering growing interrogations about the issue,” and at the same time, convincing said populations to “adhere to Morocco’s vision.” The conference was concluded by the creation of a Morocco-Senegal committee to reflect on what Morocco can bring to the ECOWAS table and build a feasible and effective platform for meeting the growing continental and regional challenges, the statement concluded. This move comes just days after 44 African states signed a free trade agreement to boost and kickstart intra-African exchanges. And Morocco, whose Africa-policy guidelines are in line with a more assertive and integrated Africa, is seeking to convince its fellow African partners of the sincerity of its plans for the continent’s and ECOWAS’ Pan-Africanist aspirations.

Rabat – Polisario’s continuous maneuvers in Western Sahara buffer zones have been fueling the concerns of Moroccan civil and political authorities, who pledged their commitments to counter provocations of the Polisario in restricted areas. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that Moroccan authorities emphasized the need for the United Nations and the UN Security Council to shoulder their responsibility and act firmly against Polisario’s maneuvers to avoid escalation and to maintain peace and security and the region. Condemning Polisario’s violations to the UN Military Agreement 1, Morocco’s Party of Progress and Socialism (PPS) stressed that “the only response to the enemy’s activities and to meet the challenges is firmness and mobilization, based on national consensus around the accuracy of the territorial integrity issue.” According to the party, this challenges can be solved only through Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, which they describe as “serious, realistic and credible, and within the framework of the national territorial integrity.” For its part, Morocco’s Bar Association (l’Association des barreaux du Maroc) has indicated that these provocative acts “constitute a flagrant violation of the 1991 cease-fire agreement in the region and a threat to peace and security, not only for Moroccan Sahara, but in the whole of the region.” The association called on “the international community and the Security Council, in particular, to shoulder their responsibilities and to treat aggressors with the rigor and firmness necessary to preserve peace and security in the region.” The Moroccan body also urged the UN to put pressure on Polisario and to summon the separatist group to withdraw immediately from the buffer zones. During a regular session of the General Council of the UGTM on Sunday, Secretary-General of the General Union of Workers of Morocco (UGTM), Enaâm Mayara, pointed out the constant mobilization of the trade union, in addition all other public and private sectors, to defend the territorial integrity of Morocco and to face all enemy provocations,

Rabat – FIFA has responded to the letter penned by President of the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF) Fouzi Lekjaa regarding Morocco’s concerns on the FIFA 2026 Task Force. FIFA’s response confirms that football’s governing body has received the FRMF letter pertaining to the scoring system used to evaluate the two bids submitted to host the 23rd world premier tournament. According to FIFA, the aim of the Task Force evaluation is to “determine whether the bids meet the requirements in terms of infrastructure and revenue- cost criteria.” The international body added that FIFA “simply provides a methodology for assessing and documenting the extent to which bids submitted meet these requirements in certain key areas.” Most of the criteria used in the 2026 Task Force are not sine qua non, which results in the exclusion of a bidder if it is not respected. The objective factors that are part of “the evaluation of the bidder.” In his letter sent to FIFA on March 25, Lekjaa expressed Morocco’s concerns about the fairness and transparency of the procedure. “To my surprise, the scoring system was finally sent to us on March 14”–24 hours before Morocco submitted its file and two days before the deadline for the submission of applications to FIFA. Lekjaa said that this system adds “several technical criteria that were not part of the original regulations,” adding that some principles “have never been transmitted to FRMF in the preparation process of the Moroccan bid.” Subsequently, the Moroccan federation will not accept FIFA’s substantial changes to the original requirements at such a “critical and late stage of the application process.” In response, FIFA said that “the new criteria do not constitute requirements of the specifications but their rating can influence the overall evaluation.” The 2026 Task Force constitutes a group of football “experts” in charge of evaluating the assets of each bid racing to win the eligibility to host the 23rd FIFA World Cup.

Rabat – Moroccan automotive sector revenues have continued to rise, reaching MAD 50 billion in 2017, compared to MAD 12 billion in 2009, L’Economiste reported in its April 4 edition. Due to an industrial acceleration plan, the automotive industry has experienced notable growth in the last few years, and the trend is expected to continue up through 2020. The automotive sector was the first exporting sector in the Moroccan economy to earn a MAD 50 billion turnover in 2017. The sector aims to double this figure by 2020.  The Moroccan automotive industry development strategy has succeeded in attracting international giants including Renault and PSA Peugeot, along with dozens of equipment manufacturers. The infrastructure quality of two of Morocco’s free zones (Tangier Automotive City and Kenitra Atlantic Free Zone) is also playing a major role in stimulating the economy. L’Economiste affirms that Renault is actually buying automotive pieces manufactured Morocco to use in both of its Moroccan and International factories. The overall cost of the pieces is estimated currently at EU 1 billion per year, but estimated to reach EU 1.5 billion by 2023. The report also pointed out that Renault’s local integration rate exceeds 50 percent, and that the ecosystem it has set up with its suppliers involves an investment of EUR 815 million, resulting in the creation of 14,000 direct and indirect jobs. The PSA group has followed the same upward trend by accelerating the realization of its projects, reaching a total export revenue of MAD 7 billion. Revenues will increase even further  once the PSA Group begins its production. Other industrial free zones in Tetouan, Fez, and Meknes have started to attract numerous equipment manufacturers in the hopes of following similar industrial strategies.

Rabat – Contrary to the UN spokesperson’s categorical denial of any Polisario Front-linked military presence in the Western Sahara buffer zone, there is a wealth of evidence that suggests that “Polisario is indeed engaged in military operations in the buffer zone,” as Le 360 reported earlier today. Upon being asked during a briefing at the UN’s headquarters in New York on Monday, Mr. Stephane Dujarric, who is the UN Secretary General’s spokesperson, said: “With respect to that situation [Polisario’s military presence], our colleagues of MINURSO have not observed any military movements in the north-east territory.” Mr. Dujarric added that “MINURSO continues to monitor the situation closely.” These remarks completely overlook Morocco’s satellite images, which clearly display the considerable Polisario military presence in the buffer zone. Most importantly, however, Mr. Dujarric’s remarks are a glaring disregard of UN Secretary General Antonio Gueterres’s advanced copy of the annual report on the Western Sahara question. In the much-awaited report, Mr. Gueterres expressed his “deep concerns” over the Polisario Front’s military maneuvers in the buffer zone, and “escalating situations” in regions, such as Guerguerat. He also called on them [Polisario militants] to “withdraw from the buffer strip as they did in April 2017,” suggesting that there indeed remains a military presence in the area. Amidst the tensions and the public outcry provoked by Mr. Dujarric’s latest “unfounded denials” of reports by both the UNSG and Moroccan authorities, Le 360 reports that some pro-Polisario outlets have sufficiently covered the front’s military operations in the very region that UNSG’s spokesperson reported having “not observed any military movements.” This clearly discredits the spokesperson’s stance and reports of others who are also “closely monitoring” the situation in the buffer zone, Le 360 said. “No later than December 27, the Algerian state-owned TV channel A3 diffused profuse images of a Polisario military parade, which was performed in the presence of the group’s leader Brahim Ghali in Agouinit, which is situated in the buffer zone,” Le 360 writes. The report further mentions a reportedly militarized sit-in that was recently reported by a pro-Polisario outlet. Under the theme “A Cry Against the Wall,” Polisario activists and militants allegedly gathered to provoke Moroccan security personnel with derogatory and insulting slogans. The “so-called civil society activists” were supposedly demonstrating in the zone to “witness no political movements” as explicitly mentioned in MINURSO’s guidelines for its “peacekeeping mission.”

By Zaina Dali Rabat- One student reflects on citizen responsibility and taking initiative at the 1st International Conference on Education Quality. As I walked up to the stage and took a seat on the Student Ambassadors Scheme roundtable discussion during the 1st edition of the International Conference on Education Quality, I looked at the audience and saw the keynote speakers, professors, researchers, government stakeholders, and students. At that moment, I thought to myself: “This isn’t merely a conference where students hear what older people have to say about us and to us, but a celebration of young people and an acknowledgement of the crucial role we play in the betterment of quality in education.”  Being on stage gave me and other student ambassadors the power to speak our minds and talk about issues in education that matter to us. Over the course of the conference, we discussed issues like overcrowded classes in higher education, special needs education, the privatization of education, infrastructure, job market needs, student orientation, and unemployment. However, the highlight of this experience was that we knew that we were heard and that the audience now knows what students are really capable of. In many conferences and gatherings, the attention seems to be more focused on who’s to be blamed for the situation that education has reached. Students blame universities for lack of orientation, universities blame professors for lack of commitment, and the government is blamed for everything. While throwing the blame on others may make us feel less guilty, it doesn’t make us any less responsible. As a young Moroccan woman, I seize any opportunity I see to make a positive social change and make my voice heard concerning what matters to me and the youth of my community. Morocco has a large youth population, but it is far away from tapping into our potential and developing the quality of education that we deserve. Moreover, I believe that if young people do not take initiatives to be part of this development, if we wait for governments to act, we are doomed to another century of low education quality. I am very passionate about education, and I believe that quality in education can only be a reality when all members of the community work together to assure that the present and future generations receive an education that expands their parameters of thinking, trains them on solving real-life issues, and empowers them to be of benefit to themselves and their country. As former US President John F. Kennedy put it: “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” I do not want to be an insignificant member in my society, and I do not want to participate in any event about education that is like a graveyard: we cry and mourn, wipe our tears, go back to our normal lives, and have some tea. That is why, back in October 2017, when I saw a poster about the International Conference on Education Quality 2018 and read the description, I knew that something great was coming and I wanted to be part of it. I immediately started exploring how I could get involved. I emailed the organizing committee of the ICEQ 2018, expressing my interest in volunteering to help in any way I can. To my surprise, I receive an immediate response from the co-chair and president of the scientific committee of the conference, Dr. Mustapha Aabi, inviting me to attend the first meeting of the newly-established Student Ambassadors Scheme for the conference.Dr. Aabi was very supportive; he trusted our capacity and believed in the work that students can put into the success of the conference. This was shown through the tasks that he delegated it to us: I had to send emails to the participants and speakers of the conference, manage the conference social media accounts, and get involved in public relations, in addition to translating documents. He and Dr. Caroline Jones, the conference co-chair, and Professor Abdelaziz Bendou, the conference chair, have been our mentors since we started conference preparations. They guided us through the whole process, and most importantly, they believed in our potential. The conference participants were impressed by the Student Ambassadors Scheme roundtable discussion and many of them gave us very positive feedback. This was an occasion for us, the students, to show stakeholders and people in higher positions that we have a perspective to share, a voice to be heard, that we are committed, and we can be trusted with the present and future of education in our country. Moroccan young people have a voice, and we deserve to be heard.  I am a product of public education in Morocco: I’ve studied my whole life in Moroccan public schools, and I also went to a public university. I value the education I received in Morocco, and I believe that without it, I would not have reached the level that I have achieved today. After university, I benefited from a scholarship to participate in a cultural and educational exchange program in the United States. All of these experiences made me more aware of my role as a citizen in my society, as well as my role as a university student. In addition, I realized that education in Morocco has its strengths, but it is not yet where it needs to be. The solution is not necessarily to look outside our borders for answers, but rather, the solution is within our nation and resides in our people. We need to invest in students, teachers, and research for higher quality education.

Rabat – At least three people were injured in a shooting at Youtube headquarters in San Bruno, northern California. The suspect, who apparently took her own life following the act, joins a short list of female mass shooters. Police forces arrived to a chaotic scene at the Youtube headquarters after several gunshots were reported on Thursday, when the suspect opened fire with a handgun on an open dining area at the Youtube offices. Local TV stations reported images of Youtube employees, over 1,100 in total, leaving with their hands raised, while other footage showed them forming a queue before being frisked by the police, reported BBC News. Three victims were taken to the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, with one of them suffering serious injuries.  A fourth was victim was later found with an ankle injury sustained while trying to escape the shooting, reported San Bruno Police Chief Ed Barberini.  US President Donald Trump took to Twitter to offer his well-wishes to the victims saying, “Was just briefed on the shooting at YouTube’s HQ in San Bruno, California. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene.” The suspect was identified as Nasim Najafi Aghdam, a 39 years-old California resident of Iranian descent.  The animal rights’ activist previously appeared on a Youtube video accusing the company of discrimination and of filtering her posts in order to prevent them from getting views.  “There is no equal growth opportunity on Youtube or any other video sharing site. Your channel will grow if they want to,” she wrote on her personal website. The suspect’s account on Youtube, Facebook, and Instagram were soon terminated after the shooting.  Ismail Adgham, the suspect’s father, claim to have warned the police that his daughter might be heading to Youtube, as she hated the company, while her brother, who preferred to remain unidentified, claimed that he didn’t know she had a gun in the first place.  Adgham is one of the few women behind mass shootings. According to FBI reports, out of 220 US mass shooting incidents between 2000-2016, only nine of the perpetrators were women.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat- Seven out of ten women are unemployed in Morocco, most of which are housewives, two-thirds of are non degree holders, and over a million are fit to join the workplace.  Ten million women remain outside the labor market in Morocco, with a participation rate of 22.4 percent, compared to the 45 percent in other emerging countries, according to Moroccan francophone newspaper L’Economiste, in its April 2 edition. L’Economiste compared the North African country to Turkey, where women’s employment increased from 20 percent in 2000, to 30 percent in 2014.  The World Bank, as quoted by L’Economiste, considers women’s employability to be a key challenge necessary for Morocco’s economic take-off. Unemployment among women is highly influenced by traditional social norms, which limit women’s participation to the private sphere. Over three-quarters of unemployed Moroccan women are housewives, and while one in five of them do not join the workplace by choice, 8 percent are forced to stay at home by their husbands.  Unemployment also affects unmarried women, as it reaches 45.7 percent of divorced women, 38.9 percent for widows, and 17.9 percent of single women.  Two-thirds of Moroccan women do not hold an academic degree, which makes it even more difficult for them to find jobs.  However, an important number of women predisposed to work remain unemployed. At least one woman in 10 inactive women, is a diploma holder. “This represents a population of 1.1 million people.” Women’s participation “would improve the national activity rate by 4.3 points, and that of women by 8.5 points,” states the article. Women seeking employment are mostly women under 30 years of age, followed by women aged between 30 and 44 years old.  Gender-based discrimination follows Moroccan women to the workplace, as shown by the World Bank’s 2018 “Women, Business and the Law” report, published on March 29. In this report, which studies the economies of 189 countries, Morocco scored between 40 and 91 out of 100 on seven indicators, namely access to institutions (91/ 100), the enjoyment of property (40/100), access to employment (67/100), work incentives for women (60/100), access to justice (75/100 ), access to credit (50/100), and the women’s protection from violence (70/100).

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – In a commanding, 30-minute speech delivered at a conference in Marrakech, the Minister of Moroccans Living Abroad, Abdelkrim Benatiq, challenged Morocco to “find a new approach to immigration: not to treat immigrants as a burden, but rather as new and distinguished capital.” The 3rd forum of Moroccan Competencies Living in the United States, held April 3-4, centers around the theme, “Moroccans of the World: Re-engaging Competencies for the Future.” At the opening ceremony, Benatiq proposed a new narrative for migration, not only in Morocco, but also worldwide. “Borders are finished: we live in a globalized world. Those who choose globalization should accept that there will be pros and cons…instead of closing the door.”  Read Also: Abdelkrim Benatiq Brings Western Sahara Issue to Moroccan Community in US At the conference, freedom of movement was framed as a facet of entrepreneurial freedom. Morocco has historically been a country of emigration, with an estimated 5 million Moroccans living abroad. However, as Morocco develops into a destination country for migrants across Africa, Benatiq insisted that Morocco cannot simply look at its legacy of emigration but must also address the future. The minister’s comments referenced King Mohammed VI’s 2014 and 2017 campaigns to regularize and integrate undocumented migrants living in Morocco. According to the minister, the policy was initially created “with limited resources but with political will” and now serves as a model in many other countries. President of Moroccan Entrepreneurs of the World (MeM) Adil Zaidi called Morocco not only a “logistical hub” in the Mediterranean region, but also “an African hub.” He encouraged pan-African investment, saying, “Africa is our continent.”  Morocco has begun to draw from the collective experiences of the Moroccan diaspora “by considering themselves as actors of the economic and social development of the country,” according to a press statement. Al Akhawayn University President Driss Ouaouicha underscored the importance of, “learning how to bridge the gaps between the two cultures and the two ways of seeing the world.” Read Also: Benatiq Calls on Moroccans in Germany to Join Development Project Initiated by King Mohammed VI  Approximately 150,000 Moroccans live in the United States; the April 3-4 proceedings in Marrakech offer a panel of Moroccan born, US-based speakers an opportunity to connect and share their expertise with entrepreneurs still living in the kingdom. The 27 speakers hail from a variety of sectors and organizations, ranging from computer science to dentistry, the International Monetary Fund to the Hawaii state government. “In contrast to some clichés and prejudices about migration and migrants, our compatriots are distinguished by their skills, their performance, and their good performance in their host countries,” said the MeM president at the conference’s opening. “They constitute a relay and a link between the entrepreneurship of the host country and that of Morocco, and now that of Africa.” The event was organized by the Ministry of Moroccans Residing Abroad and Migration Affairs in conjunction with the General Confederation of Moroccan Companies (CGEM). Last July, the Ministry of Moroccans Residing Abroad and Migration Affairs and the CGEM launched MeM and named it the “13th Region” of the CGEM. MeM aims to create a digital platform for professional exchange between entrepreneurs and to support the integration of Morocco’s global entrepreneurs into the kingdom’s economy.

By Zoubida Senoussi Rabat – Hervé Renard has had enough of the fake news. Yesterday, Al Akhbar wrote an article stating that Morocco’s national football coach “would leave the Atlas Lions just after the Russian World Cup.” Al Akhbar is supporting its claim by citing a source that is allegedly “close to Renard,” adding that Renard will be in advanced negotiations with European football clubs and several federations including those from the Ivory Coast, Algeria, and even the United Arab Emirates. According to that same source, the former coach of Zambia allegedly expressed regret for having extended to four years his first contract, because the FRMF may well, in case of refusal of amicable separation, require substantial damages for prior termination of the contract. Following the rumors, Renard released a statement in his Facebook account to reassure the Moroccans that he is not going anywhere. “In order to immediately stop all rumors and unfounded speculation reported by some media today, I say calmly but firmly: ‘I am very very happy to be in Morocco!’, he wrote, adding that his only concern today is to do his best possible for the national team at the World Cup in Russia, expected for 20 years by the Moroccan people. Hervé Renard continues to condition his future in Morocco to the results that the national team will achieve in Russia next June. He believes that the Lions’ team “needs to improve its ball possession, as well as its ball recuperation techniques in order to compete with other teams” at this summer’s World Cup in Russia.

By Zoubida Senoussi Rabat – Winston Churchill once said that Marrakech was “the loveliest spot in the whole world.” The British politician spent the winter of 1935 painting while vacationing in Morocco. During his stay, Churchill grew to love the North African country, especially its red city, Marrakech. The former prime minister also called Marrakech the “Paris of the Sahara” because of the contrast between the city’s desert location and the backdrop of the Atlas Mountains that surround it. This image inspired Churchill to create some of his finest paintings. Accompanied by paintings by other artists, Churchill’s works will be displayed in the Heather James Fine Art of San Francisco gallery from June 1-30. Some of his oil paintings (all created between 1920-1940) will include, “nine landscapes plus a coastal scene and a still-life painting, and  other works that depict estates, gardens, and his [Churchill’s] family’s favorite destinations, including France and Morocco,” according to “themalaymailonline.” “Morocco was to me a revelation,” the former UK prime minister wrote in a 1936 article, reprinted by the Daily Mail that reading about politics in Morocco. “doesn’t afford the slightest impression of the charm and value of this splendid territory.”  “Herein these spacious palm groves rising from the desert [Marrakech], the traveler can be sure of perennial sunshine, of every comfort and diversion, and can contemplate with ceaseless satisfaction the stately and snow-clad panorama of the Atlas Mountains. The sun is brilliant and warm but not scorching; the air crisp, bracing but without being chilly; the days bright, the nights cool and fresh,” he added.

Rabat- United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres has reiterated his call for the Algeria-backed Polisario Front to withdraw from the Western Sahara buffer zone of Guerguerat in the face of rising tension in the region. In a statement to the Security Council received by the Associated Press, Guterres urged the main parties–Morocco and Polisario–to the conflict to “refrain from actions that could affect the ceasefire in their 42-year conflict over the Western Sahara.” The UN chief has also reportedly urged Morocco to “reconsider its refusal to send an expert mission as part of the UN effort to address questions raised by the Guerguerat situation.” Guterres’ statement was reported on April 2, the same day when his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric denied the presence of any military activities in buffer zones despite Morocco’s repeated warnings of Polisario’s provocative escalation in restricted zones, including Guerguerat. The UN official added that he “was encouraged by new steps” introduced by his Personal Envoy Horst Kohler to “relaunch political negotiations and urges additional steps by the parties, neighboring countries and other key players.” Dujarric said that the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) has not observed any military activities in the region, adding that the mission continues to oversee the situation “closely.” In contrast to these statements, in the advanced copy of his annual Report on the Situation in the Western Sahara, the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, expressed his concerns over Polisario’s presence in restricted zones and called for an immediate withdrawal similar to that of April 2017. Morocco believes that Polisario’s activities in the region is a justification for a possible war, urging the UN and Security Council to shoulder responsibility and put pressure on the separatist group to withdraw from the region. The North African country has also promising to deter any future provocative actions from the front that could hinder settlement process and undermine the stability of the region.

Rabat –  While the Arab world and Africa are set to support Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid, thus giving the African Kingdom an edge over United 26, Saudi Arabia has chosen to lend its support to United 26. Earlier today, the chairman of the Saudi general Sports Authority (GSA) Turki Al Sheikh met with Carlos Cordeiro, the president of the United States Soccer (footabll) Federation, to express Saudi Arabia’s country’s endorsement of the joint American bid (USA/Canada/Mexico). “I was pleased to meet Mr. Carlos Cordeiro, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, and chairman of the United 2026,” the Saudi official said on Twitter shortly after his meeting with the chairman of the North American joint bid. Mr. Al Sheikh’s latest move is the consolidation or confirmation of a series of tweets the Saudi recently posted about his country’s position on the 2026 bid. Saudi football’s chairman’s position has been dubbed as a purely political move, and one that puts the country’s bilateral and strategic relationships with the U.S over its closeness with the Arab world which is overwhelmingly in favor of a Moroccan win on June 13. Others have linked Saudi Arabia’s decision not to support Morocco’s bid with the North African Kingdom’s neutral position in the Gulf crisis. “We will look for Saudi Arabia’s interest first,” Mr. Al Sheick responded some weeks ago while commenting on the high probability that his country would rather choose the bid featuring its most important strategic ally: the U.S. “Friendship and fraternity have been very detrimental to the Saudis… what really matters to me is that the 2026 World Cup needs to be hosted in the best conditions,” the Saudi also said in mid-March, again tacitly suggesting that United 26 was the Saudi federation’s choice.

Rabat – Morocco’s public external debt continued rising to stand at nearly MAD 332.35 billion in 2017, compared to MAD 312.46 billion in 2016, according to the Department of Treasury and External Finances (DTFE) of Economy and Finance Ministry. The external public debt statistics up to December 2017 report, issued recently by the ministry of economy, shows that public external debt represents 31 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017, compared to 30.8 percent a year earlier.  The Statistical Bulletin of the external public debt structure, indicated that multilateral creditors are the first grouping of Morocco’s creditors with a share of 47.3 percent of the public external debt, followed by bilateral creditors with 29.3 percent and monetary financial institutions and commercial banks with 23.4 percent.  The report also indicated that public institutions and enterprises (EEP) are the main borrowers followed by the Treasury. Their debts amounted respectively to MAD 179.3 billion and MAD 153.1 billion. The distribution of the public external debt by currency shows that the euro accounts for the lion’s share with 61.1 percent, while the dollar accounts for 27.8 percent, according to the DTFE. Regarding the interest rate, fixed-rate debt dominates with 74 percent, while variable interest rate debt represents 26 percent. The Statistical Bulletin of the Public External Debt is intended to provide public external debt statistics, in order to complement those provided by IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and to allow internal and external users to have a broad set of relevant information and statistics on the country’s debt position.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – United States government document indicates that the pentagon approved the delivery of USD 115 million equipment in September, under the Excess Defense Articles program (EDA), which allows US foreign allies to benefit from surplus defense equipment, at a reduced or no cost.  In addition to 162 Abrams, American third-generation main battle tanks, Morocco also received tracked command post vehicles, grenade launchers, howitzers, as well as 419 armored personnel carriers, reported the Arab-American media site Al-Monitor.  The same source stated that the headquarters of the US Department of Defense, Pentagon, deals with Morocco during President Donald Trump’s first year in office, accounted for over a quarter of the USD 430 million total authorized or delivered to the Middle East.  The article notes that US military equipment to Morocco, already largest US weapon buyer in Africa, have increased during the last years, indicating that Pentagon is considering other programs to accelerate the process instead of relying on programs that require extensive approval. Strategic and research analyst Seth Binder, as quoted by Al-Monitor, confirmed this increase saying that Rabat receives “USD 15 million a year in [regular] military aid from the US, so USD 100 million for one project is pretty massive,” he added, “people complain that the arms sales process is too slow. I have been wondering if they use EDA if that process would speed up.” Administered by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the  EDA program was established in 1961 declares that “excess by Military Departments can be offered to foreign governments or international organizations in support of US national security and foreign policy objectives.” In Morocco’s case, these deliveries are part of US and European efforts to strengthen Morocco’s military against regional challenges of drug-trafficking, and the escalation of terrorist networks in North Africa as the Islamic State demises in Iraq and Syria.

Rabat – The president of the Moroccan Royal Football Federation, Fouzi Lekjaa, addressed a letter to the head of FIFA, Gianni Infantino on March 25, condemning  FIFA’s 2026 Task Force. FIFA made its announcement just a few days after the publication of the 2026 World Cup bid books of both Morocco and the joint three-nation North American bid. The 2026 Task Force constitutes a group of football “experts” in charge of evaluating the assets of each bid racing to win the eligibility to host the 23rd FIFA World Cup. In the letter published by FRMF,  Lekjaa expressed Morocco’s concerns about the fairness and transparency of the procedure. “To my surprise, the scoring system was finally sent to us on March 14”–24 hours before Morocco submitted its file and two days before the deadline for the submission of applications to FIFA. Denouncing the FIFA’s surprising measure, Lekjaa said that this system adds “several technical criteria that were not part of the original regulations,” adding that some principles “have never been transmitted to FRMF in the preparation process of the Moroccan bid. “The FRMF is satisfied that the scoring system established by the Task Force for the evaluation of the nomination files does not comply with the requirements of the regulations concerning the bidding and selection of the host country or countries of the 2026 World Cup,” reads the letter addressed to Infantino. Subsequently, the Moroccan Federation will not accept FIFA’s substantial changes to the original requirements at such a “critical and late stage of the application process.” Before Morocco, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) condemned the Task Force system, emphasizing that this group is made up of “Infantino’s boys.” ESPN reported that CAF believes that this could be a plot to rule our Morocco’s bid before the June 13 vote. On June 6, FIFA will name the successful bids, which will be eligible to move to the next voting stage. After Morocco’s announced its bid to host the world’s premier tournament, a unanimous decision was announced by FIFA to expand FIFA World CUp to 48 teams, beginning in 2016. Meanwhile, this year’s World Cup and the following tournament in 2022 in Qatar include only 32 squads. FIFA’s decision, however, did not deter Morocco’s determination. Morocco has reaffirmed its readiness to host the tournament.  The Moroccan bid has received the support of many international countries, who promised to give their voice to the African bid. The list of Morocco’s bid supporters, includes Belgium, Qatar, Russia, Algeria, Tunisia, Nigeria, Botswana, Luxembourg, Saint Lucia, France, and Serbia.

Rabat – Morocco will use its high-resolution surveillance satellite to monitor the Western Sahara buffer zones, which have seen Polisario escalation in recent months. According to Moroccan newspaper Al Massae, Morocco has decided to use its military satellite, launched in November 2017, to monitor Polisario’s movements in restricted zones, including Mahbes, Tifariti, Guerguerat, and Bir Lahlou. The separatist group has been threatening to relocate its facilities, including the its “defense ministry” in Bir Lahlou, located 230 kilometers away from the Es-Semara provinces in Moroccan territory. The front has reportedly established tents in the restricted zones, and has continuously defied the UN 1991 ceasefire agreement since its ratification. The newspaper added that images taken by the satellite dubbed Mohammed VI-1, are forwarded to General Abdelfattah Louarrak, Inspector General of the Moroccan Royal Army (FAR), Nasser Bourita, the Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs, a well as other security and military authorities. Moroccan press reported on Monday, that Morocco’s army had announced its readiness to respond to any possible provocations in the Western Sahara buffer zones. King Mohammed VI and Morocco’s government have been calling on the United Nations and its security council to pressure the Polisario to withdraw from the buffer zones of the region, as it did in April 2017. Moroccan officials have also warned that the nation will not stand idly by, and continue to defend its territorial integrity at all costs, emphasizing that  any attempt by Polisario to change the status quo of the buffer zone could constitute a “casus belli.”

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat- Saudi Arabia announced in a press release on Monday, April 2, that “spying” on spouse’s phone is now considered a criminal offence, and is punishable by a fine of SAR 500,000 (USD 133,000) and one year in jail. Among the many recent changes in law provisions–including allowing women to drive, to attend concerts, and to apply for jobs in fields previously unavailable to them–Saudi Arabia has now adopted an anti-cybercrime law on “spying,” states Saudi Arabia’s Center For International Information:  “Married individuals planning to spy on their spouse in Saudi Arabia will need to think twice, because they could potentially attract a fine of SAR 500,000 (USD 133,000, or EUR 108,000), along with a year-long prison term.”  The new law prohibits the act of “snooping” through a spouse’s personal data or gaining illegitimate access to their computers or mobile phones with intentions of blackmail. “Spying, or interception of data transmitted through an information network or a computer without legitimate authorization,” or “unlawful access to computers with the intention of threatening or blackmailing someone into taking or refraining from an action (be it lawful or unlawful),” emphasized the same source. The press release added that harsher punishments will fall upon those who delete, erase, leak, or destroy another person’s data.  “Unlawful access to computers with the intention to delete, erase, destroy, leak, damage, alter or redistribute private data…Offenders could be jailed for maximum of four years and fined up to SAR 3 million.” This law came as a response to an increase in cyber crimes, such as blackmail, embezzlement, and defamation in Saudi Arabia.

Washington D.C. – Since the meeting of the interior and foreign affairs ministers with the joint committee of the parliament in charge of foreign policy on Sunday, April 1, we have witnessed a proliferation of statements by Moroccan officials on Morocco’s determination to repel any Polisario attempt to change the status of the buffer zone in the Western Sahara.  This new official rhetoric is characterized by Morocco’s willingness to respond in force, should the Polisario follow through on its recent threats to impose fait accompli in the region, specifically relocating part of the front’s “Ministry of Defense” to the Bir Lahlou area. Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Omar Hilale, could not be more clear in the letter he sent Sunday evening to the president of the Security Council for the month of April. The Moroccan diplomat declared that any attempt by the Polisario to change the status quo in the region would constitute a cause for war. This remark has raised several questions across the country: Does Morocco really intend to engage in an armed confrontation against the Polisario? If this is the case, why choose to do so less than four weeks before the UN Security Council renews the MINURSO mandate, and what would be the consequences for both parties in the event of an armed confrontation? Apart from the patriotic revival that events of such magnitude could cause among Moroccans, if we pause a moment to analyze the context in which Morocco decided to threaten the Polisario with armed conflict, we will realize that the region is still far from the brink of a new war over the Sahara. The context in which Morocco has decided to beef up its rhetoric and demonstrate its readiness to resort to war is telling as to its intended outcome. Rabat resolved to go on the offensive three days after the publication of the advanced copy of the annual report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.  In the report, which could be described as rather favorable to Morocco, the Secretary-General expresses his concern about the ongoing presence of the Polisario in the buffer zone of Guerguerate and urges the front to evacuate the zone as in April 2017. At the same time, the Secretary-General welcomed the measured response of Morocco to Polisario’s actions in the buffer zone. Antonio Guterres’s new report creates a positive momentum for Morocco a few weeks before the Security Council adopts a new resolution on the conflict. Wanting to take advantage of this new momentum, Morocco has decided to escalate its rhetoric to push the Council to harden its stance with the Polisario compared to the previous year. This time around, Morocco not only wants to stop the Polisario’s incursions in the Guerguerate, but also to prevent it from changing the status quo in the whole area located east and south of Morocco’s defense wall.  On the eve of the adoption of the annual Security Council resolution last year, the Polisario announced in extremis its decision to withdraw from the Guerguerate. The draft resolution that the Security Council was about to adopt on April 27, 2017, welcomed Morocco’s withdrawal from the buffer zone, and expressed its deep concern over the Polisario’s ongoing presence. In addition, the draft resolution strongly urged the Polisario to evacuate the region within 30 days and asked the Secretary-General to brief it on the subject and recommend next steps. But just as the security council was preparing to vote on the resolution, the Polisario sent a letter to its members, informing them of its decision to redeploy its armed elements outside Guerguerate. Thanks to this decision, the separatist movement managed to avoid the adoption of a resolution that would have exposed it to sanctions in case non-compliance with the provisions of the ceasefire agreement. Since the adoption of resolution 2351, the Polisario has repeatedly made incursions in the Guerguerat area and elsewhere in the buffer zone, due to the absence of strong and binding language of the resolution. Moroccan diplomats identified the Polisario’s last-minute decision as a stratagem that would mean repeat incursions into the buffer zone.  On the same day that the Polisario informed the security council of its decision to redeploy its armed elements, Morocco expressed dissatisfaction and insisted that “a simple redeployment does not constitute a withdrawal of the Polisario from the zone.” In the letter that Morocco’s Permanent Representative of Morocco to the UN sent to the UN Security Council, he expressed the hope that “neither MINURSO nor the Department of Peacekeeping Operations will fall for [this] masquerade.” Morocco’s announcement that all options are open, including war, is, therefore, part of a strategy to push the Council to take a strong stance on the Polisario and adopt a resolution containing a binding language. This would  serve as a deterrent and permit an appropriate response in case the Polisario tries, once again, to change the status quo of the region or violate the ceasefire and the military agreement 1. Morocco also seeks to take advantage of two important factors: 1) The Security Council is chaired by Peru, a country that has shown positive intentions towards Morocco in recent times. Peru expelled the so-called ambassador of Polisario last September. It is very likely that the President of the Council will convene one or two meetings to discuss the latest developments on the ground. 2) Unlike in previous years and last year, the composition of the security council is favorable to Morocco. Besides the five permanent members, among the ten non-permanent members of the Council, Bolivia and Ethiopia are the only countries that recognize the self-proclaimed SADR. This is a policy boon compared to last year, when the security council had four countries recognizing the Polisario state: Namibia, Ethiopia, Bolivia, and Uruguay. The latter two fiercely opposed the firm language of the first draft resolution proposed by the United States, and pressured the Council to adopt a more balanced resolution in response. There is no doubt that the dynamics of the negotiations in the security council will be favorable to Morocco this year. Though it is expected that Bolivia will remain resolutely opposed to Morocco, it is likely that Ethiopia will adopt a nuanced position, given the revival of diplomatic relations between Rabat and Addis Ababa. During the negotiations that preceded the adoption of resolution 2351, Ethiopia was careful not to take positions hostile to Morocco and it is likely that it will adopt the same position this year. In light of the above information, what we are witnessing is the adoption of well thought-out strategy of Moroccan diplomacy whose ultimate goal is to force the Polisario to put an end to its provocations in the region. At the same time, Morocco seeks also to reorient the debate within Security Council and negotiations surrounding the conflict ahead of the adoption of the new resolution, in order to challenge the legitimacy of the Polisario and its readiness to reach a mutually-acceptable political solution.  That being said, one thing is clear: Morocco has no interest in engaging in an armed conflict with the Polisario. Such a scenario would open a diplomatic Pandora’s box that would serve the Polisario’s long-term goal of mobilizing international public opinion in its favor. Morocco has less interest in engaging in an armed conflict with the Polisario now that John Bolton has been appointed as National Security Advisor in President Donald Trump’s cabinet; the hawkish designate will likely blur the US position on the conflict, as Bolton is known for sympathizing with the Polisario.Morocco has every interest in avoiding steps that could disrupt the balance of power in the region.  The strategy that Morocco has successfully maintained since the signing of the ceasefire in 1991 has served to preserve and control the status quo of the conflict, with largely successful results and few setbacks. Diplomatic efforts would do well to continue this approach, as any outbreak of armed conflict would completely change the situation and put Morocco under pressure.

Rabat – Recent developments in the Western Sahara dominated the opening speech of the Minister of Moroccans Living Abroad, Abdelkrim Benatiq, during the opening day of the 3rd Forum on Moroccan Competencies Living in the United States in Marrakech. The international conference, attended by MWN, mobilizes Moroccan expats to share their know-how and insights about life abroad on a variety of topics, including education, health, and technology.  In his speech, Benatiq said that Morocco convinced the world–including the United States–that there is no way to “create a small and a fragile state in a strategic region,” as the presence of the separatists in such a sensitive area undermines the stability of the neighboring regions, including the Sahel, the Malian border, and Europe. The official said that “after Polisario has not been able to establish a state that could serve the interests of another country, Polisario are seeking to create legal issues between Morocco and its partners,” referring to the European Union. To do so, Polisario has been attempting to deter Morocco-European Union partnerships through its appeals to the European Union Court of Justice (ECJ) to end agreements between the bodies, such as the fisheries deal. The Polisario has also framed the conflict in a way to undermine the key Moroccan-European values of democracy and human rights. However, Benatiq categorized these attempts as “failed” due to the“strong bonds” between Morocco and the EU, which have existed for more than 60 years. The Moroccan official stressed the importance of political stability for these political and economic partnerships. Referring to Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, the official said that Morocco has presented the Sahrawi Population in the Tindouf camps with “the best solution” to the decades-long conflict, which has been exploited by Polisario to propagate discord. The official also categorized the advanced copy of the annual UN Secretary-General report on the situation in the Western Sahara, as a balanced and fair document. Morocco to Host Flagship Migration Event During his presentation, the Moroccan Minister also informed the attendees of other flagship events that Morocco will host this year, including the UN’s 2018 intergovernmental conference on international migration. The conference will see the adoption of the global compact for safe, orderly, and regular migration. Morocco will also host the 11th summit of the World Forum on Migration and Development, to be co-chaired by Morocco and Germany. The event will take place in December in Marrakech. According to Benatiq, the UN choice acknowledges Morocco’s role in protecting the rights of migrants, in accordance with the 2013 National Policy on Immigration and Asylum. This policy was launched in September 2013, under the instructions of King Mohammed VI Morocco has distinguished itself as a regional leader in immigration, evidenced by its 2014 regularization campaign for migrants and refugees aiming to settle in the country. In recent years, this policy and shifting migration patterns have established Morocco as a country of destination rather than solely transit, for refugees and migrants aiming to reach Europe.

By Zoubida Sennousi Rabat – A rising star in the Bollywood film industry, Nora Fatehi is a 27 year-old Moroccan-Canadian actress and dancer with a huge international following. Her notoriety is due to her active presence on Instagram and Youtube, where she regularly posts photos and videos that highlight her passion for dance. Unfortunately, as Fatehi rose in success, she accumulated more than just fame and fortune: cyberbullies.  Fatehi is constantly targeted by “trolls,” who criticize her work and pictures across her social media accounts. The model-actress feels like her “haters” have been “safe in the cyber world for too long,” and says it is time to speaks out against them. “Trolling is a cyber-crime. If you are caught, you cannot run away by saying that you are entitled to your own opinion. Everyday people struggle with self-esteem issues or, even worse, commit suicide because of trolls,” Fatehi said in a recent interview with the Indian outlet Business Standard. “If you have a point of view regarding my style of work, you are not entitled to express your opinion. Having said that, unfortunately many comments are sexual and derogatory in nature, demeaning to me as a woman and as a human being. You need to face the consequence of your opinions; you need to own up for your act. Trolls and cyberbullies have been feeling too safe in the cyber world for too long,” Fatehi remarked. http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/nora-fatehi-feels-it-is-time-to-act-against-cyber-bullies-118033000644_1.html.  Fatehi also noted that, “Unfortunately, a lot of people take out their personal frustrations on social media. Moreover, the belly dancer thinks that the internet is “a safe environment and a place” where bullies reveal their true colors and easily express their hate towards other people. “They use the Internet to hide behind a screen because it gives them a safe environment and space where their true psychopathic tendencies are revealed,” added the actress. A few days ago, Fatehi refused to perform in Pakistan when invited on a TV show. According to the Indian press, Nora’s dance videos have a huge fan base in Pakistan, where she had been receiving requests for performances and shows. Nora was concerned about her personal security regarding cyberbullies.  https://www.instagram.com/p/Bg6hTogBrJS/?hl=fr&amp;taken-by=norafatehi

Rabat – Amid Moroccan anger over Polisario’s presence in buffer zones of Western Sahara, spokesman of the United Nations Secretary-General, Stéphane Dujarric, said that members of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) have not “observed any military elements in the northeast territory.” When asked about the United Nations’ opinion on Moroccan charges of illegal Polisario activity in the region, Dujarric said that his colleagues in MINURSO have not discerned any activities in the region, adding that the mission continues to monitor the situation “closely.” The UN spokesperson made his remarks in a briefing (00:26:00) at the United Nations headquarters in New York on April 2. In contrast to these statements, in the advanced copy of the his annual report on the Situation in the Western Sahara, the United Nations Secretary General, Antonio Guterresm,  expressed his concerns over Polisario’s presence in restricted zones and called for an immediate withdrawal similar to that of April 2017. Morocco has been warning the MINURSO and UN Security Council of Polisario’s activities in the region, stressing the need for immediate intervention to avoid further escalation. Military elements of the Polisario Front have repeatedly  violated the 1991 ceasefire agreement through its repetitive incursions into the buffer zone.  In the advanced of the report he released on March 29, Antonio Guterres expressed his deep concern about the Polisario’s ‘renewed presence’ in the Guerguerat. Moroccan press reported on Monday that the Moroccan army is preparing to respond to any new provocations from the front in the buffer zones. During an emergency meeting with a joint committee of both chambers of the Moroccan parliament, Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit, described the situation in the region as “dangerous.” That same day, Moroccan Ambassador to the UN Omar Hilale addressed a letter to the UN Security Council, urging it to prevent the Polisario front from changing the status quo in the region. Hilale  warned the security council that any attempt by the front to change the status quo of the buffer zone could constitute a “casus belli,” emphasizing that Morocco will not “stand idly,” but rather deter and repel Polisario’s repeated “provocations.” King Mohammed VI, according to Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, expressed his condemnation to the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres. El Othmani made his statement on Monday in a meeting convening trade unions, secretaries-general, and representatives of all political parties. The meeting aimed at informing all officials of the  “dangerous development” in the region.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat- The Spanish authorities have prohibited the passage of Moroccan women carrying heavy loads on their backs through the Sebta (Ceuta) border starting April 2. Henceforward, women who transport counterfeits will have to use rolling carts. Mule women are Moroccan women used by merchants to transport up to 100 kilograms of goods from the tax-free Spanish protectorate through official entry points to Moroccan territory, typically for a meager pay that varies from MAD 50 (USD  5) to 100 (USD 10), depending on the nature of the goods. The Tradesmen Association of Sebta announced that women can continue to pass with goods, as long as they use rolling carts, rather than carry the goods on their backs. The association’s president maintains that this resolution bears humanitarian purposes in mind: “It is no longer acceptable to see images of women carrying heavy loads on their backs like mules. It’s inhuman,” they explained. In addition to ending the phenomenon of “women mules,” this decision will significantly reduce the weight carried, no set between 20-25 kilograms, thus limiting the risks of injuries and the escalation to stampedes, in case of jostling. In 2017, three separate stampedes were reported. The first incident occurred on March 28, resulting in the death of one woman, while the second incident took place on April 24, claiming the life of a 50-year old woman. The third calamity occured on August 28, when two women were killed and several others were left injured. On January 15, 2018, two women died in the same circumstances while several others suffered injuries. The new measures were put into effect with the reopening of the border crossing “Tarajal II,” following a week closure on the occasion of the “Semana Santa” holiday, during which the city only opened its doors to tourists.

The conference’s press release sheds light on the importance of dialogue between Morocco and other African regions, as well as other countries in the world, in promoting tourist destinations and strengthening geopolitical ties. In a recent survey issued by an EU-based online market research firm, ResearchAndMarkets.com, Morocco was described as Africa’s leading tourist market. The survey stated that Morocco garnered over 10 million foreign visitors in 2016.

By Zoubida Senoussi Rabat – Maître Gims is in a precarious situation right now. The Congolese rapper has been the center of media attention since he was denied French nationality a few weeks ago. The singer-songwriter expressed his disappointment in  France’s refusal to grant him French citizenship. “Iy first request [for French citizenship] was quickly rejected and I don’t understand why,” Gims said in an interview with the French television program En Balade Avec.  But we might know the reason behind his citizenship rejection… According to the French magazine Closer, the famous Francophone singer is still married to “a French woman living in Morocco,” and never filed for divorce before he tied the knot with his new wife, DemDem, in 2005. Gims had converted to Islam back in 2004, before taking a second wife. “Maître Gims is now married to two women, and this has hindered the artist’s candidacy for French nationality even though he has been living in France since he was 2 years old,” added the tabloid. “According to France’s policies on foreigner residency, it is forbidden to live ‘in a state of polygamy’”, points out Closer, explaining why Gims’ application for citizenship was likely rejected. Nevertheless, Gims continues to profess his affection for  France and his attachment to French language and culture. “I feel French. After all, being French is  not just a title on a paper–it’s a way of life. Today, I am French, I speak French, I love the French language, and I am an ambassador of the French language all over the world.” Maître Gims was born in the Congo in 1986 under the name “Gandhi Djuna,” but spent his childhood  in France. Starting in 2002, Gims kicked-off his career in France as a singer and a rapper with the French hip-hop group, “Sexion d’Assaut.” He began his solo career in 2013.

Rabat – After months of Polisario’s escalation in buffer zones of Western Sahara, Morocco’s army has begun mobilizing its personnel in  southern Morocco to repel any possible new “provocations.” Since December 2017, Morocco has informed the United Nations of the “provocations” of the separatist group in buffer zones of Western Sahara, including Guerguerat, Bir Lahlou, and Mahbes. In addition to defying the United Nations and its 1991 ceasefire agreement through its continuous presence in the restricted buffer zones, the separatists have reportedly  established tents in the restricted zones and announced the relocation of their military facilities to Bir Lahlou, another area of the buffer zone, located 230 kilometers away from the Es-Semara provinces in Moroccan territory.  Sources from Laayoune told Moroccan news outlet Hespress that high-level military reinforcements arrived in the city, including military trucks and other equipment, to deter any future provocations by the separatist group. Meanwhile, news sources close to the Polisario expressed the front’s “readiness to respond to any Moroccan move that would undermine the liberated territory or change the status quo.” On Sunday, the Moroccan parliament held an emergency meeting with Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, and Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit. During the meeting, political parties condemned Polisario’s actions, calling on the government to respond strongly to its “provocations.”  On Sunday night, Morocco’s Ambassador to the UN, Omar Hilale, addressed a letter to the UN Security Council, urging it to take responsibility and to compel the Polisario to respect the provisions of the ceasefire and Military Agreement 1.  Hilale made clear to the Security Council that any attempt by the Polisario to change the status quo of the buffer zone could constitute a “casus belli.” Hilale emphasized that Morocco will resort to all means necessary to deter and repel Polisario’s “provocations.”   “Morocco will not stand idly by the deterioration of the situation on the ground,” said Hilale Polisario’s coordinator with the United Nations mission in the territory, known as MINURSO,  Mhamed Khadad, described Morocco’s warnings an “attempt to disavow the peace process.” He said that the separatist group will respond “to any breach of the ceasefire.”

Rabat – Moroccan and international officials are gathering in Marrakech today to discuss the judicial system under the symposium theme, “The Independence of the Judiciary,” which King Mohammed VI referred to as an important aspect for “any judicial system that seeks a greater role in safeguarding rights and freedoms.” In conjunction with the symposium, the King addressed a message on Monday to the participants of the event, calling on them to seize the opportunity to come up with solutions to “common challenges” facing all international judicial systems, including in Morocco. The King said in his statement that the symposium is taking a place at a time of  major national judicial reforms. According to the sovereign, Morocco is keen to update its judicial sector to meet the demands and modern concerns of citizens, including those engaged in lawsuits. “My country has sought to lay the foundations for judicial independence, taking the necessary institutional, legislative, and practical measures to that end,” he said. In his note, the King made reference to Morocco’s constitution and its principles, especially that of impartiality, regarding the judicial system. According to the King, the Moroccan constitution “prohibits any interference in the cases being prosecuted and the law provides for sanctions against any attempt to influence judges.” The King promised the participants of the symposium wide-reaching reform, including legislative, organizational, and practical reforms. The said reforms are being prepared by a group of “eminent judges, lawyers, judicial experts, and professionals from the justice system.” In this regard, the King said that major legal texts have been adopted including the organic laws relating relating to the Higher Council of the Judicial Power and the Statute of Judges, and the legislation that transferred the supervision of the Office of the Public Prosecutor from the Minister of Justice to the Attorney General at the Court of Cassation. The concept judicial independence from other government branches took center-stage in the King’s statement:  he asserted that this concept must be applied on the ground to benefit“citizens, because it asserts the rights of litigants, it entails responsibilities for the judges.”

Rabat- Malfunctioning Chinese spacecraft, Tiangong-1 fell into the southern Pacific Ocean on Monday, April 2, after orbiting the earth for six years, according to China’s Manned Space Engineering Office and the European Space Agency. The Chinese government launched Tiangong-1 on September 29, 2011, as its first prototype space station, with the aim of demonstrating docking capabilities and carrying out orbit experiments in line with China’s space programme aiming to launch a permanent Chinese space station by 2020. In March 2016, the spacecraft ceased to respond to ground orders and began its journey towards decay, as it tumbled astray around space, until its fiery reentry to Earth’s atmosphere on Monday at 00:15 UTC (00H42 GMT). Tiangong-1 which translates into “Heavenly Palace” or “Celestial Palace-1” weighed 8.506 kilograms and was 10.4 meters long. Its interior facilities constituted of high-resolution cameras for manned missions, two sleep stations with individual lighting control and exercise gear. In 2017, China forecasted that the Tiangong-1 would meet its end by late March 2018, reported the Guardian. One year after Tiangong-1 broke down, China launched Tiangong-2 to test capabilities for long-term human presence in space, said the same source. In a previous statement, the European Space Agency predicted that the spacecraft might land over water and said that the chances of being hit by a piece of wrecked Tiangong-1 are “10 million times smaller than the yearly chance of being hit by lightning.” The Chinese tabloid Global Times newspaper commented on the media buzz surrounding the spacecraft’s fall, stating that the incident should not have been subjected to so much attention: “It’s normal for spacecraft to re-enter the atmosphere, yet Tiangong-1 received so much attention partly because some western countries are trying to hype and sling mud at China’s fast-growing aerospace industry,” relayed the same source, noting China’s expanding space experiments.

Rabat- Among the many photos that have recently circulated on social media showing King Mohammed VI in good health with fans, new photos capture the sovereign with a lady, Brigitte Ferrat, in a Paris garden. King Mohammed VI posed for three similar photos with Brigitte Ferrat, a fan of the King’s who posted the photos on her Twitter account on Sunday. The photos show the king smiling to the camera, side by side with Ferrat surrounded by a variety of flowers and other plants. Next to one of the photos, Ferrat wrote: “I could have done my hair, [the king] responded: we do not care!” she added “Natural and spontaneous.”  J’aurais pu me coiffer il me répond : on s’en fou !

“Your Excellencies, honorable Ministers, Distinguished Presidents of the Higher Councils of the Judiciary and Public Prosecutors, Ladies and Gentlemen, It gives me pleasure to send this message to your international forum and to welcome participants in this high-level conference on the judiciary. Given the high esteem in which I hold the judiciary and also the special attention I have always devoted to judicial bodies and to the members of the judicial system, I was keen to grant my patronage to this event. First of all, I wish to commend you on your choice of theme: The independence of the judiciary: guaranteeing the rights of litigants and upholding the principles of justice. This is an important, topical theme for any judicial system that seeks to play a greater role in safeguarding rights and freedoms and in enhancing judicial security with a view to promoting development and protecting society. I hope this conference will provide an opportunity for participants from different legal backgrounds to identify common challenges and come up with appropriate answers and innovative solutions to those challenges, building on the universal principles they have in common. Your Excellencies, Distinguished members of the Judiciary, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your meeting is taking place at a time when a major, historic reform of the judicial system is under way in Morocco. Guided by a constant desire to comply with the modern principles governing judicial systems, the Kingdom of Morocco has been actively seeking to upgrade its judicial sector in order to respond to the concerns of citizens, satisfy the needs of litigants, fulfil the aspirations of society and meet the requirements of our time. Convinced that the independence of the judiciary is of utmost importance and given the role it plays in the emergence of states committed to the rule of law, my country has sought to lay the foundations for judicial independence, taking the necessary institutional, legislative and practical measures to that end. In this regard, I was particularly keen to make sure the separation of powers was expressly enshrined in the Constitution. The latter also stipulates that a Higher Council of the Judiciary – chaired by the Sovereign and composed of legal and judicial experts as well as elected judges – is to be set up as an independent constitutional body which ensures that the guarantees provided to judges are respected and which manages judges’ professional careers. The Constitution also prohibits any interference in the cases being prosecuted, and the law provides for sanctions against any attempt to influence judges. Moreover, the Constitution stipulates that any failure by a judge to uphold his or her obligations with respect to the independence and impartiality of the judiciary would be considered a serious professional violation which could give rise to criminal prosecution. The Constitution goes further in this regard, laying down provisions for upholding the rights of litigants and ensuring the proper administration of justice. It confirms the judge’s role in terms of protecting the rights, freedoms and judicial security of individuals and groups. It also guarantees not only a citizen’s right to take legal action, but also the presumption of innocence as well as the right to a fair trial within a reasonable timeframe. These are constitutional principles which I wanted to see reflected in a national charter for the reform of the judicial system. The preparation of that charter, which includes a range of legislative, organizational and practical reforms and which was developed using an extensive participatory approach, was entrusted to a group of eminent judges, lawyers, judicial experts and professionals from the justice system. Important legal texts have been adopted in this respect, particularly the organic laws relating to the Higher Council of the Judicial Power and the Statute of Judges, in addition to the legislation which transferred the supervision of the Office of the Public Prosecutor from the Minister of Justice to the Attorney General at the Court of Cassation. Through this collective initiative, my country has made important strides towards completing the institutional framework for running the judicial system. I hope we can speed up the implementation of other relevant measures set out in the charter to update legislation and improve the functioning and performance of the judiciary, thus enhancing its independence, in keeping with the Kingdom’s Constitution. As the guarantor of the independence of the judiciary, I seek to make sure that that independence – as enshrined in the Constitution – serves the citizen, enhances the rule of law and promotes development. Your Excellencies, Distinguished members of the Judiciary, Ladies and Gentlemen, Like other communities which attach the utmost importance to the judicial system, and regardless of the accomplishments made with respect to the institutional framework underpinning the legal system, my country remains concerned by the stakes and challenges relating to judicial systems worldwide. Chief among these challenges is the obligation to guarantee the independence of the judiciary on the ground and in practical terms. This is because judicial independence is not meant to benefit the judges, but rather the citizens. Because it asserts the rights of litigants, it entails responsibilities for the judges. Litigants are legitimately entitled to expect a judge to prosecute independently and impartially, and to base his or her judgment on nothing but the law and his or her conscience and convictions. This is an obligation for the judge. He or she must show integrity and impartiality and steer away from any influence or temptation which may expose him or her to disciplinary measures or criminal proceedings. Enhancing confidence in the judiciary as the bedrock of the rule of law and the main driver of development is another challenge that needs to be tackled. This can be achieved by improving the performance of the legal system in order to enable it to accompany the profound economic and social changes taking place in society. To achieve this objective, we need, among other things, to facilitate access to justice through an overhaul of legislation in order to keep pace with modern times and bring domestic legislation in line with international instruments, particularly those relating to human rights. Just as important is the need to make sure that cases are prosecuted within reasonable time frames, to provide the judicial security needed for an improved business environment and to promote investment and development. It is also essential to ensure the effectiveness and transparency of judicial administration through the use of information technology and to institutionalize alternative means for resolving disputes. To develop criminal justice, we need to look into ways and means to strike as sound a balance as possible between the obligation to safeguard rights and freedoms and the need to preserve the values and pillars of society and to shield it against anything that may threaten it. This is particularly true in today’s world, which is characterized by growing perils, complex relations and the ever-expanding use of digital communications. The latter implies threats as well as potential misuses that are particularly complex and that need to be tackled in an efficient, professional manner. Enhancing the performance of the legal system remains a key concern, given the expectations of individuals and societies alike. This goal cannot be achieved without improving judicial administration to support the work of judges. Experience shows that the digitization of the legal system can play an important role in this regard. The achievement of objectives at all of the above levels hinges on enhancing the qualifications of the men and women working in the judiciary. It also requires that we ensure capacity building within legal bodies and foster integrity across the judiciary. Any endeavor to promote integrity should be supported through, for example, the promotion of international cooperation as an instrument that can help improve legal systems and encourage the exchange of experiences and know-how as well as the identification of best practices in the field. Your Excellencies, Distinguished members of the Judiciary, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am sure the issues relating to the theme of your conference will be discussed extensively. Participants will thus have the opportunity to make fruitful comparisons, particularly as they share not just a deep concern about the challenges legal systems are faced with, but also a strong desire to forge innovative solutions by drawing on their vast experience and achievements. They will thus enrich the debate, while bearing in mind the particularities of their respective societies. I hope your debates will lead you to make creative, relevant proposals and practical recommendations. You would thus have turned your conference into a sustainable platform for the fruitful exchange of experiences in order to contribute to the development and overhaul of legal systems. May Almighty God grant you every success.”

Rabat – Morocco counts approximately 700,000 citizens who suffer from epilepsy, a chronic nervous disorder, in which brain activity is disrupted by electrical activity, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness. This finding was presented during a training session on semiological crises, electroencephalography (EEG) and epilepsy surgery, held in Rabat from March 26 to 30, with the participation of specialists and experts at the national and international level. The event was organized under the initiative of the Center for Rehabilitation and Neurosciences and the Departments of Clinical Neurophysiology and Neuroradiology at the University Hospital of Rabat (CHU), as part of a collaboration between Morocco and India in the field of health. One of its major goals was to introduce Moroccan surgeons to the technique of hemispherotomy. Commenting on the sidelines of the event, Abdeslam Khamlichi, the president of the Hassan II Foundation for Prevention and Fight Against Nervous System Diseases, said that “if the disease is not treated early, it can lead to psychomotor delays, paralysis and various disabilities.” “For severe and intractable epilepsy with seizures, which cannot be cured by treatment, the technique of hemispherotomy becomes mandatory,” Khamlichi said, adding that this technique, consists of disconnecting surgically all connections between the left and right brain. Seizures, as a result, cannot generalize or spread to the other hemisphere. Khamlichi pointed out that this avant-garde technique is very complex and difficult to achieve, noting that no surgeon in Morocco and Africa has done it before. Therefore, this training provided an opportunity for Moroccan surgeons to develop their theoretical and practical understanding of the disease,in addition to creating the possibility of joint Moroccan-Indian hemispherotomy operations, with the assistance of renowned professors such as Sarat Chandra and Manjari Tripathi from the All India Institute for Medical Science in New Delhi. The five-day training session comes as a result of several conventions securing South-South cooperation between the two countries.

New York   –  Morocco’s Ambassador to the United Nations, Omar Hilale, addressed on Sunday a letter to the Security Council to warn its members about the maneuvers of the Polisario in Guerguerat area. The letter comes on the heels of reports that the Algeria-backed Polisario has decided to move the headquarters of its so-called “Ministry of Defense” to part of the buffer zone, which its consideres as “liberated areas.” The Moroccan ambassador said that a relocation of any Polisario facility, be it civil, military, administrative, or of any kind or nature whatsoever, from the Tindouf camps in Algeria, to the buffer zone “constitutes a casus belli.” Hilale pointed out that Polisario’s maneuvers in the region constitute a “violations of Military Agreement 1” and “seriously threatens” the UN political process, which aims to help the parties to achieve a mutually acceptable political solution to the territorial dispute. “With their repeated violations, which are now extended to several zones in the East of the security structure in the Moroccan Sahara, the other parties seriously condemn any chance of relaunching the political process,” stressed Hilale in the letter.  “The inaction of the International Community and its passivity towards these violations have, unfortunately, been interpreted by the other parties, as an encouragement to persist in their defiance,” the ambassador regretted. Hilale called on the Security Council to put pressure on the Polisario and compel it to abide by the provisions of the ceasefire and the military agreement. “The Security Council is called upon to use its authority to enforce compliance with the ceasefire and Military Agreements and to order “polisario” to withdraw immediately, unconditionally and completely from the area East of the security structure in the Moroccan Sahara,” he said. The Moroccan diplomat emphasized, that in case the United Nations fails to shoulder its responsibility, Morocco will use all necessary means to defend its rights and prevent the Polisario from changing the status of the region.  “Morocco, will not stand idly by the deterioration of the situation on the ground. The other parties will, then, have to take full responsibility for the consequences that will result from their actions,” he said. Hilale went on to add that,  despite the repeated calls of the UN Secretary General to avoid any actions that might escalate tension, the Polisario has not only increased its maneuvers in the Guerguerat region, but has also set up tens in the Mahbes, another area in the buffer zone and is preparing to relocate its military facilities to the localities of Bir Lahlou and Tifariti. The Polisario has, “once again, repeated, three days ago, its violations of the Military Agreement N.1, in another area of the Moroccan Sahara, in this case in Mahbes,” he said, adding that several armed elements of the Polisario have entered this area, aboard military vehicles, and have set up tents, dug a ditch and built constructions using sandbags.

Faurie, who arrived in Morocco on Friday, also stressed the need to reinforce bilateral ties between the two nations in agriculture, an area to which Argentina attaches special interest, according to MAP. Faurie also expressed his interest in exchanging best practices between the two countries in the usage, management and distribution of water resources, as well as agriculture-related energy practices. The official made his remarks following a meeting with Morocco’s Secretary of State for Fisheries, Mbarka Bouaida. The Moroccan official said the two countries maintain very good relations on both a political and economic level. Bouaida also discussed the importance of strengthening economic cooperation, emphasizing that the partnership between Morocco and Argentina can serve as a foundation for the further development of economic ties between Africa and South America. The two parties also set a work agenda and agreed on the essential points of the partnership between the two countries. Earlier this week, Argentina’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told MAP that Faure’s visit “will be a step towards solidifying political bilateral relations and boosting technical and scientific cooperation among other spheres between Morocco and Argentina.” Argentina’s exports to Morocco were valued at USD 509 million in 2017, marking an increase of 38 percent over the course of the past two years, added the same source.

Rabat –  Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita, described as “serious developments” the multiple provocations of the Polisario elements in the areas of Guerguerat, Bir Lahlou, Tifariti and Lamhaybes, located in the buffer zone between. Morocco will not allow any change in the legal and historical status of the Guerguarat buffer zone, which is an integral part of the national territory, said, Sunday in Rabat minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita. “The UN’s reaction to Polisario provocations in the Guerguerat region was not strong enough to deter the separatists,” Bourita told the press after the joint meeting of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Islamic Affairs and Moroccans living abroad at the House of Representatives and the Committee of Foreign Affairs, Borders, National Defense and Occupied Zones at the House of Advisers, which was held in the presence of the minister of the Interior and the minister for Relations with the Parliament and Civil Society, government spokesman, to review the latest developments on the issue of the Kingdom’s territorial integrity. Bourita stressed that the Kingdom “will act firmly against the provocations of the Polisario in the Guerguerat region and will not allow any change in the status of this area which is an integral part of the national territory and has always known a Moroccan presence until 1991.” Morocco withdrew from this area for the sole purpose of allowing the UN to manage the ceasefire, said the minister, noting that the United Nations and the major powers must assume their responsibility and that the Kingdom reserves the right to defend this part of its national territory. The minister also added that today’s meeting, which was held at the initiative of the government, is intended to inform members of both Houses of parliament of the dangerous developments in the buffer zone, located at east of the defensive device of the Kingdom. Bourita also warned that the separatist group has gone even further in its provocations by committing certain dangerous acts in the region of Tifariti and Bir Lahlou, which aim to change the legal and historical status of this zone. Morocco considers such actions unacceptable and will undertake diplomatic actions that are not in any way part of a process of appeasement or the ordinary management of the situation, but to draw attention to the dangerous nature of these actions that constitute a violation of the ceasefire, threaten regional stability and risk plunging the region into the unknown, he said. A member of the parliament who attended the joint meeting of the Moroccan parliament told Morocco World News that Morocco’s Interior Minister, Abdelouafi Laftit, said that the Polisario had moved its “Ministry of Defense” and its “parliament” to the area of Bir Lahlou in the buffer zone. The Moroccan official added that other elements of the Polisario set up tents he area of Al Mahbas, located near the Moroccan defense wall.

Rabat – On Sunday, the Moroccan parliament strongly voiced its concern over the repeated illegal maneuvers carried out by the Polisario Front in the restricted buffer zones of Western Sahara. The meeting gathered together parliamentary committees of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior. Abdelouafi Laftit, Minister of Interior, has reacted strongly to the illegal presence of the Polisario in the UN-administered buffer zones of Guerguerat, Tifariti and Mahbes. Despite continuous warnings from both the Moroccan government and the several agencies of the United Nations, the separatist group has been carrying out illegal maneuvers that violate the 1991 United Nations ceasefire agreement. Several parliamentarians expressed their concerns over the situation in the restricted buffer zones. One member of the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM), Aziz Benazzouz, described Polisario’s actions as “dangerous.” Hamdi Ould Errachid of the Istiqlal Party told the press that Morocco needs to begin implementing its Autonomy Plan immediately, while PAM’s Adi Bouarfa said that the government “must execute the right to prosecute [Polisario’s] incursions,” noting that Algeria should not ignore the “sacrifices made by the Moroccan people for the independence of Algeria.” Sources within the parliament told members of the Moroccan press that Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita has informed the parliament about contents of the first draft of the latest report by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on the Western Sahara question. In the document, which was received by Morocco World News, Guterres expressed his concern over the precarious situation in the buffer zone of Guerguerat. The UN chief reiterated his firm position, and that of the UN, in opposition to the presence of the separatist group in the buffer zone. In paragraph 8 of the document, the UNSG reaffirmed his January 6 statement calling for the Polisario to withdraw from the buffer zone, such that the flow of commercial and civil traffic is not hindered and such that no action taken could constitute a change in the status of the buffer zone. In paragraph 80 of the draft, Guterres condemned the Polisario’s illegal activities in Guerguerat, which violate the UN ceasefire agreement. Guterres then calls on the separatist group to withdraw from the buffer zone “as they did in April 2017.”

Rabat – Beginning today, Morocco will hold a seat on the African Union’s Peace and Security Council (PSC) for a two-year period. The North African country plans to actively contribute to the promotion of peace and stability on the continent. Morocco was selected to join the PSC during the 32nd ordinary session of the AU executive council held in Addis-Ababa in January. Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday that Morocco’s election to the PSC represents an affirmation of the kingdom’s credibility in diplomatic endeavors and the high esteem it has earned for its strategy of engagement within Africa. The statement reported by Maghreb Arab Press added that this election to the PSC also acknowledges the leadership role that Morocco has played in several initiatives since 1960 to advance Africa’s stability and development. The same source added that the North African country is establishing its “mandate within the PSC” with the view of promoting peace and security on the continent, particularly given the security challenges that “require joint and concerted action as well as an unwavering commitment” by African nations to help protect genuine security and stability. According to the Moroccan ministry, stability on the continent will only be achieved through “political stability, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, as well as the consolidation of the rule of law in Africa.” Africa’s security agenda should also prioritize the settlement of regional conflicts and crises which “constitute a real threat to peace and security in Africa,” according to the statement. During its two-year term, Morocco will give special attention to issues related to terrorism prevention and the fight against violent extremism, as well as post-conflict reconstruction. Morocco’s goal is to federate “collective efforts of the Council’s member States” and to seek immediate solutions to the issues that hinder Africa’s sustainable development. Morocco’s strategy will also prioritize socio-economic development and South-South cooperation, which form a bedrock principle “and a condition sin qua non for peace, stability, and prosperity in Africa.” Other initiatives that Morocco will pursue while a member of the PSC include combating human trafficking, food security and environmental security.

Rabat – Morocco’s star in Africa is rising; but can it overcome economic stumbling blocks and European skepticism to become the regional leader it aspires to be? Much of the Western Sahara controversy that is used by Morocco’s enemies to attack its national sovereignty is based in old policies, which predate the ongoing peace process and recent investments into the region, as well as the economic shortcomings resulting from underdeveloped infrastructure outside the main cities, and lack of foreign investment into the far ends of the country. Sahrawi protesters and much of the mostly Amazigh population in the South of the country end up between the rock and the hard place – on the one hand, there is the legitimate interest in attracting further attention to the portions of the country that still require greater investment; on the other hand, self-interested separatist activists with an agenda utilize economic grievances to hijack reform movements towards destabilizing the country. Interestingly, however, with Morocco taking assertive steps to improve the situation not only within its own borders but across the continent, the same critics attack these overdue economic measures. One example of such a Catch 22 is the building of the Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline, which was met with the condemnation of 40 African and European countries on the basis of environmental concerns.  Morocco, however, has also built a massive solar power plant in the Sahara.  A diverse economy should reasonably rely on a variety of energy supplies in order to function properly; working with no fossil fuel energy whatsoever is an unreasonable expectation, particularly since many of the government officials from the 40 dissenting states regularly use fossil fuel in the course of travel for business. The gas pipeline project would stretch across West Africa, and possibly extend into Europe. It is the continuation of the West African Pipeline (GOA), and is supposed to promote the integrated North West African Zone, help all the countries involved achieve energy independence, support the badly needed electrification projects, and achieve economic and industrial development goals. The project would empower the partnering countries, and it would also address the energy needs of some of their disenfranchised populations. One of the main complaints about South Morocco and Western Sahara is the supposed lack of access to power.  Developing further energy projects would surely address those shortages. So why are so many countries complaining? Interestingly enough, these countries do not actually want a stable, prosperous, secure, and well integrated Morocco.  A perpetual state of conflict and dissent serves their interests significantly more than an African competitor which could attract away investors, and put pressure on stagnant European markets. Europe Does not want a stable and competitive Morocco For that instance, supporting Polisario, and encouraging protests, rather than working with the Moroccan government to speed up infrastructure development in the needier regions, or send in private investors to address the shortcomings, is the preferred strategy. Alleged humanitarian support and keeping “human rights violations” in the news likewise feeds into the European “human rights industrial complex”, whereby countries which have long since ceded entrepreneurship elsewhere, need to employ their decreasing young people. Government jobs and human rights NGOs focused on “safe” and manageable conflicts are a good way to channel energy that would otherwise cause internal pressure on the public officials. In other words, these European critics of Morocco’s approach to development, no matter which way it goes, are actually projecting their own internal issues – and their own way of handling them. For the same reason, the self-empowerment of the African countries is a threat to Europeans. If Nigeria and other West African countries become energy independent and improve the lives of their populations, what will be the rallying point for the European concerned NGOs? Nevertheless, Morocco is on the path of strengthening its bilateral and multilateral relationships in Africa, and growing its economy. In the most recent sign of its growing respect and importance in the region, the Congolese president invited King Mohammed VI to participate in the Blue Funds Conference, which will take place in April, and focus on utilizing resources to preserve the ecology of the Congo Basin. Morocco has been playing a central role in this project, ever since its launch during the UN-sponsored climate change conference in March 2017.  Furthermore, Rabat will host the African Union’s second ordinary meeting of the Specialized Technical Committee on Urban Development, Local Government, and Decentralization. The aims of the committee – to decentralize governance and to empower local communities – are laudable and should be seen as a sign of progress in an otherwise heavily bureaucratic high level organization, which features diverse interests and frictions.  That the future of resolving various African countries is in involving increasingly local resources and activists, who can tackle various issues without the red tape and lack of local knowledge from the federal governments has become an increasingly widespread realization among the activists themselves in a number of African countries; the fact that their governments finally understand that point gives reasons for optimism about the future. Empowering local communities in South Morocco and Western Sahara is surely an important and fascinating theme; it presents many opportunities for entrepreneurial thinking, positive outreach, early investment, and exploration of various ideas. Yet, instead of getting involved in that discussion in constructive ways and asking informative questions, which could help bring about faster and better results, Morocco’s critics prefer to focus on criticism. Rather than working with Moroccan government to come up with a plan for alternative skills training for poor mining towns, where the coal mines are no longer a reliable source of income, while Morocco is undergoing currency reforms, the same critics add fuel to the fire of the protesters, who, on occasions, turn violent, creating the appearance of destabilization inside a country, which is a vital intelligence partner to many of the same European Union members. Quite interestingly, major human rights organizations, such as Amnesty, decry Moroccan mass arrests of these protesters, journalists, and others, while failing to ask a simple question as to how previously peaceful protests turned violent. Indeed, countries undergoing difficult economic transitions, aimed at improving the internal situation, should be lent support by the international community, rather than antagonized and cornered. There is no question that Morocco and European states will have a different approach to handling mass social movements, particularly, when the country is undergoing massive changes on various fronts and where it is working to tackle bureaucratic corruption in addition to social and economic issues. Europe should support Morocco’s march towards progress The question is – are the European states and organizations interested in Morocco’s prosperity and success through the inevitable growth pangs, or will insist on ignoring all the positive achievements Morocco is undergoing to focus exclusively on the protests and the Western Sahara issues?  If one reads European coverage of Morocco, none of the progress appears to take the central page, even when well deserved.  Balanced coverage would require the acknowledgment of important steps in breaking through the water-related issues, such as Morocco’s recent participation in the World Water Forum in Brazil. The goal of the forum is to challenge conventional thinking and to resolve ongoing issues through learning sessions, debates, and interactive workshops. Morocco participated in the “Water Planet” exhibit, which, among other things highlighted the country’s success in water management. Little is said about the upcoming UK-Morocco Trade and Investment Forum, which indeed, looks towards bringing in investments, focusing on Morocco’s convenient location. Just as importantly, the 24th Annual Mediterranean Film Festival, taking place in Tetouan this year, will address the issues of censorship and artistic freedom – the issues just as central to European discussions and governance as they are to Africa and Morocco. This important cultural event may disappear behind the raging headlines on the political issues of the day, yet it represents a major step forward in Morocco’s economic, cultural, and political development. Not only is the country becoming increasingly attractive to creative pursuits, which, of course stimulates the local scene and the economy, but it is modernizing and liberalizing culturally at a rate that should be widely discussed and acknowledged. It is easy enough to endlessly dwell on the failings in various arenas, but when Morocco steps up its game in discussing important issues that should be of interest to everyone – including the human rights of artistic expression – that should receive as much of a positive scrutiny as all the negative attention devoted to its problems. Just as importantly, the deliberate and systematic introduction of such discussions into popular discourse represents an important and well thought-out political step by the country’s government, which is bringing the country on par with its European and American counterparts. Morocco benefits from its complex identity as an African, Mediterranean state, with a complex heritage of ethnic and religious identities, and strong connections to Europe and the Middle East, as well. It is looking to integrate into Africa, and lead the continent towards overcoming security, political, economic, and social problems, while simultaneously improving its own lot. As such, Morocco is taking many risks, and bold, admirable steps – which also invite greater scrutiny, because it is opening itself up to the world, and embracing different perspectives. Rather than using Morocco’s remarkable interest in self-improvement towards the temptation to pile on and bash it for everything that is not according to the European or American standards or expectations. This is a great opportunity to positively encourage additional progress, praise and reward improvements and changes, and assist with addressing difficulties and dilemmas. Positive international relationships do not come with either purely transactional alliances where major issues are ignored until such point as they become insurmountable obstacles in the growth of these relationships nor with focusing exclusively on the problems and differences. Rather, a balanced conversation about maximizing opportunities for growth will serve Morocco’s friends and allies well in growing, strengthening, and deepening those bonds without being perceived as meddlesome and small-minded. On the contrary, the country that is positioned to become the focus of the CyberSouth project – a collaboration between European Union, the Council of Europe and several MENA countries to combat cybercrime and improve electronic evidence gathering – already objectively has a lot to offer. Its contributions should be celebrated as an example to other future potential partners in such ventures. And the fact that Morocco is positioning itself as a gateway for African outreach is promising to any country that is looking to establish a foothold in the continent. More than just a beautiful vacation destination (though it certainly is), Morocco is becoming a valuable international contributor in many different arenas; it is becoming a real partner, an ally, and is already a good friend to many. Rather than the continuous shaming over the issues that are constantly instigated by those who are envious of its success and drive for progress, Morocco’s European and American counterparts should extend their interests beyond a few widely publicized issues and expand their outreach and partnership on more diverse and deeper levels. They then will be better positioned to contribute to a legitimate, constructive, respectful, and friendly discussion on improvements in various fields, and they themselves will benefit from seeing the fruit of their own investment in the country’s blossoming before their very eyes. In many ways, Morocco is already punching above its weight: imagine how the resourcefulness of its citizens propels its advances when the conditions for entrepreneurship, education, and innovation become optimal and enjoy wider support.

Rabat – The Moroccan actress and screenwriter, Mouna Rmiki, has won two best actress awards for her work in the short film “The Green Lotto”. Rmiki won at the IndieFEST Film Awards in California and also at The Best Shorts Competition in New York City. Rmiki wrote The Green Lotto and she portrays Kareema in the film which tells the story of a couple trying to obtain a Green Card in an attempt to gain American citizenship. Rmiki was born in Geneva and grew up in Spain before moving to Morocco’s capital, Rabat, at the age of 12. After having successfully completed high school, she enrolled in the ISCAE business school while also taking drama classes with Youssef Britel and Jean Marie Courtois, after which she immediately landed several roles. The Moroccan actress discovered her passion for acting at a very young age; after a long and flourishing journey of self-discovery and relentless efforts in theatre and several other art projects she flew to the United States five years ago to pursue her career on Broadway. She also co-wrote a play on immigration in the United States called “Nowhere.” Rmiki is also known for performances in “l’histoire des hommes qui ne reviennent jamais” (2014) and “Too Proud to Die” (2016).

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced Israel’s violent attacks against unarmed Palestinians following deadly clashes near the Gaza border. Israeli soldiers responded to the large demonstrations with live fire. The violent attacks against Palestinians have so far claimed the lives of at least 16 people and wounded more than 1,400. In response to the violent reaction from Israeli troops in the Gaza Strip, the Moroccan ministry wrote in a statement that “the Kingdom denounces the Israeli occupation forces’ use of excessive force, ignoring the peaceful nature of the demonstrations.” The statement emphasized that the situation in the region “requires stability and restraint away from any act of violence or escalation.” According to the same statement, Morocco reiterates its support for the Palestinian Authority under the leadership of President Mahmoud Abbas and its solidarity with the Palestinian people as they pursue their legitimate rights including the establishment of an independent state with Al Quds East as its capital. On March 27, Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita paid an official visit to Palestine where he met with the Palestinian leader and other officials at the headquarters of the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian president added that Bourita’s visit reaffirms the deep ties of fraternity between the two nations. Bourita, whose visit was at Abbas’ invitation, stressed the importance of visiting Palestine to reaffirm Morocco’s firm position and its unwavering support and solidarity with the Palestinian leadership and people. Israel’s violent attacks in Gaza led to an emergency UN Security Council meeting on Friday, just hours after the violent clashes. During the meeting, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for “an independent and transparent investigation” into one of the bloodiest clashes in Gaza since the 2014 cross-border war between Israel and Hamas, according to spokesman Farhan Haq. Other UN members have also expressed their concern on the current situation in Gaza, noting that the risk of escalation is very real. Abbas declared in a statement that Israel was responsible for the violence and declared Saturday a national day of mourning.

The March 21 arrests of the two Syrians took place in Sefrou and Mohammadia. According to a statement by the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), the suspect, who has been charged with funding criminal activities, had established a bank account in Morocco at the disposal of a money transfer agency in Syria in order to transfer and receive money. Authorities also announced the arrest of two Moroccans, one from Casablanca and one from Taounate, for being involved in transferring money to the same Syrian suspect in 2017 and 2018, added the DGSN statement. The second Syrian suspect arrested on March 21 was also receiving suspicious sums of money in his personal bank account. Recently, the Moroccan counterterrorism bureau (BCIJ) dismantled a nine-member terror cell in Oued Zem and Tangier. The suspects were plotting to use a deserted property owned by one of the detainees in order to manufacture bombs and explosive devices, with the greater view to undermining stability in the country by attacking public institutions and police forces. During their arrest, the BCIJ seized an illegal shotgun, ammunition, several knives, paramilitary clothing, computer equipment and ISIS-related propaganda documents. The head of BCIJ Abdelhak Khiame said that Morocco’s security strategy has resulted in a dramatic decline in the number of terror cells operating in the country. According to Khiame, the number of terror cells dismantled in Morocco declined from 21 in 2015 to 19 in 2016, adding that those two years marked a period of significant expansion in active ISIS-related terror cells all over the world. The BCIJ boss, however, did not deny that the risk of terrorism is still present in Morocco. Referring to Moroccan ISIS members, Khiame said that 1,668 Moroccans have joined ISIS since 2014, some of whom fought in battles against coalition forces. Khiame said that Moroccan ISIS fighters are known to “our services and will be arrested if they try to return to the country.”

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – Moroccan musician Abdelhak Mabrouk debuted his latest music video, “Ahwach Jazz,” at a press conference at Marrakech’s La Mamounia Hotel on Friday, March 23. Approaching the hotel’s entrance, Mabrouk invited an ahwach group to inaugurate the event, offering the audience an introduction for those unfamiliar with the traditional music, dance, and poetry collective performance. Mabrouk released his eponymously titled album in March 2017. The 10-track compilation is the fruit of Mabrouk’s decade-long project: to forge a new kind of music by fusing jazz with Morocco’s ahwach tradition. The seven-minute video features Mabrouk in various guises playing saxophone, at times solo, at others participating in an ahwach performance. The different vignettes are more impressionistic than narrative, and the video itself grants arresting shots of Mabrouk’s native Ouarzazate. Filmed in January, the video offers sweeping views of Ait Benhaddou, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the palm groves surrounding the mud-walled hilltop city. The production was nine months in the making and required two different teams; “It was quite a process,” said Elisabeth Myers, the ensemble’s project manager, speaking with Morocco World News. However, the video’s rocky genesis was not evident to the press, guests, and musicians seated in La Mamounia’s interior. Abdellah Adioui, the artistic manager, admitted he was “very happy” with both the event and quality of projection, adding that he was glad to see the video “shared with all the guests,” in a brief statement to Morocco World News. Adioui also remarked that he was pleased to see Morocco’s “intangible [cultural] heritage” broadcast and celebrated in such a space. Music runs in Mabrouk’s family: his father played saxophone in a military band. Mabrouk gravitated toward jazz at an early age and says he always knew that he wanted to be a musician. He moved from Ouarzazate to Marrakech to pursue his musical career as a jazz musician. However, after receiving critical acclaim on saxophone, Mabrouk found himself drawn to rhythms and musical traditions of his youth. In an earlier interview with Morocco World News, Mabrouk said, “Folk music is like your mother, like your father, you know what I mean? Any country that loses its traditional dance, its folklore, its patrimony – it has nothing.” In his explorations of traditional Moroccan music, Mabrouk insists ahwach and jazz have more things in common than they do dividing them. These two are not mutually exclusive musical forms, spliced together: rather, each already contains elements of the other. In fact, Mabrouk’s attempt to synthesize something new with ahwach simultaneously involves tracing the diverse threads already woven into the cultural fabric itself. Speaking to Morocco World News the day after the event, he said: “There is something between ahwach and all the rhythms that come from Africa.” To prove his point, he began drumming different rhythmic variations on the arm of his chair, identifying musical overlap with Gnawa music and reggae. “These things, if you do research, you start to recognize,” he says. “There are four [main] variations to rhythm in ahwach but there are [actually] many more.” And the connections are not exclusively musical: the traditional dress worn during an ahwach performance also manifests diverse elements of Morocco’s history.  Referring to the beaded headdresses worn by women during the performance, Mabrouk discovered connections with Morocco’s historic Jewish communities. “The beadwork is of the Jewish peoples that used to live in Morocco…because, at the time, the Jewish community made the most beautiful jewelry.” For Mabrouk, the synthesis of Morocco’s traditional music and jazz has also brought into clearer focus the parallels between ahwach’s diverse origins and those of Morocco’s own history. When asked what is next on Mabrouk’s horizon, the musician is reserved. “If you try to force something, it won’t come,” he says. However, Mabrouk is open about his desire to create a venue to promote and “share” ahwach with a broader “community” of musicians. Although purposefully vague about the details of what audiences and ahwach jazz enthusiasts have to look forward to, the team is positive about future collaborations and the opening of new creative channels. “My vision is to share [this] and create a jazz festival to bring together artists from around the world to develop rhythm of ahwach.” For Mabrouk, music offers the ideal medium with which to engage others while celebrating  Moroccan heritage.
