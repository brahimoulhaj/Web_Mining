Rabat – Former Algerian international footballer Lakhdar Belloumi has confirmed that he will represent Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. In an interview with the French-based weekly magazine, Jeune Afrique, Belloumi said on Thursday: “I can confirm that I will be an ambassador for Morocco’s bid.” Belloumi’s assertion came in response to information reported by Algerian media, claiming that Algeria has forced the footballer to decline Morocco’s offer. Earlier this week, an interview broadcast by Algerian El Heddaf TV showed Belloumi emphasizing that he refused Morocco’s offer to become the ambassador of the North African bid. After receiving the invitation, Belloumi declined the offer to avoid contradiction with “the decisions of the high instances,” referring to the official Algerian position, a close source told Algerie Focus, reported Algerie Focus. However, the former footballer said that, in contrast to what was reported by Algerian media,  he has never at any time refused the proposal that was made to him to represent the Moroccan bid. He said that he was just “waiting for Algeria’s support” for the bid. “I did not say that I refused the role of ambassador that Morocco offered me, but simply, that I had to wait for the government’s agreement before saying yes,” he said. He added that Morocco has all the assets to organize a World Cup, including stadiums, hotels, and a real passion for football. The Algerian star also said that Morocco had invited him to several sports events, including the final phase of the African Nations Championship (CHAN). Belloumi believes that “Morocco and Algeria are two brother countries. I think Algerians want the flagship event to be organized by Morocco.”  Recalling Morocco’s football stars, Belloumi said that the North African country has already chosen several African Ballon d’Or winners, including Samuel Eto’o, Didier Drogba, and El Hadji Diouf to represent Morocco’s bid. The country is also expecting Egyptian Mohamed Salah and Portuguese Cristiano Ronaldo to join its list of ambassadors. Morocco’s offer is part of its strategy to appoint renowned public figures and football stars as ambassadors from all over the world to campaign and promote its bid to boost international support for Africa’s bid nation.

Rabat – Although the public fuss about immigration in Morocco generally foregrounds sub-Saharan migrants, a recent survey by the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) has found that there are actually more European migrants in Moroccan workplaces. The survey was conducted earlier this month and sought to collect substantial data to facilitate the integration and immersion of migrants in the professional opportunities available in the North African country. According to HCP experts, the survey’s primary reason was to shed light on the demographic and economic profiles of migrants who choose to stay and work in Morocco. “The objective was to comprehend the nature of migratory flows to our country, and assess their [migrants’] level of social and professional integration in Moroccan society,” HCP said in a statement made on March 28. However, the report warned that, because the survey mostly concerned ordinary households, its conclusions may present some limits, as they “focused on the socio-economic and demographic profiles of migrants, not their number or volume.” Within the parameters of its focus on “ordinary households,” the study found that compared to sub-Saharans, there are more Europeans established in Morocco. According to the study, Arabs represent 33.5 percent of the migrant populations in Morocco, and are also the kingdom’s largest migrant population. They are followed by Europeans (32.5 percent), and then sub-Saharans with 27.3 percent. A recurrent pattern among different groups of migrants is the prevalence of males: “Regardless of their origins, the number of male immigrants is always higher,” HCP further said in its report, adding that six out of ten migrants in Morocco are men, representing roughly 59 percent of the migrant population in Morocco. This pattern is even more striking when compared to other demographics: the study found that men represent 70.5 percent of sub-Saharan immigrants in Morocco, 56 percent of European immigrants and 54.2 percent of Arab immigrants.  Why Migrate to Morocco? The study found that the primary cause of migration to Morocco is the search for better economic and financial prospects. “With a ratio of 41.4 percent, the evidence suggests that economic conditions constitute the first motivation” for migrating to Morocco. Education constitutes the primary motivation of 34.1 percent of migrants (with 22.4 percent of migrants at undergraduate and post-graduate levels, and 11.7 percent in vocational schools). The remaining 24.5 percent listed political, social, or humanitarian motivations (e.g. undocumented or illegal immigrants, unaccompanied minors, refugees and asylum seekers).  Big City Living, Service Sector Work The vast majority of migrants live in cities (97.7 percent) and work essentially in the customer service sector (e.g. call centers). The study also found out that Casablanca-Settat, Rabat-Salé-Kénitra, and Marrakech-Safi are the most attractive destinations for migrants, as these regions are considered more foreigner-friendly areas with relatively open and welcoming social mores, and more possibilities for work. Due to the professional qualifications of the majority of migrants, they reportedly face no major obstacles in the job market. “Migrants’ job prospects in Morocco are roughly the same as that of Moroccan natives,” HCP experts said. They reported that 78.5 percent of migrants work in the service sector, whereas 18.1 percent are unemployed, and the remaining 3.4 percent work in the industrial and the handicrafts sectors.

Washington D.C. – United Nations Secretary General, António Guterres, released the advanced copy of his much-anticipated annual report on the situation in the Western Sahara, which was obtained by Morocco World News. The report, the basis for the Security Council’s upcoming decision whether or not to renew the mandate of the UN mission in the territory, known as MINURSO, includes a number of points that will certainly be welcomed by Morocco. The Western Sahara Question is a UN Prerogative  Prior to the publication of the report and in light of the meetings that the UNSG personal envoy, Horst Kohler, held with representatives of the African Union and the European Union, many in Morocco feared that these meetings heralded a new approach by the UN to involve other parties in the negotiating process.  Moroccan observers feared that the UNSG was paving the way for the African Union to become a full-fledged stakeholder in the UN-led political process, a position that Morocco has fiercely opposed for years. With the publication of the new annual report, the UNSG leaves no doubt that the United Nations is the only international organization that has the legitimacy and credibility to help the parties reach a mutually acceptable political solution. In paragraph 26 of the draft report, Guterres noted that all the African Union and European Union officials who met with Personal Envoy, Horst Kohler, in recent months, reiterated their support for the Personal Envoy and acknowledged the leadership of the United Nations in the political process. “In these discussions, the interlocutors pledged support for my Personal Envoy’s efforts and acknowledged the lead of the United Nations in the process,” Guterres said. As in previous reports, the UNSG report steered away from mentioning the European Court of Justice rulings on the EU-Morocco Fisheries Agreement. This omission is an apparent setback for the Polisario and Algeria, which have redoubled their efforts in recent years to persuade the United Nations to politicize the issue of the alleged exploitation of natural resources in the territory. UN Concerned about Buffer Zones The situation in the buffer zone of Guerguerat also features prominently in Guterres’ annual report. Polisario members have been violating the UN 1991 ceasefire agreement through their illegal armed maneuvers in the region. Guterres reiterated the firm position of the United Nations against the presence of the Polisario in the Guerguerat area. In paragraph 8, the UNSG reaffirmed his appeal of January 6, 2018 for the Polisario to withdraw, such that the flow of commercial and civil traffic is not hindered and such that no action taken could constitute a change in status of the buffer zone. “On 6 January, I expressed deep concern about recent increased tensions in Guerguerat, calling on the parties to exercise maximum restraint and to avoid escalating tensions. I also called for regular civilian and commercial traffic not to be obstructed and for no action to be taken that may constitute a change to the status quo of the buffer strip. In a letter addressed to Mr. Ghali and dated 5 January, I requested that the parties refrain from actions that could undermine the efforts of my Personal Envoy to relaunch the political process, while also reiterating my commitment to the peaceful resolution of the conflict,” he said. While recognizing Morocco’s efforts to avoid escalation in the buffer zone, Guterres expressed in paragraph 80 of his report concerns about “the renewed Frente Polisario presence in Guerguerat, and the challenges such actions by either party may bring to the ceasefire.” He, therefore, called on the Polisario to “withdraw from the buffer strip as they did in April 2017.” Two Details of Great Significance to Morocco  In any report of the Secretary General, what matters most is the chapter on “observations and recommendations.” This year’s annual report contains two details that are of great significance. The first detail is the emphasis on Guterres’ call on Algeria to contribute to and increase its engagement in the political process. In paragraph 78 of the draft report, the UNSG stresses the importance that Algeria, along with Mauritania, contribute effectively to the UN-led political process aimed at helping the parties to reach a mutually agreed political solution. “I would like to reiterate the Security Council’s call on neighboring States, Algeria and Mauritania, to make important contributions to the political process and to increase their engagement in the negotiating process,” he said. This year’s language concerning Algeria’s involvement in the process is stronger than previous years when the UNSG limited himself to pointing out that “Algeria and Mauritania, as neighboring countries, can and should make important contributions to this process.” The significance of this year’s language is that it stresses the need for Algeria to be involved in the political process, thus echoing Morocco’s diplomatic position, which has long emphasized that Algeria is a major party in the conflict and should therefore be involved in the UN-led political process. The second detail relates to the concept of self-determination. In paragraph 78 of the report, the UNSG insists that the parties to the conflict should show a spirit of compromise in reaching a political solution, in accordance with the resolutions adopted since 2007. In this paragraph, the UNSG makes no mention of the concept of self-determination, whereas all previous reports referred to this concept when talking about the need to conduct “direct negotiations between the parties, which are to occur without preconditions, in good faith.” “In its resolutions since the beginning of 2007, the Security Council has directed me to facilitate direct negotiations between the parties, which are to occur without preconditions, in good faith, taking into account the efforts made since 2006 and subsequent developments, while working with realism and a spirit of compromise,” Guterres said. This paragraph contrasts starkly with the second paragraph of the “observations and recommendations” of last year’s report in which the UNSG mentioned the concept of self-determination. “In a series of resolutions beginning in 2007, the Security Council has directed the Secretary-General to facilitate direct negotiations between the parties to reach a “mutually acceptable political solution, which will provide for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.” Over the years, the Council has provided ample guidance that the negotiations are to occur without preconditions, in good faith, taking into account the efforts made since 2006 and subsequent developments, and working with realism and a spirit of compromise,” Guterres said in his report published in April 2017. In addition, the report raises serious concerns of the United Nations with regard to the security situation in the buffer zone. It is very significant that these concerns appear immediately after the paragraph where the UNSG expressed his concerns about the Polisario’s repeated maneuvers in Guerguerat. “Further, I remain deeply concerned about security in Western Sahara, in particular in the vast and empty desert expanse east of the berm, where unarmed military observers of MINURSO remain vulnerable to threats by criminal and terrorist groups,” the UNSG said. This statement echoes the efforts that Morocco has made in recent years to draw the attention of the international community to the possibility that the Tindouf camps and the vast areas of the buffer zone may become safe havens for terrorist and criminal organizations. The report, however, falls short of calling for conducting a census in the Tindouf camps to determine the exact number of people living there. For the past several years, Morocco has called on the United Nations to conduct a census in the territory and to shed light on the systematic embezzlement of the humanitarian assistance destined to the population living in the camps. A Need for Caution However positive the language of the UN report might appear, Moroccans should not assume that the dynamics of the conflict are in their favor. Moroccan diplomacy has yet to convince the Security Council of the validity of its approach to putting an end to the conflict. What matters most is the resolution that the Security Council will decide on April 30. It remains to be seen whether it will reflect the same language regarding Algeria and Mauritania’s involvement or whether it will settle for using the same language as last year’s resolution. With the appointment of John Bolton, a hawkish American politician known for his sympathy towards the Polisario, as the new National Security Adviser for President Donald Trump, Moroccans would better be served to show some caution. At this juncture, with Bolton scheduled to start his new job on April 9, it would be hard to predict the outcome of UN Security Council deliberations next month about the conflict. Will the UN finally depart from its fixation on the concept of self-determination as necessarily leading to independence? Will it explore other avenues to help the parties reach a mutually acceptable political solution? Will its members admit that a solution to this complex conflict cannot be found based on the same principles of the 1960s and the 1970s? Or will Bolton, known for his support for a referendum on self-determination, weigh in on the deliberations of the Security Council prior to the adoption of the new annual resolution? Will his appointment usher in a new chapter in the UN-led political process? The language of the resolution that will be adopted at the end April will demonstrate to what extent the UN is ready to bring about a political solution to the conflict.

Rabat- Member countries of the United Nations Security Council have failed to agree on any action or joint statement over Israel’s use of violence against Palestinian protesters in Gaza. At the request of Kuwait, the UN Security Council’s members held an emergency meeting on Friday, just a few hours after the deadly clashes in Gaza between Palestinians and Israeli troops, which claimed the lives of at least 16 people and and wounded more than 1,400.  During the talks, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for “an independent and transparent investigation” into one of the bloodiest clashes in Gaza since the 2014 cross-border war between Israel and Hamas, according to spokesman Farhan Haq.   Some council members, including Britain, France, and Russia, voiced their concerns over the shots fired against Palestinian protesters.  “The risk of escalation is very real. There is the possibility of a new conflict in the Gaza Strip,” the French representative said.  However, a US representative blamed what he called “bad actors who use protests as a cover to incite violence.” The Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour said he was disappointed the security council didn’t reach a consensus to condemn what he called a “heinous massacre” of peaceful demonstrators or to support his call to provide protection for Palestinian civilians. “We expect the Security Council to shoulder its responsibility” and “defuse this volatile situation, which clearly constitutes a threat to international peace and security,” Mansour said. The clashes erupted as thousands of Palestinian protesters marched toward Gaza’s border with Israel on Friday, March 30, to kick off a 6-week-long demonstration demanding the right of return for refugees, which left 16 people dead and more than 1,400 injured by Israeli fire, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.  For its part, the Israeli military said that thousands of Palestinians threw stones and rolled burning tires toward troops, adding that Palestinian gunmen fired toward soldiers in one incident and that militants were trying to carry out terror attacks under the cover of protests.  The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, said in a statement that Israel was responsible for the violence and declared Saturday a national day of mourning.

Rabat – Mauritanian authorities have dismantled an international ring involved in illegal prospecting for gold in Zouerat, a town in northern Mauritania. The ring includes members of the Polisario Front. The ring is made up of international gold prospectors, including several members of the separatist front, who have collected a large fortune through the illegal trafficking of gold. Elements of the Mauritanian army recently dismantled the ring and transferred members of the network to the Zouerat, a town 750 kilometers away from Nouakchott, to police headquarters for investigations. There, law enforcement aims to identify additional members involved in illegal gold trafficking.  Members of the Polisario Front have been linked to several criminal acts of late, including drug trafficking.  Recently, Morocco’s Counterterrorism Bureau (BCIJ) has expressed its concern over the situation on Sahel-Saharan states, where terrorists are conducting illegal crimes to fund their terror activities. Head of BCIJ Abdelhak Khiame also said that the Polisario members in the region ought to be considered a terrorist group, due to their involvement in terrorist cells, including Al Qaeda and Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Speaking about the security threats in the Sahel region, the BCIJ chief said that illegal activity often serves as a means of escaping from poverty for many separatists living in Tindouf in southern Algeria.

Rabat – Customs authorities on the Guergerat border have seized more than 10 million units of illegal firecrackers and counterfeit items, including food and fixed-line telephone devices. According to Moroccan press, the seized products are worth MAD 1.4 million. The items were collectively hidden in a truck carrying products declared for import. Customs authorities discovered the illegal items using a special scanner.  In 2017, Moroccan customs seized 8,300 unused mobile phones of different brands at the Guerguerat border crossing to Mauritania. The seized mobile phones were hidden on a truck registered in Mauritania. The buffer zone of Guerguerat has witnessed many instances of illegal smuggling in recent years, under heightened tensions between Morocco and the Polisario Front due to increased security intervention in the area. Moroccan authorities had intensified security measures in the area to combat illegal activities at the border area, a frequent checkpoint for smugglers, up until last month. Tension reached alarming levels in the months in December of 2016, and January  2017, when the Polisario militants began obstructing passage to Moroccan trucks carrying goods to Mauritania and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Morocco withdrew its law enforcement from Guerguerat in February after a request issued on February 25, by Antonio Guterres, the United Nations Secretary-General. The UN chief urged Morocco and Polisario to “unconditionally withdraw all armed elements from the Buffer Strip as soon as possible, to create an environment conducive to a resumption of the dialogue in the context of the political process led by the United Nations.” Immediately after the statement, King Mohammed VI ordered the withdrawal of Moroccan security forces from the region. The Polisario, however, did not withdraw its forces until the end of late April. Besides Polisario’s activities in the buffer strip, the region poses other security challenges for Morocco. In late September, a Moroccan officer serving at the border crossing in Guerguerat was attacked by individuals armed with knives, who proceeded to steal a Moroccan army pick-up truck. Additionally, separatists loyal to the Polisario Front have previously conducted assaults against members of Moroccan police. In December 2016, three separatists attacked a Moroccan policeman with knives. After their arrest, investigations revealed the attackers had worked to incite the local population to demonstrate their support for Polisario. The ongoing illegal activities of the Polisario Front in the Western Sahara buffer zone pose a threat to the stability of the region and undermine the UN settlement process to end the conflict over the region.

Rabat – BeIN Sports Algerian commentator Hafid Derradji is predicting that FIFA will rule out Morocco before the 68th FIFA Congress on June 13, eliminating the country from the world’s 211-football-federation vote for the host of the 23rd FIFA World Cup. Derradji, who shared his opinion piece on his Facebook, said that Morocco’s “dream” to host the World Cup might once again “postponed” for other several years “or maybe will never be achieved!”   To back his argument, Derradji said that FIFA President Gianni Infantino is not willing to take on the risks of a Morocco winning bid: “He has shown his concerns over the disparity of the infrastructure level between” the two bidders. The Algerian journalist added that Infantino “does not want to lose America and lose his position whatever the reason is.” According to Derradji, FIFA’s Evaluation Committee will play its “dirty” game and will consider Morocco’s bid as insufficient to dismiss it even before the June 13 vote.  “The US will do all it can to avoid reaching the voting stage,” to rule out the Moroccan bid. According to the Algerian commentator, the Moroccan file has grown stronger compared to its previous four bids. However, “the strength and rigidity of the bids have not [historically] been the only determinants to host major sports events, even if Morocco’s file is the most attractive bid to European and American investors because it will open up the doors for them to establish projects and contribute to the construction of stadiums, hotels, road networks and railways,” he added. Derradji said that some European and Asian federations–and even some Arab countries, including the advisor of Saudi Crown Prince (Turki Al Sheikh)–have indicated their preference for the World Cup bid. Al Sheikh has previously said that Saudi Arabia will vote for the bid that would serve its interests. Despite the unwavering  support expressed by President of African Football Confederation (CAF)  Ahmad Ahmad, CAF will not be “able to convince all the African federations to vote into for Morocco’s bid.” He added that the influence of the President of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF), Fouzi Lekjaa, is not enough on its own to convince football federations to vote for his country’s bid. Derradji mentioned that FIFA will be carrying out inspections in Morocco and the other three-nation North American bidders. The FIFA delegation will also grade the bids with a mark of two out of five, “and if one of the two files get a mark less than two, it will be withdrawn before the General Assembly.” On June 6, FIFA will name the successful bids, which will be eligible to move to the next voting stage. Despite continuous speculation, Morocco’s bid is determined to clinch the rights to host the World tournament. The bid has already received support of many countries, including the Russia, France, Qatar, Botswana, Nigeria, Saint Lucia, Luxembourg, Belgium, Serbia, Tunisia, and Algeria.

Rabat- Good news for gig-attendees and music lovers! A new research study has found that attending a concert every couple weeks helps to boost your lifespan and can add up to 9 years to your life. The study was carried out by O2, which owns some of the largest music venues in the UK, alongside Patrick Fagan, an expert in behavioural science and associate lecturer at Goldsmith’s University in London. “Our research showcases the profound impact gigs have on feelings of health, happiness and well-being–with fortnightly or regular attendance being the key,” Fagan said.  The findings show that those who attended live music experience, for only 20 minutes, saw their feelings of well-being boosted by 21 percent, while those who took part in a 20-minute  yoga session saw their well-being increased by only 10 percent, and those who walked their dog saw only a seven percent increase in their happiness. In addition, the research found a direct link between high levels of well-being and an increased lifespan of nine years or more. To determine the results, test participants undertook psychometric testing and heart-rate tests, which showed that gig experience increased participants feelings of self-worth by 25 percent, closeness to others by 25 percent, while their mental stimulation jumped by an impressive 75 percent. “Combining all of our findings with O2’s research, we arrive at a prescription for a gig a fortnight which could pave the way for almost a decade more years of life,” Fagan said. The research adds that experiencing live music makes participants feel happier than simply listening to music in private, showcasing that the shared experience is key to increasing well-being. “We all know just how good it is seeing your favourite band or artist live, but now we have the proof,” O2’s spokesperson Nina Bibby said.

Rabat – The city of Rabat convened NGOs activists and political representatives, calling for the release of detained Jerada protesters on Friday. A series of demonstrations ignited across Jerada province in recent months, in order to decry social disparities and mourn the death of local miners, who died while working in abandoned mine shafts. Tensions mounted on March 14, after a clash between security forces and protesters. Several protesters were arrested for causing injuries among law enforcement and for participating in unauthorized protests. In a press conference held to discuss the situation in Jerada, human right activists and politicians denounced the “social repression” of demonstrations, according to Spanish news agency EFE. Mustafa Brahma of the far-left party, La Voie Démocratique   (The Democratic Way), criticized the “systematic repression” of protest movements taking place across the country.  Brahma told EFE that “this crackdown will complicate the situation if the authorities do not provide pragmatic responses to the social demands of citizens.” He added that the number of Jerada event detainees has reached 70. Lawyers of the detained protesters told EFE that 54 individuals, including seven minors will be presented before the court for involvement in “assaulting police, organizing unauthorized demonstrations and destroying public property.” Morocco’s government is firm on its decision to ban unauthorized protests. In cabinet meeting held this month in Rabat, officials emphasized that security forces have the unconditional right to intervene to enforce the law in accordance with legal provisions in the region. However, Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi stressed that peaceful demonstrations are allowed as long as demonstrators respect the law, which prohibits acts of violence and vandalism. Authorities have been pledging development reforms in the province for the past several months. Earlier this month, the secretary-general of the region’s prefecture, Abderrazak El Gourji, told French news agency AFP that the city of Jerada has more than 3,200 mine shafts, 200 to 300 of which are active. “The others are abandoned and present a clear danger–they will all be closed,” he said. Renowned Moroccan politicians and international NGOs, including Amnesty International, condemned the intervention of law enforcement in the region. In a publication made public on March 16, Amnesty International called on Moroccan security forces to “stop using excessive force and intimidating peaceful protests,” adding that “five police trucks drove into a crowd of protestors on 14 March,” when clashes erupted between law enforcement and demonstrators. In response to Amnesty’s accusations, El Khalfi said that “what was published by Amnesty International concerning the Jerada events lacks fairness and does not include real data.” El Khalfi added that Morocco is offering people the right to demonstrate “within the framework of the law and, similarly, the public forces have also the right to intervene in the strict respect of the law provisions.”

Rabat – Morocco is viewed by many as an exception to the norm of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The extent to which this claim is asserted varies, but one thing is certain, Morocco is at the very least unique in the region in its governance and culture. In order to understand the claim of exception, a definition of the norm must first be established, so what is that norm and how is Morocco different?  What is that norm and how is Morocco different?  Across the MENA region states typically are autocratic and corrupt. They rule through harsh authoritarian regimes that crackdown on dissent. Their economies are underdeveloped and underwritten by statist policies and rents on natural resources, typically hydrocarbons. Societies in the MENA region tend to be very traditional and Islam is often used as a barrier to reform in civil rights. There is an aversion to secularization and Islamist groups thrive in the cultural environment.  On the other hand, Morocco has a much more open society and has a history of progressive ideals. Morocco’s economy has a lot of missed potential, but is growing steadily in diverse sectors and doesn’t suffer from the resource curse. Morocco is still authoritarian, but much less severely so than its peers, and is arguably on the path to democracy. The Arab Spring, while destructive in many countries, has led to meaningful reforms in Morocco with very little unrest. And finally, Morocco has virtually no serious threat of Islamist groups. Of course, defining a norm for a whole region requires painting with very broad strokes and each state has its own discrepancies. Furthermore, Morocco seems to fit some of the norms. So is the “Moroccan exception” blown out of proportion? perhaps it is, but the subtle differences that set Morocco apart go a long way to shaping its present situation and its future. But the purpose isn’t to argue about Morocco’s exceptional status, but rather look to its past to identify the root causes of this notion in order to better compare it with the rest of the region. For David Pollock, a Kaufman Fellow of The Washington Institute, the Moroccan exception is attributed to its location and cooperation with the West: “Yet Morocco’s very exceptionalism, especially in a region marked by either violent instability or severe repression, or both, makes it a special case worthy of significant attention and encouragement. Indeed Morocco, often neglected in the troubled aftermath of the Arab Spring, is actually among its most interesting countries — precisely because it is now so quiet, after a few months of massive demonstrations more than two years ago. The case for this is all the more convincing because of the country’s objectively important attributes: a strategic location between the western Mediterranean and the North African Sahel; a relatively large population, approaching 35 million within the next year or two; and an all-too-singular penchant for close economic, political, and security relations with both Europe and the United States. Two major factors largely explain this unique Moroccan phenomenon… » Judeo-Amazigh substratum The first root cause, and the oldest, is the influence of Jewish and Amazigh culture, hereafter referred to as the Judeo-Amazigh substratum. North Africa’s indigenous population of Amazigh people have the strongest historical influence on Morocco’s culture. After the fall of the second temple and the Jewish Diaspora in 70 AD, Jewish tribes began to spread across North Africa and many found a home in Morocco. The Jewish people and Amazigh were both tribal, nomadic, matrilineal, and had democratically elected ruling bodies. Because of these similarities in tribal structures and the Jewish people’s ability to adapt to different cultures while holding onto their religious and cultural identity, the two groups flourished together. Jews brought artisanship and the concept of monotheism to the Amazigh and in return were taught agricultural techniques and the concept of sainthood. This culture would change again when Islam reached North Africa. Arab society was also tribal in structure but there were a few key differences. Firstly, it was non-democratic, power was based on wealth and military strength. Secondly, it was strictly patrilineal and women had little place in society. In other MENA states this societal structure remains today much as it was in 700 AD, with Saudi Arabia being the best example. However, in Morocco history took a different path and turn.  Moroccan sweet mint tea, a symbol of tolerance and acceptance of the other When the Arab conquerors finally defeated the Judeo-Amazigh resistance in 710 AD the traditions of the Judeo-Amazigh society were already so established that many aspects of society remained the same. While tribes became patrilineal, the role of women was not diminished, and in many cases Women called the shots and ruled through their husbands and sons. Additionally, the traditions of religious coexistence persisted and Moroccan society enjoyed mostly friendly relations through the first half of the 20th century. Morocco, open society Today, Morocco is a more open society and women have more of a place in it than many other MENA states. In terms of religion, the influences of Amazigh spirituality and Sufism have shaped Moroccan Islam and opened the door to “cultural Islam.” Because the traditions of saints and spirits lie outside the region as prescribed by the Quran, the notion of “one, and only one form of Islam” could never take root. The unquestionable nature of Islam is essential to the legitimacy of Islamist groups, so when Moroccan Islam inherently raises some questions Islamist platforms stop making so much sense. The influences of the Judeo-Amazigh substratum are not concrete, and for the most part lie in the inter-subjectivity of Morocco’s cultural identity. All the same, this unique cultural evolution is the first place where Morocco began to set itself apart from other states in the region. Positive role of the monarchy The second big root of exception is Morocco’s system of Makhzen or Traditional Monarchy. In a country as big and diverse as Morocco is, the one main thing that unites the people and provides a sense of national identity is the king. But what sets the Moroccan Monarchy apart from other Middle Eastern monarchies is that the king has more than just historical legitimacy, but also religious legitimacy.  The king’s role as Commander of the Faithful (amir al-mu’minin) not only unites the country through religion but also undermines Islamism without much need for violence. In many other MENA states, secular, authoritarian governments that rule through military legitimacy (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Syria, etc.) find themselves at odds with popular Islamist movements that form in the religious vacuum. These opposing forces often engage each other with violence, and in cases like Algeria’s civil war, this has devastating effects. In Morocco, because the king, the nation, and religion are all virtually the same thing, there is simply no room for radical Islamist groups to form.  Traditional Moroccan Monarchy, undeniable symbol of stability and cohesion The Moroccan monarchy is responsible for part of the Moroccan exception, but in some ways it appears to follow the norm, after all, it is an autocratic regime. This is certainly true, but Morocco is, also, well on its way to democracy through progressive devolution of power since the Constitution of 2011. So why is this happening in Morocco but not in other countries?  To begin, the Moroccan monarchy never really had to be harsh or despotic to maintain legitimacy to rule. Unlike other MENA states who’s oppressive rulers came to power through violence and military strength, Morocco’s monarchy had significant historical and religious legitimacy to base its claim to power. This answer to the question of legitimacy has continued to aid the monarchy to this day. Another difference in Morocco’s style of authoritarianism is a preference for cooptation over coercion when dealing with the opposition. In a way, it is a traditional form of power-sharing. Ahmed Charai, a Moroccan political analyst, publisher and journalist, the Moroccan exception is, undoubtedly, the result of historical and political  legitimacy: “The first is a unique aspect of Moroccan political culture that most populous Arab countries cannot easily emulate. In a region in which political legitimacy is hard to come by, Morocco is governed by a monarchy with three centuries of continuous history in the country. The institution of the Makhzin, Moroccan Arabic for the kingdom’s administrative authority, enjoys historic popularity within the country. It is part of the fabric of Moroccan culture, woven into its music and art as well as its political and civil society institutions. King Muhammad VI himself enjoys immense popularity, particularly among the urban as well as rural poor, who largely perceive him as their champion. But in his 11-year reign, the young king has not been content to rest on the laurels of his family tradition. To the contrary, he has made strenuous efforts to resist and overturn the dictatorial tendencies of his late father, Hasan II, whose years of rule were popularly known as the “years of lead.” Muhammad VI began his rule by relieving the late king’s long-serving and unpopular security chief, and replacing him, for the first time, with a civilian. He did so, on the backdrop of the growing strength of the country’s Islamist opposition, a menagerie of parties and extra-political movements which unsurprisingly include a local franchise of the international Muslim Brotherhood movement.” It is true that during the so called, “Years of Lead” the government of Morocco was much more harsh in its treatment of perceived threats to its power, however the trend today, and for most of Morocco’s history is to co-opt the people that threaten to change the status quo. Lastly, Morocco may be authoritarian now but the current King is committed to a slow, calculated shift to democracy. Other authoritarian rulers in the MENA region attempted to hold onto their power at all costs and now in the aftermath of the Arab Spring many of them are dead or gone and their countries in ruins. Morocco is lucky to have a ruler with the foresight to avoid this particular fate. “Soft” colonization under French rule Morocco was, also, very lucky during the period of colonization. Due to the historical strength of its empire, Morocco was for the most part overlooked by France and was never much of a target for colonization. The focus was much more on Algeria and the results there were catastrophically violent. Morocco was only really colonized on a second thought spurred on by petty international feuds. The style of “soft” colonization that was used in Morocco allowed for the preservation of Moroccan culture and mostly peaceful relations.  Exotic Morocco for spicing up life A lot of this credit falls to Maréchel Lyautey, the French commander that oversaw colonization in Morocco from 1912 to 1925. Lyautey had a soft-spot for Moroccan culture and safeguarded the Moroccan traditions while modernizing the country. The French also ruled through the king by decree and the laws were written in Arabic and in the traditional way, so even though Morocco was being colonized, it wasn’t done in such an overt way. Because the period of colonization was relatively peaceful, when the independence movement started gaining momentum after WWII, the struggle for independence was primarily political and independence was achieved without violence. Because Morocco experienced very little violence during the period of colonization, foreign relations with Europe and the United States post-independence were relatively cordial. Today, Morocco enjoys close relations with the EU and the United States, and even has FTAs with both. Had things gone differently, Morocco would undoubtedly have had a harder time adjusting to its role as an independent state in the international arena. Comparatively, France’s approach to colonization in Algeria was incredibly destructive. The French wanted nothing less than to wipe out all traces of Algeria’s culture. The people native to Algeria were systematically oppressed and marginalized to a horrific degree. Algeria’s brutal colonization, transitioned to a savage war for independence, and the trauma has reverberated through the generations, shaping the psyche of Algerians today. One such impact is that to this day Algeria is somewhat suspicious of foreign actors. This has inhibited well intentioned efforts at developing Algeria’s economy or integrating Algeria into more south-south trade. European programs like MEDA I and II and agreements like the Arab-Maghreb Union seem to miss their potential due to Algeria’s unwillingness to open up relations with other states. Algeria’s violent history has also imbued their culture with issues regarding respect and tolerance. This is most noticeable in Algeria’s relations with Morocco. If the two countries where able to normalize relations and open up to trade both would see huge benefits, particularly for Algeria. Unfortunately Algeria’s government is too prideful and not trusting enough to make a move like that, so Algeria continues to suffer in its self-imposed isolation. Lack of oil in Morocco is a blessing in disguise One last factor that contributes to Morocco’s exceptional status, has less to do with history than it does with geology. Of course, geology is not the focus, but it is important enough, in this case, to be included briefly here. Morocco has virtually no oil or natural gas and relies on foreign imports for its energy needs. At first glance, this may seem to be a hindrance, but for Morocco, it’s actually a blessing in disguise. Without access to oil Morocco has had to develop its economy to be much more diverse than many of its MENA neighbors. In this regard, Petra Hannen, a freelance journalist in an article published in the GIZ magazine Akzente, issue 04/2011, argues that natural resources are not always a blessing: “Natural resource wealth is not always a blessing. Often, it goes hand in hand with poverty, corruption and conflict and seems to hinder rather than help sustainable development. For mineral wealth to have a positive impact, you need transparent policies and commodity flows and sustainable production systems. Most people think of oil states as wealthy states. But Nigeria proves that sometimes the opposite is true. It is Africa’s leading oil producer, and yet it is one of the world’s 20 poorest countries. What’s more, the people living in the Niger Delta, the country’s oil-producing region, are among Nigeria’s most impoverished communities, with a large percentage of the population having to survive on less than one dollar a day. For these people, ‘black gold’ has not brought prosperity or development. Instead, it has increased corruption, social problems, environmental damage and armed conflict. The many billions of US dollars in oil revenue that have poured into the country during its oil industry’s 50-year history have completely bypassed these communities.”  Museum of Moroccan Judaism in Casablanca Additionally, Morocco’s government hasn’t been able to pacify opposition with generous handouts from oil rents in the way that the Gulf states do, so Morocco’s government has had to be much more responsive to popular opinion. All too frequently states in the MENA region and the developing world fall victim to the resource curse, but by the luck of the draw Morocco has avoided this pitfall entirely. In fine Be it luck, cultural heritage, the actions of a few intelligent leaders, or the voices of many; Morocco has pursued a unique path through history. The tacit influences of history and culture can be hard to bring down to earth, but coupled with distinct and measurable aspects of the political and economic world, they shape Morocco’s history. In many ways Morocco is very much like the other states in the MENA region, but where it counts the most Morocco has done things a little differently, and that makes a world of a difference today.

Rabat – In an Easter week sermon delivered in St. Peter’s Square in Rome, Pope Francis recently told young people around the world to stand up and fight for their beliefs and their legitimate role in shaping society. “It is up to you not to keep quiet,” said the pontiff. He was reacting in part to the response by hundreds of thousands of young people and teenagers across the United States who marched on state capitols and in Washington, DC to make their voices heard on gun control following the shooting deaths of 17 students at a high school in Parkland, Florida on February 14. The youth-inspired grassroots nature of the March For Our Lives movement caught the nation by surprise. But it shouldn’t have; gunshot-related violence is the third leading cause of death in the United States for children and young adults ages 1 to 17. In the 1960s, young people participated in acts of civil disobedience to demonstrate their commitment to social justice issues and to highlight the fact that if an 18-year-old American male was old enough to be drafted into military service then he was old enough to participate in public policy debates, too. In Morocco, public revulsion was widespread this week when cell phone video surfaced of the sexual assault of a teenage girl. The assault reportedly took place in January; the cell phone video that captured the assault has led to the arrest of the suspected perpetrator, a 21-year old man. So began another round of public outrage and soul-searching concerning sexual harassment, sexual assault and gender equality challenges in the kingdom. More raw nerves for equality advocates, especially considering that a new national law was passed in February which more precisely identifies sexual harassment, “ill-treatment” and gender-based violence, as well as strengthening penalties for the same. In-Your-Face Activism For young adults looking to confront the sexual harassment epidemic head-on, a performance lab conducted Friday night at the Renaissance Café by young Moroccan activists called Zanka Bla Violence (streets without violence) represents a visceral in-your-face learning experience that—similar to the March For Our Lives movement—harnesses the voices of young people who have come face to face with a critically important issue. Using both video and live re-enactments of common street harassment situations, the Zanka collective deconstructed the sexual harassment phenomenon that many young women deal with everyday. The activists challenged audience members to question their preconceived notions of appropriate behavior in public spaces. The need for this kind of honest dialogue will grow as more women pursue education and vocational opportunities across Morocco. Tahadi Association, a Moroccan association working to combat sexual harassment in public places like buses and trams, conducted a survey of 200 women in 2017 and found that 75 percent of women reported being harassed on public buses. Emma Gonzalez, a senior at the Florida high school where the February 14 shooting took place, has now become a leader of the youth-led movement to reform gun laws in the US. Whatever one’s beliefs on gun control in the US, the power of young Americans to mass organize sends a message to politicians and policymakers that the legislation that they support and the laws that they pass affect those who may not now be of voting age but they soon will be. If the throngs of new student activists want to bring about change in the nation’s laws, they’ll need to stay actively engaged in the political process for months and years to come. Somebody Else’s Job? During her Washington, DC speech, Gonzalez’s admonition to young Americans was clear and blunt: “Fight for your life before it’s somebody else’s job.” A message that’s relevant, too, for young Moroccans who will enter adulthood in a new era where women rightfully expect the same opportunities for personal accomplishment that men enjoy, as well as the same expectation of public respect. Creating momentum that leads to change is difficult but it requires a personal commitment that can prevent the kind of apathy that led one frustrated young Moroccan woman, in reaction to the cell phone assault video, to tweet, “I am so done with this country.” While young Americans take a stand on public safety principles related to the nation’s gun regulations, young Moroccans can stand up and demand more of each other when it comes to gender relations and mutual respect. As Pope Francis said, “You have it in you to shout.”

Rabat – This year is crucial for women’s rights as global movements like #MeToo and #TimesUp are paying particular attention to the discriminatory rules and behavior that relegate women to a secondary status at home and in public spaces. Yet, while women in the West are struggling against gender bias, in Muslim countries they remain entangled in subsistence problems. One should not overlook the fact that in the poorest communities, poverty, unemployment, violence and prejudice against women are prevalent barriers to gender equality. I have studied gender and development in the MENA region for 19 years. My research, which has included a myriad of interviews with women from Morocco to Niger, has focused on one question: How can the national governments and international community improve the welfare of the world’s poorest women? The answer is simply to help them overcome gender inequality at all levels. There are three main reasons for this. First, this momentum creates several opportunities for the international community to support women and further their empowerment, as women now attempt to not only join but instead transform the patriarchal systems in the region.   Second, while past decades have witnessed a large number of constructive reforms and legal rights for women in some Muslim countries, much work remains to be done to make real improvements in society. Implementation of these reforms is inadequate, and cultural and societal norms constitute one of the main hurdles for female emancipation.  Third, in addition to unfavorable cultural traditions, an emerging Islamist movement – which is trying to reverse women’s accomplishments – constitutes a major challenge to women’s rights. This challenge is witnessed in many countries from Iraq to Mauritania. This opposition to gender equality not only menaces what women have realized over the decades, but also threatens to undercut any progress in gender equality.   Furthermore, women’s rights can be understood only within the complex political and cultural context of the region.  Economic, social and political development has been constantly hindered by a strong patriarchy, ongoing insecurity and conflict, stagnating economies, and absence of the rule of law.  As a result, there is a concentration of power and wealth in the hands of the male ruling political and financial elites, while women suffer from an increasing level of social marginalization and widespread poverty, from a general disillusionment with formal politics, and from a dramatic resurgence of religious extremism. To circumvent this reality, coalitions between feminist and human rights groups in the region are gathering momentum.  By linking social and economic development to women’s rights, these coalitions present women’s rights as national urgent demands.  In doing so, they are attracting the attention not only of the media, but also of decision-makers.  Indeed, in spite of discrimination, women in North Africa have over the past three decades played an avant-garde role in the socio-cultural, economic and political development of their countries. Recent trends in women’s activism and family law reform are very significant and attest to their vibrant agency.  Women’s action in some countries like Morocco and Tunisia is part of the official agenda. They use education to raise their living standards and those of their families; they help improve the economies of their countries; they feminize the political and civil society spaces, and democratize academia by pioneering gender studies.  They have used the legislation front to assert their rights as citizens and, ultimately, their independence and selfhood, thus, setting an example for the other Muslim nations. In our book titled Women in the Middle East, Fatima Sadiqi and I have shown that, while significant challenges and prejudices impede the progress of Muslim women as agents of change, the list of their accomplishments is remarkable and impressive. What is important from our perspective is that in spite of overwhelming challenges, progress is being achieved through women’s determination and will to change themselves and their societies.  However, as mentioned above, there are hurdles blocking women’s emancipation and legal rights in the region. Most countries have not agreed to all the articles of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), and the quota system is not officially recognized in most constitutions, which implies that the representation of women depends on the political agendas of individual leaders. There is also a weak commitment by many governments in the region to protect women from violence, especially domestic violence, and concerning their legal rights as victims of violence. The good news is that the inheritance law is now publicly debated in Tunisia and Morocco. Since 1976, Tunisia has taken several positive steps such as the banning of polygamy, the right to pass on a woman’s nationality to her children, the right for her to marry a non-Muslim, etc. Women’s groups have been pushing for changes in inheritance laws for the past few decades but their efforts have always been met with resistance from Islamists. Currently, women can only inherit half than men according to the Islamic law (shari’a).  One of the ways to achieve the goal of women’s rights is women’s emancipation and empowerment, and to do so, they need to have the right to own and inherit fully.  Muslim countries cannot reach their full potential if half of their population is systematically blocked from contributing. Women still struggle to have equal pay for equal work, own land, and are often discriminated against. Women in these countries are economically disadvantaged in every step of the way, in addition to unequal rights, domestic violence, and sexual harassment. Therefore, measures and policies to protect women’s rights should be introduced in order to boost their number in the workforce, and ensure that they enjoy equal rights as men.

Rabat – The French President’s wife, Brigitte Macron, has recently lodged legal complaints against individuals attempting to steal her identity to request for favors and preferential treatment from many VIP establishments and events around the world. One of Mrs. Macron’s aides said: “A complaint has been lodged and an inquiry is underway.” The same aide went on to affirm that although the numerous attempts at identity theft have been unsuccessful so far, “there are fears about her [Mrs. Macron’s] image.” RTL, the French radio station that broke the story, quoted a “close source” to the Elysée: “It’s quite clearly an attempt to damage her reputation.” According to RTL, the fraudulent emails which tried to impersonate Mrs. Macron were sent in the last ten days, and came from places like Australia, Morocco, Hong Kong, and France. The emails requested “symbolic little services,” invitation requests to VIP events and venues, and preferential treatments in luxury hotels and restaurants. In Morocco, for instance, a luxury hotel is said to have received an email requesting that Mrs. Macron’s “nephew” be warmly welcomed and picked up at a local airport. Other requested favors included “best tables at Paris’ best restaurants” as well as tickets to Australia’s Grand Prix. The scammers used the email [email protected]nce.fr whereas the official email address of the French president ends with @elysee.fr. The scam was discovered when some of the establishments contacted sent requests to the French presidency to confirm whether they were the senders of said emails.

Rabat – The first eye color change surgery on the African continent was performed in Morocco on Saturday, March 24, in Casablanca, according to le360. The 21-year-old female patient changed her eyes colors from brown to blue. The operation lasted 30 minutes and was supervised by a team of Spanish doctors, who worked alongside with Dr. Chahbi, a specialist in ophthalmology, who used a low-pain technique with few side effects, which involves injecting a pigment into the inner layers of the cornea, unlike other techniques that involve grafting a colored implant into the eye. The dyes used in this technique are made of oxidized iron that offers a wide range of colors choice, to green, blue, gray or brown. In term of price, the operation costs between MAD 15,000 and MAD 18,000. Other techniques to change eye color include a procedure that creates a circular tattoo of the cornea with a femtosecond laser, which creates a circular tunnel in the cornea for pigment injection. Another technique is called Brightocular and involves implanting a colored lens in the eye in front of the iris. However, side effects may occur with this technique, such as inflammation of the eye and cataracts, or the gradual clouding of the eye lens and accompanying decrease in vision.

Rabat – The Ministry of Interior announced the arrest of a new suspect connected to an eight-member terrorist cell dismantled on Thursday in Tangier and Oued Zem, a city in the Khouribga Province. While investigations are underway to arrest other suspects in connection with the dismantled terror cell, security officials have managed to arrest another suspect for his alleged involvement in the said cell.  According to initial investigations carried out by the Central Office for Judicial Research, which is affiliated to the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance of Morocco (DGST), the ninth suspect was arrested while in the process of obtaining financial aid from members his arrested cohort for the acquisition of materials involved in the preparation of IEDs (simple bombs made and used by unofficial or unauthorized forces). The ministry statement added that the suspects were plotting to exploit a deserted area owned by one of the detainees in order to manufacture bombs, with the greater view to undermine the stability of several places across the country. The statement concluded that the suspects will be presented before the court after investigations that have been carried out under the supervision of the public prosecutor. On Thursday, the Ministry of Interior announced the arrest of an eight-member cell in the cities of Oued Zem and in Tangier. All members were between the ages of 21 and 31 years old. The Counterterrorism Bureau (BCIJ) seized a shotgun, ammunition, knives, paramilitary clothing, computer equipment, and ISIS propaganda documents in the process of the arrest operation.

Rabat – As Morocco continues its campaigning efforts to assure and hone its hosting rights by reassuring the footballing community that is “ready” and “, news from football’s highest deciding body is rather alarming for Africa’s candidate. Following this week’s official presentations of the two contending bids for FIFA 2026 hosting rights, FIFA announced that the 2026 Task Force, a group of “experts” to evaluate the merits of each bid, would “now carry an assessment process.” The group is charged with the “technical evaluation” of contending bids’ merits, FIFA’s report said, adding that the appraisal process is supposed to “include visits to the respective member associations.” With its 2026 task force, FIFA vowed to guarantee “fairness, objectivity, and transparency.” Recognizing that his organization “has been heavily criticized for how it conducted the selection of hosts,” FIFA’s president Gianni Infantino promised that the 2026 voting procedures would be “different” and “fairer” to the contenders and all the involved parties. However, Infantino’s gospel of “impartiality” and “fairness” has not been received by many national and continental representatives in FIFA’s executive committee, therefore denying unanimous support to the FIFA officials selected to lead the 2026 Task Force. “Bids can be blocked from the FIFA Congress vote on June 13 if they are scored lowly by a task force, which is packed with people appointed to jobs by Infantino,” ESPN reported on March 28, clearly suggesting the reason for CAF and Morocco’s concerns about the Task Force’s credibility and “impartiality.” Some furious members of CAF are even reported to have accused the 2026 Task Force of being composed of “Infantino’s boys,” implying a “secret plot” to rule out or “eliminate” Morocco’s bid before the June 13 election in Moscow. Like Infantino himself, almost all the members that constitute the Task Force are known for being pro-United 2026, some CAF officials said, suggesting the prevailing belief in the Moroccan press that “none of the officials in the designated Task Force knows has a good knowledge of Morocco.” The Majority of CAF’s officials, including the organization’s president Ahmad Ahmad, think that although The Task Force can freely and rightfully appraise the technical merits of contenders, it should not have the right or power to eliminate a candidate Should the allegations be true, UEFA is joining CAF’s battle to subvert and undermine the “extensive prerogatives” of the 2026 Task Force. And according to CAF’s “African bloc,” which is a fervent supporter of Morocco’s bid, the committee should instead focus on giving the FIFA community relevant but non-binding observations, rather than decide on who is eligible or not. Despite Infantino’s incessant appeals of “neutrality and transparency,” UEFA and CAF officials are adamant that the Swiss man used his influence to select a “partial committee of “pro-Americans” (three former Yugoslavians, one Indian, and one Swiss). For them, the absence of a person with a good grasp of Morocco is a sufficient reason for partiality and inequity. Amidst the avalanche of objections, Infantino, who also recently faced criticisms over his “overt support” for United 2026’s bid, has announced that he will not be present at the FIFA gathering on June 13 in Moscow. In a statement shared with The Associated Press, FIFA said that Infantino’s decision not to join Moscow on the voting day is motivated by his commitment to “an objective and transparent vote.” Infantino’s decision has been hailed by FIFA as a sign of his “unwavering” commitment to fairness and objectivity, hinting that he would not want his presence to influence some voters on June 13. “As a reminder, the FIFA president will not take part in the vote of the congress and is not involved in the work of the task force who will conduct the technical evaluation,” FIFA’s statement to The Associated Press read. In sharp contrast, however, analysts and observers in the footballing community have been quick to perceive the Swiss man’s move as a defensive stance aimed at undermining and discrediting all the “partial” and “Pro-America” criticisms he has been receiving for the past months. Whatever the reasons for Infantino’s decision of “not meddling in the bidding contest,” and despite the 2026 Task Force’s reportedly professed inclination towards an American 2026 World Cup, the North African nation’s organizing committee has been confident that “Africa’s candidate” is more than ever ready to host the World Cup, hinting that no maneuvers will be able to undermine the “tremendous efforts” the country has been putting in the prospective success of its bid. Speaking recently at a Casablanca press conference about the Task Force controversy, Morocco’s bid chairman Moulay Hafid Elalamy said: “If we are eliminated because we do not deserve—in a sporting sense—to host the tournament, then we can accept our defeat. But if other conditions play into the contest—for we believe that we are ready and qualified to host the tournament—we’ll defend our bid and fight for our right for hosting.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Health has reduced the prices of 67 medications for several common chronic diseases. The ministry announced on Friday that this decision is part of its ongoing review of drug prices in Morocco. The reduction, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), concerns medications used in the treatment of chronic diseases, such as asthma and high blood pressure,  as well as antibiotics and drugs to reduce the cholesterol levels and to fight against certain types of cancer.  Prices were reduced by more than 30 percent for some cancer treatments. The ministry also reduced prices of medicines used to treat mental illnesses by 50 percent. The prices for antiviral medications were also been slashed by more than 50 percent, while asthma medicines decreased in price by upwards of 35 percent, according to the ministry. The ministry’s decision to reduce prices falls within the framework of the national drug policy, specifically the application of provisions in decree 2.13.852, issued on December 19, 2013.  Since the issuance of Decree No. 2.13.852 on the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs in 2013, the ministry has been able to reduce the prices of more than 3,600 medications. The health department also added that the National Drug Policy aims to encourage the local pharmaceutical industry to ensure fair access to medications and treatments for all Moroccans. In July 2017, the ministry reduced prices of medicines to treat several common illnesses, including cancer, diabetes, blood pressure, infectious diseases, and inflammatory illnesses.

By Hajare El Khaldi  Rabat- Under a new “extreme vetting” proposal,” the Trump administration plans to gather social media history from people seeking entry to the United States. Under Trump’s latest proposed shift in immigration policy, filed in the U.S. State Department today, most immigrant and non-immigrant visa applicants would be required to list all social media identities that they have used in the past five years on a federal application form forvetting and identification purposes.  While most diplomatic and official visa applicants would not be routinely asked for social media information, others would also have to list phone numbers, email addresses, and international travels from the last five years, as well as any immigration problems that they have had in the past, whether with the US or elsewhere, and potential family connections to terrorism.  Candidates from countries where female genital mutilation prevail would be directed to a website in order to make sure that they are aware about the illegality of FGM in the US.  The State Department will publish the new proposals on Friday seeking approval from the Office of Management and Budget. The public will then have a 60 days comment period. The policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies, as quoted by the Washington Times, said “this upgrade is long overdue, and it’s appropriate to apply it to everyone seeking entry, because terrorism is a worldwide problem. The aim is to try to weed out people with radical or dangerous views.”

Rabat – Concerns over the Tindouf camps situation took center stage at the 13th Social Forum, which took place from March 13-17, in Brazil. Event participants denounced the serious violations of children and women’s rights in the Tindouf camps during a conference entitled “Women and Children in Conflict Zones: The case of the Tindouf camps.” President of the Sahara Observatory for Peace, Democracy and Human Rights (OSPDH) Aicha Duihi referred to the worrying conditions facing children in the Polisario-run camps, which include forced labor, sexual abuse, and enlistment for military service. Speaking at the conference, Duihi said that “since the creation of the Tindouf camps in Algeria in 1975, Polisario officials have targeted children and young people.” She added that the children of Sahrawi people in the camps grow up in unspeakable conditions that affect their physical and psychological growth. The activist explained that schools in the area have been instrumentalized in calling for hatred, violence, and incitement of wars, adding that classes have been used for non-educational purposes, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). “These practices are inconsistent with the requirements of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which advocates education for the principles and values of freedom, equality, and tolerance,” she said. Addressing the audience, Duihi recalled the case of one of the Sahrawi child who was sent to Cuba in 1982, where (he/she) was subjected to all forms of violence along with other children from Tindouf Camps. The president of the OSPDH discussed the “hidden adoption” of the children from the Tindouf camps, who are delivered to selected families in Spain, through tacit agreements between the leaders of the Polisario and fraud organizations that present themselves as humanitarian entities. The 13th World Social Forum is organized by the Network of Moroccan Associations in Italy (RACMI), in partnership with the African Federation in Tuscany (FAT), and the Italian Moroccan Space for Solidarity (SMIS). The symposium offered participants with the opportunity to discuss the challenges of migration and exile. During the same symposium, Italian academic and journalist Massimiliano Boccolini condemned the  Tindouf camps, emphasizing that the “existence of the Tindouf camps and an armed Polisario militia that cooperates with jihadist organizations is a threat to stability” in the region.

 Rabat – The Administration of Customs and Indirect Taxes (ADII) generated a revenue of MAD 95 billion in 2017, compared to MAD 90.5 billion the previous year. Evolution of imports is mainly responsible for the revenue increase, explains the ADII in its 2017 activities report. The report states that the budgetary customs revenue amounted to MAD 89 billion–adding that all duties and taxes recovered by the ADII saw an upwards trend in 2017. The Value Added Tax (VAT) established 58 percent of the total amount of the budgetary revenue in 2017, followed by the Internal Consumption Tax (at 31 percent), the Import Duty (at 10 percent), and the Gas Pipeline Fee (at 1 percent). There was a  7.4 percent (MAD 51.4 billion) increase in  VAT incomes,due to the increase of the tax on energy and other products. Consumption Internal Taxes (TIC) increased by 4.8 percent annually, showcasing the effectiveness of the tax system. The TIC on energy products, 80 percent of which comes from the TIC levy from “Diesel fuel and Fuel-oil,” has generated MAD 15.7 billion of revenue in the past year, displaying a 3.4 percent increase when compared with 2016. The TIC on manufactured tobacco has increased by 6.3 percent since 2016, as there has been a rise in the number of cigarettes sold. For other products, the TIC has increased by 9.2% to MAD 1.7 billion  Concerning the Gas Pipeline Fee, collected incomes amounted to more than MAD 1 billion, showing a slight  growth of 1.6 percent due to a 23 percent inflation rate.  On the other hand, Import Duty revenue decreased by 5 percent, which is related to the decline of import taxation of wheat. Import duties excluding wheat have increased by 4.4 percent thanks to an improvement on tax imports.

Rabat – On Thursday, the US embassy to Algeria expressed its support for the resumption of the Morocco-Polisario negotiations, with the aim of reaching a solution to end the Western Sahara conflict. The US embassy made its statement after US Ambassador to Algeria John P. Desrocher’s two-day visit to the Tindouf camps in Algeria. According to Anadolu Agency, the US “strongly” supports the talks between the main parties to the conflict intended to reaching a “just and mutually acceptable” solution to end the conflict. Earlier in March, Morocco made its stance on the Western Sahara conflict clear in a meeting with the United Nations Personal Envoy,  Horst Kohler. King Mohammed VI emphasized these principles in a speech he made in conjunction with the 42nd anniversary of Morocco’s Green March. Desrocher’s visit came only one week after the US Congress reaffirmed its support of Morocco in the conflict by including the Western Sahara in Morocco’s aid provisions in the Appropriations Bill, approved on Thursday, March 22. The US Congress also referred to the need for more control over the aid sent to the Tindouf camps in Algeria, where an unidentified number of refugees currently live. This decision is likely tied to reports of corruption and embezzlement by the Polisario members in the camps. Morocco has been reluctant to re-launch negotiations with Polisario, as the separatist front has been carrying out several illegal maneuvers in UN restricted areas in recent months. Recently, the UN Security Council expressed its concerns over the situation in the buffer zone of Guerguerat. After the meeting between UN officials, Dutch ambassador to the UN Karel van Oosterom said that that “the members of the Security Council expressed their concern out the situation in Guerguerat,” emphasizing the importance of “maintaining the status quo, as mentioned in the report of the Secretary-General,” issued in April 2017.

Rabat – Fourteen members of the Polisario Front entered Al Mahbes, a restricted area close to the Algerian border in northeastern Western Sahara, on Thursday. A security source told Moroccan news outlet Le360 that “fourteen elements of the Polisario front raided, this Thursday evening, between 10:10 p.m. and 19:00 p.m, the locality of Mhabes, aboard four Jeep military vehicles.” The source added that the armed elements have installed several tents in the locality of the Moroccan province of Assa Zag, an area which is restricted by the UN 1991 ceasefire resolution. The separatist group has been defying the United Nations’ 2351 resolution on the regulation of the statues of the Western Sahara buffer zones since December 2017.  The front has also been threatening to move its “defense headquarters” to the restricted buffer zone of Bir Lahlou. The sources claimed that the process of relocating the separatists’ headquarters to Bir Lahlou “has started and will be completed within a short period.” The news was widely reported by Moroccan press yesterday. Polisario’s maneuvers are underway in a time when the United Nations is preparing its annual report on the Western Sahara question. Observers argue that this provocative actions will hinder the settlement process, a situation which raised concerns in the UN Security Council in a meeting held on March 22, in the presence of the UN Personal Envoy Horst Kohler. On March 21 in New York, the Security Council expressed its concern about the situation in the buffer zone of Guerguerat, stressing the importance of maintaining the status quo. The council’s president, Karel van Oosterom, condemned the provocative actions of Polisario, emphasizing that “there should be no change in the status of the buffer zone.” The UN official stressed that the Security Council has also underscored the need for the “full implementation of resolution 2351

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – The United Nations Committee on the Exercise of Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People chose Morocco as the host for the 5th International Conference on the Palestinian Question. The upcoming conference will be held on May 17 and 18 in Rabat, and members will convene to discuss the future of Palestine in light of the United States’ unilateral decision to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The new embassy is also set to open in May, coinciding with the 70th anniversary of Israel declaring independence. Speaking in New York on Wednesday, March 28, Palestinian Ambassador to the United Nations Riyad Mansour said, “obviously, nothing will back down the US Administration and everything seems to be in place for this announcement to take effect.” The decision of US President Donald Trump sparked international outcry and condemnation across the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe. Global leaders, including Morocco’s King Mohammed VI, voiced their concern that this decision jeopardized the long-term peace negations between Palestine and Israel. In a December 5th letter to Donald Trump, Morocco’s king expressed his “deep concern” over the current US administration’s decision, which contravenes the UN Security Council resolution 2334 (2017). The king’s sentiments were reiterated this week by Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita during a visit to Jerusalem on March 27. After praying at the Al Aqsa mosque on the Temple Mount, Bourita reportedly said that “the prayer at the Al-Aqsa Mosque is a strong message of support for the Palestinian cause.” Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas recently thanked Morocco’s monarch for his “unwavering support,” in a meeting with Bourita. This visit was part of an official the invitation of Abbas, to hold meetings and review the Palestinian question.

Rabat – Pedophilia, sex slavery, rape, dangerous sexual practices: one Moroccan returnee shares her frightening experience living among Daesh fighters.  Salma El-Harraq, a Moroccan woman who returned from Daesh, has recently opened up to the National Criminal Police Brigade about her alarming sexual trauma at the hands of members of the Islamic State, as reported in the March 28 edition of Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath. Perceived as mere sexual objects for the fighters’ to exploit, women are among the first to feel the terrorist organization’s wrath.  The returnee recounted the sufferings of Yazidi women, belong to a Kurdish religious minority, who were taken as spoils of war.  These women, among others, were displayed in a market in Hassiba commune on the Iraqi-Syrian borders, and sold them like cattle based on tariffs set by the leader of the terrorist organization.  The prices varied between minors and older girls, as the terrorist militants also have the right to “keep” girls as young as seven years old, on the condition that they will perform sexual acts when they reach the age of 12. Prisoners of war were forced to perform housework and errands, in addition to being sexually enslaved by the fighter who is given the right to violate them under the blessing of a fatwa issued by Daesh’s religious theorists.  Daesh’s sex victims, according to El Harraq, were also prostituted by the combatants, in exchange for a road pass, internet connection, or food.  Those sentenced to death and awaiting execution were not exempted from sexual assault, neither were those whose previous fighter partners passed away or were traveling outside of the camp. Al Ahdath noted that high prevalence of unprotected sex  might mean that a large number of the combatants and their wives, sex slaves, and children are infected with sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. A 2017 United Nations report urged the Iraqi government to extend help to women victims, Yazidi and other minorities, of Daesh sexual slavery.  “The physical, mental and emotional injuries inflicted by ISIL are almost beyond comprehension,” stressed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad.

Rabat – In a recent interview with the American daily, The Washington Post, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) revealed that Riyadh had spread Wahhabi ideology, at the request of its Western allies to counter the influence of the Soviet Union (USSR) in Muslim countries, during the Cold War.  The powerful heir to the Saudi throne made the statement during a 75-minute interview with the Washington Post, on March 22, on the sidelines of his first diplomatic visit to the United States since being named crown prince. According to bin Salman, the Saudi-funded spread of Wahhabi ideology began in the second half of the twentieth century after Saudi Arabia’s Western allies urged the country to invest in mosques and madrassas overseas during the Cold War, to help counter the influence of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. “Our allies demanded that we use our resources to accomplish this task,” Bin Salman said. The Crown prince also admitted that successive Saudi governments have gone astray, and now “we have to get it all back.” “Funding now comes largely from Saudi-based foundations,” he said, rather than from the government. Wahhabism is an Islamic doctrine and religious movement, named after its founder, an eighteenth-century preacher, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. The movement has long been variously described as an ultraconservative and austere faith, in addition of being a source of global terrorism. In an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes” broadcast last Sunday, the crown prince discussed a myriad of topics including his reform efforts at home, lambasting rigid doctrines that have long governed Saudi Arabia in response to the Iranian revolution in 1979, after which Saudi Arabia wanted to “copy the Iranian model.” “Saudi Arabia was not like this before ’79. Saudi Arabia and the entire region went through a revival after ’79. … All we’re doing is going back to what we were: a moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world and to all traditions and people,” Bin Salman said. “I believe Islam is sensible, Islam is simple, and people are trying to hijack it,” he told the Washington Post. When Mohammed Bin Salman became the crown prince, the kingdom has witnessed important reforms as he announced his plans to change the country’s economic visions. At 32, Bin Salman pledged to make Saudi Arabia “a place for dreamers who want to change the world.” The Saudi crown prince, has previously vowed to return the country to “moderate Islam” and asked for global support to transform the hardline kingdom into an open society that empowers citizens and draws investors.

Rabat – There is a reason that success stories are among the most compelling human stories: they humanize life and remind us of the essential truth that it is possible to beat the odds, to rise above one’s socio-economic condition. In a way, success stories that are truly compelling are also truly humane because they’re a constant reminder that we can, by way of perseverance, be “the heroes of our stories.” Such is Rachid Khadiri Abdelmoula’s incredible success story. Earlier this week, the Moroccan’ determination and unflinching professional devotion brought him the highest accolade of the academic world: a PhD. Rachid was enrolled at the Polytechnic University of Turin, where he started off as a street vendor financing his studies with his meager income. And because receiving a PhD in Civil engineering is the result of years of dedication and hard work, Rachid’s story has made the rounds in the Italian press. Even Italian political parties and associations known for their vehement opposition to immigrants and their fascist rhetoric have publicly praised the Moroccan’s efforts, hailing him as “a symbol of integration.” Born in 1987, Rachid left his native Morocco in 1998 to join two of his older brothers in Turin, Italy. There, he told his brothers that his objective is to start working as soon as possible to send remittances to his parents back home. But his brothers convinced him to pursue his studies, persuading him that good and deservedly earned certificates would increase his chances of climbing the “restrictive” social ladder in Italy. Rachid took heed of his brothers’ counsel, but he nonetheless decided to combine school and work. As a vendor of lighters, napkins, newspapers, and other little gadgets in the streets of Turin, the Moroccan toured a city he now declares to know like the back of his hand. He used his street vendor’s income to “survive and finance my studies at the Polytechnic University of Turin,” one of Italy’s leading institutions. Every day after school, Rachid told Republica, he would take on his ‘street vendor identity’, touring the streets of Turing and selling his collection of handy little gadgets. “It has been a strenuous journey,” he told the outlet, especially recalling memories of the days when he would “spend an entire day walking through the streets of Turin without even making €10.” Once at home at nights, despite the fatigue of meandering through Turin’s streets, “I had to study… I was really afraid I would fail that year,” he explained, remembering the ghosts of his first year at university. He also mentioned the “racist attacks” and “daily struggles” he survived before meeting some “good friends” on whom he could sometimes count to fill the gap. For his PhD thesis, Rachid spent eight months in Switzerland at a CEMEX, a global leader in the ‘building materials’ market. “It was an experimental immersion in the company’s work,” Rachid later said of the Swiss episode of his academic training, adding: “It was a marvelous experience. I worked and collaborated with 24 different nationalities.” Many on social media have shared videos of the best moments of Rachid’s PhD ceremony. A user commented on Facebook: “In these times of fear and suspicion, when populist and anti-immigration rhetoric is gaining considerable ground, and when the media only underscore criminal deeds by some specific communities, stories like his need to be shared and acknowledged.” Once a street vendor bereft of the most basic necessities, Rachid has become, as they say in Italian academia, a “Maestro.”  Applauding and celebrating Rachid’s implausible and dared success, some social media users also commented that they “hope that stories like this will set an example for many youth in Morocco.”

By Reuben Abati Rabat – I was in Morocco recently, about 20 years after I last visited Timbuktu, Marrakech, Casablanca, Rabat and Laayoune. I was quite impressed to see how Morocco with its colour-coded cities remains very much an organized, efficient and a comparatively competitive country.  The trip this time began from the Lagos airport aboard the Royal Air Maroc, which now plies the Lagos-Casablanca route. Twenty years earlier, I had to go first to Paris, France, change from one airport to the other, before boarding another flight to Morocco. This crisis of transportation, having to go to Europe before accessing African countries, poses a major threat to trade, co-operation and integration among African countries. This time around, Lagos to Casablanca took no more than 4 hours. The flight was full; the passengers were mostly Nigerians.  I would later discover that these passengers were not necessarily going to Morocco to attend the Crans Montana conference on Africa and South-South Co-operation taking place in Dhakla, they were transit passengers going to New York or Europe. Casablanca to New York is about 6 hours, and the cost of travel either to the US or Europe through Morocco is much cheaper. The Bilateral Air Services Agreement (BASA) between Nigeria and Morocco has brought both countries closer, with many Nigerian businessmen taking advantage of the opportunity to trade with Morocco. Many Nigerian students are also now going to school in Moroccan universities and technical colleges. As I took in these details, and reflected on the vast possibilities of closer Nigeria-Morocco relations, what struck me as I left Casablanca for Rabat, was not even the beauty of the roads and the skyline, or the meaty, physically majestic cattle that grazed on the fields along the highway, not disturbing motorists or crossing the road, or causing any violence, unlike Nigerian cattle and their herders, but the fact that it is this same Morocco, with its near-First-World standards, that has been struggling since early 2017 to be admitted as a member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Nigerian trade unions, business investors and some former diplomats have been in the forefront of the objection to Morocco’s membership of ECOWAS. The reasons they offer are largely sentimental, not fact-based, not informed, all made worse by what seems to be a continuing lack of rigour in the management of Nigeria’s foreign policy process. In January 2017, Morocco returned to the African Union (AU) after 33 years of absence.  Under King Mohammed VI of Morocco, there has been in the last seven years or so, a concerted diplomatic effort to assert Morocco’s Africanism and to reach out to other African countries outside North Africa. Morocco’s issue with Algeria, the crisis in Libya, and the conflict of objectives and goals among the members of the African Maghreb Union  (UMA) perhaps makes this re-strategizing of Morocco’s foreign policy pragmatic and inevitable. Having returned to the AU, Morocco took the additional step of seeking the membership of ECOWAS. In June 2017, at the 51st meeting of ECOWAS Heads of State and Government held in Monrovia, Liberia, ECOWAS agreed in principle to Morocco’s application for membership. The ECOWAS Commission then put a team together to prepare an Impact Report on Morocco’s proposed membership to be considered at the 52nd meeting of the ECOWAS Heads of State and Government scheduled for November 2017 in Abuja, Nigeria. As it turned out, ECOWAS could not consider the 70-page Report as scheduled, due to its busy agenda, as was claimed, but a committee of five comprising the Heads of State of Togo, Cote D’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea and Nigeria was empaneled to study the Report and advise the ECOWAS Heads of State and Governments accordingly. The Extraordinary session planned for the first quarter of 2018 at which a decision is to be communicated in this regard, has not yet taken place, but Morocco’s proposed membership has already generated much interest across the sub-region. In Nigeria, for example, the Joint Committees on Foreign Affairs and Co-operation for Africa on November 15, 2017, organized a one-day public hearing titled “Public Hearing on the Review of Nigeria’s Membership of ECOWAS in view of Morocco’s bid to be admitted into the Regional Body.” Some of the arguments advanced at that event and which may have influenced Nigeria’s lack of clarity so far on the Morocco question are at best ridiculous. It was argued for example that if Morocco joins ECOWAS, Nigeria will disintegrate. How? Nigeria is a member of the D-8 and the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC); it has not disintegrated on account of that. No member-country of ECOWAS is in a position to disintegrate another country for whatever reason under the Constitutive protocols.  It was also said, and this really exposes the hypocrisy involved, that Nigeria should block Morocco because it is one of the most corrupt countries in the world. This is not true. Morocco’s corruption perception index has consistently improved while Nigeria’s CPI continues to worsen. Nigeria has no moral right to condemn any other country on the ground of corruption, and if this were a criterion for international relations, many countries including Nigeria would have been expelled from the United Nations long ago. It was further argued at that forum and in the Nigerian media that “any attempt to allow the North African country to join ECOWAS will subvert Nigeria’s economic prosperity.” The evidence given in this regard is that Morocco is an associate of the EU under the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP). And: Nigeria having refused to sign the ECOWAS-Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union could become a dumping ground for cheaper goods from Europe through Morocco, thus crippling investments across the sub-region. Our response is that in the long run, ECOWAS member-states in general, would have to strengthen their capacity to compete and be productive, rather than hide under protectionist policies. One other ridiculous excuse that has been given is that ECOWAS owes its existence and survival to Nigeria and that Nigeria should not allow any new country to reduce its control over ECOWAS. It is precisely this kind of undiplomatic talk that continues to make other countries in ECOWAS suspicious of Nigeria’s motives and unappreciative of the country’s contributions to the  regional body. Other non-sequitur arguments raised by Nigerians include the Western Sahara issue or that Morocco is a monarchy, rather, a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. What is required is a dispassionate study of Morocco’s application, even of similar applications from Tunisia, which is seeking an observer status in ECOWAS and Mauritania, which left in 2000 but now wants to return. Technically, those opposed to Morocco’s membership have advanced two noteworthy arguments so far but even then, both can be interrogated. The first is the argument about contiguity. They insist that Morocco is not contiguous with any West African country and may not meet the geographical criterion as defined in the Council of Ministers Resolution/Res 464 (XXVI) of the OAU, 1976, which divides Africa into 5 geo-political regions namely Northern, Western, Central, Eastern and Southern Africa. In this regard, Morocco is classified as a North African country along with Algeria, Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia. Further, Article 1 of the revised ECOWAS Treaty of July 24, 1993, defines members of ECOWAS as countries within the geographical region known as West Africa.  So, how about Mauritania? However, it is clearly within the powers of the ECOWAS Heads of State and Governments to determine that geography cannot debar an interested African country from joining ECOWAS. Economic and political considerations should override geography that is merely nomenclatural, particularly if the applicant-countries are within Africa. Opening up ECOWAS beyond geographical boundaries would be more in keeping with the long-term goal of the AU, which is the creation of an African Economic Community (AEC) that promotes the integration and cooperation of the various regional blocs in the continent. Incidentally, this is the growing global trend. For example, Egypt, Tunisia and Libya are members of the Common Market of Eastern and Southern African States (COMESA).  Algeria has also submitted its accession applications to this economic body. Integration is not uncommon. The Community of Saharan States (CEN-SAD) cuts across ECOWAS, ECCAS, COMESA and UMA countries. The D-8 is an economic association of development countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America.  To push the counter-argument a bit further, if geography were the sole issue, ECOWAS by now should have long admitted contiguous countries like Sao Tome and Principe, Equitorial Guinea, Chad and Cameroon which have also expressed interest in ECOWAS membership. The other major argument on the Morocco question is whether or not the country would commit to the principles of the revised ECOWAS Treaty. ECOWAS can afford to insist on its principles and objectives. It is, after all, one of the most successful regional groupings in Africa. In pursuit of its Africanism agenda, and perhaps to demonstrate its interest and commitment, Morocco has consistently identified with ECOWAS principles. Even without yet being a member, Morocco has since established strong ties with Mali, Senegal, and Mauritania, which are exempted from entry visas to Morocco. The country is also strongly involved with Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, and Mali where it provides support for agriculture and healthcare systems. The objection to Morocco by certain Nigerians should in fact be investigated closely.  It is on record that Morocco and Nigeria are involved in a gas pipeline project, the Morocco-Nigeria gas pipeline; there is also a BASA agreement, which unfortunately, Nigeria currently lacks the will to utilize. Both countries are also partners in a phosphate project in Kaduna. Some states in Nigeria have also signed co-operation agreements with Morocco, notably Bauchi state which is partnering with the OCP-Group of Morocco in agriculture and fertilizer production. OCP is the largest exporter of phosphate in the world.  While some Nigerians are busy arguing whether Morocco is good for ECOWAS or not, the truth is that many Nigerians are already benefitting from Moroccan partnerships.  There are 3,000 documented Nigerians currently living in Morocco – 195 of them are in prison. There is even a gallery of African Arts in Morocco featuring many Nigerian art works. There are also Nigerian students quietly enjoying scholarships in Moroccan colleges. At the level of person-to-person diplomacy, there are Nigerians doing business in Morocco, making huge profits. Take sardine, that variety of fish Nigerians enjoy, and import from Europe. Morocco has one of the largest troves of sardines in the world along its Continental shelf on the Atlantic all the way to the island of Sardinia in Italy from which the fish takes its name. It is cheaper to bring in fish from Morocco than to import from Europe! Morocco is the world’s leading producer of Sardines. I have given these details just in case the vocal anti-Morocco lobbyists in Nigeria are doing so for their own selfish purposes. My suspicion really, is that there is a growing body of anti-trade lobbyists, and greedy rent-collectors, who want Nigeria isolated from the rest of the world and who are actively doing whatever they can to seize and exercise an undeserved monopoly over Africa’s largest market. Right now, 40 European and African organizations are opposing the Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline project, actively encouraged of course by Nigerian economic dream-blockers. Membership of ECOWAS comes with both costs and benefits for Morocco.  It is the second largest investing country in Africa after South Africa, with a GDP of about $100 billion, and according to Quantum Global Research Report 2018, “the most attractive economy for investments in Africa.” ECOWAS membership will grant it access to a market of about 320 million consumers, but it would also result in an influx of ECOWAS immigrant population. Morocco would be obliged to respect the free movement of such persons and of goods within the region, adopt the ECOWAS passport and join the Common External Tariff (TEC).  Here is the trade-off: Morocco’s direct investment in ECOWAS has doubled between 2011 and 2017, from MAD 295 million to over 2 billion.  This can only grow higher. When it comes to the vote on the Morocco question, Nigeria should prioritize its own interests and not the selfish and emotional preference of a few.  Foreign policy requires greater rigour and creativity than we have seen lately in Abuja. It is a blunder for example, I repeat, that President Muhammadu Buhari stayed away from the Extra-ordinary session of the AU in Kigali on the African Continental Free Trade Area Treaty, the same treaty that had been approved and endorsed by the Federal Executive Council (FEC), just because some unionists screamed that they were not consulted.  Did Nigeria not participate in the negotiations of the treaty? An ad-hoc, knee-jerk management of foreign policy will only make us look more ridiculous in the eyes of the world.

Rabat –  The Morocco 2026 organizing committee continues to invest massive efforts to prove to the footballing world that Morocco is the right candidate to host the 23rd edition of world football’s most pivotal tournament. And so, knowing that the communications may be the defining factor in settling the fierce competition between the two contenders for the 2026 hosting rights, Morocco’s bid committee is reported to have recently requested support  from Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo and Egypt’s playmaker Mohamed Salah. The information was released on Wednesday this week by the Turkish news outlet Anadolu Press Agency. According to the outlet, officials of Morocco 2026 contacted the two stars, requesting them to endorse and represent the North African country’s 2026 bid as official ambassadors. Reporting on this important development for Morocco’s 2026 hopes, a number of national outlets quoted an “important official” of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation who reportedly spoke on conditions of anonymity. Speaking with high expectations for Morocco’s bid, the source confirmed the report: “We are currently holding negotiations [with Cristiano Ronaldo and Mohamed Salah], and an agreement could be reached in coming days” said the source, hopeful, adding that “Other big names of the footballing world have also been contacted,” or will soon be. Another source, also reported to be in the inner circle of the organizing committee, has been quoted as saying: “The five-time Ballon d’Or winner and Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo, together with Liverpool’s darling, the Egyptian Mohamed Salah, are currently in advanced negotiations [with Morocco’s 2026 committee] to represent the kingdom’s bid.” Considering the tough competition between Morocco and United 2026 (USA/Canada/Mexico), endorsement from these two established and high-caliber stars of the beautiful game is without doubt a morale boost for Morocco 2026. And some outlets are already hinting at the public euphoria that a Moroccan World Cup would mean. “Morocco has sent a vibrant message to United 2026 which has frustratingly been failing to convince the sport’s big names to join its cause,” Moroccan outlet Le 360 wrote on Wednesday. It is worth reminding that many football legends, including Didier Drogba, Samuel Eto’o, and El Hadj Diouf, among others, have already lent their support to Morocco 2026, accepting to be Morocco’s bid’s ambassadors. With big stars set to join Morocco’s cause in the next few days, or months, the North African country is truly preparing an attractive armada of legends and stars to convince the footballing world of the superiority and merits of its bid.

Rabat – The Ministry of Interior has just issued a statement regarding a dangerous terrorist cell dismantled today, by the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations.  According to the statement the cell was composed of eight members and followed the extremist religious ideology of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.  The terrorist organization, which was active in the cities of Oued Zem, near Khouribga, and in Tangier, was on the look for explosive devices to cause large-scale terrorist acts in sensitive sites across the kingdom.  The operation  seized one shotgun, ammunition, knives, paramilitary clothing, computer equipment, and propaganda documents for the Islamic State.  According to the same source, the members–aged between 21 and 31 years old–were planning to murder one of their own, after doubting his loyalty to the terrorist organization.  The statement declared that this operation is line with the country’s efforts to avert the great danger posed by supporters of the Islamic State in Morocco. The terrorist suspects will be brought to justice following extensive investigation by the public prosecutor.

Rabat – Representatives of Beijing and Rabat have established a joint Morocco-China business council to promote China’s gigantic Silk Road project. The council is set to oversee and implement the regulations of the bilateral agreement that Morocco and China signed in November 2017, regarding China’s Silk Road initiative. On Tuesday this week, a Chinese delegation paid a working visit to Rabat as part of the two parties’ commitment to fostering their 2017 Beijing agreement. The Chinese delegation also took part in the China-Morocco economic forum, a business convention organized by the CGEM (Morocco’s Employers Union), in collaboration with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT). The Council envisions bringing the two countries closer together, with the aim expanding and consolidating commercial exchanges. During Tuesday’s economic forum, the two parties agreed to sign a memorandum to push for more bilateral engagement. The memorandum put a special emphasis on the promotion and endorsement of China’s “Belt and the Road” initiative, boosting Morocco-China cooperation on many fronts, especially maritime exchanges. According to China’s State Council, this project will reinvent trans-regional exchanges and cooperation. Faiçal Memkouar, the general vice-president of the CGEM, and Jiang Zengwei, CCPIT’s chairperson, agreed to involve their organizations in their countries’ growing bilateral ties, pushing for Morocco’s regional leadership in the African part of China’s monumental trans-regional project. As the Council will facilitate “the sharing of information” as “a joint platform” to ease investments agreements between the two countries, it is also expected to bring Moroccan and Chinese business leaders closer, especially by organizing a series of “business-to-business” meetings between Moroccan businessmen and their Chinese counterparts. The signatories of the memorandum declared that this will play a key role not only in furthering bilateral deals, but also in “concretizing existing business opportunities.” Morocco’s exportations to China have reached an impressive figure of 70 percent, the China-Morocco Silk Road Council noted, adding that more concrete partnership agreements will be signed in coming years. China is Morocco’s fourth commercial partner, and the Morocco-China Silk Road Council is expected to double the existing figures of Sino-Moroccan relations. China wants to maintain and further its growing global geostrategic prominence, and Morocco, as the first African nation to join the Silk Road initiative, is said to be a determining player in the project’s Africa branch. In that regard, the signatories of the memorandum stressed that the North African country’s geostrategic situation serves as the “unquestioned bridge between Africa and Europe,” which makes it an indispensable asset in a project as big as China’s “Belt and Road.”

Rabat- France continues its crackdown on suspected Islamic radicals with the expulsion of the Moroccan Imam, Mohammed Tlaghi, who is accused of calling believers to “pray for jihadists around the world” and to “destroy the enemies of Islam in France and in the world” in many of his sermons, French authorities announced on Wednesday.  The deputy imam of the Torcy mosque, located in east of Paris, was deported to Morocco on Wednesday, following his arrest by police services early morning.  “He will be taken back to the border under an expulsion order and must take a plane to Morocco during the day,” local authorities said. A deportation committee had issued in December 2017, a statement against expelling the 50-year-old, who had been living in France since 1992. Tlaghi also worked as a professor of mathematics before being suspended from his post by the National Education in France. “He is accused of having violated basic principles of the Republic,” his lawyer, Gilles Devers, said at that time.  “If my client receives a notification of the deportation order, we will file an interlocutory liberty in the administrative court of Melun,” Devers added. The decision included sermons held in 2016 and 2017, during which “the two imams of the mosque had explicitly legitimized armed jihad by calling on the faithful to pray for jihadists around the world to destroy the enemies of the mosque in France and in the world.” The French daily, le Parisien, reported that the Torcy mosque, which could accommodate up to 500 worshipers, was the subject of an administrative closure order in April 2017, for being “a place where radicalism and incitement to jihad were advocated.” After the closure order, all Tlaghi’s assets were frozen by the French government.

Rabat- King Mohammed VI condemned the Houthi missile strikes against Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, March 27, expressing his “deep sorrow” and “his absolute solidarity with the brotherly Saudi kingdom” to the guardian of the two holy mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. “I learned with deep sorrow and indignation the news of missile fire targeting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, brother, from Yemeni territory,” said King Mohammed VI in a message addressed to King Salman. In this message, the monarch condemned the attacks, which he described as “despicable criminal aggression,” in his personal name and on behalf of the Moroccan people. He then reaffirmed Morocco’s “outright solidarity with the brotherly Saudi people.”  King Mohammed VI also voiced Morocco’s steadfast support for the steps and measures undertaken by King Salman “to preserve the security of his brotherly kingdom and face up any threat to peace and stability in the region.” Saudi authorities announced they have intercepted seven ballistic missiles fired by Houthi rebels backed by Iran, which targeted four Saudi cities, including the capital Riyadh, in the early hours of Monday.  Houthi rebels fighting in Yemen’s civil war claimed responsibility for the attacks.  The Houthi rebels have fired ballistic missiles into Saudi territory repeatedly over the past three years. However, this is the biggest rebel attack on the Saudi capital since the kingdom intervened in Yemen’s war and launched coalition strikes against them in 2015.  Morocco is one of eight Arab states to have joined Saudi Arabia in the military intervention against the Houthi advance.  The coalition, which is receiving logistical support from the United States, Britain, and France, launched air strikes against the Houthis and allied army units loyal to Yemen’s ousted former president Ali Abdullah Saleh with the aim of restoring the government of exiled President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.

Rabat – Algeria’s Ennahar TV has announced Algeria’s support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup Bid. The North African country has also allowed its former football star Lakhdar Belloumi to represent Morocco as its bid ambassador. In an interview broadcasted by Algerian Al Haddaf TV, Belloumi previously announced that he refused Morocco’s offer to become an ambassador for the country’s 2026 World Cup Bid.  The offer, according to Algerian news source Algerie-focus, was addressed to Belloumi by Hicham El Amrani, member of Morocco’s 2026 bid committee. After receiving the invitation, Belloumi declined the offer to avoid contradiction with “the decisions of the high instances,” referring to the official Algerian position, a close source told Algerie Focus. The Algerian legendary footballer said in the interview that he refused Morocco’s offer because “It is a shame to leave his country to work somewhere else.”  He also expressed his disappointment in the absence of a commensurate employment offer in his homeland, Algeria, after being offered a job opportunity in Morocco.  Last month, Kheireddine Zetchi, president of the Algerian Football Federation (FAF) told Algerian TV channel Ennahar that “Algeria will stand with Morocco and help it to clinch the rights to host the World Cup,” on the sidelines of the 40th Ordinary General Assembly, which took place in Casablanca on Friday, February 2.

The Algerian legendary footballer said in the interview that he refused Morocco’s offer because “it is a shame to leave his country to work somewhere else.” He also expressed his disappointment over being offered a job opportunity, while he was not offered an employment in  Algeria.  Morocco’s offer is part of its strategy to appoint renowned public figures and football stars as ambassadors from all over the world to campaign and promote its bid. In January, Morocco appointed Samuel Eto’o as one of its bid ambassadors. The former Barcelona and Inter Milan star is said to be a fervent supporter of Morocco’s candidacy. Morocco’s World Cup bid is impressing the world. Many countries have expressed their unconditional support for Morocco’s candidacy. The list of Morocco’s supporters includes: Qatar, Belgium, Russia, Luxembourg, France, Tunisia, Nigeria, and Serbia. Last month, Kheireddine Zetchi, president of the Algerian Football Federation (FAF) told Algerian TV channel Ennahar that “Algeria will stand with Morocco and help it to clinch the rights to host the World Cup” on the sidelines of the 40th Ordinary General Assembly, which took place in Casablanca on Friday, February 2.

Rabat – While the “Me Too” movement continues to surge in Britain and America, women’s stories of sexual harassment in and out of the workplace have garnered international attention around the world, including in several European countries and Morocco. According to Assabah in its March 28 edition, a “political leader” has been arrested and convicted for sexually harassing the women in his professional network. The incident occurred in Safi, a province in Settat. According to reports, the political leader in question—whose name has not been revealed in news reports—was handed a six-year prison sentence for demanding sexual favors from his female subordinates and other women. The Settat court verdict followed a series of appeals by a number of women (colleagues and others) who said to have received inappropriate sexual advances from the suspect. As the suspect is also a prominent businessman in the Settat region, complainants said in their files that he sexually harassed them and requested sexual favors in exchange for financial help or subvention for their projects. Speaking to the press under conditions of anonymity, a 30-year old president of a civil society organization recounted her experience with the suspect. In her statement, she reported to have paid a visit to the suspect’s office concerning a project her association was undertaking, seeking support—mainly financial—from the businessman. As she prepared to leave the suspect’s office, he told her to stay longer because he needed to “talk about something important,” the woman said, explaining that the suspect suddenly got up and kissed her. When she objected to his advances, he allegedly cooled down and told her: “Consider this as a kiss from your father.” “But my father does not kiss me in this way,” Assabah quoted the woman as saying. According to Assabah, the woman was the first to submit a complaint with the Settat Appeal Court. However, in the course of procedures preceding the trial, she discovered that her case was not an “isolated one”: many other women had been through similar experiences with the same man.  Her courage emboldened the other women to sue the suspect, Assabah reported. The suspect reportedly contacted many of the women in a bid to persuade them—mainly by offering them huge sums of money—to withdraw their complaints. But his efforts were countered by many women’s rights associations that convinced the women to continue their fight, promising them support throughout the trial, Assabah added. The man was handed a six-year sentence, as well as a fee of 2,000 to 20,000 MAD if he attempts to approach or contact any of his victims

Rabat – The Commission Nationale de Recours de la Deuxième Opération de Régularisation (Morocco’s National Committee in Charge of Monitoring Immigrant Regularization) has recently announced that the country’s authorities are taking steps to regularize over 24,000 migrants. According to the Commission Nationale, the move is a much-needed response to Morocco’s growing status as a “destination country,” as opposed to its previous “transit country” status.  As many immigrants are now choosing to establish themselves in Morocco, the Commission has decided to soften the requirements for granting papers to immigrants in Morocco in line with government policy. This is expected to facilitate the legal, as well as professional, integration of the thousands of immigrants in Moroccan territory. The press release also mentioned that relevant authorities received around 28,400 applications. After a close scrutiny of the documents, the decision was made to grant legal status to over 24,000 people, thus giving them the rights to live and work in Morocco.  The Commission’s work seeks to create and promote an immigration-friendly environment, both in the workplace context and in society at large. The document also suggested that Morocco wants to emphasize a safe, organized, and beneficial immigration policy, as prescribed by the UN and other international organizations. This campaign of softening immigration-related regulations follows “a fully humanistic philosophy,” the document said, adding that the decision to ease the eligibility for legal status aims at enlarging the number of beneficiaries.” The statement also put a special emphasis on King Mohammed VI’s personal push for immigration reform throughout the evolution of the process.  According to the National Commission’s statement, Morocco’s determination to reduce immigrations costs, including documentation and insertion of beneficiaries into new networks, is an indicator of King Mohammed’s unfailing support for good government practices and a legal framework oriented towards integration and inclusiveness.  Among the people to be granted legal status, the commission is said to have prioritized the following categories of immigrants: women and their children, unaccompanied minors, foreigners with a job but no valid contract, foreigners married to Moroccan nationals, and immigrants with a relatively good level of education but no legal residency. For Driss Yazami, the commission’s president, Morocco is taking significant steps to minimize the burden and costs (social, economic, and psychological) of immigration.  By easing legal status requirements, and by granting papers to such a whopping number of people, the country, under the auspices of the King, is determined to prioritize, value, and respect the human dignity and rights of the people living in its territory, some members of the Commission told the press.

Rabat – The Public Prosecutor in Marrakech’s Court of Appeals announced the opening of an investigation on Wednesday on the alleged perpetrator of the sexual assault against a young girl in Bouchane. After the arrest of the alleged suspect on Wednesday, the court of appeals is carrying out a judicial investigation to determine the circumstances of the filmed incident that has been shaking social media since Tuesday. The incident took place in Bouchane, a small town and rural commune in Rehamna Province of the Marrakech-Safi region. The Royal Gendarmerie made their arrest earlier today and placed the defendant in custody while investigations are underway.  The incident occurred back in January, and the victim has now been identified. The 55-second video has stirred backlash and concern among Moroccan citizens on social media. A hashtag is now being used to decry the incident. The hashtag “#Wash_Maandakch_Khtek” (translation: “Don’t you have a sister?”) echoes the young woman’s pleas, heard in the video as she tries stop her abuser. Seven months ago, similar graphic footage was released of a group of teenagers sexually assaulting a mentally ill-girl on a bus in Casablanca. The incident resulted in public protests in Morocco’s major cities, including Rabat and Casablanca, to denounce the lack of public safety.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – The head of the Moroccan counterterrorism agency has declared that France did not warn the kingdom about the Moroccan origins of the gunman responsible for the Trèbes attack, despite suspicion of potential radical ties.    The Director of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations, Abdelhak Khiame, told the U.S-based news agency the Associated Press on Tuesday that the bureau was not properly notified of the attacker’s radical positions.   This came as a surprise to the counterterrorism agency and the French authorities, who usually maintain an active information exchange about individuals with dual French-Moroccan citizenship. Although French authorities had been monitoring the attacker, identified as Radouane Lakdim, before Friday’s deadly incident, they failed to alert the Moroccan bureau. “His [Lakdim’s] country of birth should have been notified that its [a Moroccan] national was under surveillance by French security,” said Khiame. According to police investigations, the 25 year-old suspect of the attack in Trèbes was born in Morocco on April 11, 1992, but moved to France with his family in 2004 and consequently obtained French citizenship. Following the attack in Trèbes, the Moroccan counterterrorism agency investigated Lakdim’s family, but found no signs of alarming radical beliefs. Khiame added that throughout all of Lakdim’s visits and vacations in Morocco (the last of which was in 2012), the police never uncovered any suspicious evidence about him. French media and opposition politicians have put Moroccan authorities’ competence into question, considering that the suspect was being monitored, but went unnoticed.  The French Counterterrorism prosecutor, Francois Molins, even stated that Lakdim has been on police’s radicalization watch list since 2014, and was still being monitored by French intelligence in the days up leading to the attack.   However, even the prosecutor maintained that the surveillance could not discern any signs of violent intentions or a desire to join the Islamic state extremist group, which claimed responsibility for the terrorist act.   Khiame has claimed that the counterterrorism agency has furthered its efforts to monitor Moroccans abroad in Europe and cooperate with European countries in identifying persons suspected of extremist religious beliefs. However, the French authorities evidently did same not exhibit the same degree of collaboration toward its Moroccan counterterrorism partnership. Lakdim’s 18 year-old partner, identified as Marine P., and one of his underage friends, have been held in police custody in order to “determine the origins of the gun the terrorist used, and the circumstances under which he [Lakdim] obtained the weapon, as well as eventual complicities.”  On Tuesday, Marine P., who denied involvement in Lakdim’s plans, was preliminarily charged with associating with a criminal terrorist, while the perpetrator’s 17-year-old male friend was released due to a lack of evidence for the conviction.

Rabat- Customs clearance of imported cars is bringing huge capital benefits to the Moroccan state. In 2017, automotive imports brought more than MAD 5.2 billion in revenue. According to le360, the Administration of Customs and Indirect Taxes recently released data stating that more than 13,321 used cars have been imported and given customs clearance in 2017, recording a 10 percent decrease compared to the previous year. Twelve thousand of these used cars are over three years old and 183 do not exceed one year since their production. The funds collected in 2017 from customs clearance amount to MAD 588.4 million, a decrease of 13 percent, compared to 2016.

Rabat – In the presence of Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas expressed his country’s gratitude over King Mohammed VI’s support for the Palestinian cause. In a meeting held at the headquarters of the Palestinian president with Bourita, Abbas underscored the support and solidarity of the King, the Moroccan people, and government to the Palestinian cause and population.  Abbas also declared Morocco’s support to the occupied city of Jerusalem, demonstrated through ongoing Moroccan leadership of Al-Quds Committee, headed by King Mohammed VI. The Palestinian official reaffirmed that Bourita’s visit confirms the deep bonds of fraternity between the Moroccan and Arab people, in addition to the two countries’ commitment to reinforce and further develop bilateral ties. During the meeting, Abbas underscored the latest developments in the Palestinian territories, including the deadlocked political process as a result of Donald Trump’s recent decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem. The Palestinian leader also emphasized the importance of Arab support for the Palestinian stance, which remains committed to its people’s rights and rejects the policy of fait accompli, intimidation, and attempts to wipe out the cause. Abbas also recalled, in this regard, that the Palestinian question is the cause of all Arab nations and all free people around the world. During the meeting, Abbas stressed the need of holding an international peace conference intended to reach international mechanisms to resolve the Palestinian question in accordance with the resolutions of international legality, reported Maghreb Arab Press. This conference, according to Abbas, also aims at allowing the building of an independent Palestinian state with Al Quds East as its capital on the basis of the 1967 borders. The Moroccan official, who arrived in Palestine yesterday, stressed the importance of visiting Palestine to reaffirm Morocco’s firm position and its support and solidarity with the Palestinian leadership and people. Bourita noted that the Palestinian cause and Jerusalem are part of the constants in national foreign policy. Palestinian Deputy Prime Minister Ziad Abu Amro and Foreign Minister Riad Malki also attended the meeting. On Tuesday, Bourita toured Jerusalem, where he performed Salat Duhr (afternoon prayer) at Al-Aqsa mosque. The minister’s visit is part of a working visit to Palestine at the invitation of the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas.

Rabat- Morocco is not planning to sell its remaining 30 percent stake in Maroc Telecom, Morocco’s largest telecom operator, Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Boussaid announced on Tuesday, on the sidelines of the UK-Morocco Trade and Investment Forum in London, reports Reuters.  “The government has a 30 percent stake left…This is not now on the table for selling,” Boussaid said.   Maroc Telecom is Morocco’s main telecommunications company, with just over 18 million subscribers. The remaining stakes of Maroc Telecom are controlled by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) telecoms firm Etisalat, following the acquisition of the Paris-headquartered media company Vivendi’s 53 percent stake in the Moroccan telecom firm.  The Moroccan-British Trade and Investment Forum kicked off in London on Tuesday, March 27, marked by the participation of ministers and notable business people from both countries.  The Moroccan Embassy in London has teamed up with the British Developing Markets Associates (DMA) in order to introduce British investors to the opportunities that Morocco has to offer in several sectors, such as renewable energies, tourism, petroleum exploration, finance, phosphates, education, and vocational training.  This meeting explores Morocco as an economic gateway for the African market, due to its economic assets, geostrategic position, proximity to Europe, the strong presence of its private sector in Africa, and its political and economic stability.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat- Between Sufi spirituality and literature, these confreries reflect glimpses into Morocco, from the practical to the obscure. Gutenberg’s Companions in Morocco The Moroccan franchise of the Brotherhood of the Gutenberg Companions represents a non-spiritual organization that brings together writing enthusiasts who believe in the power of words in spreading the values of coexistence and peace. Since its creation in 2010, the Moroccan section of the Gutenberg Companion has performed several actions to realize  its mission, such as creating school libraries to encourage extracurricular reading among the youth. This fellowship includes renowned Moroccan personalities, such as André Azoulay, Senior Adviser to Mohammed VI; Abderrahmane El Youssoufi, politician and former prime minister; Fathia Bennis, CEO of the Central Security Depository of Securities Marocclear; and Neila Tazi, Vice-President of the House of Councilors and member of the Education, Cultural and Social Affairs Committee. Named after the father of the printing press Johannes Gutenberg, this coalition was founded in Paris in 1979 by twenty-one writers and prints devotees, from the worlds of media, literature, journalism, and graphic art. The brotherhood’s origins are strictly rooted in France, as it initially aimed to preserve and promote all forms of French culture. However, chapter locations have developed around the world over time, namely in Germany, Poland, Italy, Brazil, and more recently, in Switzerland and Morocco. These new chapters shifted the companions’  oath to center language and literature, rather than solely French, at the heart of the association. 
Sufi Orders Sufism represents mysticism within the Islamic faith, often displayed through its adherents’ constant striving towards full awareness of God’s presence in all aspects of their lives, favoring contemplation over action,and spiritual enlightenment over social interactions. The following are three of the most notable Sufi orders in Morocco. The Boutchichiya This Sufi way derives its teachings from Sheikh Moulay Abd Al Qadir Al Jilani, one of the most notable Sunni Hanbali preachers and theologians of 12th century Baghdad. While the founder’s shrine resides in Baghdad, his message carries on as the most established Sufi order in Morocco through “holders of the secret” who claim ascendance from Prophet Mohammed. The movement is currently lead by Sidi Jamal Al-Qadiri Al-Boutchichi, who rose to leadership following the death of the renowned spiritual master since 1972,   Sidi Hamza, who passed away at the age of 95 in January 2017. Every year, thousands of pilgrims come from across the world to Madagh village, the headquarters of the principal zaouia, in Berkane province, to celebrate the Prophet Mohammed’s birthday known as Al Mawlid, and discern the divine knowledge from the Sufi leader. The Hamadcha The Hamadcha is among the most crucial Sufi brotherhoods in Morocco, known for their bewitching dances and music that entangles its practitioners in a healing trance. This spiritual coalition is also renowned for its music that relies on traditional instruments, such as the harraz, taarija, tbal, ghaita and layra, with a repertoire inspired from Gnawa and Aissawa Music. This Sufi brotherhood was founded at the end of the 17th century by Sidi Ali Ben Hamdouch, and currently has followers in Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco. In addition to their famous yearly gathering in the region of Meknes, the Zaouia El Hamdouchia in Essaouira, has also become a place of worship in partnership with the Association of Hamdouchi Soufisme of Essaouira. The zaouia witnesses the gathering of practitioners of this spiritual practice from all over Morocco. During this moussem, or traditional festival, the Hamadcha lures the audience into collective rituals, including invocations of God, the Prophet Mohammed, and sung religious poems. The Tariqa Karkariya Born in the 90s at the hands of Sheikh Mohammed Fawzi Al Karkari in northern Morocco, this order claims Sufism to be the highest station of Islam, which consists of a journey towards the divine knowledge. The Karkariya proclaim a living way to God’s knowledge that is based on visions rather than receiving blessings. “Our tariqa is the tariqa of visions. People who do not see are not my disciples and I am not their Sheikh,” asserts Al Karkari. One of the key elements of this order is Sheikh Al Karkari, who claims to be a descendant of Prophet Muhammed and “holder of an innumerable secrets” and the “Seal of the saints.” Karkari followers are mostly known for their dress: a colorful patchwork representing the universal love of all God’s creatures, which signifies that the Arifin bi’Lah (knowers of God) have been blinded from others’ judgment through the light of God. “The Tariqa Karkariya is the way to love. The eternal and universal love, not the selfish and possessive love. The unlimited love,” the order explains.

Rabat – Mauritanian authorities expelled Seif Kousmate, a  Moroccan-French photojournalist, after detaining him for more than three days for conducting research on slavery in the country.  The Paris-based NGO,  Reporters Without Borders (RSF), noted that the authorities made the arrest on March 20, at the border with Senegal, “from where he had planned to take a flight back to Morocco.” The reporter was placed in police headquarters in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania. The authorities seized the journalist’s laptop and mobile phone and arbitrarily “detained him for three days in Nouakchott, interrogating him, inter alia about his links with Biram Dah Abeid, a former presidential candidate and leader of the anti-slavery movement, who he interviewed in the course of his reporting,” added the NGO. The journalist was deported from Mauritania after “starting a hunger strike” on March 24, and arrived in Morocco’s Casablanca on the same date. The NGO contacted the journalist, who he said “he was initially suspected of terrorism.” The Mauritanian authorities returned  the journalist’s phone and laptop, but would not release “several memory cards containing photos he had taken.” The journalist, however, told RSF that he still have several photos to complete his research report. In September 2017, Mauritania prevented twelve anti-slavery activists from entering Mauritania. The activists work with the Chicago-based Abolition Institute, an organization campaigning against alleged slavery in Mauritania. RSF wrote that a French freelance journalist, Tiphaine, was ordered to leave Mauritania or face detention for investigating slavery in the country in April 2017.

Rabat – Following the release of a sexual assault video on Tuesday that caused a public uproar on social media, Moroccan security forces arrested a 21-year old suspect on Wednesday in Benguerir–a city located in the Rehamna province in central Morocco. The suspect was allegedly involved in violently assaulting a young girl. The incident occured back in January, and the identity of the victim has now been identified. Yesterday, Morocco’s General Directorate for National Security opened an investigation, seeking to identify the suspect involved in the assault. In a statement, the DGSN urged all law enforcement to identify the identity of perpetrator who violently attempted to undress the victim, while  touching her inappropriately. The girl is heard begging and crying for help in the video, while a second aggressor stands laughing while filming the scene. Public Uproar The 55-second video has stirred backlash and concern among Moroccan citizens on social media. A hashtag is now being used to decry the incident. The hashtag “#Wash_Maandakch_Khtek” (translation: “Don’t you have a sister?”) echoes the young woman’s pleas, heard in the video as she tries stop her abuser. As awareness of the incident spreads, a Twitter user urged authorities to come up with a solution to end similar occurrences in Morocco: “We need a solution…six months in prison is not enough.” Others urged the government to apply the death penalty in rape cases. I’m so done with my country ??#???_???????_??? — Asmaa Ait lahcen (@SimaVu) March 27, 2018  As awareness of the incident spread, a twitter user urged authorities to come up with a solution to help end similar occurrences in Morocco. “We need a solution…six months in the prison is not enough.” #???_???????_???#???_???????_????
????? ????.. ??? ???? ??? ????? ????? ??? ??????. — ??? ????? ?????? (@aabdpres) March 27, 2018  “Please don’t you tell me that you are against death penalty anymore,” wrote another. Ne dites plus s’il vous plait que vous êtes contre la peine de mort 🙂 #???_???????_??? — Rim Kaanane (@RimKaanane) March 27, 2018  The investigation of the incident falls just one month after Morocco’s new law against harassment and gender-based violence was enacted on February 14. Bouchra Abdou,  an activist, feminist, and director of Tahadi Center,  told Morocco World News that the new law is not “really enough.” She added that there should be a better security approach for dealing with assaults  in public spaces, adding that “authorities need to push up their sleeves and do something concrete about assault incidents and their perpetrators.”  Abdou added that the Ministry of Education also needs to offer students awareness campaigns to educate them about the dangers of assault and harassment. In November, The Tahadi Association launched a campaign on both social media and in public spaces platforms to prevent sexual harassment on public transportation in Casablanca. The campaign was a response to a previous assault on a public Casablanca bus last August. Seven months ago, graphic footage was released of a group of teenagers violently assaulting a mentally ill-girl on a bus in Casablanca. The incident resulted in public protests in Morocco’s major cities, including Rabat and Casablanca, to denounce the lack of public safety.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – The Moroccan-British Trade and Investment Forum kicked off in London on Tuesday, with the participation of ministers and notable business people from both countries. The Moroccan Embassy in London has teamed up with the British Developing Markets Associates (DMA) in order to introduce British investors to the opportunities that Morocco has to offer in several sectors, such as renewable energies, tourism, petroleum exploration, finance, phosphates, education, and vocational training. This meeting explores Morocco as an economic gateway for the African market, due to its economic assets, geostrategic position, proximity to Europe, the strong presence of its private sector in Africa, and its political and economic stability. Another key objective of this forum is to encourage participants to strengthen trade and economic partnership between the two countries following the UK departure from the European Union. Trade between the UK and Morocco increased by 36.4 percent in 2016, with a UKP 2.6 billion reach. Although it is a significant step forward, analysts and economic operators of both countries maintain that it falls short from the countries’ economic potential. The UK Department of International Trade perceives the Moroccan economy as “an open and liberal economy” that benefits from the confidence of international investors, and continues to attract significant foreign investment. Currently, over 200 Moroccan companies export their products to Great Britain, and nearly a hundred British companies are present in Morocco, such as GlaxoSmithKline, Shell, British Airways, and Unilever. Morocco’s imports from the United Kingdom consist mainly of petroleum products, lubricants, passenger cars, airplanes, electric motors, medicines, machinery, chemicals, woolen fabrics, synthetic fibers, wheat, tobacco, and perfumes. Meanwhile, the North African country’s exports include clothing, knitwear, wires and cables for electricity, electronic components, natural and chemical fertilizers, citrus fruit, canned fish, fresh tomatoes, canned vegetables, fresh and frozen fruits, flowers, acid, and fish. When it comes to tourism, activities continue to expand. In fact, more than 600,00 British tourists visited Morocco in 2017, paving the way for Morocco to hit 1 million tourist by 2020. The Moroccan delegation to the forum, led by Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Boussaid, includes Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Mounia Boucetta, Secretary of State for Investment Othman El Ferdaous, and General Director of the Moroccan of the Moroccan Office for Hydrocarbons and Mining Amina Benkhadra. The Moroccan delegation also included representatives of the Moroccan Employers’ Association (CGEM) and the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN).

Rabat – Morocco’s Royal Navy has been taking part in US-sponsored naval exercises in the Gulf of Guinea since March 21. Initiated by the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM), a project to strengthen US military relationships with its African partners, this year’s edition is taking place in Cameroon at the country’s naval base in Douala. The exercises have brought together 31 states and are set to end on March 29. Most of the participants coming from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). As such,  the North African country’s Royal Navy is reported to have seized the opportunity to showcase the strategic assets Morocco offers in its ECOWAS bid to build an effective and responsive regional force. This strategy also aims at facing  the mounting security threats in the region, especially the G5 Sahel coalition. According to American military authorities, the Obangame/Saharan Express—the official name of AFRICOM’s naval exercises in the Gulf of Guinea—aims to boost collective responses to a wide range of security threats in the region, including the fight against piracy, intelligence and expertise sharing, and the fight against human trafficking and drug smuggling. Together with 31 other national navies, Morocco’s Royal Marines exercised in “building defense capabilities, responding to crises, deterring and defeating transnational threats… in order to promote regional security and stability,” AFRICOM said in a statement about its naval exercises and operations in the Gulf of Guinea. It is worth noting that many analysts deem the North African country an indispensable partner and an important player in the US’s counter-terrorism activities in Africa and the Arab world. Last week, in a move to boost US-Morocco cooperation on national defense and navy-related concerns, a US-navy delegation paid a working visit to Rabat and Tangier.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat- The alleged mastermind behind EUR 1 billion robbery from a hundred banks in forty countries, was arrested in Spain, stated Europol on March 26. Lead by its Ukrainian mastermind identified as Denis K, the cyber burglary network used malware, known as Carbank and Cobalt, which allowed the hackers to control ATMs and divert money to their own accounts before laundering it through cryptocurrencies. “The mastermind of a group of hackers took control of the banking identity system, which allowed them to empty ATM machines or switch accounts resulting in transfers of great importance,”declared a statement from the Spanish Ministry of the Interior. According to the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), the pirates were able to remotely control ATMs, which they programmed to distribute money at a specific time, while accomplices waited next to the machines. The criminal network targeted ATMs in the centre of Madrid in early 2017, making an extraction worth EUR 500 million, reported the Spanish Ministry of Interior. Though the attacks spanned forty countries, the majority of the cyber burglaries targeted the Russian banking industry, conducted in partnership with the Russian mafia. Using sophisticated malware, the cyberthieves would email bank employees with malicious attachments, pretending to be legitimate businesses. Once downloaded, the malware allowed the criminal organization to control infected computers and  access the internal banking network and the servers controlling ATM machines. After completing each operation, which yielded over USD 1.5 million on average, profits were immediately converted into virtual currency, allowing them to buy goods, including luxury cars and houses. The investigation has been led by the Spanish police, in cooperation with Europol, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Belarusian, Taiwanese, Moldovan, and Romanian authorities, in addition to private cyber security companies. “This is the first time that the European Banking Federation (EBF) has actively cooperated with Europol on a specific case,” declared Wim Mijs, the EBF chief executive, as quoted in Europol’s statement. “The public-public cooperation is actively working to fight cross-border digital crime,” he added. Morocco has recently become part of a EUR 3.35 million European Union project, which aims to toughen legislations on cybercrime in Algeria, Tunisia, Jordan, Lebanon, and Morocco.

Rabat – Taking on Uzbekistan’s national squad in their second pre-World Cup warm-up, the Atlas Lions imposed their tactical superiority and gracefulness, culminating in a beautiful and well-deserved victory. Morocco started the game with high intensity and an admirable winning mentality. From the very minutes, they pressed high and attacked eloquently. There was pace, determination, and resolution in the Atlas Lions’ tireless crosses and wide passes in the very first minutes of Tuesday’s clash. And so, quite unsurprisingly, the first goal came unbelievably early, at the third minute. Morocco wins possession after pressing high. Amine Harit receives a pass of godly inspiration outside the Uzbek penalty area; he controls beautifully, eliminates three Uzbek players in an angelic flash of inspiration, and fires a bamboozling low strike that is denied by the Uzbek goalkeeper. And before the keeper can come back from his colossal efforts in phenomenally saving the Chalk O4’s man shoot, Yacine Bammou, who happens to be in the right place at the right time, crosses the ball inside the box; the low cross finds EL Kaabi right in front of the goal. And what did the CHAN man do?  What he always does, what has made him the rising star of Morocco’s Renaissance. Kaabi hammered the ball home, scoring a typical central striker goal that enraptured the thousands of fans at the Mohammed V stadium in Casablanca. EL Kaabi’s goal gave Morocco the lead, boosted their confidence, and granted Hervé Renard’s boys the necessary energy to keep the momentum that they paraded in the first half hour of the match. The game continued its course as Morocco imposed its supremacy in all the departments on the pitch. In the middle, despite some minimal errors—which is normal in a football game—Morocco’s flow was almost irreproachable in the first half. For twenty minutes during the first thirty, Renard’s boys passing was a Greek mythology-like showpiece, an eye-catching exhibition of the ultimate artistic proportions, the epitome of tactical depth, collective harmony; it all seemed unmentionably euphoric: they’d learned their lesson after their unimpressive—by their own current standards—win against Serbia last week. Their improvement was unmistakable all throughout Tuesday’s match. From the Atlas Lions’ downpour of crosses to their beautiful ball circulation, Uzbeks watched, clueless and helpless, their opponents overwhelm them. The only true danger for the visitors came at the 32nd minute, when the midfield put a quite elegant long pass in Morocco’s penalty area. But Morocco’s goalkeeper, Munir, was quick to deny the chance. Ten minutes later, at the 42nd minute, after completely dominating the game, Morocco doubled the score line on a spotless corner accompanied by an equally immaculate Marouane da Costa header. 2-0 before before the break, and Moroccan fans could chant their joy; they could dream of, fantasize about,  a beautiful summer in Russia! The second half, for all its intensity and its glimmer of glamorous footballing masterpieces—Morocco could have easily scored a third and fourth goals—went goalless: it lacked the vibrancy and determination that characterized the first half. Uzbeks kept trying to make something happen, they pressed high; at times, they even had moments of picturesque ball possession, crowding the midfield and overpowering Morocco’s left and right backs. But their passes and crosses were laughably ineffective in front of the impermeable defensive citadel that Morocco displayed on Tuesday. Munir (the keeper) barely intervened in the game. But while Hervé Renard’s boys did the job, what was required of them, the victory against Uzbekistan should not be the tree that conceals the forest: clear and ‘unmissable’ opportunities were missed, and you can’t afford wasting your opportunities in a deadly Group B this summer. The Atlas Lions were the better side against Uzbekistan, which justifies their well-deserved and laudable 2-0 against a team that shocked Senegal with a 2-2 draw last week. But, as Hervé Renard said ahead of Tuesday’s clash, they can—and have to—do better. Prior to Morocco’s Tuesday match, Senegal’s legend El Hadj Diouf told the press that Morocco will, like Senegal at the FIFA 2002 World Cup, make Africa proud. Like his side in 2002, Diouf argued, Morocco can astound football fans, shock global footballing behemoths, “and make Africa proud.” “They will write history,” the Senegalese said, adding: “If the Moroccan players take confidence and tell themselves that they can write the history of African football [in Russia], they can do it…They’re a technical team, tactical, and they have a manager who they listen to… Frankly, I take my hat off for this team, they never give anything up.” After the towering footballing masterwork that Renard and his squad gifted our eyes with against Uzbekistan (let’s be a bit indulgent about some negligible mistakes), I feel, for my part, more inclined to agree with Diouf: This outsider can be astounding this summer.

Rabat – Good news for small investors and businesses in need of funding: Morocco has finally drafted a bill to regulate collaborative financing, colloquially known as crowdfunding, in an unprecedented move in the African region.  Crowdfunding has emerged as an alternative form of financing projects, startups, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), especially in their early-stages. It is generally carried out via online platforms that connect those who can give, lend, or invest money directly with those who need financing for a specific project, rather than seeking means of traditional bank financing. The long-awaited legal framework to regulate this financing method, was submitted by the Ministry of Economy and Finance on March 21, and published soon after on the official website of the Government’s General Secretariat.  The draft bill, which was signed by Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Boussaid, sets the necessary regulations to give investors and small businesses in need of funding, particularly start-ups and SMEs, access to this innovative form of finance, for the first time in Morocco.  According to a statement, the draft law, dubbed 15-16, aims at “strengthening the financial inclusion of project leaders, supporting economic and social development, and canalizing collective savings toward new opportunities.”  The draft law broadly defines the conditions under which the relevant companies can operate, as well as the various modes of financing authorized in this context. It underlines the provisions applicable to managers of crowdfunding companies and the procedures for obtaining approvals to operate in this sector, as well as the modes of fundraising authorized for such entities. The prospective law will also enable investors on crowdfunding platforms under a better protection regime with a higher level of guarantees, which is based on clear rules on the diligence of projects to be financed, securing transfers and protecting contributors. The implementation of the draft law will eventually replace the law 004.71, which has long forbid appeals to public generosity in Morocco, with quid pro quo donations only permitted to registered foundations.

Rabat – A spine-chilling video of two Moroccan men sexually assaulting a young girl in the street circulated on Facebook on Tuesday, March 27. One of the aggressors recorded the video, while the other tried to remove the young girl’s clothes and inappropriately touched her, as she kicked at him from the ground.  Throughout the video, the girl is heard begging them to stop: “Do not you have a sister!” she screams.  Viewers hear only the perpetrators’ laughter in response. This video comes just seven months after the release of a similar filmed sexual assault, in which a group of boys publicly violated a mentally-ill girl on a public bus in Casablanca.  Public protests erupted in major cities throughout the country in the weeks that followed the August incident, demanding an end to rape culture and the protection of women’s rights to public space and safety. The incident also comes just one month after Morocco’s new law against harassment and gender-based violence became law on February 14.  As protests for women’s equal rights in inheritance law echo across the country, this latest incident demonstrates that paper decisions for gender equality remain worthless without the backing of real infrastructural change. However, this comprehensive implementation will only come with a deeper cultural shift to prioritize the fundamental respect of humanity–for women and for all people. Morocco World News chose to not share the video due to its graphic content.

Rabat – Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita performed Salat Duhr (afternoon prayer) at Jerusalem’s  Al-Aqsa mosque, on Tuesday. The minister’s visit is part of a working visit to Palestine at the invitation of the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas. Bourita said in a press statement reported by Reuters that “the prayer at the Al-Aqsa Mosque is a strong message of support for the Palestinian cause,” adding that his visit “comes under the high instructions from King Mohammed VI.” Al-Aqsa is the third holiest site in Islam, located in the old city of Jerusalem. ??????? ???? ?????? #?????? ???? ?????? ?? #??????_?????? ???????#????? pic.twitter.com/fsR4oMHuVO — omar rabie (@o_rabie) March 27, 2018  Nasser Bourita was accompanied during his prayer by the Palestinian Ambassador to Rabat Jamal Choubki, the Palestinian minister of Jerusalem affairs, Adnane El Houssaini, and Sheikh Omar El Kassaouani, director of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Bourita is the second Arab foreign minister to visit the site in the recent months. In February, Omani Foreign Minister Yusuf Bin Alawi also visited the holy site. During his visit to Palestine, Bourita will hold meetings with President Abbas and other members of the Palestinian cabinet for talks on a wide range of topics, including the Palestinian statehood. #????? ???? ?????? ???????? ??????? ???? ?????? ???? ???? ?? ?????? ?????? pic.twitter.com/qj7Cy5YWTk — ????? ????

Trump’s decision was uniformly condemned by regional Arab and Western countries alike. World leaders, including King Mohammed VI, denounced the US decision, considering it a significant threat to further peace negotiations between Palestine and Israel.

Rabat- Ahead of the Atlas Lions’ clash with Uzbekistan’s national squad and following Hervé’s boys’ somewhat impressive win against Serbia, Morocco’s French head coach believes that his side still needs to improve its flow and rhythm in many departments. To counter the quick passes and counterattacks of world-class opponents, the Atlas Lions need more focus and a better ball possession, Hervé Renard said yesterday in an interview with Spanish outlet EFE. Though he is convinced  that the Moroccan national squad has the technical depth and the required individual talents to take on football’s heavyweights like Spain, the meticulous French coach believes that his team “needs to improve its ball possession, as well as its ball recuperation techniques in order to compete with other teams” at this summer’s World Cup in Russia. If you are to confront and thwart the sea of counterattacks and crosses associated with European squads, you need to “make the best of your opportunities,” which includes maintaining a good possession, Renard argued in his interview. The “white wizard,” as he is often called, went on to say that “European teams are faster;” and as such, countering them requires “that you not lose your balls”: Keeping the ball is key, Renard explained. Renard’s comments reflect what we wrote last week in the aftermath of the Atlas Lions’ victory against Serbia: “Against the likes of Spain and Portugal, where the ball quickly flows from the midfield to the sides, like a tide of an irresistible tsunami, you need an almost impenetrable defensive fortress… And so, to stop the lethal Cristiano headers, or the incessant Alba crosses, or the seamless and elegant Isco-Iniesta midfield, you need more inspiration and urgency than what the Atlas Lions displayed yesterday. Morocco shined in Turin, but it can do better; it has to do better.” Considering what he told EFE in yesterday’s interview, Renard seems to understand, three months before the Russian World Cup, that his boys are in dire need of change and adaptability, which is a good sign: you need a winner’s mentality to take on Spain and Portugal.

Rabat – The US Congress has reportedly thwarted a pro-Polisario request hostile to Morocco’s stance on the Western Sahara conflict ahead of its vote on the 2018 Appropriations Bill last Thursday, March 23. According to Moroccan newspaper Assabah, two US congressmen attempted to introduce a request for additional consultation with the State Department and the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) prior to the vote. However, the US Congress moved forward and voted the 2018 Appropriations Bill into law, granting Morocco the right to use the aid everywhere in the country, including Western Sahara on Thursday. Trump’s administration and its congressional allies are more concerned with the state of the US economy than “marginal wars,”  according to Assabah. Quoting Driss Legrini, professor of law and international relations, Assabah added that this is a firm and unequivocal response from the US Congress to the enemies of Morocco, referring to Polisario and its mentor Algeria. This decision followed a similar action in 2017, when the Congress allowed Morocco to use US aid in the service of Western Sahara, and thus tacitly recognizing Moroccan sovereignty through its inclusion of the territory. The amount of aid available to assist the region, where the conflict has been ongoing for more than 40 years, remain unidentified. Legrini added that the US seeks to focus on their strategic relations with Morocco, rather than “fulfilling the wishes of lobbies engaged by the Algerian intelligence services.” The Congress also stressed the need for more control over the aid sent to the Tindouf camps in Algeria, where an unidentified number of refugees currently live. This decision is likely tied to reports of corruption and embezzlement by the  Polisario members in the camps. The separatist group has been involved in embezzlement of international humanitarian aid intended for the region, including the UN aid. Polisario’s activities were harshly denounced by the UN General Assembly’s Third Committee in 2017. One member of Morocco’s permanent mission to the UN in New York,  Omar Kadiri, blamed Algeria for avoiding its responsibility for the Sahrawi population held in the Tindouf camps. The Moroccan diplomat condemned the humanitarian aid embezzlement by Polisario in the Tindouf camps. Kadiri’s statements were echoed earlier this month, when Morocco’s Head of Affairs in Geneva Hassan Boukili condemned the living situation of of the Sahrawi population in the Tindouf Camps, accusing Algeria of shirking its international responsibility towards the population. Speaking at the 71st session of the Standing Committee of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Boukili emphasized that Morocco’s eastern neighbor is, “the only country to oppose the implementation of all the feasible  solutions for the populations in the Tindouf camps.” Boukili added that Algeria, “has chosen to suffer an alleged situation of Sahrawi refugees of its own creation.” He notes that the country is the only nation to refuse to conduct a headcount of the populations in the Tindouf camps.

Rabat – After posting a photo on his Facebook with King Mohammed VI, Israel Goldberg has returned in a live video to narrate his discussion with the Monarch. The Rabbi starts his live video saying, “Long live the king!”. Then he proceeds to debrief viewers about their discussion.  “I had the honor this afternoon to transmit the seven universal principles–the seven laws of Noah–to the King of Morocco who had symbolically come to buy a pair of glasses at Jonathan, at 17 rue des Rosiers, the building where is located the Lubavitch synagogue which is at the same time the oldest of Paris.”  The seven laws of Noah: do not worship idols, do not curse God, establish courts of justice, do not commit murder, do not commit adultery or sexual immorality, do not steal, and do not eat flesh torn from a living animal. Goldberg also mentioned the Rabbi Lubavitch’s message advising that every school, every single house, including the royal palace, ought to have a sadaka (charity) box.  Then he replied gently, “you also know the sadaka.” Adding that “every human being must take a minute of silence to reflect, each with his own ideas, to become a better being.”

Rabat – The Ministry of National Education announced on Monday that the Academy of Dakhla-Oued Eddahab is adopting a special timetable for primary, secondary, and high schools in the region. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reports that the ministry released a statement attributing the decision to the geographical specificity of the region, where the difference between sunrise and sunset times is 45 minutes. The ministry added that the daylight savings time adopted in Morocco on March 25, will be applied in all central, regional, and provincial administrative services, as well as in all schools under the ministry. In 2017, a group of activists launched a petition, calling on Prime Minister, Saad Eddine El Othmani and the Parliamentary Council to abolish the biannual time change and maintain with Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) . The signatories want the government to issue a law that would suspend the bill implementing DST indefinitely, sticking to the GMT timing “appropriate with the country’s geographical location throughout the year.” The measures also raised a debate in Europe recently, as several member countries urged the EU to consider abolishing daylight savings. The energy-saving practice is under review by the European Parliament, which backed a possible plan to end daylight savings time across the 28 member states after 384 deputies out of 549 voted in favor of the resolution. Daylight savings time was first adopted during the First World War in the UK to give factories more daylight hours to operate in, thereby aiding the war.

Rabat- The Chinese spacecraft, Tiangong-1, has been out of service since September 2016, and is predicted to crash-land in the upcoming days. Experts warn that it could potentially hit few countries–including Morocco.  Tiangong-1, which launched in 2011, was declared “out of control” by the China National Space Administration in 2016. Most of the satellite is expected to burn up as it breaks through Earth’s atmosphere–however some chunks of debris may still hit the ground and spill the highly toxic chemical hydrazine.  “There is a chance that a small amount of Tiangong-1 debris may survive reentry. Should this happen, any surviving debris would fall within an area of few hundred kilometers and would be centered along a trajectory,” according to the U.S.-based Aerospace Corporation, which is retracing the doomed craft’s descent.  According to an analysis by Aerospace, the satellite will re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere within the first week of April. Experts predict that the reentry will take place on April 3 at 8:37 a.m. (GMT +1) somewhere between latitudes of 43° North and 43° South. However, the satellite’s exact position and projected trajectory remain unknown. Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell told the The Guardian, “You really can’t steer these things. Even a couple of days before it [the satellite] re-enters, we probably won’t know more than approximately six or seven hours in advance when it’s going to come down.”  Multiple news sources have reported that Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, France, Spain, and Portugal are among the regions where some debris might be anticipated.  According to the European Space Agency, the risk of damage or injury is “significantly small” as the probability of being hit by a debris from the satellite is about 10 million times lower than the annual probability of being struck by lightning.

Rabat – While most of the national squads qualified for the Russian World Cup have recently revealed their home and away kits, or jerseys, for this summer’s tournament, Morocco’s kits have yet to be revealed to the numerous Atlas Lions’ fans anxiously waiting to discover the look and texture of the squad’s Russia 2018 kits. Last week, some national outlets even reported on the fans’ frustration and disappointment due to this “unwarranted” delay. Some Moroccan fans on social media, taken with Portugal’s kits and quite outraged about Morocco’s delay, went as far as putting the logo of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation on Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal jersey, suggesting that “this could be Morocco’s kit for this summer tournament.” And so, amidst the flurry of speculations and popular irritation at the delay, Adidas, the company in charge of producing and marketing the Atlas Lions’ kits for Russia 2018, recently released the reason for this hold over: counterfeit duplication. According to Al Maasae in its March 27 edition, Moroccan footballing authorities and Adidas’s executive committee agreed to delay the official uncovering of the Atlas Lions’ World Cup kits to avoid forgery. They are waiting for the appropriate moment to uncover the kits, Al Massae reported, citing Adidas’ concerns about “counterfeit duplication of the kits,” if uncovered several months before the opening of the Russia FIFA 2018 tournament. Al Massae also explained that, although counterfeit production is a common occurrence in Morocco, with a host of forged kits already filling Moroccan shops and passing for the Atlas Lions’ FIFA 2018 official kits, none of the producers has been successful in predicting what the team’s real kits will actually look like. According to Al Massae, Casablanca is full of forgery factories that have caused financial losses for Moroccan clubs like Wydad. “But,” Moroccan fans may be asking, “When will they launch it? What exactly do they mean by “appropriate moment?” To that, All Massae and Adidas gave no further details, no clues. So Moroccan fans can admire or dislike the official kits of other national squads while nervously waiting for that of the Atlas Lions.

Rabat – Morocco’s World Cup bid book, which FIFA made available on Monday, promoted the nation’s stability and security, noting the limited gun circulation in the country. The world football governing body, FIFA, published the bid books of the 2026 World Cup bidders with their respective executive summaries.  “Exceptionally low murder rates (3/100,000), benefitting from very low gun circulation, are reflected in a United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime study, ranking Morocco among the best-performing nations in the world – at the same level as both Denmark and Japan,” reads the 20th section of Morocco’s bid summary. Morocco’s argument on gun safety comes amid the growing number of high-profile mass public shootings in the US. Since the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, massive rallies have brought protesters to the streets and government offices in US states to condemn the the high death toll due to gun violence and protest against the availability of military-grade weapons and bump stocks, in addition to the absence of a universal background check requirement in the majority of states.  The low gun circulation in Morocco might help the country to convince FIFA and voters across the world to back the Moroccan bid to host the massive tournament, as the North African country emphasized that Morocco is the safest place to host the competition. Morocco’s executive summary also underlines the importance of football in country, describing Morocco  as a land, where the game’s passion “runs through every vein.” Introducing Morocco to the world, the summary describes Morocco as a “land of peace and stability.” The file also underscored the nation’s “extraordinary diversity and tolerance, open to the world and ready to welcome the world in all its colours.” The bid showcases Morocco’s key assets, including its ideal proximity to Europe and Africa. Morocco officially submitted its bid book to FIFA on March 15. The application has received the support of many countries from different corners of the world, including Russia, Serbia, Luxembourg, Botswana, Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, and France. The country is hoping for more support, and hopes to collect more votes and promises of support in the coming weeks to win the bid to host the world’s premier football competition.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – French President Emmanuel Macron announced his intention to invest hundreds of millions of euros into promoting and exporting the French language worldwide. Addressing the vaulted Académie Française on International Francophonie Day, March 20, Macron declared French a “language of freedom,” adding that the government will sponsor additional French programs to sustain and further disseminate its education abroad. This is in contrast to the opinion of the French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, who recently told the nation’s youth that “to master English is to better control one’s future” via Twitter. In the same tweet, Philippe also suggested state funding to defray the costs of English proficiency exams for France’s students. Nonetheless, Macron insists that English-language “domination is not inevitable” within the European Union and across the wider world. “It’s up to us to set some rules, to be present, and make French the language with which one has access to a number of opportunities.” The Macron government’s emissary for Francophone affairs Leïla Slimani was circumspect in her support. The Franco-Moroccan novelist insisted that she “had listened to all voices, even the most critical [ones]” and reiterated her position that there is no “hierarchy” of French speakers or writers. French is the sixth most spoken language in the world and the vast majority of French speakers reside outside of France. Today, official “Francophonie” is a constellation of over 50 countries – from Morocco to Mauritius – where French is a national or significant language. Population experts estimate that, by 2050, 80 percent of French speakers will live in Africa. Macron sought to emphasize that France is a “country among others.” However, many people in France’s former colonies eye the Elysée leader’s new initiative with skepticism. Franco-Congolese writer Alain Mabanckou mounted a robust response to Macron’s mandate, noting that the French language was not historically associated with liberty for people in post-colonial countries. Last month in an open letter, Mabanckou noted that French has been a way for France to maintain undue influence in African affairs. “Unfortunately, la Francophonie is still seen as a continuation of France’s foreign policy in its former colonies.” Macron raised eyebrows last year when visiting Burkina Faso, regaling a room full of students with his ambitious, if not quixotic, pronouncement that French could become the “number-one language in Africa, maybe even the world.” On the same trip, Macron claimed, “I am from a generation that doesn’t come to tell Africans what to do.” However, Mabanckou believes that the French president has not gone far enough in “provi[ng] to these young people that [he is] of another generation.” The Renaudot Prize-winning author explained that reinvigorating Francophonie would entail more than simply maintaining the currency of the French language abroad, and must come hand in hand with efforts to change attitudes in and open up France itself.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat- Morocco has been recognized as a top-tier destination for economic investments on the African continent in 2017, in sectors such as information and communication technology (ICT), energy, infrastructure, and tourism.  Quantum Global Research Lab released a report on Monday, March 26, showing Morocco’s highest investment in 2017: 2.57 billion dollars of foreign direct investment which marked an increase by twelve percent in comparison with 2016, making Morocco the first in Africa’s 2017 Investment Index. The 2017 investment index features “Top 10” and “Bottom 10” African countries. After Morocco, Egypt ranks second, Algeria third, then Botswana, the Ivory Coast, South Africa, Ethiopia, Zambia, Kenya, and Senegal. The “Bottom 10” includes Central Africa, Liberia, Somalia, Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Sao Tome-Principe, and Zimbabwe. The report shows that Morocco’s investment advancement goes back to the country’s strong social capital factors, strategic geographic positioning, increased economic growth, direct foreign investment, and external debt levels. Morocco has been successful in attracting international investors to its borders especially in areas of tourism, energy and industry, as Managing Director of Quantum Global Research Lab Mthuli Ncube said: “In spite of the improvements to oil production and prices, African economies are turning their attention towards diversification to stimulate industrial development, and to attract investments in non-oil strategic sectors. Morocco has been consistent in attracting an inward flow of foreign capital, specifically in banking, tourism and energy sectors and through the development of industry.” Based in Zug-Switzerland, Quantum Global Group is a private entity concerned with investment Management, macroeconomic research, and econometric modelling, providing services to institutional clients in the African continent. Quantum Global mainly targets Africa’s agriculture, healthcare, hotels, Infrastructure, mining, and timber sectors.

Rabat – Member of Russia’s Football Federation Pyutr Barkalov has officially expressed his country’s support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. Barkalov has echoed remarks made by Russia’s Ambassador to Morocco Valery Vorobiev, who said on Saturday that his country believes that Morocco’s bid is “the best” to host the tournament in 2026. The Russian official said that “Morocco has considerable assets that can allow it to challenge the United States, Mexico, and Canada.”  “Given the close relations between our two countries, we will vote for Morocco,” he added. On Saturday, Vorobiev said during a conference on Russia’s preparations to host the upcoming world tournament held by the Russian embassy in Rabat that “objectively, the three candidate countries are weak in football, we all know the American, Mexican, and Canadian football. [It is] not real football.” He added that the 2026 World Cup in Morocco will be beneficial for many countries, including African, Middle Eastern, and European countries as the kingdom is only 14 kilometers away from Europe, “which is good for [football] fans.” The Moroccan bid is gaining more support and confidence; the country has received international support from several countries, including Algeria, Tunisia, Botswana, and Nigeria. President of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Ahmad Ahmad has supported the Moroccan bid since Morocco expressed its desire to host the world premier event.

Rabat- Tens of thousands of protesters flocked to the street, in several parts of Spain including Barcelona and Lerida, following the arrest of former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont in Germany on Sunday.  Puigdemont’s lawyer, Jaume Alonso-Cuevillas, said in a post on Twitter that the exiled official, Puigdemont, had been intending to return by vehicle to Belgium, where he has resided since fleeing Spain last October. He was then detained by the German police based on an international arrest warrant. “President Carles Puigdemont was held in Germany when he crossed the border from Denmark, on his way to Belgium from Finland,” the lawyer said. Local media reported that at least 89 people were injured and several demonstrators were arrested as they clashed with police for the first few hours after the news of Puigdemont’s arrest broke.  Several videos have circulated, showing Spanish police firing shots into the air and speeding vans towards protesters in an attempt to disperse crowds.  Demonstrators, who chanted “This Europe is shameful,” also gathered in front of the European Commission’s Barcelona offices to demand the release of the former President Puigdemont.   The ousted leader has been living in self-imposed exile in Belgium since fleeing Spain after a failed bid by his regional government to declare Catalonia’s independence from the country in late October 2017.  The Spanish government-led declaration to impose direct rule over Catalonia included the Spanish court’s dissolution and dismissal of the Catalonian parliament and called for a new regional election in December.  Puigdemont had fled to Belgium along with other members of his dissolved cabinet after Spain’s attorney-general filed charges of rebellion, sedition, and misuse of public funds against Puigdemont and five of his ministers on October 30.  The arrest came after a Spanish Supreme Court judge, Pablo Llarena, ruled on Friday to reactivate the international arrest warrants against Puigdemont. The judge also ordered five other Catalan officials to be detained without bail.

Russia, however, denied all claims directed against it, with Russian leader Vladimir Putin describing the allegations as “nonsense.” Putin referred to the incident as a “tragedy,” adding that the victims would die instantly if they were poisoned by the Soviet-designed nerve agent. The Russian spy and his daughter remain in critical condition.   On March 4, #Russia attempted to murder a British citizen &amp; his daughter w/ military-grade nerve agent on British soil. We stand in unbreakable solidarity w/ #UK.

Rabat – Moroccan biologist, author, and prominent Islamic feminist Asma Lamrabet has broken her silence to speak about the reasons of her resignation from the Mohammadia League of Scholars  “Rabita Mohammadia of Oulemas.” In a press statement shared with Morocco World News, Lamrabet reaffirmed that her resignation is due to her position on inheritance. The author of “Believer and Feminist,” said “I did not want to express myself, from abroad, where I was participating in an academic seminar, on the reasons that led to my resignation” to avoid “any malicious instrumentalization that would disguise my patriotism, my values, and my deep convictions.” Lamrabet has long been focusing more on women’s issues and gender equality in Islam. Defending her stance and opinion regarding equality in inheritance, Lamrabet wrote: “to those who would like to burden me, I would say that my action, as a volunteer in the Rabita, for almost ten years had no other ambition than to serve my country and to promote this third way, that of a peaceful Islam, contextualized and in tune with universal humanist values compatible with our cultural values.” She added that  she has always advocated a progressive reading, reformist and depoliticized to “operate a new approach to the question of women in Islam.” Lamrabet concluded her statement by addressing a message, where she expressed her gratitude to people who show support and solidarity with her, calling people to support the “legitimate rights of women for a Morocco of justice and equality, more than ever.” Lamrabet announced her resignation from her position as director in the Mohammadia League of Scholars on March 18, due to disagreements over equality of inheritance. Born in 1961, Lamrabet is the founder of a working group for women’s issues and intercultural dialogue, and a major contributor to “Third Way” feminism, a movement that questions religious patriarchy and fights sexism in Islam.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – Morocco will benefit from an EUR 3.35 million project that aims to tighten legislation on cybercrime in the European Union’s “Southern Neighborhood.” This initiative is a joint project between the European Union and the Council on Cooperation Against Cybercrime, financed under the European Neighborhood Instrument that started on July 1, 2017. Following an eight-month inception phase, a launching conference was held in Tunisia on March 21-23, with the participation of several countries, including Morocco and the other priority countries for the project: Algeria, Tunisia, Jordan, and Lebanon. The three-year project aims to tackle the issue of cybercrime through five key areas:    legislation, specialized services, and inter-agency services, including public-private cooperation, judicial training, international cooperation, and strategic prioritization of cybercrime and electronic evidence.  The Budapest Convention of 2001, also known as the Convention on Cybercrime of the Council of Europe, serves as a guideline for the Cybersouth Project and for any country hoping to develop a comprehensive national legislation against cybercrime.  By its 15th anniversary in 2016, 50 states had become party to the convention: several European countries, Australia, Canada, the Dominican Republic, Israel, Japan, Mauritius, Panama, Sri Lanka, and the USA; another 17 counties, including Morocco, became signatories.  According to a 2015 Global Information Society Watch (GISWatch) report, Moroccan Cybercrime Services, working under the General Directorate of National Security, identified 112 cases of cybercrime in 2011, over 26 of which were crimes against personhood, including sexual harassment.  “Despite the increasing number of sexual harassment cases in cyberspace, and Morocco’s avowed commitments at the international level, the government’s legislative agenda does not address sexual harassment in cyberspaces sufficiently. NGOs also tend to concentrate their efforts exclusively on sexual harassment offline,” read the report.

Rabat – The organizers of an event attended by the detained Islamic scholar in 2009  have contradicted his alibi that he was on a plane to the conference at the time when a complainant accused Tariq Ramadan of rape. The president of the Union of Young Muslims, Yassine Djemal,  who organized the conference in September 2009, said in a court hearing that Ramadan arrived in Lyon, France before the time that the defense had allegedly claimed during an investigation, according to French news agency AFP. “Mr. Ramadan was scheduled to arrive in Lyon on October 9, 2009, at 11:15 a.m. A colleague and I picked him up at the airport at around 11:35 a.m.,” said Djemal. In order to defend his client from the plaintiff’s claims, which pinpoint the rape in the afternoon, Ramadan’s first lawyer presented an airline ticket during investigations, implying that the scholar landed in Lyon at about 6:35 p.m. The witness added that they then transported Ramadan to hotel Hilton where the woman claimed to have been raped. Ramadan was arrested on January 31, after two women filed complaints against him last year, accusing him of rape. Ramadan fully denies the accusations and deems them to be part of a “campaign of lies launched by adversaries,” a sentiment shared by his supporters. In March, another French woman of Moroccan origin filed an additional rape accusation at the Paris prosecutor’s office against the detained scholar. The 40-year old complainant accused the Islamologist of nine accounts of rape over the span of a year and a half, from February 2013 to June 2014 in Paris, Roissy, Lille, London, and Brussels. If the charges are confirmed, the scholar will face up to 15 years in prison on the charge of rape, and up to 20 years on the separate charge of rape of a vulnerable person.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI’s Parisian tour continues. The King has been posing for photos with Moroccan and international fans during his stay in France. His latest fan, Israël Goldberg, took to his Facebook to express his gratitude for meeting the monarch in Paris. “I had the honor this afternoon to transmit the seven universal principles – Noah’s seven laws – to His Majesty the King of Morocco, who had symbolically come to buy a pair of glasses at Jonathan’s, at 17 rue des Rosiers, a building where the Lubavitch synagogue is located that is also the oldest of Paris,” wrote the Rabbi. Impressed by the King’s modesty and tolerance, Goldberg added that the King “was very touched to hear our blessings-we recited in Hebrew the ritual braha on kings-and asked us to pray for him.”  He added that they have also offered the King “the principle of the daily silent meditation minute that the Rabbi lubavitcher–who he said he knew well-had proposed to institute in every school in the world, with a box of tszdaka (justice or righteousness)” To conclude his message, the Rabbi wrote “long live the King.” Several photos of King Mohammed VI appearing in France have gone viral following his recent successful heart surgery.

The Russian official made his remarks concerning the Moroccan bid in a press conference held by the Russian embassy in Rabat on Russia’s preparations to host the upcoming 2018 World Cup beginning in June. Referring to the three-nations North American bid, Vorobiev said, “objectively, the three candidate countries are weak in football, we all know the American, Mexican and Canadian football. [It is] not real football.” He added that the 2026 World Cup in Morocco will be beneficial for many countries, including African, Middle Eastern and European countries as the kingdom is only 14 kilometers away from Europe, “which is good for [football] fans.” The Russian diplomat also commended Morocco’s weather, explaining that “the weather conditions are good in Morocco and everything is good and there are no shortcomings,” adding that “it is necessary” for Morocco to host the 2026 World Cup. Speaking about the 2018 World Cup, Vorobiev said that “Moroccans know Russia well,” adding that the country is excited to receive Moroccan football fans. Vorobiev also commended Morocco’s football team qualification, saying that the Moroccan squad “is strong.” The Russian official said that Morocco’s recent victory over Serbia in a pre-World Cup friendly is further proof. The Russian diplomat also underscored the bilateral ties linking Morocco and Russia, noting that “good historical relations link the two countries, and that Moroccans know Russia well through cultural exchange.” Morocco’s 2026 bid has managed to collect public support from several countries across the globe, including Qatar, France, Serbia, Botswana, Algeria, Tunisia, Nigeria and Luxembourg.

Rabat – Congolese ambassador (Congo Brazzaville) to Morocco Jean-Claude Gakosso has recently handed King Mohammed VI an invitation letter from President Denis Sassou Nguesso. The letter is an invitation extended to the Moroccan monarch to take part in a conference to be held on April 25 in the Congolese capital city. The Blue Funds conference seeks to mobilize funds and other resources to help maintain and preserve the ecological riches and uniqueness of the Congo Basin. According to reports, King Mohamed VI has been invited as the conference’s special guest. This special move is a recognition of Morocco’s tireless efforts—King Mohammed is said to be the Congo Basin initiative’s most important international supporter—in helping and furthering the visions and aspirations of the initiative. Speaking to the press on the significance of Morocco’s contribution to the materialization of the project’s ambitions, Congo’s ambassador Jean-Claude Gakosso said that Morocco has been present and indispensable since the beginning of the project in March 2017. He explained that the initiative of salvaging and sustaining the ecological diversity and riches of the Congo Basin was launched during the UN-sponsored COP 22 climate change conference in Marrakech. “Morocco has been playing a central role in terms of giving more international resonance to this project,” Mr. Gakosso said. Morocco’s foreign minister Nasser Bourita welcomed the invitation on behalf of Moroccan authorities. Also speaking to the press on Morocco-Congo bilateral relations, Mr. Bourita stressed Morocco’s desire to reinforce its relationships with all “fellow Africans.” Mr. Bourita spoke of “sincere friendship” and necessary “solidarity” to face the numerous challenges of “common African ambitions.” Bourita reminded the pres that the two countries share historical ties and enjoy “very old relations.” He added that the bilateral ties between the two countries are based on an “unwavering solidarity in times of hardship” and a common desire to strengthen existing relations. Bourita concluded, the two countries’ foreign affairs ministers have a special and solemn obligation to bring their nations closer together, thus boosting and upholding the friendship and “fraternity” that have always characterized their relationships.

The stampede broke out at the Barrio Chino crossing point in Melilla, causing several injuries. Later, Moroccan and Spanish media reported that the stampede caused the death of a man who “was severely injured” during the incident. However, Morocco’s Maghreb Arab Press reported later that no deaths had occurred in connection with the stampede. When Spanish senator Bildu Kon Inarritu inquired about the circumstances of the stampede, the government cabinet announced that the stampede had broken out on the Moroccan side of the border. The Spanish government, according to the news source, added that ten people were stuck in the narrow passage whose capacity should not exceed one person. The source added that two people “fell to the ground” and were trampled by other “human mules.” “Due to the gravity of the situation,” the Spanish authorities “have asked the Moroccan authorities to release the rush of people from their side in order to bring out the wounded because that was impossible on the opposite side,” added the source which quoted the Spanish cabinet. The source added that Spanish authorities transferred one of the victims of the incident to the Comarca Hospital in Melilla, and that the Spanish police were later informed of the death of the injured Moroccan citizen. Kon Inarritu also expressed his concerns over the general situation in Melilla, asking the government to identify measures that have been taken to avoid such tragic incidents in both Melilla and Ceuta. In its report, the Spanish cabinet said that the stampede occurred on the Moroccan side of the border, “where the maintenance of order is Morocco’s responsibility.” The source added that, “It is not up to the government of Spain to judge the work of the Moroccan authorities on the control and regulation of people’s transit.” Following the January incident, Spanish media reported that three were injured on the Spanish side, one of whom is in a “very serious condition.”

This visit will be the first of its kind for the Moroccan official, a source told Moroccan news outlet Le360. Bourita will meet with President Abbas and other members of the Palestinian cabinet for talks on a wide range of topics, including the Palestinian statehood issue. Al Khaleej online, an Emirates-based news outlet, reported that Nasser Bourita will also visit Jerusalem. The visit is part of Morocco’s historical connection and obligation to the region, conducted under the instruction and supervision of King Mohammed VI, Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee. The kingdom’s commitment aims at protecting and perpetuating the historic and religious heritage of the multi-faith holy site. Bourita’s visit will take place just a few months after President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital city of Israel and to move the US embassy there from Tel Aviv. Trump’s decision was uniformly condemned by regional Arab and Western countries alike. World leaders, including King Mohammed VI, denounced the US decision, considering it a significant threat to further peace negotiations between Palestine and Israel.

In the past week, Facebook came under fire after its involvement in one of the “largest data breaches of personal information.” International media outlets reported that Cambridge Analytica (CA), a data firm associated with Donald Trump’s election campaign, had managed to extract data for about 50 million Facebook users, allowing it to create targeted and psychologically verified advertising content. When the news of Cambridge Analytica data scandal came to light, the social media giant went quiet for several days, until the founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, commented in a very “late apology” on the company’s attitude regarding its users’ data privacy. “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you,” Zuckerberg wrote. He noted that the company has already changed some of the policies that served to enable the breach, adding that, “we also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it.” Even though the company’s founder apologised for the mistake, Facebook seems to have lost the trust of not only its users but also advertisers and key shareholders who have continued to sell shares of the company whose market value plummeted by USD 58 billion within a week. The company’s latest market value became known on Saturday night. Share value in the company dropped from $176.80 on Monday to around $159.30 by Friday night. “This truly is a “damaging episode” in Facebook’s history,” BBC quoted senior analyst Laith Khalaf as saying. “One of the secrets of Facebook’s success has been that the more people who use Facebook, the more integral it becomes to its customers. Unfortunately for Facebook, the same dynamic cuts in the opposite direction if it loses a meaningful number of users as a result of this scandal,” Khalaf added. On Wednesday, March 21, advertising on Facebook was suspended by Mozilla and Commerzbank. Later, the official Facebook accounts of SpaceX and Tesla were also removed, likely by CEO and founder Elon Musk. The data leakage scandal also drove many angry users to launch a #DeleteFacebook campaign on Twitter, which helped cause Facebook’s shares to nosedive.

Rabat – Morocco is more than ever decided to hold the 2026 World Cup. After campaigning in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, Morocco 2026’s organizing committee is setting its sight on Central Asia, with the aim of convincing that part of the world that the kingdom’s bid is the more deserving one in this 2026 scramble. As the defining hour for the vote approaches, the fierce competition to win the hearts and minds of the FIFA community is nowhere near its end. According to recent reports, an important Moroccan delegation has paid a working visit to Kazakhstan, Turkey, and Azerbaijan. Moroccan officials spoke to their central Asian counterparts in terms of lending their support and vote to the North African country’s bid. The delegation was headed by Morocco’s ambassador to Russia and convened other Moroccan diplomats who, armed with their knowledge of the diplomatic world, are now engaged in campaigns aimed at persuading their counterparts of the merits and potentials of Morocco’s bid. This Central Asian episode is said to be an important step in the country’s global plan to counter United 2026’s—USA/Canada/Mexico—recent orchestrated campaign to disparage Morocco’s organizational capacities as well as its financial, socio-cultural, and a score of other assets related to the hosting of the FIFA World-Cup. And while the North American trio is showcasing its huge stadiums and ‘formidable’ infrastructures, Morocco is reported to be campaigning in terms of “smart” and compelling  efforts that foreground the historical, touristic, and socio-cultural “marvels” that the country “can offer” to the many fans and teams who will be visiting during the 2026 edition.

Rabat – On Friday this week, a lone gunman identified as Redouane Lakdim stormed into a supermarket in Trèbes, a small town in southern France, killing four people, including the high-ranked officer Lieutenant Colonel Arnaud Beltrame who traded his life to save a hostage. Sixteen others are believed to have been wounded in the attack, with one currently in a critical state. Following this attack that some in France say constitute President Macron’s first ‘true test’ in facing the mounting challenges of terrorism and related threats, the French president affirmed his “absolute determination” to crush terrorism and other forms of “fundamentalisms.” And regarding the ‘Trèbes gunman,’ the French president reminded the police and all other security services that facing the surging extremist challenge would mean asking and answering some fundamental questions: “When and how did his [the Trèbes attack’s perpetrator’s] radicalization occur? How did he get the gun he used?” Macron added that “all necessary means should be mobilized to answer these questions.” Following the police operation in which the suspect was killed, Le Monde published a series of articles that shed some insight into Redouane Lakdim’s demographic profile and motivations for the Friday incident. Two relatives of the terrorist have been placed under police custody, Le Monde reports, adding that the “perpetrator’s bloody itinerary” is a long story of abrupt radicalization and petty crimes. Based on the findings of the first police investigations, Le Monde reports that the series of events started on Friday when Lakdim attacked an Opel Corsay labeled white car with two people inside. He stole the car, killing one of the two people and critically wounding the other. Around 11 am, he drove to a marine camp which he was eying to assault. He, however, had a change of heart, driving instead to a CRS (the general reserve of the French national police) facility. There, he opened fire on four policemen who were jogging, wounding one of them on his left shoulder, before fleeing and escaping the fury of the CRS officers. “Investigators found six bullets near the CRS facilities,” said Paris’ public prosecutor François Molins. The suspect then stormed into a supermarket in which there were around fifty people. “Preliminary findings attest that he entered the supermarket while shouting ‘Allah Akbar’, and saying that he is ready to die for Syria,” Mr. Molins noted. According to the public prosecutor, the perpetrator also asked for the release of his ‘brothers in arms,” especially Salah Abdeslam, the “most important surviving suspect” of the 13 November 2015 Paris attacks that killed 130 people. He indiscriminately opened fire in the crowded supermarket, killing a client and the supermarket’s butcher. When the gendarmerie later encircled the supermarket, the perpetrator accepted to liberate one of the hostages in exchange for Lieutenant Colonel Arnaud Beltrame. Mr. Beltrame is believed to have kept his phone line open, which would later allow his colleagues to launch the assault that killed the perpetrator and liberated the supermarket hostages. Speaking after the liberation of the hostages, French President Emmanuel Macron praised the ‘noble sacrifice’ of the officer who traded his life. Macron dubbed him “a national hero whose sacrifice will forever remain in our memories.” Daesh claimed the attack late on Friday, saying that the lone gunman was operating under their command. Who is Redouane Lakdim? According to primary police investigations, the 25-year old Redouane Lakdim was born in Morocco on 11 April 1992. He was reportedly known for his Salafi leanings, as well as his criminal past, although, according the authorities, all of the crimes he had engaged in were petty crimes with no real threat of radicalization. “Between 2016 and 2017, he was the object of a police monitoring. But we found no evidence and warning signs of a possible radicalization” Mr. Molins told the press. This was reiterated by France’s interior minister Gérard Collomb who also said: “We were monitoring him and we thought that he was not radicalized.” Mr. Collomb added that the supermarket attack was “unexpected” and “abrupt.” Redouane Lakdim’s partner, together with a “minor friend of his,” are currently being held under police custody “for determining the provenance of the gun the terrorist used, the circumstances under which he got his gun, as well as eventual complicities” involved in this “tragedy,” Le Monde reported. According to the same outlet, police investigations of Mr. Lakdim’s house established the gunman’s links with ISIS with “notes, a personal testament, and visual contents” that attest that the suspect may have been a member or a simple sympathizer of the terrorist group. Investigations are still ongoing, but everything now indicates that the suspect paid allegiance to the Islamic State, the police said, adding that subsequent investigations will reveal more details in the case.

Rabat – Carles Puigdemont, the fugitive former Catalan president who is wanted in Spain on rebellion and sedition charges, was detained by German police while attempting to cross the border into Denmark, according to his lawyer and party spokesman, Jaume Alonso-Cuevillas. Puigdemont “was arrested today at 11:19 a.m. by Schleswig-Holstein’s highway patrol force,” a German police spokesman said, adding that the detention was based on an international arrest warrant. “He is now in police custody,” the spokesman said. Puigdemont’s lawyer said in a post on Twitter that the exiled official had been intending to return by vehicle to Belgium where he has resided since fleeing Spain last October. He was then detained by the German police on an international arrest warrant. “President Carles Puigdemont was held in Germany when he crossed the border from Denmark, on his way to Belgium from Finland,” the lawyer said. 1. El president Carles Puigdemont ha estat retingut a Alemanya quan creuava la frontera des de Dinamarca, de camí cap a Bèlgica des de Finlàndia. — J. Alonso-Cuevillas (@JaumeAlonsoCuev) March 25, 2018  The ousted leader has been living in self-imposed exile in Belgium since fleeing Spain after a failed bid by his regional government to declare Catalonia’s independence from the country in late October. The declaration led the Spanish government to impose direct rule over Catalonia, after which the Spanish court dissolved the Catalonian parliament, fired the Catalan government, and called a new regional election in December. Puigdemont had fled to Belgium along with other members of his dissolved cabinet after Spain’s attorney-general filed charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds against Puigdemont and five of his ministers on October 30.

Rabat – On Friday, Morocco’s General Directorate for National Security (DGSN) released a press statement denying comments attributed to Moroccan lawyer Mohammad Ziane regarding a complainant summoned in the case of detained journalist Taoufik Bouachrine. A recent report by Moroccan news outlet Al Omk featured statements attributed to Ziane, who claimed that a complainant was forced to appear before the court on Friday. Ziane’s alleged statement added that the complainant was also threatened with the release of videos of her personal life if she did not appear at the next hearing which is scheduled for March 29. To verify the statements published by the news source, the judicial police opened an investigation in accordance with the procedures of the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Court of Appeal in Casablanca to determine the circumstances and veracity of the attorney’s allegations. The press release issued by DGSN added that the court is the only legitimate body in charge of informing complainants who have been summoned to appear before the court. The DGSN strenuously denied that police received any complainant last Friday, announcing that the only alleged accuser in the high-profile case was summoned last Thursday. The statement also added that the police refuted the false statements published in the report, emphasizing that the investigation and all related witness and complainant interviews done in this case are based on legitimate practices done in accordance with Moroccan judicial procedures. The statement also noted that police officers and investigators are obliged to maintain the strict confidentiality of all aspects of the investigation, including complainant statements, in accordance with relevant legal requirements. Bouachrine, who was arrested on February 28, is facing charges of sexual harassment, sexual violence, and rape. The police claim to be in possession of 50 videos that may serve to back the charges facing the prominent journalist, suggesting that some or all of the videos were recorded by Bouachrine himself. During a previous court appearance, Bouachrine’s lawyers argued for their client’s innocence, claiming the videographic evidence the police claim to possess had been “falsified” in some manner.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – Hundreds of thousands of protesters lined the streets of the United States’ capital for the “March For Our Lives,” calling for stricter gun control in America. The march was put together in the five intervening weeks since the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida that resulted in 17 students’ deaths.  The march follows in the tradition of peaceful civil protest on the streets of Washington D.C., harkening back to 1960s activism of the US Civil Rights Movement. However, at Saturday’s “March For Our Lives,” the majority of speakers were under the age of 18. As student activist and Parkland survivor Emma González said before leaving the podium: “Fight for your lives before it’s somebody else’s job.” “March For Our Lives” highlighted the issue of gun violence across the country: survivors of the Florida shooting shared their spotlight with speakers from high schools in Los Angeles and Chicago. Similar events advocating gun control took place in 800 locations across the US and worldwide, including Berlin, Bogotá, London, Mumbai, Port-au-Prince, São Paulo, Sydney, and Tokyo.  The campaign to tackle gun violence aims to build momentum and pressure lawmakers by demanding expanded background checks on gun buyers, a ban on assault weapons, and raising the minimum age of gun-buyers. Cameron Kasky, a Parkland survivor, told those gathered in Washington D.C. that “the march is not the climax of this movement–it is the beginning.”  “Today, we take to the streets in over 800 marches around the globe and demand common sense gun laws.” Yolanda Renee King, 9, drew thunderous applause as she echoed the words of her grandfather, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: “I have a dream that enough is enough. And that this should be a gun-free world, period.” However, despite one the groundswell of popular support for gun reform inspired by the Parkland survivors, substantive gun reform may yet be far off. Few issues in American politics are more polarizing than that of gun ownership, and many Americans reject any efforts by the government to restrict firearms for law-abiding citizens.  The gun lobby in the United States offers staunch support for citizens’ rights to own firearms and hotly contests any moves in government to curtail them. The National Rifle Association (NRA) often cites a single, 27-word sentence from the US constitution, penned in 1791, guaranteeing Americans’ rights to form civil militias. US President Donald Trump, known for his outspoken commentary on Twitter, was silent on the issue of the rallies on the streets of the capital. However, the White House released a statement saying, “We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their first amendment rights today. Keeping our children safe is a top priority of the president’s.”

Rabat – The Moroccan boxer Mohammed Rabii has, as ever, secured another impressive victory, claiming his fifth victory in five professional boxing matches and maintaining his momentum among the invincible breed of the “noble sport.” Once again, the KO man—he won three of his previous four matches by KO—knocked out the Italian veteran Giuseppe Lauri in a third round hugely dominated by the Moroccan’s formidably powerful punches. At the Palais Des Sports in Marseille, France, and on an occasion dubbed “the evening of the year” by promoter Sebastien Acaries, who was speaking in terms of the boxing quality and physical prowess exhibited by the fighters, the 24-year old Moroccan overpowered the Italian, forcing him, in the third round, to withdraw from a fight that could have taken eight rounds.   Moroccan commentators have compared Rabii to Mohammed Ali, calling him “Morocco’s Mohammed Ali.” International boxing commentators, for their part, have dubbed him “the rising star,” “the developing pearl of the boxing industry. Comparison to a gigantic legend is surely heavy for the young and growing shoulders of the Bronze winner at the 2016 Rio Olympics; yet, should the Moroccan uphold this aura of overwhelming invincibility, his sure-to-come future achievements may make the Mohamed Ali analogy plausible, valid, and far from the farfetched dream that some now think it is. “I am a shy person. But inside the ring, I am a totally different person,” Rabii once said in the aftermath of another impressive KO victory late last year. For now, his records—outstandingly knocking out his opponents—are backing him up: He is of a rare species inside the ring.

Rabat – This weekend we won’t have our traditional dose of La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, or Premier League (that enthused and fairly overrated league) matches. But the international friendlies were just as exquisite, with some fixtures proving to be of the stamina and texture of a world cup semi final, or even final. I have said so much about the Atlas Lions’ current shape that I’m usually guilty, though understandably, of self-plagiarism when discussing another brilliant performance from Hervé Renard’s boys.  Serbia may not be in the same category as Spain or Portugal (two of the teams that Morocco will be facing in Russia), but the game was nonetheless a much-needed warm-up, a training-like session aimed at giving the coach hints about what is working right now, how to improve it, and, ultimately, how to fix what is not working. And what does not seem to be working right now is the flow in the midfield. But there is, too, some lack of harmony in the defensive system. Morocco did play well, with flow and harmony coming from crosses, and some bits of mastery in the midfield as well. There were also some moments of inspiration in the game, that energized and passionate spirit of players who know they’ll be facing the likes of Iniesta and Cristiano Ronaldo three months from now.  Morocco won by 2-1, a clear indication that, generally speaking, Renard’s boys do have the talents and spirit it takes to win matches. However, against the likes of Spain and Portugal, where the ball quickly flows from the midfield to the sides, and then inside the penalty area, like a tide of an irresistible tsunami, you need an almost impenetrable defensive fortress.  Serbia’s equalizer, which left Morocco’s defenders laughably helpless, seemed too easy. And so, to stop the lethal Cristiano headers, or the incessant Alba crosses, or the seamless and elegant Isco-Iniesta midfield, you need more inspiration and urgency than what the Atlas Lions displayed yesterday. Morocco shined in Turin, but it can do better; it has to do better. If a game shocked football fans in this international break, it was France VS Colombia. You may not be a Francophile, but Les Bleus are without doubt one of the most well-equipped and fun-to-watch squads around right now. It’s almost like a Brazil squad, a beautiful combination of individualities and collective depth.  With the talents they have at their disposal right now, and all of them playing determining positions in Europe’s leading clubs, France is a reservoir of unbelievable talents. Sadly, however, a Falcao and Rodriguez-led Colombia descended upon Les Bleus yesterday like a hurricane. France, dominating the first minutes, led the game by 2-0.  The South Americans quickly came back, however. And non content to have a draw with one Europe’s footballing powerhouse, the South Americans drove the third goal home with an elegant penalty kick from Quintero.  The defeat was a shocking surprise—allow me the pleonasm—for the stars-filled French squad, perhaps even so for the Colombians. But, as they say, “A quelque chose malheur est bon.” France has everything it takes to win Russia 2018, but they need to invest in better ways to streamline their otherwise unstoppable factory of elegant players. Watching these two teams play is always an artistic event, a meeting ground for beauty and effectiveness. Nonetheless, had it not been for the sheer technical prowess of David Degea—who performed yet another irreproachable match—Germany could have easily won the game by 3 or 4-1. But that is exactly what makes good teams: the presence of great players who step up in the most defining hours. No wonder these two favorites for Russia ended on an even score of 1-1. And, watch out, this could be a textbook match of a semi final or final in Russia this summer. Egypt VS Portugal was not quite an encounter of two national squads; it was, more to the point, an opportunity for the growing Mohamed Salah to compare his current mind-blowing shape to the indefatigably comforting presence of the established Cristiano Ronaldo.  A friend of mine recently told me that Salah is a growing beast. How not to agree with that given the Egyptian’s goal against Ronaldo’s side? Salah receives a pass outside of the penalty box at the 55th minute.  A normal player would have controlled and looked for team play. Perhaps pass the ball to a teammate inside the box, or maybe attempt a cross. But Sallah is no normal player, so he did what he has been doing since he joined Liverpool last summer: score improbable goals that leave goal keepers wondering “How did he do that?”  But for all the brilliance ofSalah’s performance yesterday, in the end, it was Cristiano who had more momentum. With two goals –again with that magical head of his—in added time, the Madrista once again made the statement he is been making since he awoke from his goal scoring slumber: “I’ll be around for a while, and you don’t get to write me off, not yet at least.” So: Sallah is perhaps the future of football, but Ronaldo is its present, which explains yesterday’s score line: 2-1 in favor of Cristiano and cos. Italy showed one thing against a Dimaria-led Argentina: they no longer are the squad they once were. No wonder they failed to make it to Russia. And so Messi could serenely watch his teammates crucify veteran Buffon and the lot of indecisive attacking bunch that the Italian squad has turned into.  While stunning Italy, however, the superb goals from Banega and Lanzini are an invitation for improvement for this Italian squad we used to admire: In modern football, having a good keeper and an almost impenetrable defense is good.  But scoring is key. Insigne and Immobile can be robust and beastly strikers at time. They are however sporadic scorers for the national squad. So perhaps it is good that they will not be in Russia this summer. In four years, they need to reinvent their playing philosophy, bring back that Del Piero, Totti, and Pirlo-led Italy in which the danger was constantly imminent and could come from anywhere. Nigeria’s Super Eagles’ 1-0 victory over Lewandowski’s now world class Poland national squad was a reminder that African teams should not be written off in this 2018 edition. If Morocco succeeds the miracle that Hervé has promised he and his boys would deliver, with other African teams in less deadly groups, the continent may pass that Quarterfinals barrier that has been unnerving African fans for decades. So, “Go Africa!”  Of Tite’s Brazil, what can one say? The Brazilian coach says that he wants to engineer his team on the basis of talented bunch of the 1982 generation. And he is not very far from so grand a dream, at least when you consider the succession of mouthwatering performances that the team has delivered since the former Corinthians man took over a lackadaisical Neymar-dependent and Dunga-coached squad.  So: 3-0 against Russia yesterday, with Paulinho and Coutinho scoring; with the likes of Jesus, Willian, Coutinho, Marcelo, and what have you, not to mention that the 2014 frustrating Neymar-dependency is a long-forgotten nightmare, this squad will be aiming to give their Brazilians and global fans what people expect from Brazil: sheer joy, winning coupled with pure beauty, that footballing joie de vivre of which Brazil alone has the secret. These friendlies gave us what I call glimpses of Russia 2018: Germany can secure a successive win; Spain is great, but not indomitable; Portugal can count on Ronaldo’s current beastly shape; Brazil is not the fragile giant it was four years ago; France can win but is far from being consolidated; African teams can be the surprising bunch; and most of all, given South Americans’ immaculate performances (with Uruguay and Costa Rica also securing beautiful wins this week), this Russian World Cup may well be leaning towards a South American victory. But how I wish an African squad  can be the champions! Why not?

Rabat- The co-pilot of the Portuguese airline, TAP Air Portugal, was arrested Friday night at Stuttgart airport after he showed-up drunk shortly before the takeoff to Lisbon, keeping more than 100 passengers stranded at Stuttgart airport in southwestern Germany, German police and prosecutors said. Shortly before the takeoff, an airport worker discovered that “the co-pilot seemed unsteady on his feet and reeked of alcohol.” After warning the airport authorities, German police entered the cockpit and found the 40-year-old in a “highly intoxicated condition” yesterday evening, according to statement. The Stuttgart public prosecutor’s office immediately suspended the Portuguese pilot’s flight license and set a EUR 10,000 bail for his release. Following the incident, the flight was canceled and all the 106 passengers on board were taken to a hotel, the German news agency DPA reported.  TAP tweeted Saturday that the passengers would only be able to fly to Lisbon on Monday, “which is, at the moment, the first day with seats available.

Rabat- The Marrakech-based Cadi Ayyad University (UCA) has once again been designated the leading higher learning institution in Morocco, the Maghreb area, and Francophone Africa at large, according to a recent university ranking published on March 20 by the London-based Times Higher Education (THE). In 2018, UCA managed to maintain its leadership in Morocco and Francophone Africa, ranking above universities such as Morocco’s Mohammed V University, Senegal’s Cheick Anta Diop University, Tunisia’s El Manar University, and many others. Overall, UCA ranks 11th in Africa and 19th in the Arab world. This important international validation, which is based on a university’s excellent teaching and research record and alumni employability, is an acknowledgement of the university’s continuous investment in excellent teaching, high quality research, and skill-building programs and majors that take into account the changing environment of the work setting, UCA said in press release that celebrated the university’s new ranking. The Times Higher Education praised the Marrakech-base university for its excellent research facilities, while acknowledging that UCA is still to improve in many of its newly established academic fields, especially in social sciences and the humanities. “Scientific research is a great source of pride for the university, and with more than 1,400 research professors and 146 research facilities it has become a leading scientific and technological centre in Morocco,” THE said in its ranking, specifically citing the MOS project, which has recently led to some groundbreaking discoveries in the Atlas Mountains.  In its own press release, the university also mentioned its recent improvements in research. The press release nonetheless pointed out that much work is still needed, not only to improve the university’s future global standing, but also to hone its facilities and teaching programs in order to help it stay on top of the critical trends and challenges of a globalized and changing world. “Thanks to its futuristic vision and the dedication and devotion of its researchers, the university has succeeded in boosting and consolidating its research facilities, making it a national and international educational hub,” the press release said. But, recognizing the numerous challenges ahead, it added: “It is true that UCA is striving to maintain what it already has, but that does not mean that we should not project ourselves towards realizing the dream of tomorrow’s university.”

Rabat- Following news reports that the bodies of 300 abandoned babies are annually discovered in Casablanca, the police have conducted investigations into the causes of this reported dire trend. Earlier this week, an article published by the French daily Le Monde claimed that every year 300 newborns are found dead in Casablanca’s public dustbins. Le Monde said in its report that these high figures are due to the fact that extramarital relationships and abortions are frowned upon by Moroccan public opinion. “Being an unmarried mother is a nightmare in Morocco,” Le Monde wrote. The outlet further explained that many of the single and young mothers who revert to abandoning their babies are allegedly traumatized by their “precarious situations,” leading them to fear going to orphanages, where they believe authorities would report them to the police. Investigations by the Casablanca-based department of national surety (an equivalent of the national police) have, however, come to different conclusions. According to police findings, the trend of abandoned dead babies turned out to be true, although the numbers reported in some outlets are pure speculations with “no practical foundation.” The police said that the figures advanced by the media “are very much exaggerated.” Between 2016 and 2017, only 23 cases of abandoned newborns were registered, with 10 cases in 2016 and 13 in 2017, the police reported in a statement on Friday, speaking in terms of “informing the public” and “correcting this involuntary mistake.”

Rabat- An important US military delegation has recently visited the Moroccan port city Tangier, report local outlets. It is believed that that the military delegation was led by Admiral Francis D. Morley, who is the director of American navy’s IPO program (Navy International Programs Office), a US-funded plan to boost cooperation in the field of international security. Admiral Morley is also said to  to be an important member of President Trump’s inner circle, suggesting the strategic significance of his leading an American navy visit to Morocco. Having first landed in Rabat from Detroit, before subsequently heading to Tangier, the Morley-led navy team was welcomed by Moroccan military authorities, essentially from the country’s Royal Navy corps. The welcoming ceremony also saw an important participation from the American embassy in Rabat, as well as a number of other American businessmen and military attachés residing in the North African country. Although neither party –American and Moroccan military officials–has  been forthcoming about the visit’s details, sources close to the Royal Navy have been quoted as saying that this important visit is taking place in the framework of leapfrogging and strengthening US-Morocco strategic relationships on military and national defense-related matters. During the Tangier tour, the American navy delegation seized the opportunity to pay a visit to the Ksar Sghir military port, the same sources told the press, noting that the said military port is currently undergoing development and modernization works. As this important military visit came just few weeks after the common training sessions held between the US navy’s state-of-the art guided-missile cruiser USS Vella Gulf and some Moroccan frigates, Moroccan observers have been keen to affirm that Admiral Morley’s visit may after all herald a new dawn of increased and reinforced military relationships between the two countries, especially given that the North African country is currently engaged in a thorough reform of its air and naval defense systems, and has acquired a sizable number of US-made military equipments over the last years.

Rabat- King Mohammed VI offered his congratulations  to former Prime Minister Abderrahmane El Youssoufi, following the publication of his memoirs.  Youssoufi’s three-volume memoir looks back at his political experience, including the period of occupation resistance and the country’s post-independence era, from different perspectives, and at both the opposition and the government level.  These memories will “undoubtedly enrich the national library of the Kingdom as a reference for researchers and those who study this important period in the history of contemporary Morocco,” the king wrote in a statement.  “We thank you for this commendable initiative, we appreciate this documentary work,” the letter adds.  This book, which features El Youssoufi’s speeches and interviews, traces his long political career, his years of struggle in the national movements – the National Union of Popular Forces (UNFP), and the Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP)- in addition to  his alternating participation and withdrawal from politics. His biographical work was published on the occasion of the 94th anniversary of the former First Secretary of the USFP. Following the coronation of King Mohammed VI on July 30, 1999, Youssoufi, who was first appointed Prime Minister by King Hassan II in February 1998, remained in his post until late 2002.  Youssoufi, former leader of the party of (USFP), and one of the icon of Morocco’s resistance to French colonialism, is regarded as one of the most respected political leaders in the country’s history, held in high esteem by King Mohammed VI. On the 17th anniversary of Throne Day, July 30, 2016, the Moroccan monarch inaugurated an avenue in Youssoufi’s honor.

Cairo- A car bomb exploded in Egypt’s second largest city, Alexandria, on Saturday, March 24, causing the death of one policeman and wounding four others, Egypt’s Interior Ministry said.  The ministry said the bombing targeted the convoy of Alexandria’s security chief, General Mostafa al-Nemr.  The statement added that the bombing had taken place after an improvised explosive device was planted underneath a car and exploded as the security director’s convoy passed by Al-Moaskar Al-Romany Street in central Alexandria, without mentioning if the security director was hurt in the attack or not. The body of the policeman and the four wounded, whose identity was not disclosed, were transported to a military hospital in the city, reported Ministry of Health Spokesman Khaled Megahed in a statement. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. However, Egypt’s state news agency MENA has blamed the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood, which the state described as a terrorist group, following the bombing.  “This attempt comes in the context of terrorist Muslim Brotherhood elements trying to disrupt the electoral process and influence citizens to stay away from the polls and avoid participating in the presidential election,” the agency said. The incident was perpetrated only two days before the opening of the Egyptian presidential election polls on Monday, during which voters will choose between the outgoing head of state, Abdel Fattah al Sissi, who will likely endorse a second term, and the little-known candidate Moussa Mostafa Moussa, who is believed to be a supporter of the president.

Rabat- Forty organizations from European and African countries have signed a petition against the construction of the gas pipeline project that will stretch along the West African coast from Nigeria to Morocco, with a possible extension to Europe. The project was first announced following a meeting between King Mohammed VI and Nigerian President Muhammad Buhari, on the sidelines of the UN Climate Summit COP22 in Marrakech in November 2016, and was further examined by the two heads of state during the Monarch’s visit to Abuja in December 2016. The project–which is the continuation of the West African Gas Pipeline (GOA), linking Nigeria to Ghana through Benin and Togo–aims to culminate in a gigantic pipeline that will run about 5000 kilometers from Nigeria to Morocco, for a cost estimated at USD 20 billion, serving 12 countries on the African continent and some 300 million potential consumers, according to a statement released by the royal cabinet.  “This strategic gas pipeline, which may stretch up towards Europe, will promote the emergence of an integrated North West African zone and enable the region to achieve energy independence, accelerate the implementation of electrification projects, and develop important economic and industrial activities,” the statement reads.  However, the associations that signed the petition argued that the project would “increase the extraction and consumption of fossil resource, the main cause of global warming,” adding that the project will lead to a financial sinkhole. “It is likely that the forecasted cost of USD 20 billion will likely be doubled and will lead to an exponential increase in the debt burden of our countries,” the petition reads.  The associations, which include ATTAC Morocco, the Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF-Nigeria), the Association Pierre Domachal (France), Climáximo (Portugal), Friends of the Earth (United States), and the association “No to the gas pipeline Fos Dunkerque” (France), pointed out that “the section already constructed (WAGP) was done without consulting the populations who rejected the environmental impact study.”   “It is a top-down project that does not consider the needs of the populations and the environment. They are not consulted and will not be the first beneficiaries of this pipeline. While Nigeria is Africa’s largest exporter of gas and oil, less than half of the population has access to electricity. In Benin, Togo, an area already served by the WAGP, barely a third of the population have access to electricity,” the petition adds.  In addition to other environmental and financial reasons, the organizations believe that the gas pipeline is “bad for the region, our peoples and the Planet. We say no to the project.”

Rabat – Morocco Defeats Serbia in Friendly Pre-World-Cup Match. The Moroccan national team won its first pre-world-cup match against Serbia, which took place in Turin at 7:30 p.m. (GMT). The Moroccan team scored its first goal at the 29 minute through a penalty kick by the midfielder Hakim Ziyech. Though this was the first match since last November, Moroccan players displayed great harmony and confidence in their game and gave the Moroccan public assurances that they are ready to defend Morocco’s jersey in the upcoming FIFA World Cup to be held in Russia next June. Following their first goals, Moroccan players sought to control the match and double the score, but they failed to materialize the scoring opportunities they created. The Serbian team’s reaction was effective, allowing them to score the equalizer nine minutes later. But the joy of the Serbian players was short-lived, with Moroccan striker scoring the second goal for his teammates at the 40th minutes following a masterful center from Hakim Ziyech. In the second half, the rhythm of the match dropped from both teams, especially on the part of the Serbian players who looked exhausted. In an attempt to inject new blood into his team and level the score, the Serbian coach made five changes, but it was to no avail. Moroccan players seemed focused and determined to win their first match of the year. The Atlas Lions will play their second friendly match against Uzbekistan next Tuesday in Casablanca.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat- Israel will reveal archived documents pertaining to the discrimination practised by Israeli state against Moroccan Jews who immigrated to Israel in the 1950s. The silent suffering of Moroccan Jewish immigrants in 1950s Israel will soon be made known to the public after years of cover-up at the hands of Zionists, reported Israeli news press Haaretz. On Tuesday, March 20, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked announced the Israeli government’s decision to post online documented evidence of discrimination practised against the Moroccan-Jewish communities. In the 1950s, the early days of the Israeli state, a large number of Jewish people who lived in Morocco immigrated to Israel.  According to previous statements made by some Moroccan Jews to Haaretz, the Jewish- Moroccan community was stereotyped, discriminated and “robbed of their Arab-Mizrahi culture and Arab identity.” Inspired by the TV documentary film by David Deri recounting racism Moroccan immigrants suffered from the Israeli state at that time, the Israeli government has made it a point to show the documents to the world. After some of the data of the archived documents were revealed in the TV documentary, the World Zionist Organization (WZO) discovered that the documents are not classified and therefore, accessible to the public. “[The documents] will be accessible to any person in Israel, to any person in the world. Totally accessible,” Netanyahu said. Shaked referred to the archived documents in question which are currently kept in the Israeli State Archives saying: I will suggest to the cabinet that the documents be reviewed and approved for perusal under the auspices of the State Archives.”

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat- Saad Lamjarred’s alleged victim has let the French media in on the sexual assault and its aftermath.  Laura Prioul declared to BFMTV that her life has been a constant struggle ever since she filed a complaint against the Moroccan pop singer, Saad Lamjarred–as evidenced by the attacks against her on social media.  The alleged victim claimed that she had to face hateful comments which portrayed her as the villain of the story on daily basis, “they say that I did it for money, that I trapped him, and that I did it for the fame,” she explained.  Prioul didn’t stop there. As she moved to the set of the “C’est Que de la Télé” show on the French channel C8. A video tweeted by the show depicts her talking about the night when the rape allegedly took place.  “I tried to fight back…but the more I fought, the more blows I received,” she confessed.  In another video excerpt, Prioul claims that she and her family have received serious death threats which prevented her from working in certain areas in France out of fear. However, the alleged victim said that she did not let the threats or the cyber bullying stop her from speaking up about  her case.  Prioul said that the case isn’t only about her, but it is first and foremost about all the women who have been through similar ordeals.  Saad Lamjarred was previously the subject of another rape case in 2010, where an American-Albanian, Armella, accused him of rape and violence. The Moroccan singer fled the States when he was temporarily released.

Rabat – Air India flight AI 139 from New Delhi landed on Thursday on Tel Aviv airport via Saudi Arabia, ending a long-standing ban of flights from Saudi Arabia to Israel, according to The Times of India. The decision is spurring many observers to query the implications of such a move in light of the Saudi Kingdom’s new regional aspirations. Though the flight may seem banal, Saudi Arabia’s permission to flyover en route to Tel Aviv is a major diplomatic event, especially considering the fact that many Arab and “Islamic countries” do not recognize Israel, and are therefore adamant about banning flight services to and from Israel.   “This is a really historic moment. We are in a new era,” said Israeli tourism minister Yariv Levin, who spoke to the press in terms of strengthening and rekindling India-Israel relationships. But this “historic” diplomatic moment may raise—in fact it already has— eyebrows in many predominantly Muslim countries. Hinting at the ongoing Gulf crisis, some observers and commentators are now raising concerns about Saudi Arabia’s softening stance towards a decades-old ban of flight services to Israel, while the Kingdom has been blockading Qatar since last June. “The Air India flew over Oman, Saudi Arabia and Jordan to reach Israel,” The Times of India reported, adding that “The permission to fly over Saudi Arabia will save Air India almost 2 hours and 10 minutes compared to the longer route taken by Israel’s national carrier EI AI.” Israeli authorities are however cautious, however, as to the overall excitement that followed this “historic moment.” “We have to be very cautious. This is really a first step—a very important one. I hope with time we have more and more normal relation with our neighbor in the region,” Mr. Yariv told reporters.

Rabat  – The US Congress has once again lent its support to Morocco in the so-called Western Sahara conflict, by way of its Omnibus Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2018, passed on Thursday. Morocco’s aid provisions in the Appropriations Bill, listed on page 1399, section (g), state: “Funds appropriated under title III of this Act shall be made available for assistance for the Western Sahara” after consultation with the secretary of state, appropriations committee, and USAID administrator. This language reflects a bicameral nod to Moroccan authority in the conflict, through its reference to the the Western Sahara explicitly within the section for Morocco’s provisions. Nearly identical iterations of this language can be found in previous appropriations bills from 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014. These provisions reiterate the European Commission’s recent decision to tacitly recognize Moroccan sovereignty through its inclusion of Western Saharan waters in its renewal proposal to the current Morocco-EU Fisheries Partnership Agreement. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reports that the appropriations bill also makes a “thinly-veiled reference” to the Tindouf camps in Algeria with its mention of steps “taken to strengthen monitoring of the delivery of humanitarian assistance provided for refugees in North Africa, including any steps taken to ensure that all vulnerable refugees are receiving such assistance.” This is the second time since FY2017 that the Appropriations Bill has called on the US state department to monitor the delivery of humanitarian aid to refugees in North Africa, echoing Morocco’s calls to the international community to shed light on the embezzlement of humanitarian aid destined for the Tindouf camps.

Rabat – Friday, March 23, a gunman opened fire and took hostages in a supermarket in southern France. At least three people were killed, and a dozen were wounded. The shooter claimed to be a member of ISIS, and was formerly thought to be Moroccan (as reported by DW news outlet). But he is, in fact, a French citizen. The shooter killed a driver in Carcassonne (located in southern France) and stole his car.  He then proceeded to drive to a supermarket in Trebes, where he carried out his attack, firing at two policemen and taking hostages. According to the head of SGP Police-FO Union Yves Lefebvre, one police officer sustained a shoulder injury, but it was not very serious. The perpetrator is the 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim, and the last time he visited Morocco was in 2012 for a short stay. Before 2012, he had also briefly stayed in Morocco in 2008. The gunman was proclaiming allegiance to the Islamist organization ‘ISIS,’ as well as requesting the release of Salah Abdeslam, the prime suspect in the 2015 Paris attacks–which claimed 130 lives. According to French media, the perpetrator entered the Super U supermarket at approximately 11:15 a.m., shouting “Allahu Akbar!”. Shots proceeded.. At 2:17 p.m., a police officer emerged from the supermarket where the hostage-taker was locked up, shouting, “We got him, we got him!”

Rabat – FIFA has officially denied the Royal Moroccan Federation (FRMF) request that Moroccan-Spanish footballer, Munir El Haddadi, play for the Moroccan team, according to sports news outlet Esto. Esto reported that FIFA addressed a letter to the Moroccan federation, explaining that El Haddadi will not join the Moroccan football team. In December, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) closed El Haddadi’s case when the Moroccan Federation withdrew an appeal request, asking the court to allow El Haddadi to play for Morocco. In November, Moroccan news daily Assabah reported that El Haddadi had contacted FRMF, calling for their support in his petition to FIFA to allow him to play with Morocco in the 2018 World Cup. The withdrawal of the appeal request was confirmed by the Moroccan official football website Lion de l’Atlas.  Born to Moroccan parents in Spain, the footballer represented Spain at the youth level and made a brief appearance as a substitute at an international game against Macedonia in 2014. His appearance against Macedonia ruined his chances to represent the Moroccan national football team, according to FIFA eligibility rules. The forward is currently playing for Alaves, where he has been playing “on loan” for the 2017-2018 period. He has also represented the Spanish national team, Spanish national under-19 football team, and Spanish national under-21 football team. During his youth, the 21-year-old footballer also played for several Spanish clubs, including Atletico Madrid, FC Valencia, and Rayo Majadahonda.

Rabat – Morocco’s Industrial Acceleration Plan is coming to fruition, according to Minister of Trade and Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy. The plan is said to have created 89,884 job opportunities in 2017, representing an increase of 13,657 compared to a year earlier. Elalamy made his comments on the Moroccan Industrial Plan during the cabinet meeting held on Thursday in Rabat. “If this average is maintained, it would exceed the initial goal of the strategy, reaching 550,000 jobs” instead of 500,000 job opportunities. In his presentation on the employment situation in the industrial sector since the launch of the plan in 2014, Elalamy noted that “in 2015, a total of 52,376 positions were created in the industry, while 76,227 job opportunities were created one year after.” 2017, however, saw an increase in job opportunities in the industrial sector, which reached 89,884 jobs. The official added that these results mirror an eminent progress and transformation, owing to the efforts made by Morocco through the creation of he Industrial Development and Investment Fund (FDII) and the signing of program-contracts intended to support the various industrial sectors, especially in the automotive, the free zones, agri-food, textiles, aeronautics, fishing and the pharmaceutical industry. Elalamy also pointed out that the net creation of industrial employment picked up from 3,738 jobs in 2015 to 32,962 in 2016, before declining to 46,036 jobs. He added that this dynamic contributed to the acceleration of the rate of growth of the value added in the industrial sector, which went from 1 percent between 2013-2014 and 5 percent between 2014-2015 and 12 percent between 2015-2016. This increase in industrial value, according to Elalamy, has had a positive impact on industrial integration as well as on industrial exports, which have been climbing since 2014, with an annual average of 10 percent. In June 2017, the Secretary of State for Investment announced that 300,000 news industry jobs will be created in the next three years due to the Industrial Plan. One of the fastest-evolving sectors of the Moroccan economy, industry, is considered Morocco’s true growth engine, consolidating Morocco’s leadership in Africa. Morocco’s industrial project for 2020 is based on two major goals: first, the creation of half a million jobs, half of which are generated by Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and another half from the restored national industrial fabric. Second, the creation of 9 percentage points from the industrial share in GDP, from 14 percent to 23 percent in 2020.

Rabat – In response to accusations of police brutality in the Jerada protests by Amnesty International, Morocco’s government spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi said that “what was published by Amnesty International concerning Jerada events lacks fairness and does not include real data.” In a publication made public on March 16, Amnesty International called on Moroccan security forces to “stop using excessive force and intimidating peaceful protests,” adding that “five police trucks drove into a crowd of protestors on 14 March,” when clashes erupted between law enforcement and demonstrators. El Khalfi added that Morocco is offering people the right to demonstrate “within the framework of the law and, similarly, the public forces have also the right to intervene in the strict respect of the law provisions.” Tensions mounted between the security forces and protesters on March 14,  resulting in the arrest of nine people. The defendants were arrested for participating in unauthorized protests, as well as for injuring law enforcement. Protests began after the death of four local miners, who were working illegally in old mine shafts. The protests have expanded to condemn the social inequalities and lack of employment in the region. Meanwhile, the government has been pledging to initiate several development projects in the eastern region for months. After a recent cabinet meeting held in Rabat on Thursday, El Khalfi said that last week’s events in the city did not deter the ongoing implementation of the “government’s commitments and measures in the areas of health, education, industry, agriculture, and energy.”  Speaking about the measures taken in the region, El Khalfi said that the steps notably concern offering social security and training sessions to integrate former mine workers, as well as the demolition of abandoned mines. He added that “efforts are being made to bring justice to the population of Jerada and improve their living conditions.” Earlier this week, authorities in Jerada pledged to shut down all abandoned mines, which pose a threat to the lives of Jerada’s citizens. Secretary-general of the region’s prefecture Abderrazak El Gourji told French news agency AFP that the city of Jerada has more than 3,200 wells, 200 to 300 of which are active. “The others are abandoned and present a clear danger–they will all be closed,” he said.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat- During the weekly cabinet meeting held on Thursday, March 22, Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani discussed Morocco’s involvement in the African Continental Free Trade agreement, recently signed in Rwanda’s capital, Kigali, on March 21. El Othmani emphasized that the signed agreement comes in line with Morocco’s return to the African Union, insisting that Morocco will continue to acknowledge South-South cooperation in Africa and maintain the participation in an integrated Africa under the supervision of King Mohammed VI. In his speech concerning the Continental Free Trade agreement, El Othmani stated that “[the agreement] was a dream that lasted for decades for African countries,” he said “because when the African Union was first established, with Morocco as one of its founders, it had both political and economic dimensions, which made signing this agreement a historical moment for many African nations including Morocco.” El Othmani highlighted King Mohammed VI’s vision of making Africa an integrated continent, which will pave the way to the continent’s growth and prosperity. He also mentioned Morocco’s recent bilateral agreements in the Africa, such as Morocco-Nigeria Gas Agreement, which represents the highest forms of cooperation between African countries. The head of government pointed to the African organization’s “frail” economic and bilateral trading, saying that the agreement is the “road” to the empowerment of Africa. Morocco’s successful participation in World Water Forum During the cabinet meeting, El Othmani also announced Morocco’s successful participation in Brazil’s 8th Edition World Water Forum, emphasizing that sustainable management of water resources remains a top priority for Morocco. In line with this sentiment, Morocco plans to reinforce its trade relations with Brazil and encourage future investments in Morocco, as it is Morocco’s “third customer” in the world. El Othmani noted that Brazil has also expressed its interest in strengthening its relationship with Morocco through future investments.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat- The Mohammadia School of Engineering in Rabat will hold the 24th Emi-Enterprises Forum from April 4-5. While last year’s 23rd edition adopted the theme “Digital Transformation: Economical Reactivation Process”–focusing on encouraging engineering students and preparing them for post-graduation life–this year’s 24th edition will focus on “Africa 4.0: Capital Challenge for Tomorrow’s Engineer.” It will center on the potential for the expansion and development of several sectors in Africa, including industry, entrepreneurship, and digital technology.  The theme will also touch on the role of Morocco in present-day Africa and address the impact of industry 4.0 (the fourth industrial revolution) on the African continent. “The [African] continent must produce competent engineers to meet the expectations of building a developed Africa. Africa is in need of a competent African engineer more than ever,” EMI emphasised in a press release. This year’s forum applauds the Moroccan engineers efforts to create a “4.0 Africa” and insists on possibilities of testing proximity solutions in Morocco and shaping them to fit the African context. EMI’s press release emphasizes that Africa is on the brink of historical socio-economic growth, owing to the continent’s rich natural resources and human capital.  Africa’s development is dependent on the rising African youth, who will expand Africa’s digital entrepreneurship, which is pivotal to its productivity and sustainable development, in line with industry 4.0. Industry 4.0, or “the fourth industrial revolution,” refers to the modern-age automation and manufacturing technologies, such as cloud computing and cyber-physical systems.  The EMI-Enterprises Forum is a tradition that has lasted for 24 years, since its founding in 1994, which allowed engineering students to exchange ideas and engage with business representatives to build their confidence. The forum is considered the biggest of its kind in Morocco since 1999, under the patronage of King Mohammed VI, and is known for its roundtable discussions, stands, animated dinners, and conferences. In this forum, participants with presentation booths will include EMI students and other students of different engineering schools in Morocco.  Conferences and roundtables will host professors, journalists, company representatives, and some engineering students. Eight hundred guests, including professors and students, will participate in EMI’s animated dinner, hosted by some of Morocco’s prominent musical bands. Founded in 1959 by King Mohammed V, Mohammadia Engineering school is the leading engineering school in Morocco, privileged by outstanding training and research facilities. The school provides a wide range of engineering branches to its students.

Rabat – Moroccan Government Spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi expressed his satisfaction on Thursday over the briefing presented by the United Nations Personal Envoy Horst Kohler to the Security Council on Wednesday. After the Security Council meeting, President of the Security Council Karel van Oosterom made a statement about the briefing, emphasizing that members of the council have all expressed concern over the situation of the buffer zone of Guerguerat in Western Sahara. The council, according to the president, stressed the need of “maintaining the status quo, as mentioned in the report of the Secretary-General,” issued in April 2017. Oosterom also emphasized that “there should be no change in the status of the buffer zone,” a warning that has been repeatedly violated by the Polisario Front in recent months. After the weekly cabinet meeting held in Rabat on Thursday, El Khalfi commented on the statement made by Oosterom, saying that it has “refuted many allegations of enemies of the territorial integrity of the Kingdom.” El Khalfi added that this statement reaffirmed the position of the United Nations on the situation in Guerguerat and the “need to maintain the status quo.” The Moroccan official told the press that the UN Security Council will keep the Sahara Question under the United Nations auspices exclusively, explaining that Morocco will never accept any parallel discussions “likely to deflect the process of these constants.” In a meeting with a Moroccan delegation, led by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita in Lisbon, Kohler reaffirmed that it is up to the United Nations to contribute to finding a solution to end the 40 years conflict. Kohler’s statement echoed his written briefing presented to the security council members. The Security Council expressed “full support” for Kohler’s efforts, welcoming his recent bilateral meetings with the parties to the conflict, which aim to relaunch the negotiation process with a new dynamic.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – The widow of a diplomat, who died in mysterious conditions in an African country, has accused an official of the Social Work Association of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of sexual harassment.  Moroccan newspaper Assabah, in its March 23 edition, reported that the complaint has already been presented to the judicial police of Rabat. The accuser claims that the official in question sexually blackmailed her in return for the release of pensions to which she is entitled after her husband’s passing.  The article states that the public prosecutor ordered the judicial police to open a thorough investigation, after inquiring into the evidence following receiving a complaint in February.  According to the same source, the alleged harasser instructed security guards to prevent her from accessing his office and questioned the reasons behind the delay in processing her file.  Assabah added that the plaintiff wrote to the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to further her case. The hearing took place in the absence of the accused official, although he has been summoned twice. The publication suggested he may be summoned by the public prosecutor by force.  The source also maintains that officials of the same ministry have attempted to pressure the complainant into abandoning her accusations.  Chapter 1-503 of the Moroccan Criminal Code states that whoever exploits the power conferred upon him by his functions to commit, threaten, or coerce others for sexual ends, shall be punished with one to two years imprisonment, and a fine of MAD 5,000-50,000.

Rabat – Morocco is reinforcing its bid to access the Economic Community of West African States through its cultural and trade links with West African countries. The application is already spreading its influence, as evidenced by  Speaker of ECOWAS Parliament Moustapha Cissé Lo’s recent reaffirmation of his support for Morocco’s application. A conference under the theme “Towards a Better Movement of People and Goods between African Countries,” convened in Rabat, with Moroccan officials includingCissé Lo and other members of ECOWAS attending, to discuss the future of Africa and the challenges hindering its development. The event, which was organized by the Moroccan parliament in partnership with ECOWAS, offered an opportunity for the ECOWAS president of parliament to discuss the key features of Morocco’s admission to the African economic union. Speaking at the event, Cissé Lo said that Morocco’s accession to ECOWAS will undoubtedly add value to the community, adding that his parliament will “fully play its role in the process of Morocco’s admission to ECOWAS.”  He added that the North African country’s accession will result in more “solidarity among the peoples of the continent.” The ECOWAS high official also called on African parliamentarians to follow in the footsteps of Morocco and “strongly support all the undertaken actions.” President of the House of Representatives Habib El Malki and Moroccan Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mounia Boucetta were also in attendance. During the symposium, Cissé Lo reviewed the ECOWAS objectives, in addition to past achievements and challenges, pointing out that it has established a plurality of legal instruments and has taken political measures to move towards the construction of this common market. The Rabat-based think tank and policy organization, Amadeus Institute, will organize a conference to discuss Morocco’s accession to ECOWAS on March 29 in Dakar. In February 2017, Morocco announced its desire to join the ECOWAS, as part of its vision to strengthen and deepen the cultural, economic, and diplomatic links uniting Morocco and the ECOWAS member countries, as well as to advocate regional integration as a vector of economic acceleration in Africa. Cissé Lo underscored the importance of the conference held in Rabat, which is in line with international and community debates to propose solutions for the challenges facing Africa. The African official also attended the international Crans Montana Forum, which took place from March 15-20 in the Moroccan southern city of Dakhla. The international forum presented Cissé Lo with an award in recognition of his work as head of the parliamentary body during an official ceremony attended by several renowned international figures at the Crans Montana Forum.

Washington D.C. – American President Donald Trump appointed on Thursday John Bolton as his new National Security Advisor in replacement of General H.R Mc Master.  The American President announced his decision on Twitter. “I am pleased to announce that, effective Am bJohn Bolton will be my new National Security Advisory. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job &amp; will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9,” Trump said. I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job &amp; will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 22, 2018    Bolton’s appointment comes nine days after the firing of now-former Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, who was also fired via Twitter. Bolton will be the third National Security Advisor in the fourteenth months since Trump was sworn in as President. With the appointment of Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State and John Bolton as National Security Adviser, many observers believe that this major shakeup will lead to the U.S withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear. Both Pompeo and Bolton are known for their hawkish positions on Iran and for their distaste for diplomacy when it comes to dealing with Iran. My official statement on accepting @POTUS‘ request to become the next National Security Advisor. pic.twitter.com/lptI5AwSeU — John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) March 23, 2018  The appointment of Bolton is also of relevance to Morocco. Bolton is known to be the only voice in the Republican party for harboring unfriendly position to Morocco with regards to the Western Sahara conflict. Bolton was in James Baker team when the former Secretary of State served as United Nations Secretary General’s Personal envoy for the Western Sahara and played a key role in the Framework Agreement plan known as Plan Baker II. The plan provided for five years for the territory’s autonomy under Morocco’s sovereignty followed by a referendum on self-determination with independence among the options envisaged. Morocco rejected the plan, arguing that it mirrored the same failed UN settlement plan of 1991. Two year earlier, Morocco had accepted the first version of the Framework Agreement, known as the Plan Baker I, but the Polisario had rejected it. Analysts contacted by Morocco World News believe that, although Western Sahara is a dispute of low intensity that does not get much attention in the White House, the appointment of Bolton as National Security Adviser might prove a big challenge for the Moroccan diplomacy in the coming years.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – The Amadeus Institute will host a conference under the theme “Morocco’s Accession to ECOWAS: Foundations, Challenges and Common Perspectives,” on March 29, in Dakar.  This conference will establish a hearing and frank and open dialogue, between the main Senegalese and Moroccan actors, on the optimal conditions for Morocco’s integration into the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).  This event will bring together government officials, parliamentarians, economic operators, and influential actors in civil society, allowing them to share common ambitions, express reciprocal expectations, and identify apprehensions and common plans to overcome the difficulties they encounter.  On one hand, the round tables will present Morocco’s perspective, the grounding for its interest in West Africa, and the different positions of Senegalese stakeholders on this accession. The two plenary sessions, which will be open to the public, will widely debate the economic, political, and diplomatic relations between Morocco and Senegal, as well as the foundations for a “win-win” reconciliation in the context of Morocco’s accession to ECOWAS.  The outcome of this conference and the proposed recommendations will be communicated to Moroccan and Senegalese decision-makers.  Following Morocco’s readmission into the African Union in January of 2017, King Mohammed VI informed Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of Liberia and Chairperson ECOWAS, of the country’s will to join the regional economic community as a full member.  During the 52nd ECOWAS Summit, Ivory Coast President Alasanne Outtara confirmed that the economic body agreed in principle on Morocco’s admission; however, an impact study of this decision is in order.  To enable ECOWAS heads of state to deliberate on the report and make certain adjustments, an extraordinary summit is expected to be held in early 2018 to deal specifically with the accession of Morocco. Senegalese businesses have expressed their concern earlier in 2017 claiming that Morocco’s admission would undermine local businesses and products. “Morocco is knocking at ECOWAS‘s door,” wrote Senegalese online media outlet Dakar-Presse, quoting a local union of businesses and labor syndicates. The article insists that this door should not be opened;otherwise it will wreak havoc on “the weak economies of the west African zone.”

Rabat – The Cherifien Office of Phosphate (OCP) launches phase II of its development plan with a MAD 75 billion investment that will capture half of the growth in demand for phosphate. The office aims to accelerate the refund for the VAT credit–MAD 20 billion at the end of 2017–to facilitate the financing of its projects, according to the Moroccan francophone business newspaper L’Économiste, March 22 edition. This second wave will be “calibrated to the growth of global demand” driven by Africa. According to the same source, this will involve optimizing Jorf Lasfar platform, second most important port in the country, as well as the integration of the planned processing unit of Laayoune. By the end of this stage, the office expects to boost fertilizer production up by 14 million tonnes reaching 26 million tonnes, compared to the current 12 million. The group displayed unusual financial health in 2017, amid stagnant prices. In fact, consolidated sales rose up to MAD 48.503 billion, with a 14 percent increase, thanks to the higher volumes of fertilizer and rock. The gross margin reached a sum of MAD 29.918 billion, a 9 percent increase that is favored by the optimization economics of industrial processes, with profits topping off at MAD 4.7 billion. L’Économiste noted that the office does not suffer from the impact of the dollar’s decline given the fact that “it realizes its turnover in dollars, and pays most of its inputs in US currency.”

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat- The Free Feminist Union, known under its French acronym (UFL), launched the first mobile application against violence based on gender and sexuality in Morocco, on March 21. The association held a press conference in order to present the various features of this new platform called “Manchoufouch”, “can we see you?” an infamous Moroccan catcalling phrase, which intends to fight against sexual violence and street harassment in the country. The application, targeted at both men and women, allows users to pinpoint where the aggression took place. The platform asks its users, whether victims or witnesses, to fill out a form containing their personal information, as well as those of the aggressors and details of the assault such as the location, date, and type of aggression. They can then request assistance from the UFL via the “ask for help” button, which will systematically intervene by informing the authorities. UFL president, Nidal Al Azhari, said in a statement to the Moroccan electronic newspaper Hespress, “You can report the incident either through the application, available on Google Play Store, or the website.” She added, “Our team will then intervene by transferring the cases to associations and NGOs, and facilitating legal and psychological help.” The Moroccan government recently passed law 103-13 on combating violence against women. However, this much-awaited law has been deemed insufficient by Moroccan and international NGOs, given its failure to provide effective solutions and help for the victims.

Rabat – In a written briefing presented to the United Nations Security Council, Personal Envoy Horst Kohler emphasized that only the UN has the legitimacy “to lead the political process” to reach a consensual solution in the Western Sahara conflict. In paragraph 12 of the first section of the briefing presented to the Security Council, Kohler reaffirmed the UN commitment to keep the Western Sahara settlement process under the auspices of the United Nations, according to Le360. The UN official echoed a promise he made in a meeting held with the Moroccan delegation on March 6 in Lisbon. During the meeting, Kohler reiterated his intention to “limit the Sahara issue exclusively to the United Nations.” In recent months, the Personal Envoy held meetings with international parties, involving them in the conflict. In January, Kohler held talks with AU Commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat in Addis Ababa about the conflict. The UNSG Envoy also met with Rwanda’s President, Paul Kagame, who is also the President of the African Union. Kohler’s meetings with the African leaders came after his official meeting with the EU’s High Representative Federica Mogherini, on January 9, in Brussels. On March 17, Kohler also met with Swedish Social Democratic politician Margot Elisabeth Wallstrom to discuss the Western Sahara conflict. Moroccan diplomacy has repeatedly emphasizing that the UN is the only body that has the right to lead the settlement process. To reaffirm his promise before the Moroccan delegation, Kohler mentioned the security council 2351 Resolution in his report, noting that “it is up to the UN to lead the political process” to find a solution to the four-decade-long conflict. He added that all of the African Union’s officials–Paul Kagame, Moussa Faki Mahamat and the European Union High Representative Federica Mogherini–have “without exception expressed support for my efforts to help find a solution to the conflict.” In paragraph 15 of the first of the report, Kohler pointed out that his role in the conflict is not that of a referee, but rather is to assist parties to negotiate a “political solution” to end the conflict. Horst Kohler stressed the resumption of negotiations “on the basis of realism and the spirit of compromise.”  “I expect the parties to be realistic and willing to compromise,” he said. The UNSG personal envoy made no comments on the ruling of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) regarding the EU-Morocco Fisheries Agreement, issued on February 27, as the issue has relevance to the UN-led political process. On Wednesday, the Security Council expressed “full support” for Kohler’s efforts, welcoming his recent bilateral meetings with the parties to the conflict, which aim to relaunch the negotiation process with a new dynamic.

Rabat- Bank Al-Maghrib, Morocco’s central bank, has outsourced the service of centralization of irregular checks (SCCI) to Creditinfo Checks, an information center with an online database that provides information on irregular checks to companies and merchants in Morocco.  Creditinfo Checks is a subsidiary of the Creditinfo Group, a leading service provider for credit information and risk management solutions worldwide that has been operating in Morocco since 2016, after acquiring the credit bureau operation in Morocco from Experian.  Headquartered in Casa­blanca, the group holds, protects, and manages data that helps financial organizations to use accurate information to offer credit. Its credit reporting system also prevents over-indebtedness, as well as the risk of unpaid debts. Its subsidiary, Creditinfo Checks, which will be operational by the end of 2018, will create a data-sharing information network accessible only to commercial companies–not banking institutions–to inquire about checks presented to them. This service was previously only provided by Bank Al-Maghrib, with no possibility of online consultation.  In concrete terms, any company that receives a check  for a good, product, or service will have the opportunity through the service consultation to verify if the check is issued on a closed account or if it is the  object of a declaration of loss, theft, fraudulent use, or falsification . Abdellatif Jouhari, the Governor of Bank Al-Maghrib, told Media24 during the press briefing that followed the council meeting of Bank Al-Maghrib on March 20, that the platform will serve as a “decision support tool” to prevent payment incidents. “Before accepting a check, the merchant can inquire about its regularity, to see if it is the subject of a declaration of theft, loss, or scam,” Jouhari explained. Bank Al-Maghrib seeks, through this action, to give the bank check more credibility and to encourage its use among economic actors.  According to central bank figures, more than 2.7 million complaints related to check issues were filed in 2016, totaling an amount of MAD 72.5 billion, while more than 598,000 individuals are banned from using checks in Morocco. This contracting-out comes as part of the implementation of Bank’s Al-Maghrib’s strategic 2016-2018 plan for the development of the debtors’ information sharing system. It also serves as a step toward the Creditinfo Group’s desire to expand the range of its services in Morocco.

Despite the injunctions and warning of the ational Telecommunications Regulatory Agency (ANRT), Maroc Telecom still allegedly did not comply with the regulatory instructions and refused to share its telecom infrastructure. Abdellatif Ouahbi, Inwi’s lawyer told le360, that the case is now being presented before court, on the basis of unfair competition. Inwi denounces Maroc Telecom’s de facto monopoly on infrastructure inherited from the state, which should be distributed according to the regulations in force. Inwi claims MAD 5.7 billion in damages and interest, explained the company’s lawyer. The current competing operators, Orange and Inwi, have tried to get in touch with Maroc Telecom several times, through a variety of methods. The latter has treated the calls with indifference. Previously in 2016, Inwi alerted the ANRT of Maroc Telecom’s refusal to share telecommunications infrastructure and put in place a competitive unbundling offer, which resulted in  the agency to hand down injunctions and warnings to the incumbent. The current telecommunications monopoly prevents Moroccan consumers from freely choosing their access provider, which forces them to accept the dominant option, even if the services are not as promised.

Rabat- After three months of being held in custody, the 17-year-old face of Palestinian resistance in the occupied West Bank, Ahed Tamimi, has accepted a plea deal for eight months in prison along with nearly USD 1,500 fine, her lawyer Gaby Lasky, said. After a video showing Ahed striking and kicking Israeli soldiers went viral, a group of Israeli Military forces barged into Tamimi’s household in the village of Nabi Saleh at 4 a.m. on December 19, 2017. She has remained in police custody since the incident, after receiving 12 charges, including “assault” and “incitement.”  According to Lasky, Tamimi had agreed to plead guilty to four of the 12 charges she faced, including assault, incitement, and two counts of obstructing soldiers.   Tamimi’s lawyer added that she will pay a fine of 5,000 shekels, almost USD 1,500 and accept an additional eight-month jail term, expecting her to be released this summer as the sentence includes the time served.  The Israeli army said in a statement after the sentence that it “will continue operating in order to preserve the security and public order in (the West Bank) and enforce the law as it pertains to anyone who harms soldiers and incites violence.”  The teen’s trial occurred behind closed doors at the Ofer military court in the occupied West Bank on February 13. An appeal by Ahed Tamimi’s attorney to have the teenage activist’s trial opened to the public has been denied by an Israeli military judge. According to the Times of Israel, Judge Gilad Peretz wrote that “he did not feel that he had the authority to overrule the court’s original decision on February 13,” adding the judge’s opinion on holding the teenage activist’s trial behind closed doors “is in the best interest of the minor.”  Tamimi’s case has garnered international attention as she quickly became an iconic symbol of Palestinian resistance, with the video of the incident reaching thousands of users on various social media platforms.

Rabat – In an interview that aired sports TV channel beIN Sports, former Spanish  footballer Raul Gonzalez Blanco said that Morocco will definitely try to surprise its opponents during the 2018 World Cup. “Morocco is in the same group as Spain, and I am very happy for the Moroccan team. We have many Madridistas fans in Morocco (fans of Real Madrid),” said Raul. Commenting on the Moroccan football team, Raul said that the 2018 World Cup is “a huge opportunity for them because the Moroccan footballers have great skill,” adding that beating Morocco will be difficult for Spain and the other teams of the “deadly group” (Group B). Raul said that Spain and Portugal are the teams he thinks will make it to the next phase of the tournament. “However, no one knows” what is going to happen because “ I am sure that Morocco will attempt to surprise Spain and Portugal.” He added that he predicts the Atlas Lions will beat Iran. Gonzalez is one of the most legendary footballers in the history of the Spanish giant, Real Madrid. He spent nearly 16 years playing for Real Madrid, after which the former captain of Los Blancos (Real Madrid) decided to devote himself to coaching  Real Madrid’s Juvenil B youth team, according to Spanish sports outlet Marca. When the tournament begins on June 14, the Atlas Lions will first battle Iran on June 15. The team’s second game on June 20 is against Portugal, while the final first-round match for Morocco will be against Spain on June 25.

Rabat- Swedish Ambassador to Morocco Erika Ferrer has categorically denied false Polisario allegations claiming that the Swedish parliament will hold a session devoted to the situation in Western Sahara on Thursday, at the request of Swedish parliamentarians. Responding to allegations, which spread on separatist-affiliated media, the ambassador said, “There will be no session devoted to the situation in the Sahara or around its resources at the Swedish Parliament.” Morocco World News contacted the Sweden Embassy to Morocco to verify Ferrer’s statements and offer her an opportunity to respond. However, the Swedish diplomat chose not to comment. Manipulation by Polisario sponsors, including Algeria, alleged that the Swedish Parliament would hold a session to discuss the situation in the Sahara and resources in the region, according to Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum. The allegations came only a week after a meeting between the Personal Envoy of the United Nations, Horst Kohler, and Swedish Social Democratic politician Margot Elisabeth on March 17, to discuss the Western Sahara conflict. In a tweet, Wallstrom wrote,“Important meeting with Horst Köhler, envoy on MINURSO and Western Sahara.” The Swedish official added that their meeting focused “on how to move the UN process forward towards a just and mutually acceptable political solution. Guaranteeing the rights of the people of W.Sahara.” She has also expressed her full support for the Personal Envoy and UN efforts.

After the meeting, Dutch Ambassador to the UN Karel van Oosterom warned the separatist front that “there should be no change in the status of the buffer zone,” a warning that has been repeatedly violated by the Polisario Front in recent months. The council expressed “full support” for Kohler’s efforts, welcoming his recent bilateral meetings with the parties to the conflict, which aim to relaunch the negotiation process with a new dynamic.

Rabat – Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) arrived in the US on Monday for his first trip since being named crown prince and heir apparent in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  The 32-year-old crown prince has an ambitious agenda to modernize the Saudi kingdom and reshape the Middle East just as numerous factors are conspiring to disrupt a decades-long order. The crown prince’s photo op session in the Oval Office with President Trump on Tuesday featured smiles and a president keen to brag about US defense contractors who make “the best equipment in the world.” The president immersed the crown prince in his world of superlatives that he relishes unashamedly: “[a] great friendship, the great relationship…probably the strongest it’s ever been.” The superlatives may put the crown prince in the right mood for the next leg of his American tour which includes the two most populous states, California and Texas, also the two largest state economies in the United States. Oil prices are not where the Saudis would prefer them as the kingdom undertakes a massive and expensive restructuring of both the economy and civil society. But there’s no time like the present. Perhaps MBS will harness some of President Trump’s oratorical abilities to sell American companies and investors on the opportunities that exist in Saudi Arabia. Think big, be big. In some ways California and Texas signify everything that Saudi Arabia wants to be in the future. California, the Golden State with the world’s sixth largest economy, excels at everything from agriculture to technology to renewable energy. Texas, with an economy just slightly smaller than that of Brazil, is home to what MBS possibly envisions for the kingdom: a petroleum economy that has evolved into a dynamic incubator for other business sectors like medical technology and research, global finance, and transportation. MBS will meet with leaders from technology industry giants like Google and Apple when he visits Silicon Valley near the Bay Area. It has been reported recently that the Saudi state oil company, Aramco, has been in talks with Google’s parent company, Alphabet, to create data centers in the kingdom. As oil drilling becomes a high-tech endeavor and as new technologies allow oil fields to be more productive for longer periods of time the need for big data will increase. As part of the Vision 2030 reform plan for the kingdom, the promotion of culture and entertainment will now be a priority. Half of Saudi Arabia’s 33 million citizens are under 25; as the Vision 2030 plan notes, “…the cultural and entertainment opportunities currently available do not reflect the rising aspirations of our citizens and residents…” The crown prince likely will meet executives from the entertainment industry as he envisions Saudi Arabia becoming an exotic tourist destination and a location for film/TV production. The Saudi government recently announced plans to issue tourist visas beginning next month. While the Hajj attracts nearly 2 million followers each year, demystifying Saudi Arabia is critically important in order to genuinely sell the kingdom as a long-term investment destination and a place worth visiting. The oil era is not yet ending. But it is coming eventually. It’s another motivating factor for Saudi leaders to look beyond oil. In the meantime, a revolution has been unfolding for several years which has eroded the unique power of OPEC to set prices unchecked. Sedimentary rocks across North America hold solid organic compounds called kerogen that can be converted to shale oil, a substitute for crude oil. The shale oil boom has radically transformed the fossil fuel industry. Almost fifty years after the previous peak in oil production in the US, oil production reached 10 million barrels per day in the US late last year, a first since 1970. The International Energy Agency said last month that US production of hydrocarbon products (petroleum oil, shale or natural gas liquids) could reach 17 million barrels a day by 2023. Back in June 2014, before the shale oil boom, oil briefly reached $112 per barrel. The challenge for oil producers who rely on oil exports to fund government operations is to now diversify the economy. Nations are sensitive to oil price spikes and are actively looking for ways to avoid them. Morocco, for instance, has embarked on a strategy that will likely see domestic renewable energy sources account for forty percent of power generation by 2020. The crown prince is fortunate, on one level, to have a friend in the White House whose priority commitment is to fossil fuels more than to the warm embrace of renewable energy. As a candidate, Trump vowed to end the “war on coal.” There’s little connection between coal country and oil-rich Saudi Arabia but the embrace of fossil fuels by the Trump Administration will be comforting to the Saudis as they embark on the challenging endeavor to retool their economy. Additionally, youth unemployment is high in the kingdom—30 percent or higher. As the crown prince rebuilds Saudi Arabia for the digital age, young Saudis rightfully expect a future where professional and personal dreams lead to actual employment opportunities. Aramco owns the largest oil refinery in the US, located at Port Arthur, Texas. The economies of the two nations are becoming more tightly linked, from oil refining to treasury debt, industrial investment to global finance. How the crown prince juggles the numerous current internal and external challenges facing the kingdom will say a lot about how close the two nations will remain once the oil era really comes to an end.

Rabat- On Saturday, March 24, the world will go dark as millions of people around the world switch off their lights for Earth Hour at 8:30 p.m. local time. Earth Hour is a worldwide campaign to raise awareness about global warming, organised by the World Wildlife Fund and the advertising agency Leo Burnett. The event first began in Australia in 2007 when millions of people turned off non-essential lights for one hour.  In the years that followed, thousands of cities and towns across the world, including major landmarks, started running similar operations by switching off their lights as a sign of concern for the environment. Morocco is also taking part in this international event, which saw the participation of 187 countries in 2017.  Morocco’s participation comes under the banner of “We are Mobilizing for Water.” Morocco’s famous landmark, Hassan II Mosque of Casablanca, will be one of nearly  thousands of landmarks across the globe that will turn off non-essential lights between 20:30 and 21:30, in solidarity with the knowledge of  “the importance of greenhouse gas emissions issue and therefore the importance of energy savings for the protection of our environment” explained Mohammed Barkaoui, secretary general of the Hassan II Mosque Foundation of Casablanca, in a statement. Across the world, monuments including the Empire State Building in New York, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and the Kremlin in Moscow will also take part in the event.  Earth Hour is a global WWF, formerly known as World Wildlife Fund, climate change initiative, which calls for everyone to stand up and take responsibility towards a sustainable future.

Rabat- Chairman of Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid committee Moulay Hafid Elalamy will tour Europe to promote the Moroccan World Cup bid with President of Royal Football Federation Fouzi Lekjaa and former athlete Hicham El Guerrouj. The delegation will pay official visits to several European countries to introduce the Moroccan bid. The delegation is also set to travel to Malaysia.

On Wednesday, former French president Francois Hollande, also expressed his full support to Morocco’s bid, noting that France will be on Morocco’s side. The official described Morocco’s file as the “best bid” for hosting the tournament.

Rabat – The United Nations Security Council has expressed its concerns over the situation in the buffer zone of Guerguerat, which has witnessed a series of illegal operations carried out by the militias of the Polisario Front. After the meeting between UN officials, including the UN Personal Envoy Horst Kohler and Head of MINURSO Colin Stewart,  Dutch ambassador to the UN Karel van Oosterom said that that “the members of the Security Council expressed their concern out the situation in Guerguerat,” emphasizing the importance of “maintaining the status quo, as mentioned in the report of the Secretary-General,” issued in April 2017. Oosterom added that “there should be no change in the status of the buffer zone,” a warning that has been repeatedly violated by the Polisario Front in recent months. The UN official stressed that the Security Council has also underscored the need for the “full implementation of resolution 2351,” which calls upon parties to resume negotiations and work together to find a solution to the conflict, while reaffirming concerns about the violations of existing agreements, including the 1991 ceasefire deal. The resolution also welcomed “the recent steps and initiatives taken by Morocco, and the role played by the National Council on Human Rights Commissions operating in Dakhla and Laayoune, and Morocco’s interaction with Special Procedures of the United Nations Human Rights Council.” In his April report, the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres urged the Polisario Front to exercise the immediate withdrawal from the Guerguerat buffer zone. Guterres also said that he “remains deeply concerned about the continued presence of armed elements of the Polisario Front in this region and about the challenges this poses to the raison d’être of this buffer zone,” while also acknowledging that this situation could “lead to the collapse of the ceasefire” and erupt with a “dangerous impact” on the security and stability of the entire region. The separatist group has been staging illegal maneuvers in the Western Sahara buffer zones for several months, despite the continuous warning issued by the UN Secretary-General. Their provocative actions are ongoing, with the separatist group announcing recently that it will relocate the headquarters of its “defense ministry” to the buffer zone Bir Lahlou. During their Wednesday briefing, the council expressed “full support” for Kohler’s efforts, welcoming his recent bilateral meetings with the parties to the conflict, which aim to relaunch the negotiation process with a new dynamic. The Dutch ambassador to the UN said that the council members “have stressed the importance of maintaining a constructive commitment in order to advance the political process.” Kohler agreed, saying that he had “a very encouraging meeting with the members of the Council.” Commenting on the briefing, French ambassador to the UN François Delattre told reporters that the Council held “very good consultations” on the Sahara issue.

Rabat – The struggle for women’s right is still a contentious topic in many predominantly Muslim societies, with a prevailing patriarchal culture that gives more rights and social recognition to its male members. It is in a bid to challenge some remnants of patriarchy in Morocco’s family law that a group of Moroccan public personalities, including university professors, lawyers, theologians, doctors, journalists, writers, and many other professions, has initiated a petition in order to challenge the ta’sib rule, an inheritance law that favors men over women. The group of signatories is demanding that women be put on an equal legal footing as men when it comes to inheritance rights. Fifteen of the undersigned are the authors L’héritage des femmes (Women’s inheritance), a recent joint academic publication that explains the authors’ pro-women’s rights stance, and where they argued that the ta’sib tradition should no longer be applicable to a changing Moroccan society. The tradition that says that males should prevail when it comes to inheritance is no longer a valid reflection of Morocco as a society, they said. “Ta’sib does not correspond to the functioning of Moroccan families in the current social context,” the group wrote in their petition, further explaining that the tradition is simply the result of patriarchal interpretations of the Holy Scriptures, rather than a divine precept. In Moroccan families, women play a crucial role, with some taking full responsibility of children’s education and others providing considerable financial and other kinds of supports to their husbands, they further said in the text that accompanied the petition. Citing official figures of recent studies, the text said that one out of five Moroccan families are at the full charge of women who are not helped in any way by their ‘distant male relatives.’ “Why maintain a law that has no social justification and no Quaranic foundations?” the text asked, adding that, as things now stand in Moroccan families, “it is unfair” to continue endorsing women’s suffering and exploitation for the benefit of their male siblings or ‘distant relations’ “For all these reasons,” concludes the text,  alluding to all the figures the signatories provided in favor of their undertaking, “we, the undersigned, are calling for the abrogation of the ta’sib inheritance law, just as has recently been done by some other Muslim societies.”

Kigali  – Morocco signed an agreement that will launch the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) at the Extraordinary Summit of the African Union (AU) held in Kigali. The agreement was signed by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, who leads the Moroccan delegation to the AU Summit. Speaking at the opening of the summit, AU Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat urged African heads of state and government to sign this landmark agreement. “The moment is no longer one for hesitation, so I call on all states to sign and ratify without delay the agreement on the African Continental Free Trade Area,” he said, noting that AUC is to see this agreement come into force before the end of the year. “In view of its repercussions on the entire African continent, economic integration thus responds not only to an aspiration born of Pan-Africanism, but also to a practical imperative linked to the economic viability of the continent,” said Moussa Faki Mahamat. The signing of this agreement represents a major step forward and another milestone for African integration and unity. The Free Trade Area will result in the establishment of a market of over 1.2 billion people, with a combined gross product of over USD 3 trillion. It will also boost intra-African trade by 52 percent by 2022, paving the way for the establishment of a customs union within four years and an African economic community in 2028.  The AfCFTA is a flagship project of Agenda 2063, the African Union’s long-term vision for an integrated, prosperous, and peaceful Africa.

Rabat –#LetTheirVehiclesRust, #Manechriche (I will not buy), #Boycottez: these are some of the hashtags that have been circulating on social media since Algeria’s Ministry of Industry and Mines recently released the factory exit prices of vehicles assembled in Algeria, which have been deemed too expensive compared to imported cars.  To reduce its imports bills, Algeria has set up in-country car assembly plants since 2012,  paving the way for foreign investments through automotive giants such as Volkswagen and Renault. And yet, Algeria currently finds itself in a dire financial crisis caused by the state collapse in oil prices and the emptying of its foreign exchange reserves.  Three years after the opening of car assembly plants, vehicle prices skyrocketed in the North African state, as imports of auto parts continued to rise. In some cases, locally produced vehicles have increased in price from 50-90 percent higher than those of imported cars. According to ministry data, the factory exit price of Dacia Logan (Renault) in Russia was valued at  610,000 dinars, with an estimated selling price of 710,000 dinars. Meanwhile, its imported counterpart in Algeria, is estimated at DZD 1.14 million. The price of Hyundai i10 made in Algeria is roughly EUR 2,000 more expensive than the price of the same small car in France. The publication stirred a general uproar among Algerians, who quickly took to their accounts on social media, calling for a boycott of vehicles “made in Algeria.” They denounced a “disguised import,” and lambasted car dealers over their high-profit margin.  Algeria’s Minister of Industry and Mines Youcef Yousfi said during a press conference held on March 17, that “car dealers now know they can no longer set prices as they see fit,” adding that the Algerian state “will keep an eye on the prices of vehicles mounted locally.” “We have asked all the local manufacturers to give us the prices–these prices will be displayed, and the State will ensure that the prices of locally produced vehicles are not higher than those imported,” the minister said.  He added that at the same time, it is not the government’s responsibility to set prices for locally manufactured vehicles. However, they must not exceed the applied tariffs to imported vehicles. In response to the Algerian car industry’s proven inefficiency, several Algerian officials, such as the former Minister of Industry Mahdjoub Bedda, previously promised to “put an end to the current [assembly-based] production model.”

Rabat – Following the Rwanda signing of the pact that will establish free trade area, King Mohammed VI expressed his pride in the deal, which is a “defining moment in history.” In a speech addressed at an AU free trade summit, King Mohammed VI described the signing of the free trade area as a “landmark event” that confirms Africa’s determination to build a continent “for the future.” Commending the benefit of the free trade area, the King said that this would help fulfill the desire and ambition of the continent’s youth “to build a strong and integrated Africa.” Africa is on the Move Africa is the home of all the natural resources required for sustainable development, which makes it a leader “at all levels and in all sectors,” according to the King. “It abounds in natural resources and its human potential is immense. This is something I noticed clearly during my numerous visits to various parts of our Continent.” The King also addressed the importance of unity and the ambition for Africa. Subsequently, the monarch recalled to the summit participants Morocco’s historic return to the African Union after 33 years of absence. He said that Morocco’s return to the AU is a strong sign “not only of my country’s desire for unity, but also of its unwavering commitment to cohesion, concord, territorial integrity, and African solidarity.” Speaking about the Free Trade Area, the King said that the launching of this pact will “expand and build on the countless measures taken by our respective countries to promote intra-African trade.” According to the King, the initiative will enhance investment and develop economic growth. It will also help the interconnectivity in the continent. “This is a pragmatic step towards an integrated, prosperous Africa which is attuned to international realities,” added the sovereign. King Mohammed VI also underscored the necessity of co-development that form the foundation of “intra-African cooperation, economic complementarity, active solidarity and the pooling of resources and efforts.” According to the King, the objective of this strategy is to “transform Africa into a dynamic force and to make it a major player on the international scene for the benefit of our populations.” This achievement also confirms the desire of all the states involved to work together to open up and expand markets, “while making sure the particularities of domestic economies are respected, especially the protection of infant industries and the economic activities involving vulnerable populations.” Africa Must Embrace Technology The Moroccan King called on the African leaders to “build on technological development the world has witnessed.” He added that digital technology is “changing the face of” Africa. “We owe this digital quantum leap to young startups operating in the fields of finance, telecommunications, industry, and agribusiness, to name but a few. Often, those behind this innovative process are young people from low-income segments of the population. Our young people ought to, therefore, take center stage in our public policies.”

Rabat – The European Commission introduced a proposal for the renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco, with a mandate for the inclusion of the Sahara. In a statement carried by Maghreb Arab Press, the commission said that the goal of this proposal is to maintain and develop the fisheries partnership between the EU and Morocco, “by concluding an agreement and protocol that are environmentally sustainable, economically, profitable and fully in line with international and EU law.” The statement came in response to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling that the fisheries agreement between the EU and Morocco is only valid as long as it is not “applicable to Western Sahara or its adjacent waters.” The court also warned that if the EU and Morocco were to include the Western Sahara in their agreement, this action would be against certain rules of “international law that are applicable to relations between the EU and Kingdom of Morocco.” After nearly three weeks, the European Commission stands to respond to the ruling, emphasizing that Morocco is a “close partner of the EU that benefits from the ‘advanced status’ in the context of Union’s neighborhood policy and the EU-Morocco Association Agreement.” He added that the proposed reforms agreement and protocol would reinforce monitoring, control, and surveillance and contribute to improved governance of the fisheries in the region. Morocco has already made its position clear regarding the ruling. Morocco’s Minister Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch said that Morocco will not hesitate to abandon the Fisheries Agreement if it affects the sovereignty of Morocco over its southern provinces in a recent interview with Moroccan TV channel 2M. “Morocco does not need the 40 million EUR that the European Union would pay in exchange for allowing European fishermen [to use Morocco’s waters]. There are agreements amounting to 35 billion EUR, all of which are in favor of the EU.” The continuity of the EU-Morocco fisheries deal, according to the EU Commission  “will also be beneficial for Morocco, in particular, in view of the importance of the financial contribution to be paid under the protocol as a contribution to the Moroccan “Halieutis” strategy of development of the fisheries sector, while EU operators, including artisanal vessels from several Member States, are expected to benefit from the fishing opportunities made available through the amended agreement and the renewed protocol,”  added the commission.

Rabat – A recent ranking of global touristic hubs  has just confirmed Marrakech’s standing in the group of global titans, those ‘international cities’ setting ablaze the hearts of those who visit them. In its most recent ranking of the world’s top 25 destinations, TripAdvisor ranked Marrakech as the eight best destination for travellers, putting the Moroccan city ahead of cities like Istanbul, New York, and Dubai, which were ranked ninth, tenth, and seventeenth, respectively. “The red city of Marrakech is a magical place brimming with markets, gardens, places and mosques, “said TripAdvisor in its justification of Marrakech’s standing in the ranking.”  The globally reputed ‘travel app’ recommended a number of “magical places” to visit while in Marrakech, including the city’s sinuous and romantic streets, and of course its world-class hotels and restaurants.  From the city’s vibrant Medina to the “serenity of the Majorelle Garden,” and the presence of its numerous historical mosques, Marrakech is a splendor, according to TripAdvisor. It is worth noting that Marrakech is the only African city to have made it to the top 10, with the Egyptian town Hurghada, the other African town in the top 25, ranked as 21st . If Morocco’s reputation as a touristic hub is to be maintained, then international validation is vital. And perhaps unsurprisingly, with this ranking of Marrakech in the clubs of the world’s most magical and marvellous cities, Morocco’s tourism industry can take pride in yet another morale boost, an international and credible validation of those who have visited the North African country’s many touristic destinations.

The country is determined to clinch more international votes to win the right host the massive tournament.

Your Excellency Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the African Union, Distinguished Heads of State and Government, Your Excellency, Mr. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the AU Commission, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, First of all, I should like to express my sincere thanks to our distinguished host, His Excellency Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the African Union, for his efforts to ensure this Extraordinary Summit is a success. I also wish to take this opportunity to praise the significant efforts made under his stewardship to reform our Organization and make sure it is capable of rising to current and future challenges. In this regard, I should like to tell him, once again, that he can count on the full support of the Kingdom of Morocco. I also wish to thank His Excellency Mr. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the AU Commission, for his resolve to breathe new life into the work of the Commission and to support the reform momentum within the African Union. This is a defining moment in history. The creation of the largest free trade area in the world, with the youngest population on the planet, is a landmark event which attests to our shared determination to build an Africa for the future. This initiative brings in new prospects, practices and solidarity mechanisms. A continental free trade area stimulates capacities and enhances knowledge and insight. More than anything else, however, it fulfils the desire and ambition of our young people to build a strong, integrated Africa. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, At all levels and in all sectors, Africa is on the move today. It abounds in natural resources and its human potential is immense. This is something I noticed clearly during my numerous visits to various parts of our Continent. I also realized that the emergence of a united, ambitious African community was urgently needed. In this respect, Morocco’s return to its institutional family is a strong indication not only of my country’s desire for unity, but also of its unwavering commitment to cohesion, concord, territorial integrity and African solidarity. The launching, today, of the African Continental Free Trade Area is a critical step towards the achievement of multifaceted development in Africa. AfCFTA is an initiative by Africa, for Africa. This initiative expands and builds on the countless measures taken by our respective countries to promote intra-African trade. It will boost investment, stimulate economic growth, enhance continental interconnectivity and inject fresh momentum into African integration. This is a pragmatic step towards an integrated, prosperous Africa which is attuned to international realities. The 1980 Lagos Plan of Action for the Economic Development of Africa and the 1991 Abuja Treaty established Regional Economic Communities which have served as the bedrock of African integration. Today, the path towards the actual establishment of a continental free trade area is virtually mapped out thanks to the undeniable progress achieved in this area by those Communities, some of which are already considering customs union protocols. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, In Morocco, experience has taught us that the open market economy and the establishment of free trade areas, with partners from the North and the South alike, often give rise to legitimate concerns and create certain challenges which must be tackled through appropriate mechanisms. Once those concerns and challenges are addressed, it becomes clear that economic openness has many benefits and translates into gains for the national economy, contributing to the emergence of new value chains. To impede such a dynamic, at continental level, would delay Africa’s rise and hamper its competitiveness and development. In this respect, Morocco believes in a kind of co-development which is based on intra-African cooperation, economic complementarity, active solidarity and the pooling of resources and efforts. These are prerequisites for any inclusive growth and for sustainable human development on the Continent. The goal, ultimately, is to transform Africa into a dynamic force and to make it a major player on the international scene for the benefit of our populations. To promote progress in Africa and boost intra-African trade, we need to build on the technological development the world has witnessed and to turn our intra-African trade deficit into opportunities for the development of new digital technologies. Africa is on its way to becoming a global digital laboratory. Spurred on by young people’s ingenuity, creativity and audacity, digital technology is changing the face of our Continent. We owe this digital quantum leap to young startups operating in the fields of finance, telecommunications, industry and agribusiness, to name but a few. Often, those behind this innovative process are young people from low-income segments of the population. Our young people ought, therefore, to take center stage in our public policies. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, We are gathered here to shape our Continent’s economic and commercial future. Today, more than ever, we need to make sure African markets are sustainably interconnected. The African Continental Free Trade Area is a key instrument for the promotion of this new economic development paradigm centered on innovation, diversification and exchange rooted in solidarity. Africa must come together with a view to achieving the ultimate goal of building a prosperous African economy based on inclusive growth and sustainable development – an economy that supports and stimulates entrepreneurship and the creation of wealth. It was precisely because we sought to respond to those legitimate aspirations that it was possible, through various rounds of negotiation, to develop the appropriate legal framework – namely the African Continental Free Trade Area. I should like, in this regard, to commend His Excellency Mr. Issoufou Mahamadou, President of the Republic of Niger, on his determined action, leadership and catalytic role in the negotiation process. This will contribute to the efficient implementation of the free trade area. The upcoming free trade area is no longer a fantasy or a mere project: the results achieved were arrived at in a spirit of compromise; not only are they balanced, but they also reflect the expectations and concerns of all parties. Thanks to the enthusiasm and dynamism which characterized the rounds of negotiation, we have been able to consider free trade in 90 per cent of goods. Through this initial tangible achievement, all the States involved are showing their desire to work towards an opening up and expansion of markets, while making sure the particularities of domestic economies are respected, especially the protection of infant industries and the economic activities involving vulnerable populations. We need to build on that same spirit when conducting future negotiations on equally important issues, such as those relating to fair competition, compliance with intellectual property rules and the promotion of investment. Only then would we give Africa a voice in trade issues. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, We are in the process of shaping tomorrow’s Africa – the one we shall bequeath to our children. We are building it on solid economic foundations in the hope that our Continent’s tremendous resources may benefit African peoples, first and foremost. To shape the Africa of the future – one that takes back its destiny into its own hands – we have had to go through countless stages and, to be sure, many others still lie ahead. We must see the whole process through in order to make sure that our economic development no longer hinges, in any way, on external players or considerations. Thank you.

Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – The International Finance Corporation (IFC) plans to expand infrastructure investment in Morocco and Tunisia to “cut spending to reign in budget deficits.” According to the global information and technology company Bloomberg, Morocco and Tunisia will be the primary beneficiaries of an investment of USD 373 million. Sergio Pimenta, vice president of the Washington-based lender for the Middle East in Africa, told Bloomberg that the IFC is helping the two North African governments develop private-public partnerships to help finance infrastructure projects. The financial body will also finance small and medium enterprises in the two countries, in order to help create jobs as part of a broader plan to bring investments alleviating youth unemployment crisis in the two countries. “While Morocco’s economic prospects are more favorable than Tunisia’s, neither country can afford to invest heavily in infrastructure,” declared Pimenta. According to the same source, Morocco is in a favourable position compared to Tunisia. While Tunisia has been downgraded in terms of credit rating, fiscal situation, and reserves, Morocco’s economy continues to be one of the Arab world’s best-performing, thanks to the relative stability it has enjoyed since the events of the 2011 Arab Spring. “Authorities this year successfully introduced wider fluctuation bands for the dirham, winning praise from the IMF and international investors. Economic growth is expected to rise 4.5 percent in the medium term,” explained Bloomberg. Pimenta concluded that Morocco’s flexible economy makes it more competitive. However, he maintained that the country is in need of additional measures to boost growth, such as investing in education, and facilitating smaller companies’ access to finance. The IFC is considered the World’s Bank’s sector arm and the largest global development institution focusing exclusively on the private sector in developing countries.

Rabat- Responding to a series of tweets by the head of Saudi Arabia’s General Sports Authority Turki Al-Sheikh, member of the Qatari royal family Maryam Al-Thani reaffirmed Qatar’s support of Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. Recently, Al-Sheikh, who is also the advisor to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been posting controversial tweets about his country’s position on the ongoing 2026 World Cup race between Morocco and the three-nation North American bid. Morocco’s neutrality in the Gulf crisis between the Saudi Arabia coalition and Qatar incensed the Saudi official. Morocco has been offering to mediate a solution between the Gulf countries, reaffirming its neutrality to avoid escalation between the countries. However, the Saudi official refuses to accept Morocco’s stance and has been tweeting provocative posts regarding Morocco’s World Cup Bid. In a recent tweet, Al-Sheikh wrote, “Some people went astray. If you want support, you should seek it in Riyadh. What you are doing is wasting your time. Now ask the pseudo-state to help you,” referring to Qatar. In response to Al-Sheikh’s tweets, Al-Thani wrote in a Facebook comment that Qatar will support Morocco, adding that Turki Al-Sheikh is not a prince, but rather, “he is close to the leader more than other princes.” Maryam Al-Thani, who is the half-sister of Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, added that Al-Sheikh’s comment demonstrates that Saudi Arabia’s policy is based on “extortion: meaning help us block Qatar and we will support you.” In a recent tweet Al-Sheikh wrote that none of the bidders who submitted their files to host the 2026 World Cup requested Saudi Arabia’s support, but, “If someone ever asks, we will look for Saudi Arabia’s interests first,” implying that his country might support the United bid. In response to his remarks, Maryam said that her country will support Morocco’s bid unconditionally. Last November, Qatar officially expressed its intention to support Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Hassan Al Thawadi, secretary general of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC) of Qatar, said that“[Qatar] will support Morocco’s bid and will extend any support if needed.” Morocco submitted its bid book to FIFA on Thursday, March 15. After the submission, the bid committee said that the country will present a “record with undeniable qualities and proposes to organize a successful, responsible, and profitable World Cup with an important legacy for the country, the continent,” and for the world. The country’s bid has already received support from Qatar and several African nations, including Botswana, Algeria, Tunisia, and Nigeria. The country is determined to clinch more international votes to win the right to host the massive tournament.

Rabat – Morocco’s State Secretary for Water, Charafat Afilal, underlined on Tuesday in Brasilia the need to highlight the alarming situation of water in Africa, noting that water-related issues should be a primary concern for the international community. “The kingdom of Morocco believes that this edition of the World Water Forum should be an opportunity to highlight the alarming situation of water in Africa,” Afilal said at a ministerial conference held as part of the 8th World Water Forum, which opened on Monday in Brasilia. In this regard, the “Water for Africa” (WfA) initiative launched by Morocco at the 22nd Conference of the Parties of the UNFCC (COP 22) held in Marrakech should serve as a framework to support the continent in its efforts to address water-related issues, she pointed out. Afilal also underlined, in an address on behalf of Morocco, the need for international solidarity with Africa, noting that the Kingdom will spare no effort to ensure that water-related issues remain a primary concern. “Since the COP22 held in Marrakech, water has become a key topic of the global climate action agenda,” she pointed out, adding that Morocco will make every effort to fulfil its commitments in the field of water. The meeting was attended by several African senior officials and representatives of internationals NGOs. The World Water Forum is held from the 18th – 23rd March 2018 under the theme of “Sharing Water”. The forum was marked by the awarding of the 6th King Hassan II Great World Water Prize to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Founded by the World Water Council, the World Water Forum represents an international meeting point to discuss water-related problems and find solutions for the world’s most pressing water issues.

Rabat – So far, so familiar: There is a genuine sense of daily jeopardy and humiliations in being a sub-Saharan migrant in Algeria, say reporters and international observers. Algeria is accelerating its massive expulsions of sub-Saharan migrants in the desserts in its southern borders, reports the French outlet Le Monde Afrique. In the course of a few weeks, Algerian authorities have allegedly ‘removed’ hundred of sub-Saharan migrants from the North African country’s territory. Indiscriminately arrested in several cities around the country, migrants are said to be sent to squalid refugee camps before subsequently being sent to deserts in the country’s borders with Niger and Mali. In the first two weeks of February alone, Algeria reportedly deported over 500 sub-Saharans. While Algerian and Niger signed an agreement that said that Algeria should not hesitate to deport Nigerien illegal migrants, recent deportations to Niger are said to have been done in the most indiscriminate of manners, with Guineans, Malians and other nationalities being deported to Niger. These massive expulsions of other nationalities towards Niger did not however sit well with Nigerien authorities, who have asked their Algerian counterparts to stop the practice. “We have held long discussions with Algerian authorities, and we told them to no longer send us migrants from Guinea, Mali, and other countries,” Nigerien minister of interior has been quoted by Le Monde as saying. In the meantime, Algeria has shifted its deportations towards Mali, where sub-Saharan migrants, again regardless of their countries of origins, are currently being forcibly taken to. Between March 6 and 7 a group of 125 sub-Saharan migrants were forcibly deported to the Malian town of Gao, saysLe Monde. And according to a press release by Human Rights Watch (HWR) cited by Le Monde, these migrants were transported to the desert on Algeria-Malia borders where they spent six hours working in the desert before finally reaching Gao. HRW also said in its press release that the migrants were attacked in the desert by militia groups. “Algeria throws us in the desert at the mercy of terrorist groups,” said one of the deported migrants. The International Organization for Migration (IOM), for its part, has revealed that on March 15, the organization helped 369 migrants escape the horror of militias in the borders between Niger and Algeria. The migrants were essentially from Niger, Guinea and Mali, IOM said, adding that “they were angry, afraid, and traumatized.” On March 13, sub-Saharan migrants (but mostly Malians) stoned Algeria’s embassy in Bamako, Mali’s capital city. Bassourou Coulibaly, a 27-year old Malian who was in the last group of forcibly deported sub-Saharans, told the press that although he did not participate in the stoning of the Algerian embassy in bamako, he understands the reasons that drove his fellow migrants to resort to such a desperate move. “In our group, only three of us did not take part in the embassy incident,” Coulibaly said. He however explained that he too is angry with Algerian authorities. “I had a contract and was working as an electrician. But I was patrolled one day while going to work. I was denied the right to even take some of my belongings with me,” he said. “What else can you expect when you deny people their most basic rights?” Coulibaly asked, concluding that Malian and Algerian authorities should find ways of accommodating migrants because “when a group of angry and stigmatized youth decides to act and reclaim its dignity, it is very difficult to stop them.”

Rabat- King Mohammed VI offered an official dinner in honor of Former French President François Hollande, chaired by Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan, on Tuesday in Rabat.  The former president paid a visit to Morocco following an invitation from the National Foundation of Museums, to lead a conference at the Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art on the “culture and its role as a bridge between people.”  According to the news source, the visit will reaffirm the strong bilateral ties between France and Morocco.  Morocco’s King was the first international leader to meet with Hollande in his capacity as president of France.  Previously, King Mohammed VI hosted Hollande and his business delegation in Morocco on April 3, 2013. During the visit, the two leaders signed dozens of cooperation agreements, covering the transport, agriculture, education, and renewable energy sectors.  Prior to this visit, Hollande has stressed the importance of consolidating the friendship and ties between Rabat and Paris.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat- When Moroccan feminist blogger Yasmina Benslimane uploaded her International Women’s Day video, the online reactions were swift and strident. While Benslimane’s video, a multilingual compilation of women’s testimonials, garnered praise from some, others responded with the vitriol that typifies anonymous corners of the internet. “I was surprised,” the 24-year-old told Morocco World News. “I hadn’t expected anything like that.” However, Benslimane chose to engage with her critics rather than rebuff or eschew their perspectives. In fact, she responded to each one individually. “I wanted to see if I could change their minds.” Benslimane sent private messages to her various critics and came away feeling the discussions had been “constructive.” “They were mostly sexist men,” she said of her interlocutors. “But it’s important to make them feel heard.” In her activism and outlook, Benslimane positions herself as a feminist emissary. She believes that feminism has a “negative connotation” in Morocco, chiefly rooted in misunderstandings and “distortions.” These revolve around people eliding “feminism with ‘man-hatred’” or, alternately, thinking of feminism as an “exclusive, Western construct.” In her March 8 video, Benslimane defines feminism as a “range of political and social movements and ideologies that all share a common goal: to achieve and establish social, political, and economic equality of the sexes.” “Not everyone is going to agree with you,” she told Morocco World News. “But they will respect my point of view.” Benslimane speaks openly about her interest in politics, calling it part of the “struggle for a better world.” Indeed, although she speaks with the measured fluidity of a diplomat, her commitment and enthusiasm feel genuine. Her inclination to engage her critics in discussions of gender issues is, in itself, formidable; but she is also a rare person with the linguistic dexterity to do so. Born in Morocco, she grew up speaking Moroccan Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, and French; her undergraduate and postgraduate coursework have been in Spain and Costa Rica; and she spoke to Morocco World News in her flawless English. Benslimane has always been “fascinated” by gender issues. Recently, she started a blog, Politics4Her, as a platform on which to explore and debate various political issues from a feminist perspective. “My blog is an initiative of providing women the opportunity to break stereotypes, grow more informed, and encourage active participation in civil society.” Being a Moroccan in Costa Rica comes with its own hurdles. However, “Most people don’t know where that [Morocco] is, so I have to explain it’s a country in Africa. And then, I have to explain that we’re francophone, and the history of colonialism. And then, that we’re a Muslim-majority country but not everyone wears the hijab.” However, Benslimane takes this in stride. Laughingly, she says that by the end of these lengthy stereotype-debunking conversations, “usually everyone wants to visit.” Benslimane keeps a tight schedule. Outside of her coursework, she is preparing with her team for the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition, a simulated trial with prefixed topics for law students. She also has a UNHCR internship focusing on relations with El Salvador. When asked what frontiers she looks to cross next, Benslimane says that she “definitely” plans to return to Morocco after she finishes law school. “That’s for sure!”

Rabat-  As the United Nations Personal Envoy, Horst Kohler is set to introduce his conclusions on the Western Sahara conflict before the UN security council today, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita reminded the UN official of the key principles that form the foundation of Morocco’s position in the Western Sahara conflict. During the meeting, Kohler will present briefings on the conflict, including a written conclusion on consultations between parties to the conflict from recent months. During a meeting on March 6, the Moroccan delegation first informed Kohler of Morocco’s principles and its firm position on its territorial integrity. Bourita stressed that the negotiation process will only occur if respecting the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country, according to Moroccan newspaper Assabah. King Mohammed VI clearly outlined these principles and Morocco’s framework of reference during his speech commemorating the 42nd anniversary of the Green March last November 6, 2017. Throughout his speech, the monarch reiterated that Morocco will never respect a solution to the conflict “that does not acknowledge Morocco’s full sovereignty over its Sahara,” and the much-commended  autonomy plan, which has been declared “serious and credible by the international community.” The King added that all the parties that “have concocted this disputed must fully shoulder their responsibility,” in order to reach a final solution to the four-decade long conflict. Morocco, according to the sovereign will reject any “obsolete proposals designed to divert the settlement process for the set terms of reference.” After his official mediations sessions with the parties related to the conflict, Kohler held a meeting with Swedish Social Democratic politician Margot  Elisabeth Wallstrom on March 17, to discuss the Western Sahara conflict. In a tweet, Wallstrom wrote,“Important meeting with Horst Köhler, envoy on MINURSO and Western Sahara.” The Swedish official added that their meeting focused “on how to move the UN process forward towards a just and mutually acceptable political solution. Guaranteeing the rights of the people of W.Sahara.” She has also expressed her full support for the Personal Envoy and UN efforts.

Guaranteeing the rights of the people of W.Sahara. Full Swedish support for Köhler and UN efforts. pic.twitter.com/m77RjFHnPX — Margot Wallström (@margotwallstrom) March 17, 2018  The Personal Envoy aims, through this strategy, to provide other bodies with an opportunity to propose solutions that would help the UN find a lasting solution to the conflict. This was not the only time that Kohler involved international parties to the conflict. In January,  Kohler held talks with AU Commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat on Addis Ababa about the conflict. The UNSG Envoy also met on Friday with Rwanda’s President, Paul Kagame, who will officially take over the chairmanship of the African Union on January 28. Kohler’s meetings with the African leaders came four days after his official meeting with the EU’s High Representative Federica Mogherini, on January 9, in Brussels. During the meeting, the two high officials “exchanged views on the relaunch of the UN peace process for Western Sahara,” according to an official statement by the European Union External Action. Defying Morocco? In a publication posted on Moroccan news outlet Le360, M’hamad Harmouch, said that Kohler continues to meet only parties whose position is contrary to that of Morocco on the Sahara issue, referring to Kohler’s last meeting with the Swedish official. According to the news source, Kohler defied the promise he made before the Moroccan delegation during the recent meeting in Lisbon, reaffirming his intention to “reduce the Sahara issue exclusively to the United Nations,” according to statements made by Bourita. In a recent interview with MWN, Moroccan political observer El Moussaoui El Ajlaoui said that Morocco could never accept Kohler’s strategy to involve other parties to the conflict. He added that the North African county seeks the United Nations as the only body with the legitimacy to pass judgment on the territory. He explained that Kohler’s move is applied to put pressure on Morocco, rather than being a measure to find a solution to the conflict. The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is set to submit his final report on the Sahara conflict in April.

Rabat – At a free trade summit this week in Kigali, Rwanda, African leaders have said to be poised to sign a free trade zone deal that would unite and integrate the markets of all 54 member states of the African Union. According to AU estimates, the deal will bring about the creation of a market of 1.2 billion people living in the continent, including, most essentially, a gross domestic product of $2.5 trillion, leading some observers to argue that should the deal be signed and implemented according to AU’s initial plans, it would culminate in the creation of the biggest free trade zone ever since the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WT0) in January 1995. Expected to unite the 54 AU member states in a tariff-free trade zone, the project is said to constitute a founding pillar of the Africa 2063 agenda, an AU strategic study that gives prominence to continental integration and intra-Africa exchanges in the continent’s bid to encourage inclusive growth and sustainable socio-economic development. Many leaders who represented their countries at the Kigali summit have said that not only will an Africa free trade zone help the continent to diversify its economic activities, it will also, in the process, shield African economies from the price volatility so pervasive in the commodity exports market traditionally associated with African economies. And so, despite the last-minute decision by Nigeria and Uganda to pull out from the Kigali summit, leading many observers to predict major setbacks in the implementation of the continental free trade dream, the general sentiment among the continent’s leaders is that the need to encourage and boost intra-African exchanges has never been this urgent. “Less than 20% of Africa’s trade is internal,” said Rwanda’s Paul Kagame commenting on the necessity of enlarging intra-African exchanges. But, he explained, “Increasing intra-African trade does not mean doing less business with the rest of the world.” Morocco’s African Cooperation delegate minister Mohcine Jazouli, who was part of the Moroccan delegation at the summit, echoed the same sentiments in an interview he gave on the sidelines of the conference. The Moroccan minister spoke in terms of a “prosperous, strong, and interdependent Africa.” While the ratio of intra-continental exchanges reaches an impressive figure of 64% in Europe, and 52% in Asia, Africa’s is only 13% at present, the Moroccan minister said, adding that it is now more than ever necessary to “encourage regional integration and promote innovative and smart mechanisms that will create a tariff-free, responsible, and inclusive Africa.” Morocco, which signed the agreement, as it is in perfect harmony with the North African country’s Africa initiative that gives prominence to South-South Cooperation, has no qualms that the deal will bring about prosperity and economic development at the continental level. Speaking yesterday as a panelist at the Kigali summit, South Africa’s Cyril Ramophosa also lauded the merits of a prospective continental free trade zone. For the South African president, the deal will create a more conducive environment for trade and investments for the continent as a whole. Mr. Ramophosa also said that the effective implementation of such a continental agreement would signal a new dawn in unleashing the entrepreneurial and creative capacities of the continent, especially as a free trade zone would entail the promotion of an integrated market through agricultural developments, structural innovations, and the free movement of persons, goods, and services. “Perhaps the moment could have come for us to create a single African currency. Our focus should not be on our individual countries but on the continent as a whole to unlock great opportunities and capabilities,” said South Africa’s president speaking in terms of “ridding Africa of its colonial mentality.” Despite sure challenges ahead, especially with Nigeria’s current stance towards the deal, studies have unanimously found that, in the long run, the free trade zone would benefit the continent in its entirety. A UN-sponsored twenty-three-page study has estimated, for example, that the continental agreement is “an important step towards integrating economies of African countries, boosting intra-African trade and attaining sustainable development in the continent.” In concrete terms, said the study, the deal could spur, by 2022, an increase of 52% in intra-African trade, which would translate into a financial benefit of about $35 billion. The study however warned that financial benefits associated with the implementation of the deal will experience a skewed distribution among national economies in the continent. For all these warnings, however, African leaders remain convinced that this is a significant and necessary step towards the realization of the AU’s Panafrican aspirations of a developed and strong Africa.

Rabat- Moroccan biology doctor, author, researcher, and prominent Islamic feminist Asma Lamrabet resigned from her position as director in the Mohammadia League of Scholars, “Rabita Mohammadia of Oulemas,” due to disagreements over equality of inheritance between men and women. Author of “Believer and Feminist,” and other works focusing on women’s position in Islam, Asma Lamrabet announced her resignation from Rabita Mohammadia of Oulemas located in Rabat, on Sunday, March 18, due to disagreements over equality of inheritance, a communiqué told H24. Born in 1961, Lamrabet is the founder of a working group for women’s issues and intercultural dialogue, and a major contributor to “Third Way” feminism, a movement of women that questions religious patriarchy and fights sexism in Morocco. Amidst criticism aimed at her approach to controversial subjects such as polygamy and violence towards women, Lamrabet continues to stand for democracy and human rights, focusing more on women’s issues and equality between genders in Islam. As director of Islamic feminism studies in Rabita Mohammadia of Oulemas organization, Lamrabet worked to promote a tolerant and open Islam in line with the organization’s main purpose. Established in 2006 by King Mohammed VI for the promotion of an open Islam, Rabita Mohammadia of Scholars is an organization that pursues wisdom, noble values, and moderate religious teachings of Islam. Equality of inheritance has become a debatable issue in Muslim countries such as Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco, in which it has started to surface. Tunisia recently witnessed protests from hundreds of women, feminist unions and human rights NGOs who marched on March 10 for equal rights of inheritance. According to the holy Quran’s ‘Surat Nisa’ (4:11), women inherit half the share of men: “Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females.”

Rabat – On June 13, one day before the official opening of the 2018 World Cup, the FIFA community will gather in Moscow to designate the host of the 2026 edition of football’s ultimate event, this time in a vote casting the voices of all national federations. Just a few months before this much-awaited vote, some American outlets have taken an interest in Morocco’s bid, surprised as they are that the lone North African bidder has tremendously succeeded in recent months to turn the odds in its favor, thus quelling the condescension that some observers and sports outlets initiated when Morocco first announced that it was considering challenging the North American Goliath-like trio. After ESPN and the New York Times, it is now USA Today most recently examined the surprising merits of Morocco’s candidacy. “What if the biggest and most painful upset in United States soccer history isn’t the loss in Trinidad and Tobago in October that cost it a World Cup place? What if it is still to come?” USA Today asked in a recent report, comparing the country’s painful loss to Russia and Qatar to Morocco’s rise in public opinion as a serious contender–and the favorite bid–of many national federations in the FIFA community. The outlet added: “If there is one thing that has made the American soccer community feel fractionally better about the men’s national team’s absence from this summer grand global tournament, it is the idea that hosting the event in 2026 is a lock. The problem is, that it isn’t. Not any longer.” This suggests that the North African “underdog bid,” as some outlets have been calling Morocco’s campaign, has not only dealt a serious blow to the confidence of the USA-Canada-Mexico trio; it has also convinced many in the footballing community that it could beat out North America’s “superior facilities and infrastructures.” An official of one the national federations in the FIFA community, who asked to speak anonymously, has been reported by USA Today as saying that Morocco’s bid is “smart” and “has an answer for everything.” For example, while the North American bid is exhibiting its huge stadiums and the massive media rights-related financial benefits that FIFA might receive should United 2026 win, Morocco has chosen to highlight prospective Morocco 2026 World Cup matches in touristic cities “with historical significance or natural beauty.” Morocco is “putting forward a more aesthetic and cultural spiel,” USA Today said. Considering Morocco’s more favorable viewer-friendly time zone, the Trump administration’s many globally unpopular politicking, and Africa’s important bloc vote leaning toward a second World Cup on the continent, “the tough times for American soccer may continue,” USA today concluded.

Rabat – President Trump offered what many are describing as “embarrassing” welcome to Saudi Prince Mohamed bin Salman in the White House on Tuesday. During the Oval Office meeting, rather on emphasizing US support for his for his “revolutionary” reforms and for its security, Trump insisted in what expects from the Saudis: share their nation’s wealth by continuing to purchase American-made weapons. In other words, recycle the petrodollars that Saudi Arabia earns every day through the export of oil. “We are bringing back hundreds of billions of dollars into the United States. We understand that and they understand that,” said President Trump.  Afterward, the U.S President held two charts and started enumerating the deals Saudi Arabia signed with the United States, which range from ships to missile defense to planes and fighting vehicles. While doing so, Trump mentioned a deal worth $520 million and addressed his guest saying “that is peanuts for you.” The Saudi Crown Prince, who looked embarrassed throughout the process, had no other choice but to smile at the President “joke.” Trump went to add that the military deals signed between the two countries will create 40,000 jobs in the United States. During the meeting he held with the Saudi Crown Prince following the official reception in the Oval Office, the American President reemphasized what his administration expects from Saudi Arabia. “Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy nation, and they’re going to give the United States some of that wealth, hopefully in the form of jobs, in the form of the purchase of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said. “There’s nobody even close, as I said before, when it comes to the missiles and the planes and all of the military equipment,” Trump said. “There’s nobody that even comes close to us in terms of technology and the quality of the equipment, and Saudi Arabia appreciates that.”

Rabat –  The Fez-based appeals court has delivered an eight-year prison sentence to the French pedophile accused of raping four minors in Fez.  The case broke in early January when authorities apprehended the accused with two minor girls aged ten and thirteen in a sewing workshop in Fez’s medina. The defendant, who arrived in Morocco approximately 18 months ago, has since been introducing himself to locals in Fez as a “tourist.”  He was arrested on January 1 in a tailor’s workshop in the Medina after he was caught red handed committing sexual acts on two little girls. In a recorded interview posted on social media, the girls said that the 58-year-old defendant had been grooming them with money and toys, promising gifts from France. Their identities were concealed in the film as they are filmed from behind. “When I refused to comply with his orders, he threatened me and told me that he would slaughter my family,” said one of the girls in the moving interview. During the first hearing that took place on January 5, the defendant admitted to drugging and raping the two young girls.

Rabat – Nigeria has officially stepped back from signing the framework agreement for establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area (ACFTA) after many Nigerian labor unions warned against the deal’s consequences on the local economy. Nigerian authorities released an official statement on Sunday, saying that Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari will not attend the African Union (AU) summit in Rwanda this week, just one day prior to the opening session of foreign affairs ministers on Monday morning at the Kigali Convention Centre. The purpose of this meeting was to review the draft of the Continental Free Trade Area Agreement ahead of its signing during the Extraordinary Summit of the African Union scheduled for Wednesday.  “Mr. President will no longer be travelling to Kigali for the event because certain key stakeholders in Nigeria indicated that they had not been consulted, for which reasons they had some concerns on the provisions of the treaty,” read the statement by Tope Elias-Fatile, the foreign ministry spokesman. “This is to allow more time for input from Nigerian stakeholders,” it added.  Buhari was expected to travel to Kigali on Monday, where 53 other African countries gathered to authorize the ACFTA, initiated by the African Union in 2012, with the aim of establishing a unified free trade market for goods and services. This agreement would  designate the continent the largest free trade area created since the formation of the World Trade Organisation.  According to the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki, the African Continental Free Trade Area “will also strengthen Africa’s position in global trade.” The agreement was approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) last Wednesday after it said that the deal would boost the country’s export, “spur growth and boost job creation, as well as eliminate barriers against Nigeria’s products and provide a Dispute Settlement Mechanism for stopping the hostile and discriminatory treatment directed against Nigerian natural and corporate business persons in other African countries.”    However, Nigerian local labor unions strongly contested the deal, claiming that the agreement would cause harm to the local economy, and urged the president not to sign the convention.  The country’s highest labour body, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) said the move may affect the nation’s manufacturing sector and lead to loss of jobs. “We have no doubt that this political initiative will toll the death bells of the Nigerian economy,” Ayuba Waba, President of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) said.  Nigeria is Africa’s largest oil producer with a population of about 190 million participating in its vast fuel market. But the recent fall in oil prices has led to an economic recession, driving president Buhari to resort to protective economic policies, such as banning the import of many goods.

Rabat – The 2018 Crans Montana Forum, which began last Friday in Dakhla, came to end today aboard the Italian cruise ship Grandi Navi Veloci (GNV), the host site for the second phase of the international event. Held under the patronage of King Mohammed VI, this year’s edition took place March 15-20, focusing on Africa and South-South cooperation. More than a thousand participants from 131 countries and representatives of 27 regional and international organizations, as well as former heads of state and government, ministers, presidents of parliaments, policy makers and parliamentarians, took part in the forum, to discuss several topics, including the future of Africa, sustainable development, South-South cooperation, and the different challenges of Africa in the era of globalization. The first half of this year’s edition took place from March 15-17 at the South Pearl Conference Center in Morocco’s southern city, Dakhla, despite efforts made by the Polisario, Algeria, and the African Union to prevent Morocco from hosting the event in the city. The second part was held on board the Italian cruise ship Grandi Navi Veloci (GNV), which sailed from Dakhla to Casablanca from March 18-20, hosting several work discussions during their coastal journey northward. The 2018 Crans Montana Forum was an opportunity to engage in fruitful exchanges on topics such as food security and sustainable agriculture, the oceans economy and the fisheries sector, renewable energies, and the African Green Revolution. The Crans Montana Forum has become a must-attend international event that brings together high-level political decision makers, representatives of the business community, intellectuals, civil society activists from all walks of life, as well as opinion makers from all corners of the world. Founded in 1986 in Switzerland, the Crans Montana Forum is a non-governmental organization that focuses on encouraging international cooperation, dialogue, development, stability, peace, and security in the world.

Rabat – Prior to the United Nations-Secretary General final report on the Western Sahara conflict, Personal Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General, Horst Kohler is set to present to the first outcomes of the Western Sahara mediation process to the security council on Wednesday. The meeting, which will be held in a closed session in New York,  will feature briefings of the Western Sahara conflict. Kohler is set to present the security council with a written briefing on the meetings held with the parties to the conflict in recent months. Kohler will be accompanied by the new head of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, Colin Stewart, reported Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia. The meeting was previously scheduled for February at the request of the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who requested to update the Security Council within six months of the appointment of the new Personal Envoy in accordance with resolution 2351, according to the UN. The meeting will feature the progress Kohler has made in consultation with the parties to the issue, with the aim of implementing a mutually acceptable solution to end the four-decade long conflict. The UN Security Council will take place after a series of meetings held between the Personal Envoy and delegations from Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and the separatist group. Kohler’s latest meeting was held with a Moroccan delegation, led by Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita, who reaffirmed Morocco’s firm stance on the Western Sahara question. During their meeting, which took place in Lisbon on March 6, the Moroccan delegation presented Morocco’s efforts to implement a regional development model and structures of advanced regionalization. Morocco’s Autonomy Plan was one of the key topics discussed by the UNSG Personal Envoy and the Moroccan delegation. Lisbon’s meeting served as part of Morocco’s permanent cooperation with the UN to find a fair solution to end the conflict over Western Sahara. The UN chief is set to submit his final report on the Western Sahara conflict to the UN Security Council in April.

Rabat- Months after declaring its Africa-centered foreign policy, Morocco appointed Mohcine Jazouli, a well-known political strategist of sub-Saharan affairs, as minister delegate to African affairs and African cooperation. Mr. Jazouli, who is representing Morocco this week at the African Union free trade summit held in Kigali, Rwanda, recently said in an interview with the Moroccan outlet Medias24 that the North African country’s new Africa agenda truly represents: a relationship based on a genuine love and shared values–not a traditional international affairs ‘marriage of convenience.’ “It is not enough to know Africa. One should love it,” Jazouli said when asked about how his knowledge of Africa’s political landscape has been helping Morocco’s recent diplomatic assertiveness in the continent. “I have a good grasp of Africa and its expectations. It is a continent that crystallizes scores of hopes and challenges,” Jazouli told Moroccan journalists as he foregrounded one of the reasons why king Mohammed VI chose him to lead Morocco’s vision of an integrated and prosperous Africa, under the auspices of the Bourita-led Foreign Affairs Ministry.“I love Africa, I love its diversity and its vibrant youth,” Jazouli added. Commenting on the advancements and challenges of Morocco’s diplomacy in Africa, especially the setbacks that the country has been experiencing in its ECOWAS bid, Jazouli promised that as Morocco’s top official in charge of supervising and implementing the King’s “Africa vision,” he will work to the fullest of his abilities to promote and realize Morocco’s faith in the enormous economic prospects of an “Africa that trusts itself.” Morocco is already the second African investor in the continent and is ready to engage with more and more African partners in order to showcase the North African nation’s genuine commitment to African integration, Jazouli noted. Mr. Jazouli also mentioned the impressive extent to which Morocco has recently been driving investments and commercial agreements at the continental level. He said that Morocco has recently signed over 400 trade and investment deals with its “African brothers,” adding that a truly prosperous and “independent” Africa depends on devising new perspectives that will bring African economies closer together. “Morocco has faith in Africa, in its capacity to create and innovate,” Jazouli concluded, hinting that he’ll be meeting with more African fellows—ministers and ambassadors—to discuss the necessity of regional integration and stronger intra-African commercial and cultural exchanges.

Rabat – South Africa’s High Court in Port Elizabeth is selling Morocco’s phosphate shipment, which was detained on May 1, 2017, in South Africa, after Polisario claimed that the cargo was illegally taken from Western Sahara. On Monday, the court opened an  exclusive bid auction to sell the 55,000 tonnes of phosphate cargo loaded on the NM Cherry Blossom, which was detained by South African authorities. In February, the court handed a pro-Polisario verdict against the Moroccan phosphate shipment, noting that the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) is the “owner of all the phosphate cargo currently loaded on the NM Cherry Blossom.” The court added that “phosphate ownership has never been legally held by the Office Chérifien des Phosphates (OCP) and/or Phosphates de Boucraa SA.” South Africa’s High court also decided that the institutions are not authorized to sell phosphate to Ballance Agri-Nutrients Limited of New Zealand. Additional orders issued by the court denied OCP the power to auction cargo and the right to recover the capital costs of the shipment. The court ordered the auction to run 30 days, starting March 19. “An updated laboratory analysis of the samples will be available this week to determine physical and chemical properties of the cargo,” said Clear Asset Auctioneers. According to Reuters, the starting bid for the shipment is set at USD 1 million. This ruling represents the range of judicial opinions surrounding the conflict. Previously, in June 2017, a Panama court declined an appeal brought by Polisario to stop a Moroccan phosphate cargo in Panama. The court decided that there was insufficient evidence that the shipment belonged to Polisario.

Tamini, who was arrested on December 19 last year for slapping an Israeli soldier in her West Bank village of Nebi Saleh, quickly became an iconic symbol of Palestinian resistance, with the video of the incident being shared by thousands of users on various social media platforms. “Explaining his decision, Judge Gilad Peretz wrote that he did not feel that he had the authority to overrule the court’s original decision on February 13,” The Times of Israel reported, adding the judge’s opinion that holding the teenage activist’s trial behind closed doors “is in the best interest of the minor.” The judge is said to be following the traditional rules of Israel’s juvenile courts, where, unless in ‘exceptional cases’, trials are generally held behind closed doors and in the absence of a probable public influence. But while Tamimi has been celebrated around the globe as an icon of resistance to ‘colonial occupation’ and injustice, Israeli authorities have incriminated her actions and charged her with dozens of criminal offenses, including “aggravated assault charges.”  The Israeli authorities have also accused Ahed’s supportive family members, especially her mother Nariman Tamimi—who has described her daughter as a freedom fighter— of using their daughter as a “pawn” at the service of the pro-Palestine front. “Public exposure is the only defense at the disposal of Ahed, and it is clear that without it, in a secret trial, she can’t receive a fair trial,” said the teenager’s attorney Gaby Lasky, lambasting the fact that despite numerous appeals by herself and groups of human rights activists, the Israeli authorities are still set to continue the proceedings “in the dark.”  Ahed’s attorney also told the press that both the minor and her parents wanted the trail to be open to the public.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat- Morocco will host its first Professional Windsurfers Association (PWA) Windsurf World Cup March 27 — April 7, at the Moulay Bouzerktoun spot near Essaouira.  Following the success of the first two editions, the PWA Windsurf World Cup attained the stage of the International Windsurfing Tour (IWT), making it a major gathering for the greatest national and international athletes. Over 100 professional windsurfers are expected to attend the event, aiming to determine who is the best of the best.  The guestlist will include Moroccan champion Boujmaa Guilloul, who will also be presiding ambassador and organizer of the event.  “I have always dreamed of organizing an international event in Morocco. I was hoping someone would launch the project, but over time I realized that I would have  to do it myself,” said the ex-windsurfer in an interview with Huffpost Maroc.  The country previously hosted the International Windsurf Tour in May 2016, but this year Essaouira will host three different competitions including the Women’s World Windsurfing Cup, and the Men’s World Cup.  “The competition will be very tough this year. The windsurfers will fight to win the trophy and the current reigning world champion, Spanish Iballa Moreno, will do everything she can to secure her spot,” said Guilloul.  Located 25 km outside of Essaouira, the Moulay Bouzerktoun windsurf center is a favorite destination among surfers worldwide. “Essaouira is known to offer optimal surfing conditions at this time of the year, with consistent winds and interesting swells for those who like to challenge the forces of nature,” declared the champion.  The Moulay Bouzerktoun wavespot, introduced  in 2007, is totally dedicated to windsurfing, with equipment provided by the international sailmakers Fanatic and North Sails.  The 33-year-old rider is the only Moroccan to win the International Windsurf Tour in 2016, and was also a finalist in 2017, and the current record-holder of the highest jump (20 meters) since 2012.  “I hope that this big competition will give young people a chance to get involved and encourage the government to invest in windsurfing. Creating clubs and organizing activities grants youth more easy  access this sport,” he concluded.

Rabat – Eleven men between the ages of 28 and 51 were accused of involvement in a hashish smuggling scheme between France and Morocco, and will be presented before a court in Rennes for charges of drug trafficking, criminal conspiracy, and money laundering on March 28. The accusations date back to December 2013, when the judicial police of Nantes were alerted of a drug operation between France and Morocco. In the years since, the police have wiretapped several targets between the two countries. These records led to the arrest of three men onboard of a vehicle go-fast (a vehicle with the ability of transporting heavy cargos with a high speed), carrying 115 kg of hashish. Soon after, the entire network was dismantled from Morocco, where cannabis is grown, to France, where several members sell the drug. Two of the men  are from the Paris region and a third is based indNantes. The searches carried out by the security elements at the home of one member of the organization allowed for the seizure of EU 22,000. During the first day of the hearing, one of the defense lawyers questioned the regularity of the phone tapping, claiming that it had been conducted abroad and not on French territory. In November 2017, six defendants had already been sentenced 5 to 7 years in prison, for their implications in another case. Most of the accused were known among the police investigators, including a 45-year-old man, suspected to be the head of the international criminal organization. He was previously implicated in a cocaine trafficking case and is currently exercising his right to remain silent.

Rabat – Through precise calculations, Moroccan astronomer Dr. Hicham El Issaoui has predicted that Morocco will observe the holy month of Ramadan beginning May 17, 2018. El Issaoui, who graduated from Dar El-Hadith El-Hassania for Higher Islamic Studies in Rabat, has predicted that Ramadan will begin in Morocco on Thursday, May 17, 2018. El Issaoui also predicted that Morocco will celebrate the end of Ramadan–Eid Al-Fitr–on Friday, June 15, while Eid al-Adha will be on Wednesday, August 22. The same source added that the first day of the Islamic new year, Fatih-Muharram, 1440 will be on Tuesday, September 11, and that the birthday of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), Mawlid al-Nabi al-Sharif, will be celebrated on Tuesday, November 20, 2018. In addition to El Issaoui’s Ramadan prediction, some other Middle Eastern sources predict that Ramadan will start on Tuesday, May 15. However, the Ministry of Islamic Affairs will not confirm the official start day until astronomers first observe the crescent moon in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar.  During the holy month, Muslims from all across the world fast from sunrise to sunset as a fulfilment of the second basic pillar of Islam after the profession of faith (shahadah), prayer (salah), charity (zakaat), and pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj). Ramadan lasts from 29 to 30 days depending on the observance of the crescent moon or on relevant astronomical calculations, as quoted in Al-Hadith Nabawi: “Fast when you see the crescent and break the fast when you see it; if it is not apparent, then make the month of sha’ban thirty days.”  Ramadan is not only a time for fasting; it is an opportunity for Muslims to open their hearts and engage in spiritual reflection.

Rabat – Members of the Polisario Front intercepted a vehicle carrying group of Moroccan football fans from crossing the Mauritanian-Moroccan border on Saturday, according to Moroccan newspaper Assabah. The fans had been in Mauritania’s Nouadhibou to cheer on their football club, Raja of Casablanca, which played its match against a local Mauritanian team as part of the ongoing African Football Confederation Cup. The newspaper added that the car of five supporters was blocked and encircled by a 4×4 car bearing the emblem of the  Polisario Front-Proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). The separatist group stripped the supporters of all of their belongings and allowed them to leave through the Guerguerat buffer zone. This is not the first time Polisario has carried out such provocative actions. Earlier this month, armed groups of the Polisario conducted a series of armed operations in Guerguerat in an attempt to escalate tensions in the region. The Polisario also threatened to prevent auto racing participants, including participants in the Africa Eco Race, from crossing the Moroccan-Mauritanian border. In response to Polisario’s illegal actions, Morocco called on the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) to denounce the provocations, asking the Mission to put an end to Polisario incursions into Guerguerat. Subsequently, MINURSO supervised the passage of the competition participants who successfully crossed the Moroccan-Mauritanian border in Guerguerat on January 8.

Rabat- The former French president has been taken into police custody for investigations over alleged Libyan donations that funded his 2007 campaign for the French presidency, reports French news agency AFP. Sarkozy was questioned earlier today for allegedly receiving EUR 50 million from late former Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, to finance his election bid in 2007. The alleged sum violates French rules against foreign funding, as the legal campaign financing limit was EUR 21 million at the time. The former president, however, denied the claims, dismissing the allegations as “grotesque.” In 2016, French-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine claimed that Sarkozy received millions of euros to finance his 2007 campaign, reported The Guardian. The businessman told news source Mediapart, “I have discovered things that should no longer be hidden. I wish to denounce the mafia state in which we are currently living.” The allegations are not new. The claims first emerged in 2013, when the French court opened an investigation on the alleged illegal financing of Sarkozy’s 2007 campaign in 2007. Sarkozy has categorically denied the accusations. Though Sarkozy is not yet charged, his investigation can last up to 48 hours.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – Emmy-nominated director Cecilia Peck opens up to Morocco World News about her documentary Brave Miss World, and her strive to break the silence surrounding rape and sexual assault years before the #MeToo movement brought the issue into the mainstream. When 18-year-old Linor Abargil was crowned the Miss World 1998, she seemed to have it all:  a year of charity benefits and world renown to boost her modeling career. However, beneath the crown, she had suffered a gut-wrenching trauma, just seven weeks prior. In October, 1998, Abargil was kidnapped, stabbed and raped by Uri Schlomo Nur, an Italian travel agent associated with her modeling agency, while beginning her modeling career in Italy. Soon after, Abargil managed to escape and call her mother in Israel, marking the start of her long journey towards justice. Abargil reported the crime and presented DNA evidence in Italy, before traveling home to Tel Aviv. However, Italian authorities initially released the alleged rapist for lack of evidence, pushing Abargil to seek the help of Israeli authorities, who issued an arrest warrant for Nur under his name prior to his conversion to Judaism, Selman Noor. After being tricked into returning to Israel, Nur was convicted for rape and sentenced 16 years in prison, with DNA evidence found in his car serving as the basis for his sentence. In spite of her own trauma, Abargil began to speak out about her experience and meet with other rape survivors. In her healing journey, she traveled from South Africa to Israel, and then on to American campuses, aiming to expose violence against women. In order to reach out to more rape survivors, Abargil set out for Los Angeles looking for a woman director who would help tell her story. “She felt that the worst moment in her life, which was being the victim of a terrifying abduction, stabbing and rape — and the high point of life, which was being crowned Miss World, must have happened so close together for a reason,” said Cecilia Peck who took on the mission of telling Abargil’s to the world. Peck added, “Linor had no shame in telling us about what she had been through. ‘Why should I be ashamed?’ she said, ‘The fault was his, not mine.’ Linor wanted to make a film about her fight for justice, and her journey toward healing, in the hopes of encouraging other survivors of rape around the world not to be ashamed and not to stay silent.” Peck underscored her interest in Abargil’s relationship with her mother, who buoyed her daughter with unconditional love and support throughout her healing process. “Linor comes from a very close, tightly knit Moroccan-Jewish family, who gave her a lot of support when she was raped, and the film goes into depth in her family relationships and background,” affirmed the director. On the other hand, it was hard for Abargil to speak about rape and support others while still facing her own demons: she had to walk away from the project for six months at one point in production. “It was challenging to find the balance between remaining sensitive to how triggering it could be to them, while also managing shooting days on shoestring budgets and keeping the production going. But all of the women interviewed in the film wanted to be part of something that could help other survivors feel less ashamed and less alone,” said Peck. As a result of Abargil’s case, laws were enhanced in Israel giving more rights to rape survivors. However, Abargil’s aims were higher: she wanted to help women on a global scale and set out to create dialogue around the sweeping changes in the mainstream culture today. In fact, the Emmy-nominated documentary continues to make changes through screenings on over 200 college campuses and around the world. With over 7,200,000 visitors, the Brave Miss World website provides a safe haven for rape survivors, making it the number one website for those seeking to share their stories. “We are very proud of our outreach component, which offers resources and a safe, curated space for survivors to support each other online,” declared the director. Peck wishes that these changes would reach Morocco, and that more women would be willing to speak up, and help alleviate the gender disparities. “I believe that there is a great need for advancement of the implementation of women’s rights in Morocco, and our team salutes all of the women who are speaking up there and making a difference.” Brave Miss World was recently screened at 21st edition of the New York Sephardic Jewish Festival, which dedicated its opening night to Moroccan Gnawa music.

Rabat-  The famous Francophone singer and rapper of Congolese origins who currently lives in France, Maître Gims expresses frustration after France refuses him citizenship. Maître Gims shared disappointment  in response to France’s rejection of his request for French citizenship, in an interview on the French television program, “En balade avec” on Sunday. “I made my first request [for French nationality] which was quickly rejected and I don’t understand why,” he said, “It’s important, I sing in French, I express myself in French, I am an ambassador of the French language in the world.” Gims, who has lived in France since he was two, was pained because his request was denied despite his completion of all the required legal procedures, including passing a language test for the mastery of French language. Gims said that he still does not know the reasons behind the refusal of his request, and referred to a previous comment he made on air in 2016: “I thought I would get my papers without any problems.”  “What should I do?

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – Morocco’s Ambassador to Panama, Oumama Aouad, highlighted Morocco’s environmental achievements at a conference on “Public Policies to Preserve the Environment,” held this week at the Technological University of Panama (UTP). Morocco has been building a green economy that ensures the sustainability of its development, benefiting from the natural resources that are both clean and renewable. Aouad tied these achievements to Mohammed VI’s vision of making the environment a national priority, along with social and economic development. The diplomat stated that the choice for renewable energies, whether wind or photovoltaic, allows Morocco to reduce its energy dependence. In fact, thanks to solar stations NOOR I and NOOR II, at Ouarzazate Solar Power Station, Morocco is expected to account more than half of its energy consumption with renewable sources by 2030. This policy also involves the ban on producing, marketing, and using plastic bags, given their negative impact of the environment on the short, medium, and long-term. At the international level, Aouad maintained that the preservation of the ecological heritage and the fight against global warming were illustrated by Morocco’s participation in various editions of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP), including hosting two COPs in 2001 and in 2016 in Marrakech. Morocco also adheres to the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to unite all the world’s nations under one single climate change agreement for the first time in history. At the end of the conference, students held a discussion about Morocco’s efforts to preserve the environment, touching on Panama’s decision to follow in Morocco’s footsteps with the plastic bag ban that went into effect in January. This conference, which is part of the Month of the Francophonie celebration, took place in the presence of the Director of the French Alliance in Panama, several university officials, representatives of diplomatic missions and organizations, accredited internationals in Panama, and students and researcher from the Faculty of Engineering Science. Vice-Rector for the Technological University of Panama (UTP), who presided the opening of this conference on the experiences of Morocco and Costa Rica, thanked the organizers for the choice of UTP as a framework and stressed its weigh on the theme of the environment.

Rabat- Polisario’s provocative actions continue in Western Sahara’s buffer zones. Recently, the separatist group announced its intention to relocate its armed militias to the restricted buffer zone of Bir Lahlou. Separatist sources reported today that the front has expressed its intention to move the headquarters of its “defense ministry” to Bir Lahlou, an area located only 230 kilometers away from the Es-Semara province. The sources claimed that the process of relocating the separatists’ headquarters to Bir Lahlou “has started and will be completed within a short period.” The news was widely reported by Moroccan press yesterday. Last week, Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum reported that the Polisario is planning a series of provocative maneuvers in Bir Lahlou and Tifraity, two buffer zones located in northeastern Western Sahara. However, Moroccan political observers, including Moussaoui El Ajlaoui, considered Polisario’s potential actions as an attention grab that uses Algerian media to publicize its ploy. Polisario have been carrying out several provocative actions in the Western Sahara, especially in the Guerguerat buffer strip, resulting in denunciation from both the Moroccan government and the United Nations. Polisario’s recent plan will also hinder the settlement process regarding  the conflict over the Western Sahara, which has been ongoing for four decades. El Ajlaoui told  the Moroccan newspaper that Polisario’s fictional maneuvers have mounted for media purposes without any impact on the ground, adding that the separatists seek to draw the attention of the international public opinion and the United Nations. Morocco and the United Nations have not yet responded to the alleged intentions of the Polisario Front. However, both parties have made their stance clear over the maneuvers. In January,  United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed  his deep concern over rising tensions near the Guerguerat buffer zone. Polisario had been violating the ceasefire agreement signed between Morocco and Polisario in 1991. The separatists’ provocative actions have been ongoing since December 2017.

Rabat – Morocco will build nine new stadiums, and renovate the five existing ones if the country wins the right to stage the 2026 World Cup. In a presentation for the press on Saturday in Casablanca, Chairman of Morocco’s 2026 World Cup Bid Committee Moulay Hafid Elalamy announced that the country must have 14 stadiums to stage the world tournament. The country has pledged a budget of USD 15.6 billion in order to prepare to host the World Cup. According to Elalamy, USD 3 billion will be exclusively dedicated to stadium building and renovation. The committee has already selected the 12 cities that would stage the World Cup matches: Casablanca, Rabat, El Jadida, Tangier, Tetouan, Oujda, Nador, Marrakech, Ouarzazate, Agadir, Fez, and Meknes. Casablanca and Marrakech would each host two tournament stadiums.   The committee also released the designs for stadiums, one of which will the serve as the 93,000-seat home for the national soccer team in Casablanca. The facility would also host the opening and final games during the 2026 World Cup. Stadiums with a 46,000-person stadium capacity will be also built in Oujda and Tetouan, according to the bid committee. Other new stadiums of similar capacity are planned for Casablanca, Marrakech, El Jadida, Meknes, Nador, and Ouarzazate.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – As the curtain fell on the 19th National Film Festival, “Volubilis” and “House in the Fields” carried home the evening’s highest honors. Hosted at Tangier’s Ahmed Boukmakh Cultural Center, Saturday’s closing ceremony was the finale to a week of film screenings, debates, and retrospectives. The Moroccan Center of Cinematography (CCM) orchestrated the festival, which ran from March 9-17 and offered a space for fresh talent to debut and seasoned professionals to reconvene.    The festival’s jury panel was comprised of critics, directors, curators, and professors. The president of the panel, Rasha Salti, addressed the audience remotely via video; she commended the gender balance of the jury and expressed hope that gender parity will one day be reflected in nominees across various categories. Faouzi Bensaïdi’s “Volubilis” swept the categories of original score and screenplay. The film screened previously at the Carthage Film Festival (CGC) in November and the Venice Film Festival last August. The leading actors in “Volubilis,” Mouhcine Malzi and Nadia Kounda, carried home top honors in their respective acting categories. Dounia Binebine was named best supporting actress for her performance in the film “Razzia”; for his role in “Jahiya,” Hassan Badida won the prize for best supporting actor. After the ceremony, Morocco World News caught up with best actress winner Nadia Kounda, still euphoric from the night’s events. The 28-year-old Casablanca-native has previously appeared on screen and on television, performing in Moroccan Arabic, French, and English. “Instead of saying I am ‘very happy,’ I will say that I am ‘very honored!’” When asked what ran through her mind when she was announced the winner, Kounda said that she was “thinking only of the [film’s] crew.” She reiterated her gratitude to the “Volubilis” cast, thanking them for granting her the space to express herself “without being disturbed.” “Volubilis,” which shares its name with the ancient Roman ruins near Fez, tells a love story that curdles into an indictment of Moroccan society. Kounda joined the project because, she said, the “script spoke to me.” She believes “Volubilis” (or “Walili” in Arabic), carries a message about the different concentric factors that mediate the romance of two Moroccan young people. When navigating “respect, tradition, and religion,” she asked, “how can we live our love stories in Morocco?” Mohamed Abbazi won a lifetime achievement award from CCM, commemorating his lengthy career in and enduring mark on Moroccan cinema. Abbazi’s work spans the categories of documentaries, feature films, and television. In addition to his work advancing Moroccan cinema, he has worked to build the film infrastructure to support foreign productions filming in Morocco, collaborating with the international directors such as Franco Zeffirelli and Richard Attenborough. In accepting the award, Abbazi reflected on his career not only in Moroccan cinema but also his involvement with cinema in Morocco, referencing an anecdote from his work on the set of “The Man Who Would Be King.” To help procure camels for the film’s desert scenes, Abbazi served as an emissary for the film and spoke with tribes and local officials. “I felt in that moment that the whole country wanted to support the cinema,” he said, adding the he felt “lucky and privileged to be at the beginning of [its] launch.” “I invested 50 years in service of the filmmakers of this country,” he told Morocco World News after the awards ceremony. “For me,” gesturing to his silver reel-shaped award in hand, “this is the like winning the Nobel Prize.”

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat- On Thursday, March 22, there will be a screening of “Tinghir-Jerusalem, Echoes of the Mellah”—a documentary that reminisces on Jewish life in Tinghir, Morocco, and ruminates on the gradual disappearance of its Jewish community.  The screening will take place at New York’s Columbia University. Director Kamal Hachkar will be in attendance to answers any questions and facilitate discussion. In an interview with Morocco World News, Hachkar clarified that, while there are economic, cultural, and political approaches to the issue, a conclusion is ultimately, “hard to reach […] the documentary deals more with nostalgic aspects, and is not meant to be scientific.” Hachkar added that the documentary has been cause for controversy in Morocco, as it deals with aspects of discrimination against Jews. “Islamists wanted to censor the movie, but you cannot erase reality,” Hackhar notes. “My goal in making the documentary was to help repair the wounds created by harsh words, and bring to light certain truths.” The documentary was first screened in 2012, and has been met with great success. In Morocco alone, Hachkar estimates that between 3-4 million people have seen the film. It has also been screened in major American cities like Seattle, Miami, and San Diego—to name a few.  Hachkar has said that between 200-300 people are expected to attend the sold-out event. While it addresses issues that are close to heart to the people of Tinghir and Jewish communities, Hackhar believes that the documentary also appeals to broader audiences. “The values of the film are universal, and meant for everyone. It is a story about identity, roots, relationships, hope, and memoirs,” Hachkar explains. Hachkar is a Amazigh Muslim born in the city of Tinghir in southeastern Morocco. He spent his childhood years in France, returning to Tinghir on holidays. At the time, he was largely unaware of the Jewish populations in his birthplace, but he developed an interest  in the city’s Jewish heritage as he grew older, realizing that some of the city’s cultural aspects were disintegrating over time. Hachkar referred to Tinghir’s subsequent, “loss of diversity and pluralism […] due to the loss of its Jewish children.” Currently, Hachkar is living between Marrakech and Paris, and is working on a new documentary called, “Return to the Native Country.” The documentary will follow a theme of “plurality” and explore new generations of Jewish and Muslim music artists. Hachkar has also released another documentary under the name, “Tassanou Tayrinou” which discusses freedom of love and sexual expression.

Rabat – Speaking to the press on the sidelines of the ongoing Crans Montana Forum in Dakhla, President of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab Region Ynja Khattat has urged Algeria to cooperate in settling the Western Sahara conflict. Khattat discussed the recent meeting between the Moroccan delegation and Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General Horst Kohler in regards to the Western Sahara question, in his interview with Le360. According to Khattat, the meeting is a joint consultation between Morocco and the United Nations to find a mutually acceptable solution for the regional conflict over the Sahara. The president of the region added that Morocco’s delegation was firm about its proposals, and was always reaffirming its willingness to find a solution for the Sahara issue. Speaking about Morocco’s initiatives to solve the Western Sahara question, Ynja said that King Mohammed VI was very clear about Morocco’s position on the issue in his speech last November 6, 2017, in conjunction with the 42nd anniversary of the Green March. In his speech, the monarch emphasized Morocco’s established principles and frame of reference. The Moroccan official added that all the parties who played a major role in creating the Western Sahara issue must engage in settling the four-decade-long conflict, referring to Algeria. Ynja also commended King Mohammed VI’s development model for the Moroccan southern provinces and the application of advanced regionalization. Ynja added that Dakhla, the gateway to Africa, has seen development progress at different levels including education, health, industry, and tourism. Dakhla is one of the most attractive national tourist destinations. Furthermore, the Moroccan southern city is now accessible by air from Casablanca, with ten flights per week. The city is also connected to Las Palmas (Canary Islands) with two direct flights, and to Paris with one flight per week.

Rabat- While protesters have been flooding the eastern city of Jerada to decry social inequalities, local authorities are still promising to close all abandoned mines. Secretary-general of the region’s prefecture Abderrazak El Gourji told French news agency AFP that the city of Jerada has more than 3,200 wells, 200 to 300 of which are active. “The others are abandoned and present a clear danger–they will all be closed,” he said. Wave of protests have flooded the eastern city Jerada since December 2017, after the death of four local miners. Tensions, however, mounted last week between protesters and law enforcement, which resulted in the arrest of several demonstrators. Demonstrations are mainly voicing dissatisfaction over social disparities, which led many people to risk their lives in the abandoned mines. Several videos circulating on social media show violent clashes between security forces, which erupted last Wednesday. Nine people were reportedly arrested during the clashes. Several bodies condemned the security forces crackdowns, calling the law enforcement to “stop using excessive force” against peaceful protesters. Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa said that “The authorities must allow peaceful protest by prioritising the safety of protesters. People should be free to exercise their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and security forces should never be allowed to use excessive force against protesters.” Amnesty International is not the only body that raised concerns over the arrests of protesters. In a statement published today, the Party of Progress and Socialism (PPS) directed a written question to Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit regarding the “security approach” applied in Jerada against protesters on Wednesday, March 14. The party said that such an approach creates panic among citizens, urging the Ministry of Interior to adopt communication and dialogue approaches in order to solve the situation. The PPS leader, Nabil Benabdellah, who is currently in Russia to observe the recent presidential election wrote on his Facebook yesterday, “I am following with great concern the painful and unacceptable events in Jerada. I Strongly condemn all acts of violence, and call for the activation of dialogue tofind appropriate solutions to the legitimate demands of citizens.”  
 The protesters in Jerada are demanding alternative sources of employment. Meanwhile, the government has been pledging several development projects for the benefit of the eastern region. After a recent cabinet meeting held last week in Rabat, Morocco Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi offered a press conference emphasizing that the government is creating ambitious economic alternatives for the former mining town to respond to inhabitants’ demands for improved social conditions.

Rabat- “Love a Muslim Day” letters are now being shared on social media in response to the anonymous hate letters recently sent to random UK households circulated under the title, “Punish a Muslim Day.” These “love letters” represent acts of kindness to counter the  malicious ““Punish a Muslim Day” letters, which incited recipients to commit verbal and physical violence against Muslim communities. “Love a Muslim Day” letters were devised by activist Shahab Adris of the charity Muslim Engagement and Development, which seeks to counter Islamophobia,, reported BBC and Bristol Post news site. The letter imitates “Punish a Muslim Day” in its format, but lists acts of “kindness” to show Muslims: “They have loved you. They have made you so many curries and kebabs […] only you can show your appreciation, only you have the power. Don’t be a normal person. Be a special person. Show your love,” it reads and lists 10 points for smiling at a Muslim, 25 points for throwing flowers at a Muslim, […] and 2500 points for buying a Hajj package for a Muslim family-“a lifetime trip to Mecca.” Adris told BBC that he was disgusted at the content and had the idea to “turn [the] letter on its head.” “Some of the responses I’ve seen from the Muslim community have been really positive, but the most remarkable thing has been getting responses from people who are not Muslim, saying they will do something with a Muslim colleague,” he said. Bristol Police reported that they haven’t received any more reports about “Punish a Muslim Day” letters,though they are still  monitoring the hate letters as a safety precaution, according to Bristol Post.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat- The 17th edition of women’s symbolic tribunal held in Tangier on March 17 highlighted the “feminization of poverty” through testimonies of women working under inhumane conditions. The secretary general of Union of Women’s action (UAF) section in Tangier, Hakima Cherkaoui, said that the tribunal  seeks to break the silence on women’s suffering, and noted that “women generally lack protection, face multiple constraints, and are deprived of rights in the workplace.” In a statement to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Cherkaoui asserted that this event relies on unveiling testimonies  of the struggles women endure in an effort to earn a living. “As Moroccan citizens and activists, we aim to preserve women’s rights through these symbolic hearings,” Cherkaoui added. Cherkaoui further maintains that Moroccan women have yet to attain all their economic rights, as they face more constraints in the labor market than men. In another intervention, UAF’s Secretary General for Tetouan, Halima Larbi, stressed that although poverty affects large sections of the population, it affects twice as many women as it does men. Larbi asserted that with the exception of Tangier, the majority of cities in the region lack factories and businesses to absorb women’s unemployment. This dire lack of employment has driven many women to smuggle through the Spanish borders, thus becoming virtual “human mules.” These women have no rights to  protect them against the inhumane working conditions, and the reportedly cruel treatment of the Spanish authorities, and are forced to risk their lives in a last-ditch attempt to economically survive Larbi also maintained that the statistics do not reflect the reality of widespread poverty among women in rural and semi-rural areas, noting that society discriminates against women and deprives them of their economic rights and the chance at a better life—especially because  families typically favor boys’ education. Following poignant testimonies of victims of socio-economic discrimination ( arbitrary dismissal, harassment, inheritance problems), the hearing was closed with symbolic verdicts. As a UAF event, Women’s Symbolic Court is an important tool for  mobilizing for women’s rights in Morocco.  Calling for women’s rights since 1983, UAF is a non-profit organization which started as an informal group under the name of “8 March Movement,” in reference to International Women’s Day. The group has since developed into an organized movement and became UAF in 1987.

Rabat – The lack of security cooperation between Morocco and Algeria remains an ongoing concern for the head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame. In a recent interview, with the French-based magazine Jeune Afrique, Khiame has echoed his past statements regarding the absence of security between Morocco and its eastern neighbor, Algeria. According to Khiame, this issue provides terrorist groups with a propitious climate to develop terrorist activities in the region. The alarming security situation in the Sahel remains one of the main concerns that Khiame has been discussing in almost all his interviews and statements. The region has become a safe zone for certain terror cells, including AQIM and ISIS, that have been facing security crackdowns from law enforcement in Middle Eastern conflict areas. These terror groups, according to Khiame are not the only organizations that pose a threat to the stability and security of the region. “The Polisario can also be considered as a terrorist organization in this region,” said the BCIJ chief. The counter-terror office has managed to identify more than a hundred of the Polisario Front members, who are operating in AQIM “along which they have been involved in attacks in northern Mauritania.” In a February interview with Le Monde, Khiame verified that Morocco works with its partners to efficiently exchange information about binationals tied to terrorist cells. “We have liaison officers in partner countries and Western liaison officers here in Morocco,” he said. Khiame, however, has expressed his concerns over the lack of cooperation between Morocco and Algeria. “The problem is the absence of collaboration from the Algerians and the existence of an area controlled by a terrorist group,” he said, referring to the Polisario Front. Khiame’s recent interview followed similar statements given to the Casablanca-based news source Le Reporter, in which he denounced security threats in the Sahel. In the interview, Khiame also explained the overlap between terrorist groups and drug trafficking criminals. Speaking about the security threats in the Sahel region, the BCIJ chief said that illegal activity serves as a means of escaping from poverty for many separatists living in Tindouf in southern Algeria. Many of the same separatist groups are members of terrorist organizations, including Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Morocco’s Security Strategy on the Move According to the security official, the number of terror cells dismantled in Morocco decreased from 21 in 2015 to 19 in 2016, adding that the 2015-2016 period was marked by the revival of the terrorism phenomenon all over the world. Khiame added that Morocco’s strategy has been always based on anticipation and prevention. The BCIJ boss, however, did not deny that terrorist risks are still present in Morocco. Referring to Moroccan-ISIS members, Khiame said that 1,668  Moroccans have joined ISIS, some of whom fought in battles against coalition forces. He added that his office has no idea about their number yet. “All of these individuals are known to our services and will be arrested if they try to return to the country,” he said.

Rabat – Morocco and Qatar representatives recently concluded a series of strategic agreements, aimed at strengthening and growing the relationship between the two countries.  The agreements included in the areas of media and communications, education, agriculture, industry, and counterterrorism. Additionally, the countries made a maritime agreement, which aims to facilitate trade between Morocco, Qatar, and other countries in the region. Normally, such agreements, while a positive development for both states, would not be anything out of ordinary. However, in light of the Gulf crisis – the stand-off between Doha and the Anti-Terror Quartet (KSA, UAE, Egypt, and Bahrain), marked by a naval, land, and air blockade against Qatar – Morocco’s growing closeness with Qatar may raise some eyebrows, especially as Morocco continues to maintain good relations with the rest of the GCC. Morocco’s dedication to maintaining its own independent policy is laudable and marked by two central issues: first, identifying as an African, rather than a Middle Eastern country, and second, focusing on garnering support for its position of Western Sahara. Qatar sides with Morocco on that issue; the other countries are supportive of Algeria, perhaps in part due to its membership in OPEC. The United States, too, has tried to maintain a balanced position on the crisis, but for different reasons. From the US perspective, a weakened GCC invites proliferation of additional threats, including jihadists, and further empowers the expansionist Iran. Therefore, under now-former Secretary of State Tillerson, the US strategy, initially critical of Qatar’s alleged intransigence regarding countering Islamist organizations, involved first pressuring Qatar into signing memoranda of understanding where Qatar obliged to withdraw its support for Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, and others, but later shifted towards conflict resolution mood. Much of the US pressure is now on the ATQ to lift the blockade against Qatar and patch up the relations inside the GCC. There is reason to believe, however, that even in the unlikely case that were to happen (and there is no evidence that the ATQ is about to lift the blockade), Qatar itself is interested in a more muscular and independent foreign policy and would not be satisfied with the return to status quo. Rather, it is looking to align itself with stronger actors, and assert its own interests wherever and whenever possible. Despite Qatar’s claims that the blockade pushed it more in the direction of Iran, for instance, Qatar and Iran have had growing relations preceding the blockade; further, Iran, is not the only country with which Qatar has grown closer. In the past, it has tried to maintain relations with a multitude of state and non-state actors, which frequently ended in a conflict of interest and has gotten Qatar in trouble on multiple fronts. Having perhaps, learned a lesson in diplomacy from these experiences, Qatar is now looking to build long-term bilateral relations with a wide range of rising state actors, including the United States,  Iran, Turkey, Sudan, and now Morocco, with the hope that deepening these relationships will bring it out of the shadows of Saudi Arabia and the GCC, and establish it as an independent and responsible actor, fully accountable for its own fate. Its strategy differs slightly from the recent past, where Qatar has tried to play all sides equally. Now it is more selective and strategic in choosing which countries are more in line with protecting its own interests, and less likely to try to direct its foreign policy. Although Iran has the geographic advantage and the size to pressure Qatar on a number of fronts, it also needs Qatar as a more acceptable diplomatic proxy, for instance. Qatar is also utilizing the recently signed MoU with US as a way to legitimize itself through more public relations with Israel on the Gaza reconstruction issue, and with the US through strategic annual dialogues. Morocco is central to Qatar’s interests, because it provides an important foothold to Africa. Until recently, Qatar’s role in Africa has been limited to financing Iranian and mostly Turkish deals and soft influence in countries such as Sudan. Qatar was recently accused by Egypt of engineering a crisis with Sudan and Ethiopia over the Renaissance Dam and water shortage related issues, which was the first sign of Qatar’s interest in expanding and strengthening its own independent policy in Africa. Last year’s visit to six African countries by top level officials, including Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani cemented the emergence of Qatar’s own pivot to Africa, where it seeks to create relationships beyond supporting stronger state actors. Therefore, those who believe that Qatar is merely a pawn of Iran and Turkey, are severely misconstruing these engagements, as Qatar seeks to be a lot more than just that – however, if alliances with “mentor” states will give it platform for furthering its agenda, Doha will certainly embrace them. Morocco is a rising star in Africa, and mostly recently reengaged in the African Union, while also seeking to shift its identity towards the continent, and to strengthen, grow, or build new relationships with other African countries on a variety of business, defense, cultural, religious, and security matters, including providing valuable counterterrorism assistance, as well as being a role model for problem-solving and social mobility, to key Western African countries, such as Mali. For that reason, for newcomers seeking to enter the “market”, Morocco is seen as the winning ticket. Morocco is rapidly modernizing; battling corruption; and engaging in a plethora of international engagements that are quickly propelling it towards t he international scene, which in turn, makes it more appealing for new friends. At first glance, however, Qatar’s outreach may seem disconcerting to the United States. After all, if Qatar continues to strengthen its bilateral relationships with other countries, and promote an assertive foreign policy, that may very well inhibit any motivations it might yet have to return to the GCC, and repair its relationships with the ATQ. Rather than distancing itself from bad actors, it will continue to grow closer to them. And furthermore, with additional friends and trade contracts, Qatar may choose to disregard the blockade altogether, so whatever pressure the blockade may have asserted, Qatar will render null by finding ways around it. And if the aims of the blockade have been to prevent bad actors from taking advantage of the GCC’s liberal open border policy among its members, the new trade routes Qatar is developing with Morocco, threaten that effort as well. In other words, anything that strengthens Qatar’s foreign policy agenda may be a net negative because it ultimately enables Qatar’s worst instincts and entrenches its opposition to any sort of compromise with the ATQ, which the United States states views as vital regional allies. Looking below the surface, however, there may be more to these developments than meets the eye. First, if there is any sort of dissatisfaction either by the United States, or the ATQ, it has not yet been made public. Morocco, on the other hand, has been very public about this relationship, in part, in an effort to underscore its independence from the Middle East and its conflicts, and in part to show that the ATQ’s policy on Algeria will have logical consequences. Morocco is becoming the sort of country that no one wants to alienate, precisely because it has been progressing in all the right ways and becoming an indispensable ally in counterterrorism, intelligence sharing, and other matters. At the same time, however, the silence over Morocco’s role in seemingly undermining the blockade may be interpreted differently. Perhaps the United States views Morocco as part of the solution, rather than a contributing problem and an enabler. Quite simply, unlike Iran and Turkey, in the estimation of the Trump administration, Morocco is precisely the kind of friend Qatar should be making. In this case, the growing relationship between the tiny notion known for its reckless diplomatic entanglements, and clumsy dealmaking, may come as somewhat of a relief to those who are concerned about its future steps, particularly in Africa. The thought is that Morocco’s genuine dedication to countering extremism may act as an insurance policy of thoughts against Qatar’s return to its past bad habits, and in fact, Qatar’s engagement with Morocco on that front could be not only objectively beneficial, but end up soothing the ATQ’s concerns. Likewise, the fact that Qatar is engaging in trade and related matters with Qatar, creates a modicum of transparency in an otherwise bewildering and mystifying situation, where the United States is left wondering, which, if any of the GCC members is open and truthful about what is really going on. Morocco has no interest in enabling extremists, smugglers, or the Iranian intelligence in their passageways to Qatar or through and around Qatar. Whatever is in the works between the two countries will probably be the best guarded and least harmful routes and trade options out of anything currently in existence. In fact, Morocco may in the future, and out of its own self-interest in securing its vessels, prove to be a guarantor of Qatar’s good faith in keeping to the MoU with the United States – because even outside the existing agreement, Morocco will likely view involvement of undesirable third parties, even in other matters outside the routes its own vessels take, as a business risk to be avoided, and for that reason, will likely be an enforcer of stringent oversight. At the same time, Qatar, is more likely to take Morocco’s concerns seriously because Morocco is not part of the ATQ kerfuffle, and does not in any way dishonor or shame Doha if it demands additional precautions as a matter of common sense. Morocco’s sturdy hand in managing this relationship is also a potentially welcome diplomatic boon. Morocco may end up playing an important role in deescalating the tensions, and allowing all the parties involved to save face.  The ATQ’s concerns are legitimate; however, if Qatar is able to engage in trade with various countries, and continues strengthening its relations with hegemonic state actors, while also potentially misleading the West about its relationships with Hamas or others, it is clearly ineffective and is putting everyone in an awkward positions. To the Trump administration, the ATQ’s insistence on the blockade as a way of pressuring Qatar seems counterproductive; it has no other solutions in bringing Qatar back to the fold, so at best the situation will continue at an impasse unacceptable to everyone. At worst, the administration will levy additional pressure on the ATQ to lift the blockade, which may add to tensions rather than resolve them. Qatar, on the other hands, does not wish to be “managed’ by the Saudis any longer; for what it’s worth, it prioritizes its new and growing stature as a serious power broker and financier of various operations,  and the GCC is no longer necessary for it to play that role, as it has new relationships that do not make additional demands on Doha. It has all the benefits of the new alliances with far few obligations and constraints. Still, if the ATQ and the United States prevail against Iran’s and Turkey’s hegemony, or if at some point, the US discovers that Qatar’s new policies run counter to US interests in Africa and the Middle East and starts putting pressure on Doha, Qatar will find itself at a serious disadvantage and will new to find a way of backing away from the edge. If and when that time comes, Morocco is the bridge towards a turn around in policy that will avoid Mexican stand-offs until the bitter end. Meanwhile the new trade agreements between Morocco and the ATQ, which, at this point may realize that they have effectively been outmaneuvered in this particular battle, may turn out to be a backchannel necessary for the slow deescalation process that could help avoid far bigger problems in the future. Future GCC meetings will likely be far less awkward if there are behind-the-scenes ongoing low level business dealings that can help pave way for the lifting of the blockade in exchange for private guarantees from Qatar, plus, perhaps, additional multilateral agreements, brokered by Morocco. Bilateral agreements at this point are not likely, for each country wishes to defend its interests with fervor. Qatar, despite having overplayed its hand multiple times in the past, and quite possibly now, will not back away from its newfound role in public. It can, however, make some modest compromises privately, that could eventually give it a lifeline away from Iran and Turkey. At the same time, and despite the overt divisions over Algeria, the Saudis appear to stay faithful to their commitment to deradicalization, and are indirectly cooperating with Morocco in that regard. After a period of  negotiations, they have more than willingly ceded a Brussels mosque back to Belgium; the mosque has long had a reputation for promoting radicalism – and the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is looking to distance the country from such associations. Whether, and how, Belgium will deal with that issue remains to be seen, but it will be in the hands of Europe, rather than the Middle East. However, given that the  Muslim Executive of Belgium is close to Morocco, which has benefited it through intelligence sharing, and all of that is well known to the Saudis, the message here may be clear. Morocco is being seen as a leader in the deradicalizaton and countextremism in Africa, and is being look to for guidance in Europe. Members of the ATQ are recognizing it as well, and rather than engaging in fruitless fights over dominance, are wisely ceding way to focus on other battles. Despite the seeming difference over the Qatar issue, the ATQ and Morocco are very likely in the near future to increase their already decent level of cooperation on a variety of fronts, and that is a good thing. For the United States, Morocco is an increasingly welcome influencer in its own rights; interestingly, it is by distancing itself from the Middle East, and its feuding factions, that Morocco turns out to be quite possibly of great importance in resolving tensions, avoiding additional drama, and providing pragmatic, credible, and respectable solutions that meet the US interests in controlling the damage from the GCC fallout and ensuring security and defense cooperation among existing and emerging security threats.

What advantages VPNs give The VPNs, in fact, offer two most important advantages: When the client buys VPN service he can navigate absolutely anonymously in the internet. It happens because his computer IP can’t be detected. Usually, exactly the contrary happens.

Rabat – Vladimir Putin won Sunday’s presidential election, receiving 73.9 percent of the vote, according to the state-run exit poll. Putin’s win was largely expected after one of his major opponents, Alexei Navalny, was barred from running in the election due to a fraud conviction. Putin was followed by Communist Party candidate Pavel Grudinin with 15.6 percent of the vote. Vladimir Zhirinovsky was third with 6.9 percent. Born in 1952, the Russian leader is the country’s longest-serving president since Joseph Stalin, who governed the Soviet Union for 30 years (1922-1952) as general secretary of the Communist Party. Putin also served as the Prime Minister of Russia from 2008 to 2012. Critics opposing Putin’s election claimed that “officials had compelled people to come to the polls to ensure that voter boredom at the one-sided contest did not lead to a low turnout,” according to News.com. The 2018 presidential election featured Putin seeking a fourth term in the Kremlin. More than 100 million citizens were registered to vote.

During his official trip, the Finnish minister will meet with several government officials from the two Maghreb nations to discuss issues related to migration and joint actions to prevent extremism, the ministry said. The Finnish ministry stressed the important role played by Morocco, traditionally a country of emigration due to its geographical location, in “shaping Africa’s migration strategy, aspiring to a holistic and common vision.” The statement added that “the Moroccan government has approved the immigration and asylum strategy aimed at a successful integration of migrants into the Moroccan society.” As migration across the central and western Mediterranean from North Africa to Europe is “clearly increasing, the role of Morocco and Tunisia as key partners of the EU is therefore important,” according to the statement. Furthermore, the Finnish official asserted that the “democratic development of Morocco and Tunisia can have a stabilizing effect” on the whole region.

Rabat – The head of Saudi Arabia’s General Sports Authority Turki Al-Sheikh has doubled down on his provocations and unfriendly comments regarding Morocco’s bid to host  the 2026 FIFA World Cup. In a new Tweet that is creating controversy, Al Sheikh, who is also advisor to Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, said tacitly that Morocco was mistaken when he choose not side with Saudi Arabia in its feud with Qatar, implying that his country would not vote for Morocco’s bid to host the World Cup. “Some people went astray. If you want support, you should seek it in Riyadh. What you are doing is wasting your time. Now ask the pseud-state to help you. A message from the Gulf to the Ocean,” Al Sheikh said in his Tweet. ???? ?? ???? ??????? ??? ???? ????? ????? ?????? ?? ?????? ?? ???? ?????? ?????? ?? ?? ????? ????? ?? “???????” ?????…! ????? ?? ?????? ? ?????? . — ???? ?? ????? (@Turki_alalshikh) March 18, 2018  This Tweet was posted while his adviser, Tallal Al Sheikh, was meeting with the president of the Moroccan Football Federation, Faouzi Lekjaa in Rabat. Following the meeting, and in attempt to end the controversy, Tallal Al Sheikh said that Saudi Arabia would vote for Morocco’s bid on June 13. However, at the time of writing, Turki Al Sheikh, Tallal’s boss, has still not removed his Tweets. In another Tweet he posted earlier today, Al Sheikh said that none of the bidders who submitted their files to host the 2026 World Cup requested Saudi Arabia’s support. Al-Sheikh wrote on his Twitter that the World Cup bidders did not ask for Saudi Arabia’s support. However, the Saudi official did not deny that his country will support the bid that it will serve its interests. “If someone ever asks, we will look for Saudi Arabia’s interests first,” he added. ?? ???? ??? ?? ????? ?? ??? 2026

????? ??????? ?? ??? ?????? ????? …! — ???? ?? ????? (@Turki_alalshikh) March 18, 2018  Al-Sheikh echoed a statement he made in an interview with the Saudi-based sports news outlet Arriyadiyah earlier this week. “Friendship and fraternity have been very detrimental to the Saudis…what really matters to me is that the 2026 World Cup needs to be hosted in the best conditions.” A Middle East analyst who asked to speak on the condition of anonymity told MWN earlier this week that Saudi official statement is hardly surprising. “As the Saudi Crown Prince needs the support of the Trump administration to consolidate his power, the interest of Saudi Arabia lies in supporting the US-led bid, thus returning the favor to an American administration that has proved instrumental in his rise to power,” he added.

The Italian giant will host the participants of the international forum, who will discuss several themes during their coastal journey northward. The Crans Montana Forum, which continues until March 20, is a gathering of nearly one thousand participants from more than 40 countries. Several panel discussions are being held covering important topics including security and sustainable development, renewable energies, agriculture and the maritime sector. The Crans Montana Forum has become a must-attend international event that brings together high-level political decision-makers, representatives of the business community, intellectuals, civil society activists from all walks of life, as well as opinion makers from all corners of the world. Participants to the previous edition have described the event as “an opportunity to promote peace and dialogue,” while hailing the modern infrastructures in Dakhla as “a model for the future of Morocco and Africa.”

The budget is set to cover the construction and renovation work of several infrastructure projects that must meet the criteria of FIFA. During his presentation, Elalamy said that Morocco must have 14 stadiums, 130 training grounds and 12 advanced health facilities, all of which must meet international standards for the 2026 tournament. Elalamy, who is also the Minister of Industry and Trade, said the country needs to build accommodation facilities that create a minimum of 5,500 rooms.
The chairman of the committee added that the infrastructure work will include the renovation of five existing stadiums across the country. According to the Moroccan official, the North African country has all the assets to meet FIFA’s requirements. “The hotel capacity of the kingdom is growing at an annual rate of seven percent. With six percent growth, we can significantly exceed the 5,500 rooms required by FIFA in 2026,” he said. Each stadium needs to be close to at least two training grounds and a hotel that includes 200 rooms. According to Elalamy, this is “achievable by 2026.” Regarding Morocco’s strategy, the bid committee chairman said that Morocco “integrated the needs of FIFA in our strategy taking into account the different requirements that the Moroccan file has to answer.”

Rabat – Hezbollah’s social and religious offensive of propagating the Shiite ideology among Moroccans living in Ivory Coast has recently met with a firm Moroccan reaction, a governmental counter-offensive to keep and maintain Morocco’s religious thrall on its citizens living abroad. According to Assabah in its March 18 and 19 issue, Hezbollah tried to capitalize on the huge number of Lebanese established in the West African country in order to infiltrate Moroccan circles in the country, with the purpose of preaching and converting Moroccans to Shiite Islam.  According to Assabah, the ideological battle was primarily fought in schools, many of which, built by powerful Lebanese businessmen, are educational hubs for Moroccans and other Muslims in the Ivorian capital. Assabah explains in its report that while schools built by some Lebanese nationals are “good and affordable”, the unseen cost of sending kids there resides in kids’ exposure, during religious courses, to Shiite creeds and ideology. Knowing that Hezbollah used similar tactics with Moroccans in Belgium, Assabah explains, Moroccan authorities took appropriate measures this time to thwart this religious conversion project. Beyond the traditional economic activities that many Hezbollah-leaning Lebanese are engaged in throughout the continent, it seems, according to reports, that the global vision is to expand Shiite Islam by building cultural and spiritual channels, especially via schools. As far as diplomacy is concerned, Assabah further noted, many of the so-called Lebanese businessmen have allegedly invested considerable funds in lobbying activities aimed at containing the success of Morocco’s Africa agenda, an indirect way of countering Morocco’s ‘moderate’ Sunni Islam. Morocco’s counteroffensive made use of the King’s repeated visits in the continent to reinforce religious cooperation with many fellow African countries. More practically, as affordable schools are said to be the most effective tool in Hezbollah’s traditional proselytizing missions, Moroccan authorities have offered to take in charge 50 to 70% of school fees for Moroccans in Ivory Coast. This policy should enable the government to take up to 99% of Moroccan children out of Shiite schools, according to estimates.

Rabat – Mock Muslims, humiliate them, deter them from infiltrating our country, vandalize their mosques—these are some of the lessons an American mum is teaching her kids. She steadily maintains in her now infamous Facebook live videos that this name-calling and Islamophobia is her way of “teaching her kids to be Patriots”. While many Americans are pleading with president Trump to build bridges, not walls, two mums in Tempe, Arizona, are intent on wagging personal vendettas against all Muslims in America, whom they accuse of invading the country with “their Islamic laws.” In three obnoxious footages that recently leaked online, Facebook users Tahnee Gonzales and Elisabeth Dauenhauer are shown in a car giving racist and inflammatory lectures to three unidentified kids in the background. “Muslims use our constitution against us and get everything for free, such as food, assistance, and housing,” Gonzales is heard saying. She pauses, turns towards ‘her’ children in the back of the car, and then says, referring to Muslims: “They don’t even work”, something to which a little girl in the background answers, again referring to Muslims: “They smell like goats.” And they all burs out laughing, as they continue their ecstatic mockery of Muslims. “Look at this ugly mosque here,” says Gonzales, the trip’s cheer leader, as their car arrives on site at one mosque they intend to vandalize that day. She points to how “massively” and “illegally” Muslims are “invading” America, adding: “Muslims are nothing but evil Satan worshippers.” That day’s car trip, Gonzales says, is an excursion to a nearby mosque in Tempe, Arizona, where, as part of her “attempt to expose the evil that is happening in our backyards,” she’d be showing her children what Muslims “truly are like”, and how they [Muslims] intend to invade and occupy America. At the Tempe mosque, Gonzales cheers up her kids as they loot and vandalize the mosque’s funeral van and some parts inside the mosque. “Look at these patriots,” she says, pointing to the kids as they keep on vandalizing the cult place. Gonzales, who misses no opportunity to tell her numerous Facebook live viewers the sense of her actions, says that the trip to the mosque was “to collect as much information”, to expose mosques, and teach the children how to be true American patriots. “We’re coming after you. We, the people. We’re exposing you. You guys stand for evil and nothing but evil”, Gonzales is heard addressing a worshipper at the Tempe mosque. At which point a little girl is heard telling a boy: “be careful because Muslims are waiting to rape you.” Although Tahnee Gonzales and Elisabeth Dauenhauer have been arrested by local police and charged with “felony third-degree burglary”–with “hate crime” a possible crime for which they may be convicted, observers have been raising serious concerns about how this is not an isolated incident. To them, the freedom and entitlement that people such as Gonzales now feel in publicly expressing such hateful speeches is an indication of how increasingly difficult it has become to be a Muslim or a minority in Trump’s America. The “litany of disinformation” and hate speech, the anti-Islam campaign, none of this is new, they say. Instead, what is new and “jarring” is how kids are being thought, in the public eye, to hate fellow Americans based on their religion. “What really affected me the most is seeing those young children getting real-life lessons in hate… Those innocent 5-, 6-year old children are now really learning hate from their parents. It’s really disheartening,” said an acting imam at the Tempe Islamic Centre. Some local reports have revealed that the two women are members of the Patriot Movement AZ, an alt-right activist group said to be fueled and energized by Trump’s foul language, especially his anti-immigrants and Islamophobic ramblings. In February 8, this year, The Guardian ran a long piece entitled The fight for the right to be a Muslim in America. In it, the reporter decried the disheartening double standards and the institutional exclusion that American Muslims deal with on a daily basis, especially in recent years where people who dislike Islam and Muslims feel more entitled to do so because of a president keen on praising and maintaining America’s Christian roots. With public vilifications of Muslims such as the one recently experienced in Tempe, it seems that being Muslim in Trump’s America is indeed a right that is fiercely fought for, especially considering the stigma that the president puts on Muslims in his public speeches.

Rabat – On Saturday, Morocco’s 2026 World Cup Bid Committee unveiled the details of Morocco’s World Cup bid book submitted on Thursday in Zurich.  In a press conference held in Casablanca, the chairman of the committee, Moulay Hafid Elalamy, discussed the key aspects of the Moroccan bid, including Morocco’s proportional and lean campaign for the massive football tournament, the slogan (“Together for One Goal”) and the official Morocco 2026 website. According to Elalamy, Morocco’s bid to host the FIFA World Cup is entirely in line with the economic and social development strategy established by the country under the leadership of King Mohammed VI. Elalamy, who is also the Minister of Trade and Industry, emphasized the notable work done by all the contributors and national partners to prepare a comprehensive and complete dossier to meet FIFA’s requirements. The official also introduced the cities that will be hosting World Cup matches if Morocco’s bid is selected over the competing North American joint bid from the United States, Canada and Mexico. Elalamy has also promised a remarkable World Cup to celebrate the best of football. The World Cup in Morocco, according to the committee chairman will be beneficial for soccer supporters, FIFA, Morocco, the world and Africa. The North African country will need to invest almost USD 16 billion to organize the massive tournament, including stadium construction, transportation, medical facilities and hotel construction. So much to be done?  In order to host the World Cup, Morocco needs to build more stadiums that will meet FIFA standards. Moroccan bid planners are determined to create a budget of USD 3 billion exclusively for stadium building and to refurbish the five already existing stadiums. The country is planning to build nine new stadiums as well as training facilities. Another USD 3 billion will be devoted to accommodations, which will include the addition of more than 30,000 rooms to receive football fans, national delegations and the 48 participating World Cup teams. According to the sports news outlet ESPN, one of the new stadiums being planned will be a 93,000-seat home for the national soccer team in Casablanca. The facility would also host the opening and final games during the 2026 World Cup. Stadiums of about 46,000-seat capacity will be also built in Oujda and Tetouan, according to the bid committee. Other new stadiums of similar capacity are planned for Casablanca, Marrakech, El Jadida, Meknes, Nador and Ouarzazate. On Saturday, the organizers wrote on their official Twitter account that “Morocco 2026’s six ‘Legacy Modular Stadiums’ are specifically designed to be downscaled after the tournament to provide a meaningful, lasting legacy for both Morocco and Africa.” #Morocco2026‘s six ‘Legacy Modular Stadiums’ are specifically designed to be downscaled after the tournament to provide a meaningful, lasting legacy for both Morocco ?? and Africa ?#FootballForAll #TogetherForOneGoal pic.twitter.com/G2t5Z0GVnL — Morocco 2026 (@Morocco2026_EN) March 17, 2018  The committee is also planning to renovate the five existing stadiums in five cities: Marrakech (95,565), Agadir (46,048), Fez (46,092), Rabat (46,500) and Tangier (65,000). The decision as to where to locate stadiums was done with transportation and infrastructure considerations as key priorities. The committee selected the cities, all of which are located less than 550 kilometers from Casablanca. All are conveniently connected in terms of road, rail and air transport. This important factor will provide optimal transport conditions for players and fans. The committee also revealed the designs of the stadiums to be built for the World Cup.
 World Cup Benefits  Elalamy underscored the benefits and the significant socio-economic impacts of organizing the World Cup in Morocco. The tournament, according to the Moroccan official, will serve as a catalyst for further development and will reinforce a dynamic of social and economic progress for both Morocco and Africa. How the World Cup is Important for Morocco?  According to FIFA, important criteria include “the sustainable benefits generated for the host member association and country well before, during and long after the event.”For Morocco, the benefits of bidding or hosting the massive tournament are significant. According to FIFA, the tournament can serve as a catalyst for new and improved facilities to support the development of the game at all levels, it can also enhance higher quality football development programs. The tournament can also provide the host country with greater commercial and investment activities and increase cooperation with international bodies and the government. “While winning a bid is the ultimate goal, the bidding process can also have real value in its own right,” FIFA added. Morocco is a Football Planet  In an interview given to the British news outlet The Guardian before Morocco’s 2018 World Cup qualifier win against Ivory Coast, Mustapha Hadji, the former international footballer, spoke about Morocco’s passion for football. Hadji, who is also the Moroccan national football team’s assistant coach, said that “After Islam, football is our second religion,” adding that the nation is a “real football country.” “Football is magic. it can do things that no other sport can,” Hadji told The Guardian. “It can make you cry in one second and make you feel in love the next. Politics cannot do that.”

Rabat – In a statement made to the press on the sidelines of the ongoing Crans Montana Forum, French politician and National Assembly member Elisabeth Guigou has expressed her full support to Morocco’s territorial integrity. After expressing her gratitude for being invited to take part in the fourth edition of the international forum in Dakhla, the President of the Anna Lindh Foundation lauded Morocco’s comprehensive development program established to preserve and strenghten its territorial integrity. “It is the first time for me in the Moroccan Sahara and I am very delighted,” said Guigou. The French official also lauded the long history of bilateral relations linking France and Morocco, describing it as an “exceptional relation.” “There are historic connections, cultural values and a geographical proximity” between the two countries, she added. Speaking about Morocco’s stance on the Western Sahara conflict, Guigou said that the autonomy initiative submitted by Morocco to the United Nations is an effective plan to end the four-decade-long conflict. “The plan proposed by Morocco at the United Nations must really be the basis of a peaceful settlement of this conflict, which, unfortunately, has lasted for too long,” she added. According to the French official, the conflict is “weighing on the economic development of the region.” Saluting Morocco’s return to the African Union, Guigou also said on Friday that the return is the result of the “decisive” personal involvement of King Mohammed VI and a “notable success” for the kingdom. She also expressed her wish to see “this return contribute to the resolution of several problems of the continent.” Commenting on Morocco’s development strategy, Guinou added that the provinces of southern Morocco saw significant economic development in recent years, owing to Morocco’s economic and human development strategy. The Crans Montana Forum is being marked by the participation of several French officials, including Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Sarkozy, who is a special guest for this year’s edition, lauded Morocco’s recent efforts to revitalize its domestic politics, as well as its leadership position in Africa. Sarkozy described the north African country as “an African power.”

Rabat- Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani announced Saturday that he is leading a Moroccan delegation that is taking part in the 8th edition of the World Water Forum, which is being held in Brazil’s capital, Brasilia, from March 18 to 23. A statement issued by the State Secretariat for Water said that during the opening ceremony of the world’s largest water security conference, Othmani is expected to present the sixth edition of the Hassan II Great World Water Prize to a winner (yet to be named) who has carried out significant and relevant work in water-related issues. The prize was jointly established by the World Water Council and Morocco in 2000, in memory of the late King Hassan II, and in recognition of his policy of cooperation and solidarity for the preservation and sustainable management of water resources. Morocco’s official delegation, which includes State Secretary for Water, Charafat Afilal, as well as several government officials and water resource experts, will participate in this year’s forum which is held under the theme “Sharing Water.” The Moroccan delegation will also take part in the exhibit entitled “Water Planet”. The exhibit highlights the Moroccan experience in water resources management, as well as to share experiences and best practices on water-related issues, including water and food security, the green economy, sustainable development, water in Africa, and the lack of water as a regional Mediterranean concern. Cooperation and collaboration between the private and public sectors will also be discussed. This year’s forum will feature more than 35,000 participants from multi-stakeholder backgrounds participating in innovative learning sessions, intense debates and interactive workshops. Beginning in 1997, the World Water Forum has been organized every three years by the World Water Council, an international multi-stakeholder platform organization whose mission is to mobilize action on critical water issues at all levels, including among key decision makers, by engaging people in debate and challenging conventional thinking around water issues. The Council also focuses on the political dimensions of water security, adaptation and sustainability.

By Mohamed Reddad Rabat – On a recent visit to Morocco, I happened to be one of those unfortunate souls stranded in a small town for a few days in the Atlas Mountains following the storm that dumped an unprecedented amount of white flakes, an amount unseen in decades. Fortunately, I had relatives who took me in, just like many area residents who accommodated scores of stranded travelers. Their misery cannot be equated with the unhappiness of those inhabitants who were cut off from the outside world because of the treacherous roads. Their mud houses leaked or collapsed altogether, their livestock perished, and their ailing loved ones and/or their pregnant women could not make it to the already meager health facilities. They were left to fight and improvise on their own.  When civil society took to social media and put pressure on the authorities, help finally came—but the damage had already been done. Natural disasters such as this one do happen, and the northern vortex that swept through Morocco and wreaked havoc on particularly hard-to-reach regions cannot be avoided. But this destructive event highlights the marginalization of these residents who toil to make the rugs we feast our eyes on and the coveted meats and organic foods we savor. These inhabitants are survivalists and all they need is a little attention; their demands are so simple that the cost to bring them some relief is minimal and infrequent. One could argue, however, that relying on government handouts is not the way to deal with the problem, and rightfully so.  So, what can be done? Sustainable projects would promote tourism and hospitality. These regions are endowed with breathtaking scenery and some of the most hospitable people in the country. Therefore, investing in roads and bridges would not only help ease the strain on these inhabitants, but it would bring them opportunities that would create jobs and ultimately promote financial security. That could lead to less reliance on government handouts, particularly during the harsh winter months. No one can deny the potential damage that this may cause to an already fragile ecosystem. But is that greater than the damage that these vulnerable citizens currently sustain? Redistributing resources would be a step in the right direction. Allowing these inhabitants to experience abject poverty—not because they are unwilling to work, but because they are cut off from the rest of the country—would mean shortchanging them, especially in a country that is soon to launch the first high-speed train in Africa.  We have seen efforts by the government to convey electricity and potable water to these regions, but more needs to be done to bring relief and dignity to hard-to-reach regions to promote self-reliance and stability. The authorities should put measures in place that would create immediate relief in case another natural catastrophe strikes.

Rabat- The Moroccan southern city Dakhla, known for the kingdom’s most attractive venues for wave riders, is progressively becoming a large tourist destination, as overnight stays in classified accommodation establishments increased by 20 percent in 2017, compared with the previous year. According to statistics from the regional tourism delegation, the total number of nights registered in 2017 was 116,798, with an increase of 20 percent compared to 2016. The biggest share goes to foreign tourists who spent a total 85,906 nights, while nationals spent 30,892 nights. By nationality, France ranks first with 53,866 overnight stays, marking an 8 percent increase, followed by the Spanish and Belgian markets, which are respectively 30 and 103 percent higher than in 2016. The Dutch market has witnessed a significant change in the number of overnight stays, which jumped from 397 to 1942 in 2017.  The region is also contributing to growing tourism, adding an 11 percent boost for the tourism industry nationally.   During a conference featuring the regional council and the North-South Action Association, Regional Director of Tourism Daïf Allah Endour said that, despite its current limited capacity of 580 rooms, the region has witnessed a steady increase in tourist arrivals, adding that it intends to double its accommodation capacity by 2020, especially that it is attracting more and more kitesurfers from across the world. He added, “We welcome a lot of tourists from Northern and Central Europe who come in big numbers to practice water sports,” and that the city is also capitalizing on the sports to attract more tourists. The French newspaper Le Figaro once said that water sports make Dakhla, a “successful tourist destination,” which has become not only “a paradise for surfers but also a destination for lovers of the desert.”  With water temperatures at 25 degrees Celsius throughout the year, the southern city is an essential destination and a heaven for surfer and water sports, in addition to beach lovers.  To enhance its touristic appeal and make the region of Dakhla-Oued Eddahab Morocco’s ecological tourism hub, the council of the region has recently announced that it set aside MAD 8 billion to move factories away from the city, including sardine plants, and create a “West Africa Free Zone,” located some 40 kilometers from Dakhla, as part of a regional development plan worth MAD 17.7 billion. Furthermore, Dakhla is now accessible by air from Casablanca, with ten flights per week. The city is also connected to Las Palmas (Canary Islands) with two direct flights, and to Paris with one flight per week. During the conference, Endour ensured that by 2020, the Moroccan airline Royal Air Maroc(RAM) will offer 14 flights Dakhla-Casablanca per week, in addition to its accessibility via a 550 kilometer-long highway from Agadir.

Rabat –  Football is deemed Morocco’s national sport for a reason. More than sport, the beautiful is life-sustaining tribute to the beauty of shared life, of solidarity, of comradeship…. It sustains and gives life to ties and attachments that transcends the traditional dividing lines of daily life. In fact, for Moroccans, or the crushing majority of them, the beautiful game is a mindset, a culture, a philosophy, a way of loving and expressing it. The list could go on and on, because when it comes to football, Moroccans fans are indescribable. Legends like the late Abdelmajid Edoulmi, Badou Zaki, Hamid El Hazzaz, Ahmed Faras, Mohammed Timoumi, Aziz Bouderbala, Noureddine Neybet, Mustapha Hadji, Youssouf Hadji, Mehdi Benatia, and so many others are also part of Moroccan popular myth for a reason: the beautiful game is a culmination of love publicly expressed. It is emotionally binding and yet humanely liberating. The sport has broadened social bridges, created platforms for many to express themselves and climb the social ladder, lifting many out of poverty. It has transformed lives and given hope to many. Moroccan football simultaneously embodies Moroccanness and universality, thus spurring a spirit of togetherness and harmony and peace, despite how noisy and repulsively nationalistic it can get at times. Yes, in Morocco, football provokes, but it also unifies and inspires, because it is more than just a sport. And that is what it makes it so beautiful and inspirational!

Rabat – Moroccan kickboxing star Badr Hari inaugurated the Mohamed Abed Al-Jabri School, located in his hometown Kenitra on Friday.  Pictures of the Moroccan champion sharing moments of joy with the pupils of the Abed Al-Jabri school have gone viral on social media in recent days.  Hari’s funding for the school expansion is his first philanthropic act in the kingdom:  in 2015, Hari donated 200 sheep to needy families in conjunction with Aid Al Adha. This latest project from the Badr Hari Association covered an expansion of 12 new classrooms and “a playground where students can enjoy sports and fun activities,” according to the association. With over than 450 pupils, the school had only six classrooms prior to Hari’s intervention. The champion’s successes continue to add up in the ring: on March 3, the “Golden Boy” beat Hesday Gerges in a rematch that fans had been anticipating for nearly eight years. After his victory, the “Golden Boy” dedicated his win to Morocco, crying “Morocco I love you.”

Rabat – Another round of demonstrations ignited across Jerada province on Friday, when four more local miners died while working in abandoned mine shafts. The social protests in Jerada are mainly voicing dissatisfaction about social disparities in the region. The situation in the eastern region escalated after a clash broke out between law enforcement and protesters on Wednesday, resulting in several injuries among security forces.  The prefecture of Jerada issued a statement earlier this week, saying that several members law enforcement were injured during an unauthorized Jerada sit-in, defying the Ministry of Interior decision to ban demonstrations in the region.  The ministry’s decision, however, did not prevent protesters from rallying in the streets of Jerada, correspondents told French news agency AFP. Defiance of Ban Against Protests?  Following the protests that erupted on Wednesday in spite of the ban on unauthorized protests in the city, thousands of people marched on Friday to denounce security crackdowns and the arrest of nine protesters. The protests began with a small group, who were then joined by hundreds of demonstrators, including children and women. Thousands marched, voicing their objections to social disparities and waving Moroccan flags, while others chanted the national anthem. Morocco’s government, however, remains firm on its decision to ban unauthorized protests.. In a recent cabinet meeting held on Thursday in Rabat, officials emphasized that security forces have the unconditional right to intervene to enforce the law in accordance with legal provisions in the region. After the cabinet meeting, Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi offered a press conference, during which he condemned the fake photographs of protesters injured by Jerada law enforcement that have been circulating on social media. According to El Khalfi, the government is creating ambitious economic alternatives for the former mining town to respond to inhabitants’ demands for improved social conditions. Friday’s demonstration came only a few days after the government released a statement, announcing its decision to ban unauthorized protests. However, El Khalfi stressed that peaceful demonstrations are allowed as long as demonstrators respect the law, which prohibits acts of violence and vandalism. A New Hirak Movement? Jerada’s protests hearken back to a series of social protests known as the Hirak movement that took place in Morocco’s northern province Al Hoceima between 2016 and 2017. The protests, which made economic and social demands–such as improved infrastructure and regional demilitarization–were initially sparked by the death of fishmonger who was crushed in a garbage truck as he tried to retrieve fish confiscated by the authorities. The Al Hoceima protests were also deemed unauthorized by the Moroccan government, resulting in the arrest of more than 300 protesters, sentenced for participating in unlicensed protests and for “undermining” the country’s security. Wednesday’s protests in Jerada have resulted in the arrest of nine people so far, charged with committing violent acts against law enforcement. A statement by the prefecture of Jerada states that protesters burned five police cars and caused extensive damage to law enforcement vehicles and equipment.

Rabat – Links between Polisario separatist members and radical groups in the Sahel have been sparking global concern due to the rise of terror groups in the region. Italian academic and journalist Massimiliano Boccolini warned that the presence of  Tindouf camps and Polisario is a direct “threat to stability.” The journalist told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) on the sidelines of the ongoing  13th World Social Forum in Brazil that the “existence of the Tindouf camps and an armed Polisario militia that cooperates with jihadist organizations is a threat to stability” in the region. Massimiliano, who co-authored  “Sahara: Desert mafia groups and jihad,” recently published by Italy’s Castelvecchi, added that the direct effects of “the overlapping of criminal activities, terrorist, and separatist organizations” may affect the security and stability of the region and European states as well. Recalling an incident that occurred in 2011, when three  Europeans were kidnapped in Algeria at the Tindouf camps, the Italian academic discussed the links between separatist groups and the terrorist organizations emerging in the Sahel region. Massimiliano also discussed other crimes carried out regionally by the separatists, including “all types of trafficking” and migration issues. The Italian expert has lauded Morocco’s Autonomy Plan initiative as a potential solution to the regional discord cause be the separatist group.  According to the academic, the Autonomy Plan is the only solution to “create stability in the region.” The  13th World Social Forum is organized by the Network of Moroccan Associations in Italy (RACMI), in partnership with the African Federation in Tuscany (FAT) and the Italian Moroccan Space for Solidarity (SMIS). The symposium offered participants with the opportunity to discuss the challenges of migration and exile. During the event, the coordinator of the RACMI, Yassine Belkacem, compared the situation of refugees in Europe to that of the Sahrawis held in Tindouf camps. The “concept of the Saharawi refugee is an artificial Algerian creation instrumentalized for protest against the recovery of the Sahara by Morocco, as a result of the conclusion of the Madrid Agreement between Morocco and Spain in 1975.” Belkacem urged Europe to intervene in the situation in the same way it responds to  other refugees as “the sequestered populations in Tindouf camps are subjected to all sorts of blackmail, intimidation, separation of families, and other unbearable living conditions in the camp.” Earlier this month, Morocco’s Head of Affairs in Geneva Hassan Boukili condemned the living situation of the Sahrawi population in the Tindouf Camps, accusing Algeria of shirking its international responsibility towards the population. Speaking at the 71st session of the Standing Committee of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Boukili emphasized that Morocco’s eastern neighbor is, “the only country to oppose the implementation of all the feasible  solutions for the populations in the Tindouf camps.” Boukili has urged the international community to address the causes behind the persistence of refugee-related crises, including the militarization of Tindouf camps and the exploitation of refugees to serve Algeria’s separatist agenda.

Rabat – The 32 teams that will compete in the 2018 World Cup in Russia will battle for the title with the help of video assistant referees (VAR). FIFA approved the use of video analysis to help referees review play during the Russia World Cup on Friday. On March 3, the International Football Association (IFAB) was the first organization to “unanimously approve” the usage of the VAR during the upcoming World Cup in a meeting held in Zurich, Switzerland. FIFA’s recent approval guarantees the use of VAR in the upcoming tournament.  According to IFAB, this move “represents a new era for football with video assistance for referees helping to increase integrity and fairness in the game.” The technology of VAR was first used during a Confederation of African Football (CAF) competition during the 2018 Total African Nations Championship (CHAN),  which took place in Morocco from January 13 to February 4.  VAR was already used in football tournaments in European countries, including the U.K., Germany, and Italy, according to British news outlet BBC. FIFA’s President Gianni Infantino, who attended the meeting said, “We hope and encourage a favorable decision in this respect because we are very positive about VAR.” The 2018 World Cup is set to kickoff June 14. This year’s competition is marked by the participation of the Moroccan football team. The Atlas Lions will play their first World Cup match on June 15 against Iran, while the second game will be against Portugal on June 20. Five days later, Morocco will battle against Spain on June 25.

Rabat – Present at the fourth edition of the Crans Montana Forum, America’s Reverend Jesse Jackson joined the already long lists of prominent international figures who have been saluting Morocco’s role in promoting south-south cooperation. The icon of civil rights movements, who seized the opportunity of his opening speech at the Forum, spoke highly of the role Morocco has played in recent years to defend Africa in international fora. Reverend Jackson also said that an event such as the one Morocco organized in Dakhla is a much-needed step towards the South taking responsibility for itself. The political solutions to reduce the broadening gap between the global North and South, Jesse Jackson argued, should essentially come from the South. He also spoke of Morocco and its recent political reforms as a source of inspiration for others in Africa. In his speech, the civil rights champion put a particular emphasis on Morocco’s investments in sub-Saharan Africa, saying that with an awe-inspiring figure of $4.5 billion, Morocco is a top investor in the continent’s path towards sustainable growth and improved living standards. Jesse Jackson concluded his speech by shedding lights on the scholarships and training possibilities that Morocco has been providing for many fellow African nations. In this regard, Reverend Jackson said that the Kingdom is a “light bearer of African solidarity.”

Rabat – With Bolton’s firm position on the Western Sahara, what could this mean for the future of the conflict? Rumors are circulating that Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton, could replace current National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, which ignite negative foreign relations between the United States and North Africa. When NBC reported last week that McMaster, whom U.S. President Donald Trump has never particularly cared for, was searching for an escape from the White House, suspicions arose. This speculation gained ground when Bolton was called to the White House for a meeting with the president, Tuesday afternoon. Furthermore, the resignation of moderate economic advisor Gary Cohn following Trump’s vow to enact new tariffs on steel and aluminum marks the departure of yet another moderate conservative influence within the administration.  Although Bolton has had a foot in the Oval Office for some time now, his access to real power in the White House could turn the U.S.’s foreign policy course in a far more militarist direction. In the past, Bolton has utilized fear mongering and stretching the truth to institute policies that align with his ideology. Prior to the US invasion of Iraq, for example, he was involved in gathering intelligence on the alleged weapons mass destruction while serving as the third under the Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. Additionally, in 2002, Bolton claimed that the Cuban government was developing biological weapons, which analysts later dismissed as inaccurate. After an analyst testified to Congress about this misinformation, Bolton became infuriated and attempted to transfer the analyst to another department. Bolton’s hardline tactics pose a threat to international stability and positive relations between America and other nations–including their first ally in the region, Morocco. In 2003, Bolton took part in constructing the Baker Plan II, named after then UN special envoy James Baker, which advocated for five years of Saharan self-rule under Moroccan sovereignty, followed by a referendum vote between integration into Morocco, independence, and autonomy. Throughout his career his career, Bolton has been among the most vocal supporters for holding a referendum and has often blamed Morocco for the failure of the UN efforts to put an end to the conflict. The four-decade-long conflict is still ongoing, with both Morocco and Polisario claiming sovereignty in the region. As it stands, supporters of the Polisario Front are living in refugee camps in Tindouf in southern Algeria, where they continue to advocate for the right of self-determination in the Western Sahara. Moroccan officials, led by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, recently met with the UNSG Personal Envoy Horst Kohler in Lisbon to reexamine the Western Sahara issue. Sidi Hamdi Ould Errachid, President of the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region, and Yajna Khattat, President of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region, were both in attendance, according to a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The presence of these regional officials signifies the opening of a new dialogue among relevant stakeholders. However, if Bolton is appointed as the new US national security adviser, the power balance would likely shift, putting an end to recent progress.

Rabat – Moroccan politician Omar Balafrej has condemned the arrest of social protesters in Jerada, the home of demonstrations since December. In an interview with Moroccan news outlet Al Yaoum 24, Balafrej said that that the “barons,” who have been exploiting the coal wells–referring to the parliamentarians and council authorities– “are the ones who should be held accountable and arrested, instead of protesters who marched in the streets” in peaceful demonstrations. Balafrej told the news source that he visited the mine shafts to observe the conditions under which miners are working.  “It is as if we were in the 19th century,” he said. The member of the parliament told French news Agency AFP that “there are huge problems in this region,” adding that “it is a duty to come here and get to know this town.” Jerada’s protests started after the death of four local miners in old mine shafts. The situation in the eastern region escalated following a clash between law enforcement and protesters on Wednesday, resulting in several injuries among security forces.  On Friday, another round of demonstrations broke out across Jerada province. The Ministry of Interior released a statement on March 13, announcing its decision to ban unauthorized sit-ins and protests. However, the statement did not deter demonstrators’ willingness to rally in the streets and decry social disparities that led many people risk their lives in abandoned mine shafts.

Rabat – An Italian baby girl of Moroccan origin was hospitalized after she unwittingly swallowed a piece of hashish, local press reported.  The toddler’s father said the baby, who is under 2 years old, was rushed to the service of infants at Cesare Arrigo Hospital in Alexandria, Italy, after accidentally ingesting a portion of hashish.  Medical reports confirmed that the child is not in danger, but the Italian police is now investigating neglect and child abuse charges for the toddler’s parents. In addition to judicial authorities, the case has also been communicated to city social services. Italy has seen a rise in incidents of children ingesting hashish, as many similar cases were reported in recent years.  Last January, an eleven-month-old child from Salerno, was taken to hospital after he swallowed hashish left unattended by his father, thinking it was chocolate.  Experts say that children who accidentally ingest the drug are at risk of acute intoxication due to their ongoing mental and physical development.

Rabat – The Polisario Front announced its intention to stage provocative maneuvers in Bir Lehlou and Tifarity, two buffer zones located in northeastern Western Sahara. Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum, however, reports that these announcements are only an attention grab that uses Algerian media to publicize its ploy. The main objective of the separatist group is to provoke the Royal Armed Forces (FAR) after having lost “all legitimacy on the ground in the Tindouf camps and to mislead families restrained in the Algerian soil,” added the news source. The separatist group has staged several illegal maneuvers in the buffer zone of Guerguerat, resulting in condemnation from both the Moroccan government and the United Nations Secretary-General for Western Sahara, Antonio Guterres. Moroccan political analyst  El Moussaoui Al Ajlaoui told the news source that “this Polisario maneuver has only been mounted for media purposes without any impact on the group.”   El Ajlaoui added that the separatist front is seeking the attention of the United Nations and international public opinion.  The illegal maneuvers carried out in the buffer zones of Guerguerat are defying the decisions of the United Nations. These illegal activities, however, may reinforce Morocco’s stance in the report prepared by the UNSG Personal Envoy Horst Kohler on the Western Sahara conflict. Kohler will submit his final report to the UN Security Council in Early April. In a recent interview with MWN, Moroccan political analyst Reda El Fellah said that Polisario’s military illegal armed operations near the buffer zone of Guerguerat mirror “the state of despair” within both Polisario and its backer, Algeria.

Rabat – The fourth edition of the Crans Montana Forum opened this Friday morning in Dakhla. The forum is traditionally a major moment when Morocco exposes the extent of its grand investments in its Sahara provinces, sells its Western Sahara position on to participants. This year’s forum achieved an immense and almost unprecedented success this year, with nearly a hundred countries represented at the forum (49 African countries) and scores of businessmen and international experts. Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who was a special guest at this year’s edition, seized the opportunity during an interview to laud Morocco’s recent efforts to revitalize its domestic politics, as well as its leadership position in Africa. Hailing Morocco’s “progress and stability” in a traditionally “unstable region”, President Sarkozy described the north African country as “an African power” whose return to the African Union, “its intuitional family”, is “very important” for Africa and Morocco’s position in it. Morocco is “a major element” in the political and economic “survival” of the continent, a much-needed asset for the continent to face its numerous current challenges, he said. “The return of Morocco to the African Union is very important for Morocco as it is a bridge between Africa and Europe, but it is also very important for Africa as it is a modern economy, and a stable and democratic country that comes back to the continent’s political scene,” Sarkozy said in an interview after the opening ceremony of the Crans Montana Forum. The former French president went on to acknowledge the “political and economic transformations” that the Kingdom has witnessed in the last fifteen years. “Who can deny the progress made in the last fifteen years despite crises and difficulties? Who can question Morocco’s stability?” Sarkozy asked, visibly paying tribute to the numerous political and economic openings that Morocco has been experiencing under King Mohammed’s guidance and unceasing plea for a “modern and accountable” civil service. Talking about Morocco’s position on the Western Sahara question, Sarkozy saluted the seriousness and political feasibility of Morocco’s autonomy plan. “Morocco’s autonomy plan is credible,” he said. As for the future of Africa, of sustainable growth, and of South-South cooperation, which was a major theme at the Forum this year, Sarkozy made the case for a European “Marshal Plan” to help African governments in their respective bids to boost the continent’s growth and meet the never-ending challenges of a globalized word. “Our fates are sealed together,” Sarkozy concluded, understandably espousing a politically correct posture.

Rabat – The Moroccan High Authority of Audiovisual Communication (HACA) has temporarily suspended the radio program “Dine Wa Dounia” aired on the Moroccan private radio channel Chada FM.  The Haca’s verdict came after a Moroccan cleric, Sheikh Abderahman Sekkach claimed last January that women who have extramarital sex would inevitably have “uterus cancer.” The cleric argued that during her first sexual intercourse, the woman’s vagina inscribes the “code” of her husband’s sperm. Therefore, in case of extramarital relationships, this “code” would not be recognized, and the wife would inevitably contract a uterus cancer. The cleric’s comments sparked arguments on social media. Moroccan sociologist and feminist activist Soumaya Naamane Guessous expressed her outrage in a long post published on her Facebook page in which she insisted on the “danger” of such remarks.  “These broadcasts are an insult to Moroccans intelligence and to their dignity. I am ashamed! They are dangerous because they dull listeners who number in the thousands and even millions,” she wrote. In less than a week later, the radio channel claimed that the ongoing social media backlash, of which the cleric was subject, comes as part of “a media assault.”  “Some have used the statements of Mr. Sekkach wrongly and have made him say more than what they contain,” Chada FM said in a statement, adding that the only authority to monitor the content broadcast on the air is the HACA. Following the ordinary session of the HACA on February 1, the body decided to suspend Chada FM, during the usual hour of the broadcast programming of “Din wa Dounia” for two weeks and order the company Chada Radio to take “the necessary arrangements for the implementation of this decision,” according to a statement released on Friday. “Chada FM Radio has violated the legal and regulatory provisions in force, especially those relating to the dignity of women, the honesty of information, and broadcast,” the statement adds.  The HACA has warned Chada FM Radio about the program’s content on several occasions. The latest incident occurred in 2016, after Sekkach claimed that women “have no right to leave their homes, nor the right to work,” and that women’s main place remains at home.  “When a woman enjoys food, clothes, a house, and a husband, she must stay at home. Otherwise, she becomes a sinner before God. These sentences are not of my own invention, they are directly taken from the holy Qur’an,” Sekkach added.  Following these comments, the HACA issued a press release stating that Chada FM’s guest and broadcasters violated Articles 3 and 8 of Law 77.03 related to audiovisual communication, which state that Moroccan audiovisual communication is free, and the exercise of this freedom must be “applied with respect and human dignity … audiovisual communication operators must promote a culture of gender equality and combat all forms of discrimination, especially those that degrade the image of the woman.”

Rabat – Moroccan women will finally be able to pass their citizenship on to their non-citizen spouses, according to a recent statement from Bassima Hakkaoui, the Minister of Solidarity, Women, Family and Social Development on the sidelines of the 62nd UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW62) in New York. “Borders should not deprive people of the right to nationality,” said the minister on Wednesday, adding that Morocco is currently working to put in place procedures that would allow women to easily transmit citizenship to their husbands. At the meeting organized by the NGO “Global Campaign for Equality of Rights in Nationality” and UN-Women. Hakkaoui said that no child in Morocco is living in a situation of statelessness, as the authorities are working to allow Moroccan women to transmit their nationality to their non-citizen spouses. The high-level meeting was attended by several UN officials, including Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the Executive Director of UN-Women; Sierra Leone’s Minister of Social Affairs, Gender and Children, Isata Kabia; and the Director of the Global Campaign for Equal Rights in Nationality, Catherine Harrington The Moroccan official pointed out that more than 33,500 children of Moroccan mothers and non-citizen spouses have been granted Moroccan nationality, as mandated by the nationality law adopted in 2007. Moroccan citizenship is also granted to children of unknown parents and children in Morocco or abroad, according to a statement from Hakkaoui printed in Moroccan news source 2M.

Rabat – Princess Lalla Hasnaa, president of the Mohammed VI Foundation for Environment Protection, visited, Friday in Ain Aouda (Skhirat-Temara prefecture), the “Al-Masjid” Eco-School, on the occasion of the 12th year of the Eco-Schools Program. The program is one of the Foundation’s levers to make sustainable development education an integral part of kids’ education, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). During this visit, Princess Lalla Hasnaa talked with pupils from the school’s monitoring committee, kids aged 5 to 12 and who have been active since the year 2010 when their school joined the Eco-Schools Program. They showed Princess Lalla Hasnaa some daily eco-gestures and good practices they use for water management and energy saving. The students discussed with Princess Lalla Hasnaa climate and energy issues through an online game by the Foundation aimed at raising the awareness of children about these problems. The kids also showed the Princess their interest in preserving biodiversity by presenting aromatic and medicinal plants they have planted in the school’s garden. Princess Lalla Hasnaa enquired about initiatives taken by the students to recycle waste of their establishment and save water in the school’s garden via the use of a drip irrigation system with PET bottles. The Al Masjid school is an a good example of the Eco-Schools Program. The commitment of its students enabled it to obtain the green flag since 2012, the highest distinction of the program, and to renew it every year since then. Mobilized by the monitoring committee, the 171 students divided into six classes discussed the different themes of the program. In 2012, they dealt with waste management and food, and in 2013 and 2014, they addressed two other issues: energy and biodiversity. The students of the “Al Masjid” Eco-School are now working to spread their experience in their surrounding and other institutions. They made, with the help of the “Sourire d’espoir” Association, a guide of the ecological student. Thanks to networking led by the Foundation to disseminate experiences and best practices, the school united in 2018 with another rural school, the “Lboura” Eco-School of Taroudant, Green Flag since 2013, with which it shares a game on the electrical consumption of household appliances, made with recycled materials. Today, nearly 1,925 schools come under this program, 262 of which have the Green Flag or one of its intermediate certificates. This network represents more than 717,853 eco-students supervised by 28,765 coordinators trained by the Foundation and the Ministry of Education.   With MAP

Rabat – The 2026 boat lingers on while Morocco’ hopes of finally being home to the footballing world’s ultimate spectacle keep rising high as the fateful day of the final vote approaches.  Once ranked as an outsider in a race of titans, a bid that the North American could religiously ignore, the “African bid”, as it is now being referred to, has shaken the giants and established itself as the favorite. But while many factors have allowed that unexpected rise, something much more unlikely, that no one saw coming, is now unsettling the core of what was left of the North American bid: the reluctance of cities to host the tournament. “Nobody seems to want to host the 2026 World Cup,” ran the title of an article in an American outlet. “The 2026 World Cup is having trouble finding a home,” the article explained, adding that “Chicago and Minneapolis have taken themselves out of the running for the tournament.” As the tournament’s fall out of favor in Chicago and Minneapolis came two days after a similar decision was made in Vancouver, one possible conclusion is that the increasing weariness of municipal authorities in one city is having a snowball effect on other authorities in other cities, thus creating an atmosphere where, under the pretext that FIFA’s demands are potentially harmful to the future of their cities and communities, more and more American and Canadian cities are calling off –or planning to do so—their status as hosts of the 2026 World Cup. “FIFA did not provide a basic level of certainty on some major unknowns that put our city and taxpayers at risk,” said Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who then went to talk about how communities in the host cities need to be protected against “future liability and unforeseen changes in commitments”, which is another way of rebuking the colossal investments that hosting FIFA’s major event requires. But whereas the trouble at home keeps expanding, with more cities (there are a total of 20 on the organizing committee’s list) to follow suit and declare themselves unwilling or “not ready” to host the game’s ultimate event, United 2026, the committee in charge of leading the North American bid to victory (a victory that now seems distant and improbable), is selling the footballing community a totally different image: that of a bidder with no domestic issues and more than ready to host the tournament. Yesterday, in the letter that accompanied its official candidacy (as March 16 was the last date FIFA set for contenders), United 2026 lauded the only point where the now lethargic North American bid feels some sense of superiority: infrastructures. “We are already ready,” the letter said, adding that while FIFA is looking for a bidder with “proven experience”, infrastructures, and resources, the “three nations offer the only bid that can deliver the certainty that’s needed.” Something does not seem to be adding up here: while municipal authorities in many of the chosen ‘host cities’ point towards “uncertainties”, United 2026 is promising the only viable “certainty”, leading them to conclude their Friday letter to the FIFA community with a sense of religious assurance: “Canada, Mexico and the United States are ready to host.” So: this obvious confusion, and perhaps lack of sufficient communication between city authorities and United 2026 officials, seems to be suggesting that the North American bid is not as strong as United 2026 officials would have us believe. Which makes even a lot of sense if you consider how obsessively fixated the organizing committee now is on infrastructures! But there may other reasons that have not yet surface yet. And whatever those reasons may be, in the unending sea of public endorsements that have recently greeted Morocco’s bid, the North American confusion and reluctance is surely another morale boost for the once frowned upon bidder. “Moroccans can have their world cup,” some American fans have been quoted as saying. But after months of fierce competition between the two bids, this is no generous gesture. What it is, in essence, is desperation: the final recourse of fans trying to cool off the effects of a pending fiasco.

Rabat – Al Amoudi recently filed a complaint against Morocco at the World-bank affiliated ICSID (International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes) in Washington, DC, thus ending a series of verbal threats the Saudi investor has been brandishing since 2015 against Moroccan investment authorities. According to reports, Corral Morocco Holding AB, a Moroccan subsidiary of the Swedish Corral Petroleum, of which Mohamed Hussein Al Amoudi is the chief, decided, on March 14 this week, to lodge a complaint against Moroccan government at the ICSID in Washington, D.C. The complaint asked for international arbitrage in a financial tussle between Morocco and the Cheick’s enterprises, and particularly singled out Moroccan Prime Minister, the minister of foreign affairs, and the minister of justice. But while the terms of the financial dispute have not been specified by the complainant, ICSID’s website says that the complaint lodged concerns “the exploitation and development of an oil refinery,” which is believed to be an allusion to Samir, a now defunct company whose capital was essentially detained (67.2%) by Corral Morocco Holding. Al Amoudi had already taken similar steps in November 2015, accusing the government of being the primary responsible for Samir’s financial debacle, and threatening to take appropriate legal actions against the government if Samir is “allowed” to sink. For Al Amoudi, Moroccan government’s failure to uphold the terms of an investment agreement between Morocco and Sweden (protection against expropriation, equal respect of investments, etc.) is the reason Samir went through the capital losses that then forced it to stop its activities. In an “ultimatum” he addressed to the government in 2015, Al Amoudi said that “Corral Group has been (and still is) the object of obstacles and unequal treatments concerning its investments.” The letter went on to give a scores of examples of how the government’s measures and steps prevented Samir from duly doing its activities. The “ultimatum” added: “The situation worsened when, on September 28 and October 2015, the government threatened to seize and put Samir’s funds on auction sale if the company did not pay 13.7 bn MAD.” By seizing the World Bank-affiliated ICSID, the Saudi investor is expecting “permanent protection” for his existing investments, as well as “compensation” for “expropriation” and all the Samir-related financial losses. But Mr. Al Amoudi, who is still being detained by Saudi authorities-he was part of the current regime’s crack down on businessmen and many affluent Saudis in what they called anti-corruption investigations-is more than a mere investor, as he leads a vast empire that employs over 70,000 people and has a global outreach stretching from Sweden to England, Africa (especially in Ethiopia and North Africa), and the USA. “I am a Saudi investor, born in Africa, with an Ethiopian mother, of which I am proud,” the Saudi referred to himself in a 2014 speech. And while he currently fights to ensure the survival of his financial empire, many supporters have been raising their voices for his release, saying that the businessman should be “immediately released because he has transformed many lives.”

Rabat – France has issued an international arrest warrant against the sister of Saudi prince Mohammed ben Salmane, accused of mistreating a plumber who was due to work in the Saudi king’s Paris apartment. According to Le Point, the arrest warrant against Saudi princess Hassat bint Salmane was issued in December last year by a Paris-based investigating judge. In September 2016, Le Point reported, a plumber of Egyptian origin came to work in the Saudi King’s apartment on Foch Avenue, reputed to be one of Paris chic places. As the plumber took pictures of the room in which he was set to work, the princess allegedly accused him of photographing her apartment for publicity purposes, selling her apartment’s pictures and her privacy to media. The worker told Le Point that the princess did not limit herself to accusing him of selling her privacy to media. Instead, she allegedly told her body guard to beat him up. The body guard would go on to hit the worker, cover his entire face with bruises and then ordered him to prostrate himself before the princess and kiss her feet, in sign of respect and submission. After hours of beatings and humiliation, the “molested plumber” left the site without his working materials, which were reportedly confiscated by the princess’ body guard, French Media reported. Following the incident, the princess’ body guard was placed in detention, and was charged with “theft, armed violence, sequestration, and death threats.” As for the princess, she was held into police custody for few hours before being released to return to Saudi Arabia, under “murky pretexts of some diplomatic immunity”, complains a French source close to the dossier.

Rabat – Tests on the world’s leading brands of bottled water have found that nearly all bottles contain tiny plastic particles, a recent study revealed on Wednesday.  Over 250 of the top bottled water brands were tested in nine countries, including Lebanon, India, and the United States, during a research project commissioned by journalism organisation Orb Media and led by Sherri Mason, a professor of chemistry at the State University of New York in Fredonia.  The most common plastic fibres found include polypropylene, nylon, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which are used during the industrial bottling process.  Researchers found an average of 325 plastic particles in 93 percent of bottled water samples from several brands–Aqua, Aquafina, Dasani, Evian, Nestle Pure Life,  San Pellegrino–with the highest level found in a bottle of Nestle Pure Life water, registering 10,390 particles per liter. “We found [plastic] in bottle after bottle and brand after brand. It’s not about pointing fingers at particular brands; it’s really showing that this is everywhere, that plastic has become such a pervasive material in our society, and it’s pervading water – all of these products that we consume at a very basic level,” Mason told BBC News.  The study reveals that levels of plastic fibres contained in these bottled water brands could be twice as high as those found in tap water, referring to a previous study conducted by Orb Media, which showed that plastic particles were also present in tap water. The study also found particles in beer, honey, table salt, and seafood, as the oceans are increasingly polluted with plastic waste.  To date, the implications of ingesting these microplastics on human health is still unknown. However, after the study’s findings, the World Health Organization has now told several media outlets that it is launching its own review into the potential risks.

Washington DC – Moroccan diplomacy suffered two blows in the first two months of 2018. After the African Union adopted a communique that went contrary to Morocco’s expectations, the European Court of Justice dealt another blow.  On February 27, it ruled that the Morocco-European Union fisheries agreement is valid “as long as it does not apply to the Western Sahara and its adjacent waters.” The ruling unequivocally confirmed the advisory opinion of former Advisor General Melchior Wathelet, who said in early January that that the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement should be annulled since it involves “waters adjacent to Western Sahara.” But to observers’ surprise, Moroccan officials had a different understanding of the ruling. Perhaps refusing to admit the shortcomings of their approach, they had no qualm in stating to the press that the ECJ’s ruling “confirmed” the validity of the Morocco-EU fisheries agreement. Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Nasser Bourita, told Moroccan news outlet le360 that “nothing in the [ECJ’s] verdict challenges the political legitimacy of Morocco to conclude agreements regarding the Moroccan Sahara with the EU.” The same reassuring message was conveyed by Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Aziz Akkhanouch, and Morocco’s ambassador to Brussels, Ahmed Reda Chami, who said that the ECJ “has distanced itself from the political opinion of its advocate general Melchior Wathelet.” These statements reveal a worrying pattern in the behavior of many Moroccan officials, who make unsubstantiated statements to the media to project the image that Morocco is winning all its diplomatic battles against the Algeria-backed Polisario and their supporters. Rather than using this sinuous method, Moroccan officials would do a good service to their King, their country, and their fellow citizens by facing the reality as it is, telling the truth, and taking the necessary steps to fix what went wrong. It is their duty not only to tell the truth, but also to take the bull by the horn and convey to the EU that Morocco’s territorial integrity is not negotiable. When one reads the statements of some Moroccan officials, it appears unclear whether they have any institutional memory when dealing with their bilateral and multilateral partners. Yet the recent history of relations between Morocco and the European Union shows that the appeasing rhetoric that Moroccan officials used following the ruling of the ECJ is not the appropriate approach that will help Morocco defend its interests. What Moroccans need to see and hear is not the same broken record that the EU is Morocco’s major partner and that the two parties share the desire to strengthen their partnership. What Moroccans expect from their officials is the adoption of a firm policy that would force the EU and its institution to respect its commitments with Morocco and stop interfering in the UN-led process regarding the Western Sahara. Rather than insisting that the two parties enjoy excellent relations, Moroccans officials should have issued a strong-worded statement condemning the ECJ’s ruling and immediately suspending the fisheries agreement. Such a decision would have caused a shock-wave in many European countries, forcing them to take the necessary steps to prevent the ECJ and some NGOs supportive of the Polisario from interfering in the agreements binding the two parties, as well as from dictating the EU foreign policy and undermining Morocco’s territorial integrity. Recent history shows that when Morocco showed it resolve to fiercely defend its strategic interests, EU institutions have been forced to rethink their positions. In December 2011, the European parliament refused to extend the EU-Morocco fishing agreement for one year, because, among other reasons, the agreement lacked any proof that EU money benefitted the population of the Western Sahara. Immediately after, Moroccan authorities suspended the activities of European fishermen in Moroccan waters and announced the end of the agreement linking the two parties. It took the two parties 18 months and six rounds of extensive negotiations to come to a new agreement, signing in July 2013 a four-year agreement, pending the approval of the EU parliament. Under the new agreement, the EU fishermen were allowed access to Morocco’s fishing resources in exchange of €40 million a year. The new agreement increased the annual compensation that the EU paid to Morocco by €4 million. By the signing of the agreement, Morocco succeeded not only in increasing its financial compensation, but also in obtaining recognition from the European Union that the fishing agreement was in line with international law. “I can’t predict if the European Parliament would approve this agreement or not, but this one respects the international law and stipulates that Morocco respects the international law and human rights,” EU Fisheries Commissioner Maria Damanaki told reporters following the signing of the agreement. This statement was a slap in the face of the Polisario and its supporters, who had spent months lobbying the EU to reject the agreement on the grounds that the population of the Western Sahara would not benefit from it and that Morocco had allegedly violated the human rights of the population living in the territory. Moroccan diplomacy should wage a legal and political battle in light of the repeated rulings of the ECJ. Morocco has numerous tools in its playbook to force the EU to reign in its institutions in a way that respects its strategic interests. At the legal level, there is no doubt that the ECJ will continuously issue the same ruling as the one that it issued in late February as long as the United Nations views the Western Sahara as a disputed territory whose final status is yet to be decided. This is a battle for which Morocco needs careful preparation and the presence of competent legal advisers able to defend its position and rebuke all the arguments used by Polisario supporters. At the political level, Morocco should put pressure on the EU and use its leverage in cross-continental security matters to elicit a statement similar to the one issued by the EU Fisheries Commissioner in 2011. The success of the EU security policy in fighting illegal immigration and terrorism depends largely on Morocco, which gives it plenty of room to maneuver to pressure the EU. Over the past decade, Morocco has made enormous efforts to help its European partners to effectively address the scourge of undocumented immigration. Part of Rabat’s effort to halt illegal immigration into the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in northern Morocco was the decision to build a wire wall along its border with Melilla. This decision, along with Morocco’s close collaboration with its European counterparts, has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of undocumented sub-Saharan immigrants arriving in European soil. The role that Morocco plays in stopping illegal immigration to Europe is of such paramount importance that any decision by Rabat to shift its position in the matter would have a disastrous impact on the EU. According to a report in the Spanish daily El Mundo in August 2014, a decision by Moroccan authorities to turn a blind eye to undocumented immigrants attempting to reach Spanish soil caused an unprecedented surge in makeshift boats arriving at the Spanish coasts. Between August 11 and 12 of the same year, several makeshift boats carrying over 1,000 would-be immigrants reached Spanish coasts. The incident caused the alarm of the Spanish government, especially since the number of illegal immigrants who entered Spain throughout 2013 amounted to just 2,500. The same can be said about the fight against terrorism. The success of European countries in fighting this scourge and foiling several terrorist attacks depends largely on their cooperation with Moroccan intelligence services. The key role Morocco plays in helping its European counterparts thwart terrorist attacks was on display following the Paris attacks in November 2015, after which Morocco intelligence services helped their French counterparts locate the whereabouts of Abdul Hamid Abaaoud, the mastermind of the attacks. A year later, Moroccan authorities helped their French counterparts arrest a seven-person cell in Strasburg and Marseille, which was preparing to carry out another terrorist attack in France. In addition, the close cooperation between Morocco and its European partners has helped Spain foil a significant number of terrorist attacks and dismantle as many terrorist cells in Spanish territory. European leaders are fully aware of that, hence the need for Moroccan diplomats to show more firmness in their response to the blackmail and provocations of European institutions. Despite the fact that ECJ judges are independent, there is still room for Morocco to put pressure on the EU and prevent it from issuing rulings about the Western Sahara. ECJ judges are appointed by individual member states of the EU for a period of six years. If faced with questions of national security – such as those of illegal immigration and terrorism – EU members may be forced to deter the ECJ from interfering in the UN-led political process. This would not be the first time a European country would intervene in the judicial process to end an investigation that puts national security in jeopardy. For instance, in 2006, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair intervened in a criminal investigation into allegations that UK’s arms company BAE had paid bribes to Saudi princes to win contracts. Pressured by the Saudi government, which threatened to cut diplomatic ties, Blair forced the Attorney General to end the investigation. Despite the independence of justice in the United Kingdom, Blair intervened to end the legal proceedings, because he feared they could result in “real and immediate risk of a collapse in UK/Saudi security, intelligence and diplomatic co-operation.” This strategy has proved successful in pushing a number of European countries to reconsider their hostile positions to Morocco with regards to the Western Sahara. We all remember how the firm position Morocco adopted in the last quarter of 2015 pushed Sweden to go from announcing its intention to recognize the self-styled Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic to desisting the idea and stressing its respect for the UN-led political process. In a matter of four months, the firmness shown by the Moroccan government – boycotting Swedish products, freezing the opening of an IKEA store in Casablanca, and summoning the Swedish Ambassador to Rabat – pushed the Swedish government to state that “the criteria required by the international law to recognize Western Sahara are not fulfilled”. Morocco’s resolve to ward off attempts by EU institutions to infringe in the UN-led political process has pushed another country known for its sympathy for the Polisario to rethink its positions. In a statement he made before the Danish Parliament on July 17, 2017, the Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Anders Samuelsen, defended the legality of imports of Moroccan products originating from the Western Sahara, arguing that they “benefit” the population of the territory. Additionally, in a note it sent to the parliament on January 11, 2018, the Danish government called for support of the European Commission’s plans to start the negotiations of a new fisheries agreement with Morocco to replace the current agreement, which will expire next July. What makes the position of the Danish government significant is that Copenhagen had voted against two fisheries agreements between Rabat and Brussels in 2011 and in 2013. The position that Moroccan diplomacy adopted following the ruling of the ECJ is very puzzling and pushes many Moroccans to wonder what has prevented Rabat from reacting as vigorously as it did in early 2016, following the ruling of ECJ on the Morocco-EU agriculture agreement. We remember how, immediately after the ruling, the Moroccan government issued a strongly-worded communique hinting at the possibility of rethinking its overall partnership with the EU in the advent that the latter did not strive to override the ruling. The communique was followed two months later by the decision to suspend all contacts with EU institutions. Morocco showed the same resolve following another ruling by the ECJ in December 2016 that the 2012 agriculture agreement did not apply to the Western Sahara, and that this territory does not fall under Morocco’s sovereignty. Morocco reacted immediately through the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Aziz Akhannouch, who threatened to terminate the agriculture agreement and hinted that Morocco did not rule out freezing its efforts to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants attempting to reach Europe. The way in which Moroccan diplomacy handled the question of the fisheries agreement raises many questions. Why did Moroccan diplomats show no readiness to question the grounds on which the ECJ based its politicized ruling? For example, the ECJ claims the people of the Sahara were not consulted prior to the agreement, but who are the Saharawis? Isn’t the main cause for why the referendum hasn’t been held is because there was no agreement on who is Sahawari and, therefore, eligible to vote? Who are the Saharawis that should be consulted prior to the signing of an agreement involving Western Sahara and its adjacent waters? Should we consult the Saharawis living in the territory or those living in Tindouf whose number and composition are a mystery? Has Morocco not been calling for years for the holding of a census in Tindouf to determine who are living there and their relation to the Sahara? How can we talk about the Saharawis when there have been no steps to determine who they are, especially since the Polisario and Algeria have been refusing to let it happen? How can the Polisario claim that it should be consulted prior to any agreement when a report conducted by the EU showed that the Polisario and Algerian officials have embezzled, for four decades, the humanitarian aid destined to the Tindouf camps? Does the Polisario have any moral authority to represent the interests of the Saharawis? All these questions could be used by Morocco to challenge the ECJ’s ruling and the bias of its judges. In addition, there is even a loophole in a UN resolution in 1980 that Morocco can use where it says that the Polisario is “a representative of the Saharawi people” and not “the” representative. King Mohammed VI has tirelessly worked in recent years to rekindle Morocco’s diplomacy, bring the country back to its African fold, and enable it to become a major player at the regional level. Nevertheless, all this work could be undone and put in jeopardy if our diplomacy does not show the necessary due diligence, clear-sightedness and resolve to build on the gains achieved since King Mohammed took it upon himself to lead the Moroccan diplomacy by accelerating the cadence of his tours in Africa and elsewhere.    Samir Bennis is the co-founder of and editor-in-chief of Morocco World News.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has once again expressed his confidence in Africa, describing it as a land of opportunities that should be maximized in service of the development of the continent. In a statement devoted to the continent during the fourth edition of the forum, which kicked off in Dakhla today, the monarch underscored the importance of the leading role of the African continent on the world stage. In a statement read by President of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab Region Ynja Khattat, King Mohammed VI lauded the forum, which takes place in the city of Dakhla annually and is attended by high-level officials from around the world. The King has also highlighted the importance of the city of Dakhla, which “has special significance in the history of Morocco,” said the message. “Thanks to its unique position, it serves as a strategic link between the Kingdom and regions and countries further south in Africa.” The King expressed his pride over the forum, which “has developed considerably and gained renown with each meeting.”   The event, held under the theme “Africa and South-South Cooperation,” convenes world-renowned officials and business stakeholders to address the challenges faced by the continent and discuss opportunities that would contribute to African development. According to the King, the event is now the “must-attend international event that brings together high-level political decision-makers, representatives of the business community, intellectuals, and civil society activities from all walks of life and opinion makers from all corners of the world.” The King reaffirmed his remarks on empowering Africa’s youth, emphasizing that the development of the continent as whole hinges on African young people. The royal message underscored leadership on the continent, labeling it the home of opportunities. “Africa is 30 million square kilometers of opportunity,” the King said, adding that the continent has the youngest population in the world. “By 2025, there will be 2.5 billion inhabitants in the continent, half of whom will be under 25 years of age.” The royal message added that Africa’s future depends on its youth as they will represent “an enormous asset.” The King, therefore, called on Africans, “especially young people to mobilize resolutely and effectively in order to rise the nagging challenges our continent is faced with and to embrace the dynamic of shared growth.” The King mentioned the challenges that are faced by the continent, despite the natural resources required for sustainable development, and yet African populations are suffering from poverty and marginalization in the global economic system.” According to the King, the continent is experiencing a “paradox”: although it has all the means and assets required for sustainable development, it “needs new, collective types of organization for local administrative and management purposes.” He continued, “It is with that in mind that I have decided to put advanced regionalization at the heart of my country’s economic development model.” 
Participants at the previous edition described the event as “an opportunity to promote peace and dialogue,” hailing the modern infrastructures in Dakhla as “a model for the future of Morocco and Africa.” The Crans-Montana Forum is ongoing, March 15-20.

Rabat – In an excerpt of an interview with Moroccan news outlet Hespress, Bashir al-Dakhil, one of the founders of the Polisario Front said that Sahrawis in the southern provinces are benefiting from the ongoing Western Sahara conflict. Al-Dakhil told Hespress that some officials, including parliamentarians and their relatives “take advantage” of the Sahara conflict with the separatist group, “given the privileges they enjoy and the wealth they have been receiving since the establishment of this separatist front in the 1970s.” According to the founder of Polisario Front, the principles of accountability and responsibility, which King Mohammed VI stresses as essential to the constitution in all his speeches, “ha[ve] not yet reached the Moroccan Sahara.” Referring to another recent publication by Hespress about regional communities in Morocco’s southern provinces, Al-Dakhil said that there are several “fake counties in the region, which are draining the money of the Sahara in the Boujdour province, an area in the economic region of Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra. “The southern provinces suffer from many issues related to governance due to the complete control over the decisions by the officials, without a participatory approach that would engage the population with proposals to solve the issues of concern” in the region, said Al-Dakhil. In the interview, Al-Dakhil also criticized government subsidies to the Sahara, calling for authorities to defend the territorial integrity of the Kingdom with conviction, not benefits. The founder of the separatist movement criticized the lack of involvement of the Sahrawi population in defending the issues that the region faces. Al-Dakhil, however, described Morocco’s strategy to involve the regional presidents–Sidi Hamdi Ould Errachid of the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region and Yajna Khattat of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region–in the meeting held with the UNSG Personal Envoy of Horst Kohler as a “positive step to overcome the diplomatic loopholes that led Morocco to face many disappointments.” Al-Dakhil also discussed the ongoing “war” initiated by the separatist group to challenge Morocco’s legitimacy in Sahara, after failing in its political and legal process at the international level. Speaking about Algeria and its motives for supporting the separatist group, Al-Dakhil said that “Algeria does not want the independence of the Sahara.” Al-Dakhil also quoted former Algerian president, Houari Boumediene, who once said, “We will make the Sahara issue a stone in Moroccan shoes.” Algeria has been a long-time supporter of the Polisario Front and its claim over the Sahara, reiterating their support for the separatist front, which has demanded the right to self-determination and independence since its formation in the 1970s

Rabat- Professors at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Casablanca are boycotting second-semester exams due to a lack of government responsibility for ongoing medical problems. The university professors decided to boycott the exams for the second semester after a meeting on Tuesday,  at the Ibn Rochd University Hospital, where they discussed poor working conditions and the lack of medical professionals in certain specialities within the hospital and the attached University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Moroccan news site Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported on Friday. The subpar conditions of specialized medical training triggered complaints from the university’s medical professors who expressed their discontent to what they called the government’s “deaf ears.” The professors blamed the government for its lack of commitment to deal with the severe shortage of medical professionals and medical staff residents. The professors insisted that they warned the government about the serious shortage in the university’s medical staff, stating that the decision to boycott the exams came after a prolonged period of unanswered protests. In 2017, medical professors demanded that the government grant 70 medical professors positions; the demands turned into protests as the government failed to respond.

Rabat – An international team of researchers has sequenced DNA from individuals from Morocco dating to approximately 15,000 years ago in Grotte des Pigeons, near Taforalt in Morocco, the Ministry of Culture and Communication said in a statement, adding that this is the oldest nuclear DNA from Africa ever successfully analyzed. The individuals, dating to the Late Stone Age, had a genetic heritage that was in part similar to Near Eastern populations and in part related to sub-Saharan African populations, as published in the US magazine Science. “A better understanding of the history of North Africa is critical to understanding the history of our species,” explains co-author Saaïd Amzazi of Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco. In order to address this, the team looked at a burial site in Grotte des Pigeons, near Taforalt in Morocco, associated with the Later Stone Age Iberomaurusian culture. The Iberomaurusians are believed to be the first in the area to produce finer stone tools known as microliths. “Grotte des Pigeons is a crucial site to understanding the human history of north-western Africa, since modern humans frequently inhabited this cave intensively during prolonged periods throughout the Middle and Later Stone Age,” explains co-author Louise Humphrey of the Natural History Museum in London. “Around 15,000 years ago there is evidence for more intensive use of the site and the Iberomaurusians started to bury their dead at the back of the cave.” The researchers analyzed DNA from nine individuals from Taforalt using advanced sequencing and analytical methods. They were able to recover mitochondrial data from seven of the individuals and genome-wide nuclear data from five of the individuals. Because of the age of the samples, at approximately 15,000 years old, and the poor preservation characteristic of the area, this is an unprecedented achievement. “This is the first and the oldest Pleistocene DNA of our species recovered in Africa,” explains co-senior author Abdeljalil Bouzouggar “Due to challenging conditions for DNA preservation, relatively few ancient genomes have been recovered from Africa and none of them so far predate the introduction of agriculture in North Africa,” explains first author Marieke van de Loosdrecht of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. “Successful genome reconstruction was possible by using specialized laboratory methods to retrieve highly degraded DNA, and relatively new analysis methods to characterize the genetic profiles of these individuals.” The researchers found two major components to the genetic heritage of the individuals. About two-thirds of their heritage is related to contemporaneous populations from the Levant and about one-third is most similar to modern sub-Saharan Africans, in particular West Africans. The international team of researchers, led by Johannes Krause and Choongwon Jeong from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History (Jena, Germany), and Abdeljalil Bouzouggar from the Institut National des Sciences de l’Archéologie et du Patrimoine (Rabat, Morocco) included scientists from the Mohammed V University in Rabat, the Natural History Museum in London, University of Oxford, Université Mohammed Premier in Oujda and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig.

Rabat- In what some local media outlets have compared to the fury that led young Iranians to take the American embassy hostage in 1979, dozens of angry deported Malian migrants recently stormed the Algerian embassy in Bamako, attacking the building with stones and leaving the building in ruins. The incident is said to be a follow up of the expulsion of 94 Malian migrants from Algerian territory last week. Armed with stones and some other metallic materials, the angry deported migrants took out their anger, fury, and frustration at the North African country’s diplomatic representation in their country, hoping that this desperate act would send signals as to what the general mood is regarding Algeria’s mistreatment of sub-Saharan migrants. According to reports, constant police patrols and administrative humiliations are not the only things that sub-Saharan migrants suffer from in Algeria. Some of them—generally Guineans, Malians, Nigeriens, Ivoirians.—are said to be “thrown to the desert”: abandoned in no-man’s land of militia and terrorist groups in the desert between Mali and Algeria. Some of the expelled Malian migrants have confirmed this fate. Despite overwhelming criticism at the inhumanity of Algeria’s policy vis-à-vis sub-Saharan migrants, the North African country is nowhere near ready to mend its ways,  and maintains its harsh and repellent migration policy, especially towards sub-Saharans. Last week, another 120 individuals were stranded in Bordj Badji Mokhtar, forced to walk 2 days before reaching Malian provinces. The incident at the Algerian embassy in Bamako, incensed protesters to make a statement that Africa and the AU should have made to Algerian officials long ago: membership in the continental union demands that fellow Africans be treated with respect and dignity.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI sent a message to participants in the Crans Montana Forum, which kicked off Friday in Dakhla under the theme “Africa and South-South cooperation.” Here follows the full text of the royal message, read by the president of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region, Ynja Khattat: “Praise be to God, May peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, His Kith and Kin Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, It gives me great pleasure to send this message to your assembly as you hold the Fourth Crans Montana Forum, which will address the theme Africa and South-South Cooperation. This year, once again, the Forum is being held in the city of Dakhla. As you know, Dakhla has special significance in the history of Morocco. Thanks to its unique position, it serves as a strategic link between the Kingdom and regions and countries further south in Africa. I am pleased to see that the Crans Montana Forum has developed considerably and gained renown with each meeting. It is now a must-attend international event that brings together high-level political decision-makers, representatives of the business community, intellectuals, civil society activists from all walks of life and opinion makers from all corners of the world. The relevance of the themes addressed, coupled with the quality and diverse backgrounds of the participants, are valuable factors. They make it possible to enrich the debate and explore new horizons, enabling the Forum to serve as a powerhouse for proposals. Above all, they help us look to the future with greater serenity and confidence. All of these features give the Forum an international dimension, bringing Africa – the continent of the future – under the spotlight. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Africa is at a crossroads. The profound changes under way in the continent are multidimensional. They point to a rapidly changing Africa – a continent increasingly removed from the stereotypes and negative clichés it has been labeled with. Africa is 30 million square kilometers of opportunity. It has the youngest population on earth. By 2050, there will be 2.5 billion inhabitants in the Continent, half of whom will be under 25 years of age. These young people will constitute an enormous asset, provided the demographic dividend is managed judiciously. This impressive demographic trend will produce a major change of direction which will, in turn, transform the situation in Africa and the world at large. Young Africans are a precious element in the achievement of development; through them, we have an incredible opportunity for emergence – one on which our Continent ought to capitalize. To achieve progress, however, Africa needs to muster all its energy and build on innovative, win-win partnerships. I therefore call on African men and women, especially young people, to mobilize resolutely and effectively in order to rise to the nagging challenges our Continent is faced with and to embrace the dynamic of shared growth. In addition to building on its resources, Africa should make use of all the means at its disposal to meet the legitimate expectations of African populations. One of the favored tools for Africa’s emergence is South-South cooperation. Morocco is one of the African countries nurturing the ambition and desire to ensure that Africa becomes master of its own destiny. It is no coincidence, therefore, that Morocco has made South-South cooperation an instrument for the advent of a new Africa that believes in its potential and looks to the future. In fact, this is a constitutional commitment enshrined in gold letters in the Kingdom’s supreme law. Indeed, our Constitution stipulates that Morocco undertakes to “strengthen relations of cooperation and solidarity with the peoples and countries of Africa, including the Sahara and Sahel countries (…) and to consolidate South-South cooperation”. As I pointed out in my Message to the participants in the last meeting of your Forum, I have made the bold decision to put that cooperation at the heart of my country’s African policy. Under my stewardship, Morocco has shaped a truly innovative South-South cooperation model based on the exchange of knowledge, skills, expertise and resources. This model involves all of the Continent’s sub-regions and relevant sectors. The South-South cooperation initiated by my country, which we see as a means for fruitful, principled partnership with African countries, is meant to be integrated and multidimensional. Whether in the areas of the transfer of technology, the sharing of know-how, the establishment of public-private partnerships in various domains, or training and higher education, Morocco has gained expertise which is widely recognized in Africa. Over the last 15 years, 1,000 cooperation agreements have been signed with 28 African countries. They concern such diverse sectors as education, health, infrastructure development, training and agriculture. Because it puts man at the heart of its concerns and incorporates the economic, social, cultural, spiritual, security and military dimensions, the Moroccan model is unique. Morocco, which defines cooperation strategies in the light of sister nations’ needs, has an African student population attending Moroccan universities and higher education institutions in excess of 25,000. The Kingdom is also keen to implement major strategic projects in Africa. I will mention just two recent ones: the first is the Africa Atlantic Gas Pipeline, aimed at reshaping the regional electricity market, and the second concerns the establishment of fertilizer production plants, in cooperation with Ethiopia and Nigeria, with a view to improving agricultural productivity and promoting food security throughout the sub-region. In order to achieve a mutually beneficial relationship based on sharing and to consolidate existing sub-regional partnerships, Morocco has returned to its institutional family, the African Union. I therefore call on all African sister nations to get more closely involved in this constructive cooperation by helping to enhance the efficiency of our regional and sub-regional institutions as instruments for the achievement of integration across the Continent. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, The South-South cooperation Morocco is implementing has a bearing on issues relating to stability and development in Africa, including migration. Migration is an opportunity, not a threat. The migration-related crisis the world is witnessing today is not new; nor should it be perceived as inevitable. It calls for greater cooperation, first between African countries, then between the latter and the countries of the North. As the African Union Leader on the Question of Migration, I proposed, at the 30th AU Summit, an African Agenda on Migration. That Agenda recommends the setting up of an African Migration Observatory and the appointment of an AU Special Envoy for Migration in order to tackle the migration phenomenon properly from a comprehensive perspective. In this respect, my country has played a leading role in terms of receiving irregular migrants and managing migrant flows on its territory. This inherently humanitarian policy is not just a new form of solidarity with our African brothers and sisters; it also enhances our immutable commitment to African peoples. This commitment is not a slogan Morocco brandishes in international forums. In fact, it epitomizes a resolute, irreversible policy of the Kingdom. Another example of the inter-African cooperation Morocco has developed with the rest of the Continent concerns the fight against the devastating effects of climate change. Indeed, the Kingdom is fully aware of the threat this phenomenon poses to development, peace and security in our Continent. Clearly, Africa is paying a heavy price in this regard, even though it is responsible for a mere 4 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. As the COP22 host country, Morocco was keen to ensure the Paris Agreement was put into effect through an action-oriented COP during which Africa’s concerns held center stage in the discussions. Once again, I call on the countries of the North to honor the commitments they reiterated in Marrakech, particularly with regard to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing developing countries’ climate strategies. I availed myself of the opportunity of the global climate meeting to convene the first Africa Action Summit, which was attended by Heads of State and Government of 41 African sister nations. We were thus able to exchange on the challenges relating to the climate change consequences we are facing and agreed on urgent, practical measures to tackle those effects. At my suggestion, the Summit decided to give priority to the development of the Sahel, and to the Lake Chad Basin, Island States and the Congo River Basin in particular. During that Summit, Morocco also submitted some concrete initiatives to help ensure food security in Africa. Particularly noteworthy are the Adaptation of African Agriculture project, which is designed to ensure capacity-building for the benefit of agricultural stakeholders, and the Blue Belt initiative, which aims to fight the effects of global warming on oceans. Similarly, the Kingdom expressed its willingness to share its successful experience in the promotion of clean, renewable energy, the development of responsible agriculture and the sustainable use of marine resources. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Our Continent is clearly facing a paradox: it has practically all the natural resources required for sustained human development, and yet African populations are suffering from poverty and marginalization in the global economic system. Intra-African trade accounts for only 13% of all commercial activity in Africa and represents a mere 2 per cent of global trade. Today, more than ever, the African continent must make the most of globalization. Africa lacks neither the ambition nor the desire to move forward. However, it needs new, collective types of organization for local administrative and management purposes. It is with that in mind that I have decided to put advanced regionalization at the heart of my country’s economic development model. More than a simple territorial or administrative planning measure, advanced regionalization reflects a strong desire to revamp and modernize state structures in order to consolidate the integrated development of our regions and rally all stakeholders around a common project. Today, regions are expected to become local governments wielding the kind of powers that enable them to shape their destiny within the framework of the Kingdom’s territorial integrity. My objective is to foster a new form of economic growth in the twelve regions making up Morocco – one that ensures inclusive growth and is supported locally by public and private sector actors. I especially want to enhance national cohesion and increase access to public services in regions with high potential. In no other place is this reality more obvious than in the beautiful region where you are today, right here in Dakhla: indeed, and as is the case elsewhere in the Southern Provinces, the city has witnessed a political, economic and social transformation. My ambition is to press ahead with this endeavor so that the Moroccan Sahara may reclaim its historical role and serve, once again, as a crossroads in the Continent. Morocco has consistently expressed a commitment to share its experience in this area with its African partners, through the implementation of bilateral agreements and through the United Cities and Local Governments of Africa, which has its headquarters in Rabat. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Having embarked on the right course of action, Africa today is firmly on the path to emergence thanks to the wisdom of its leaders and the involvement of its populations in an irreversible democratic process. This will enable the Continent to fulfil its legitimate aspirations for peace and human development, and to ensure optimal use of its potential. I am sure the Forum which has brought you together today will be an opportunity for you to formulate constructive recommendations and proposals that can help respond effectively to the multifaceted challenges the world – particularly Africa – is currently facing. I invite you, in this regard, to discuss the benefits of adopting efficient, multidimensional South-South cooperation mechanisms as well as participatory approaches to be used as tools for collective emergence. I wish your conference every success and would like, once again, to welcome all the participants to the Kingdom of Morocco and to tell them how much I value their important contributions to this meeting of the Crans Montana Forum. I also deeply appreciate the efforts they are about to make to determine the best practices conducive to human development in the countries of the South in general, and especially in Africa. Thank you. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.”

Rabat – A young couple was arrested for interfering with the royal procession during its passage from the administrative capital, reports Al Akhbar newspaper in its March 16 edition. The judge sentenced the man and woman to one year and four months in prison, respectively, when they appeared before the court on Tuesday.  According to police investigators, the accused were attempting to seek direct help from King Mohammed VI, when they were detained. In March 2016, the Ministry of Interior warned those who obstruct “the circulation and the passage of the royal procession to benefit from certain advantages,” while emphasizing that “such acts expose the life of their authors and their others to danger, as they constitute a crime punishable by law.”

Rabat – Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid committee officially submitted its bid book to FIFA on Thursday, at the international football governing headquarters in Zurich. In a statement printed by the state-owned news outlet, Maghreb Arab Press, the committee says that the submission of the bid occurred, thanks to the involvement of the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF) and other vital forces of the nation. “The committee has fulfilled its commitment by submitting a quality dossies with respect to the deadlines imposed by FIFA,” said the statement. Morocco’s bid book constitutes 24 sections covering the country’s vision, strategy, and sustainable development. The committee confirmed that FIFA’s key requirement–stadiums, transport, training sites and hotels–were treated with “meticulousness.” The section covering the administrative aspect of the book has required the signing of more than 200 local and national contracts, including agreements with host cities, stadiums, and airports, in addition to other requirements.  The bid committee chairman, Moulay Hafid Elalamy, says that “Morocco presents a record with undeniable qualities and proposes to organize a successful, responsible, and profitable World Cup with an important legacy for the country, but also for the continent.” According to the Moroccan official the World Cup in Morocco will be beneficial to “players, fans, FIFA, Morocco, Africa, and the world,” adding that the sport event is an important step towards promoting Moroccan youth and Africa. Recalling Morocco’s football passion, the committee says that the country aims at celebrating the sport’s values of tolerance, openness, and respect. Morocco’s Bid is Not a Communications Stunt  In an interview with BBC Sport, the chief executive of Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid, Hicham El Amrani, reaffirmed Morocco’s determination and readiness to battle for the right to host the 2026 World Cup. “We are not here for a communications stunt–we are here to win,” said El Amrani. For El Amrani, Morocco’s bid will not only need to convince June’s FIFA Congress, but also the FIFA technical team. Two hundred and eleven federations will vote for their favorable bid on June 13, in Moscow. Morocco has only one competitor, which is the three-nations North American bid (USA-Canada-Mexico). In January 2017, a unanimous decision expanded FIFA World Cup to 48 teams, beginning in2026. Meanwhile, this year’s World Cup and the following tournament in 2022 in Qatar include only 32 squads. This decision to extend the competition to include 48 teams, however, does not intimidate Morocco. “You cannot bid for such a tournament, especially one that’s been increased to 48 teams, without careful consideration–it is not a light decision,” El Amrani stated For the Moroccan official, Morocco and greater Africa are ready to host massive sports event to celebrate the world  and receive international football fans to showcase the “beauty of our country, its diversity and also boost the social, economic and human development of our country and the continent.”

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat- Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani revealed several key government decisions at the weekly meeting of the Governmental Council on Thursday, including plans to increase employment for people with special needs and plans for a national water plan. Under the framework of the Act for Unified Competition for Employment, El Othmani announced interdepartmental employment contests for people with special needs in order to boost their representation in the workplace The head of government deemed interdepartmental contests one of the most efficient ways increase public employment for the people with physical disabilities, whose employment currently fails to meet the legal requirement of 7 percent of total recruitment: “While it would be difficult to organize competitions for each sector, organizing a central one is doable for the departments and ministries that wish to integrate in these unified contests,” he explained. El Othmani stressed out the need to ease the entry of people with special needs into public office, and assured that at least one competition will be held each year. El Othmani also declared that the government is currently developing the National Water Plan, which will extend until 2050 and aims to shield the country from problems of scarcity of both potable and irrigation water. “As part of the historic responsibility, the government is in the process of developing the National Water Plan that will extend for 30 years, in line with the water law.” The prime minister announced the Ministerial Committee has identified the areas that suffer from drinking water problems, and developed appropriate solutions, which will be soon presented to King Mohammed VI as part of an emergency plan. In this context, El Othmani lauded Mohammed VI’s representation at the 8th edition of the World Water Forum, which will take place in Brazil on March 19 under the slogan “Water Sharing.” The forum will present the Hassan II Prize for Water as a global award for the best water management and maintenance projects around the globe. On a different note, El Othmani applauded the Moroccan-Qatari Higher Committee for its notable bilateral collaboration, signing eleven agreements across different fields over the course of Qatar’s latest working visit in the kingdom. These agreements “facilitate a greater dynamism for investment and relations between Moroccan and Qatari businessmen, and dynamic trade exchanges between the two countries, ” said the head of government. Accordingly, El Othmani announced that the two states agreed to open a maritime line to facilitate trade between Qatar and other countries in the region.

Rabat – During the weekly meeting of the Ministry Council on Thursday, March 15, Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani announced that the government will soon introduce a  national water plan to solve shortage problems in many regions of Morocco. The national water plan will be valid until 2050. To ensure better management of water resources, Morocco’s Water Law extends the national water plan for 30 years, said El Othmani, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) News. The Council of Ministers  held a meeting in the presence of experts, pinpointing  regions that suffer from potable water shortage and discussed solutions that suit each one of them. El Othmani emphasized that despite recent rainfalls which increased dam water volumes  by 59%, emergency measures need to be taken to manage water resources for future generations: “We must not forget to be cautious about water shortages  in numerous regions. [Preventative action] is the aim of the emergency plan which we will soon present to his majesty,” El Othmani said, “If we do not conserve this wealth [of water now], our children and our grandchildren will lose it.” In a previous announcement, El Othmani pointed to the government’s plan to desalinate five-hundred million cubic meters of local seawater in the next five years to reduce the threat of water scarcity in the future. He also drew  attention to his participation in the 8th World Water Forum on March 19th in Brazil. El Othmani attended to represent and speak on behalf of Morocco.  Hosted by the World Water Council , the World Water Forum is an international event dedicated to tackling water-related issues and finding solutions to manage critical problems on different levels.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – The first International Conference on Education Quality launched on Wednesday, March 14, as scholars from 22 different countries convened at Agadir’s Chamber of Commerce. The conference will last three days and is hosted in partnership with Ibn Zohr University and the Moroccan Ministry of Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education, and Scientific Research. Before any adults took the stage, several local children put on a brief fashion show, offering the spectators a glimpse into regional Moroccan culture through its traditional clothing, with student “hosts” offering commentary as the others sashayed past. After the students’ cultural performance, the event’s headline speakers took their seats on stage: President of Ibn Zohr University Omar Halli; Vice President of Ibn Zohr University and the Conference Chair Abdel Aziz Ben Dou; Professor Mostafa Aabi; Doctor Caroline Jones of University of Warwick; Secretary General of the Pan African Institute for Development Roger Mondou; President of University of Las Palmas Gran Canaria Rafael Robaina Romero; and the Secretary General, Ministry of Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education, and Scientific Research Mohamed Aboussalah. The seven speakers each reflected the conference’s international scope, addressing the audience in Modern Standard Arabic, French, or English. Indeed, in her opening remarks, Doctor Caroline Jones, who co-chairs the conference and played an integral part in its organization, noted the difficulties she and her colleagues face in navigating so many different languages, cultures, and pedagogical sectors. However, despite the diversity of perspectives, nationalities, and institutional backgrounds, the conference shares a unifying theme: education quality. Jones declared quality the “common denominator,” not only in terms of expert discourse but also in promoting “multiple and diverse interpretations of quality.” Conference Chair and University Vice President Abdel Aziz Ben Dou said in his address, “I am very happy to be here and working together in the name of quality education. “Quality has to do with local factors as well as global factors. We always work in synergy with the local environment.” To further explore the local environment and the Moroccan educational system, a number of the attendees visited two schools in Agadir earlier in the day. The conference aims to engage with diverse sectors of education, ranging from early childhood education to the Student Ambassador Scheme (SAS), five of whom spoke at the opening ceremony. The student ambassadors represented a variety of educational experiences. Some attended Moroccan private schools, others public ones; they studied across Morocco, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. Roger Mondou, the Secretary General of the Pan African Institute for Development, congratulated the president of Ibn Zohr University for hosting the event and expressed his hopes for substantive debate during the coming days. The evening’s keynote speaker, the Secretary General Mohamed Aboussalah, spoke about quality assurance in the domain of Moroccan higher education. However, quality assurance is not limited to academic discussions. Doctor Caroline Jones reiterated, “Of course [the conference] is about sharing knowledge; that’s why we’re here. But I feel that in this conference, already, we are creating new knowledge, new theoretical positions, and new ideas so that we can move forward. What is the point of having a conference and making presentations if it doesn’t have any impact?” In his closing remarks, conference co-chair Professor Mostafa Aabi thanked the different advisory committees and scholars involved in putting together the conference, saying “we are very humbled” to host the “world research community.”

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat – In his quest to make “new rhythm of the world,” Moroccan composer and saxophonist-turned-jazzman, Abdel Mabrouk will announce the release of his new music video in a press conference on March 23, in Marrakech. In line with his debut album “Ahwach Jazz” released in 2017, Abdel Mabrouk, otherwise known as Abdel Sax, will present his new music video, filmed in January 2018, in Ouarzazate. Sponsored by Marrakech audiovisual organization Saxo Prod, “La Palme D’or” restaurant, and the Ouarzazate tourism company Accord Sud Productions, the press conference will be organized in the restaurant, “Le Palme d’Or” at La Mamounia Hotel in the Marrakech medina on March 23. The press conference will showcase the video in the presence of Director Hassan Mrani, Chief Operating Officer Aziz Lechgar, a traditional Ahwach dance group, and other artists, and VIP guests.  Mabrouk’s new music video is linked to his greater artistic project of the same name, which is dedicated to fusing the rhythms of jazz and the five-note pentatonic scale of the Moroccan traditional dance “Ahwach,” into the new musical genre Mabrouk named as “Ahwach-Jazz.” Filmed by a drone in the environs of the southern Moroccan city Ouarzazate, Mabrouk’s video features the title track of his debut album, which contains songs released in 2017. Musician, American lawyer, and Mabrouk’s manager, Elizabeth Myers discussed the artist’s music: “Through this music, Abdel is sharing Morocco’s cultural heritage with the world; he is doing for Ahwach what others have done in the past for gnawa music,” she said.  “And as a jazz singer, I am excited to explore the roots of jazz in Africa.” Mabrouk’s album is the product of ten years of thorough research on the origins of jazz and Morocco’s musical heritage, obtained over the course of   a “spiritual journey back to [his] roots.” Born to a musician father, Mabrouk grew up in the home of Ahwach: Morocco’s “the door of the desert,” Ouarzazate. By the age of 13, Mabrouk had already learned how to play the saxophone, piano, and flute, among other musical instruments. Mabrouk followed his goal to become a professional musician to Marrakech where he lives now, he told Morocco World News in a previous interview on his Ahwach jazz debut in 2017. Mabrouk had his very first concert in Belgium in 2007. Some of his other noteworthy performances include the Festival of Amazigh Culture in Fez in 2011, the 2012 Mawazine festival in Rabat, and his Ahwach debut concert in Marrakech in 2017. He has also made covers of songs like “Set Fire to the Rain” by Adele, John Legend’s “All of Me,” Alicia Keys’s “If I Ain’t Got You,” and Avicii’s “Wake Me Up.” Mabrouk shared his dream with MWN in an interview last year: “I want Moroccan heritage to become international. Like we hear blues in Morocco, we hear jazz, bossa nova, swing—one day I want to hear Ahwach, us too, in the United States, in England…That’s my dream. I want it to become international.”

Rabat – Three months before the FIFA World Cup in Russia, London and Kremlin are on the verge of a historical diplomatic rift, with English football fans said to be eying a general boycott of the Russian World Cup. Will England go through with boycotting, thus thwarting the dream of the country’s football team? Strictly speaking, while the British government has officially made its low opinion of the Russian campaign known (England has not yet swallowed the Marseille incident in 2016), the English football federation, for his part, has made no such official statements, and therefore the understanding is that England will be present in Russia where they are to play in Group G along with Belgium, Panama, and Tunisia. It all started with the murder attempt of former spy Sergei Skripal, whose inanimate body, along with that of his daughter, was found “slumped to bench” near a shopping mall in Salisbury. Sergei and his daughter are now critically ill in hospital where, under intensive medical care, they strive for their lives. After establishing that the chemical used to poison Sergei and his daughter is of Russian origin, “a nerve developed by Russia known as Novichok,” BBC reported, Teresa May called out Russian authorities, telling the Kremlin to account for the use of a Russian-made nerve in a political murder in the UK, or else face appropriate consequences. “The Russian state was culpable of the attempted murder,” May went on to say in a tense statement on March 14, as she announced a massive expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats from the UK, as well as the UK government’s boycotting of the FIFA World Cup to be played in Russia this summer. “There will be no attendance by ministers-or indeed members of the royal family-at this summer’s World Cup in Russia,” May said. Russia has denied guilt, or indeed any involvement in the tragedy, with its foreign ministry calling May’s accusations “insane” and aiming to trouble and tarnish Russia’s World Cup.  Kremlin is however yet to answer to the UK’s massive diplomatic expulsions. And should Putin embark upon the same boats, the ramifications could be more far reaching than anyone would anticipate. For now, though, because May said in her March 14 statement that the decision whether or not to participate in this year’s World Cup is “one for the sporting authorities”, the FA, England’s highest football body, is set to participate in the World Cup. “The FA will continue to work closely with the UK government and relevant authorities regarding our participation in this summer’s FIFA World Cup and the Women’s World Cup qualifier,” a recent FA statement read. The statement added: “Our priority for England matches is to ensure the safety and security of the fans, players and staff.” So, as things stand right now, the English squad will make the trip to Russia, regardless of its government’s decision to “diplomatically and politically” boycott the event.  But even as the English squad and English football fans-the majority, anyway–are said to be keen on taking part in football’s ultimate spectacle, you can’t ignore the political dimension of the World Cup (the singing of national anthems and the brandishing of national flags).  Also, as the situation that created the diplomatic gulf between the two countries is far from contained, or over, nothing can yet be declared a foregone conclusion. And if Putin retaliates against the UK’s recent mass expulsion of diplomats-as he so often chooses to do in a spectacular manner-this is indeed nowhere near its end, which may then force the English FA to review its position as it currently stands.

Rabat – Industrial manufacturing production has increased by 2.6 percent during the fourth quarter of 2017. The Moroccan Higher Planning Commission (HCP) in charge of economic, demographic, and social statistics- released a report displaying growth indexes for industrial production, energy, and mining, for the last three months of 2017.  The report indicates an increase by 2.6 in the production of manufacturing industries, with the exception of oil refinery production, compared to 2016. Manufacturing industries that saw an increase in production include chemical productions, up 5.2 percent, textile manufacturing up by 2.8 percent, clothes and fur manufacturing up 8.7 percent, print and reproduction up 2.6 percent, and machinery equipment products up 3.5 percent. Food production also increased by 1.1 percent; radio, television and communication productions by 5.0 percent; automotive industry products by 10.3 percent; and other transportation equipment by 14.4 percent.  The report reveals that the boost in the manufacturing industry production is linked to an increase in the production of chemical industries, which recorded a 5.2 percent increase in comparison to 2016. Likewise, mineral production saw an increase by 19.9 percent, due to the boost in extractive industry production by 21.0 percent, while metallic minerals recorded 1.5 percent. Electric energy production increased by 7.3 percent. In contrast, woodwork production decreased by 9.6 percent, pulp and paper production by 2.2 percent, metallic production by 4.2 percent, and metalwork production reduced by 1.4 percent.

By – Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – In its latest report, BMI Research asserted that Morocco’s health budget will be boosted in 2018. This growth will also aid in expanding the medical device market. The Moroccan government will reportedly continue to increase funding and investments in health infrastructure. The aim is to be able to cover health insurance for 90% of the population by 2021. According to the research firm, the budget dedicated to the Ministry of Health (which plateaued in 2017) will increase to MAD 14.8 billion  (USD 1.4 billion ). This marks a 3.5% increase. Capital investment is set to reach MAD 2.6 billion   (USD 250 billion ) —an increase of 6.3%, which will enable funding of ongoing healthcare infrastructure and high profile projects. One of these projects includes the construction of the new University Hospital of Laayoune, located in the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region. The 500-bed hospital, due to be completed by 2022, has a total budget of MAD 1 billion  (USD 100 million ), and includes a MAD 15 million   (USD 1.5 million ) contract with the engineering firm “Novec.” Novec is responsible for the design, monitoring, and control of the construction done by the Ministry of Equipment  (in August 2017). The 2018 budget will also fund ongoing construction and equipment for new university hospitals in Tangiers and Agadir. The new Ibn Sina Hospital and Trauma Centre in Rabat, however, will both receive separate funding from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). In order to expand access to healthcare, the 2018 budget will likely include improvements in the supply of drugs and medical devices for healthcare services operating within the Ramed health insurance plan. The plan funds treatment in public hospitals and health centers for low-income patients. In order to address the chronic shortage of healthcare personnel (which has led to the closure of some primary care services and caused delays in opening new hospitals), the budget will reportedly hire an additional 4,000 staff members. BMI Research maintains that the medical device market will grow by 7.9% (Compound Annual Growth Rate) during the 2017-2022 period. This will bring the total value to MAD 4.5 billion   (USD 433 million ) by 2022. “In the meanwhile, the market will benefit from the economy remaining a relative outperformer in the MENA region. Investor interest in the country (as an export-oriented manufacturing hub for the European market, and increasingly also to West Africa) bodes well for Morocco’s underlying growth in the upcoming years,” reads the report. With the implementation of the universal health insurance, more people will be eligible to receive treatment, and to benefit from health infrastructure development programs.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Interior asked judicial authorities to open an investigation to evaluate Facebook photos claiming to depict violent injuries caused by law enforcement in the Jerada province. To denounce the “gravity of these acts and tendentious allegations that mislead public opinion and negatively affect the sense of security and create panic among citizens,” the ministry opened an investigation to identify the identities of those involved in the promotion of these “unfounded” allegations. The Ministry of Interior released a statement on Tuesday announcing its decision to  ban illegal protests on public roads, “responding firmly to irresponsible acts and behaviors with the aim to protect security and the interests of citizens.” The statement also denounced the persistence of “some parties” in undermining the efforts made by the government for the benefit of the citizens of the Jerada province. The prefecture of Jerada said that several members of security forces were seriously injured on Wednesday, due to an unauthorized Jerada sit-in.. Law enforcement was forced to intervene, in coordination with the prosecutor’s office, to disperse this demonstration,” the statement read. Jerada has been home to many protests since the death of four local miners working in illegal mines in recent months.

Rabat- Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita and his Serbian counterpart Ivica Dacic signed two cooperation agreements and expressed respect for territorial integrity of each country during a working visit meeting on Wednesday in Rabat, the state news agency MAP reported.  The two cooperation agreements focused on the fields of diplomatic training and culture.   Following the talks with the Serbian minister, Bourita said that there has been a “positive momentum with Serbia” this year, through visit exchanges, regular contact, and the organization of cultural events, adding that the second session of their joint committee will focus on economic and trade cooperation, occurring before the end of the year in Morocco.  The Serbian diplomat said that the joint committee should be held as soon as possible, with a view to developing economic cooperation between the two countries, adding that this cooperation has great potential, particularly in the fields of agriculture, energy, and new technologies. He also announced that Morocco will be the guest of honour at the International Book Fair in Belgrade. Dacic added that in addition to mutual respect for territorial integrity, Serbia fully supports all negotiations and efforts for peaceful, durable, and diplomatic solutions to any conflict, under the auspices of the United Nations.  “We think that the autonomy proposal (in the Sahara) submitted by Morocco falls fully and perfectly within this framework,” he said.  “It is for this reason that the two countries are mutually supporting each other within international organizations, as both are eager to see the issues resolved through dialogue and peaceful means,” Dacic added.  The Serbian official also expressed his gratitude to Morocco for its support of the territorial integrity of Serbia.

Rabat – The Ministry of Agriculture has recently made a statement on the advancement of the 2018 agricultural campaign, praising the “excessive” rainfall levels, and saying that the 2018 agricultural campaign is progressing as planned. The Ministry of Agriculture made the press release in the aftermath of a recent meeting, and which gathered all the important stakeholders and regional agricultural authorities. Participants at the meeting pointed to the “satisfactory” water levels in many regions,  tied to waves of rainfalls that Morocco registered in the last weeks. They also mentioned an overall improvement in the management of dams, which they heralded as positive signs for “favorable” conditions for springtime cultures. “The Kingdom has witnessed important rainfall in recent weeks,” the ministry statement read, as it went on to laud the overall “positive” impact that such rainfall has had on improving the odds of this year’s agricultural prospects. The statement also said that the agricultural campaign, which initially suffered from a  61 percent water deficit in dams,, is now benefiting from a 4 percent excess in water levels, which is even “more than that of a normal year.” “Favorable weather conditions and the rainfalls between December 2017 and March 2018 have allowed a positive evolution,” the press release also said, adding that that “positive evolution” translated into affordable food prices, to the delight of both farmers and customers. The statement concluded by saying that remarkable work is being done to replicate the success with the springtime cultures With 111,000 hectares already sown, the ministry is calling upon farmers to join in the efforts and make the entire endeavor as successful as possible.

Rabat- The National Office of Railways (ONCF) announced that stations of the High-Speed Train, or LGV, will begin to operate this summer.  The ONCF Board of Directors, conducted a follow-up on the construction of what are set to become Morocco’s largest future railway stations during a Board of Directors meeting chaired by Minister of Equipment and Transport Transport Abdelkader Amara on Tuesday, which was also attended by the wali of the Rabat-Salé-Kenitra region.  Among these sites, the Rabat-Agdal station, which is erected on 22,000 square-meter area, will eventually accommodate nearly 30 million passengers per year by 2025. The site has already completed 70 percent of the construction project, as of the end of February.   According to a press release from ONCF, the work of the station, which is set to become “Africa’s largest railway station, should be completed by the summer.”  As for the Casa-Voyageurs train station, which is spread over an area of 10,000 square meters, it will accommodate 20 million passengers per year by 2025. For its part, the Casa-Voyageurs train station has currently completed 80 percent of the construction work, before its official launch next summer. “Morocco takes part in a development dynamic related to the reinforcement of transport infrastructure of all modes, given the policy of major projects. This dynamic transformation also concerns the railway sector,” the Minister of Equipment and Transport said during his speech at the ONCF board meeting. ONCF also announced its intention to achieve a turnover of nearly MAD 4 billion for the year 2018. The high speed train is the first of its kind in Africa, linking Tangier to Kenitra in only 1.5 hours. The train services will be expanded to connect Tangier to Casablanca in a period of 2 hours and 10 minutes instead of the current trip’s five hour minimum. According to the company, the LGV project is in the process of passing the last inspections, before moving on to the final organizational phase prior to its launch.  The High-Speed Train project was launched by King Mohammed VI and the former French President Nicolas Sarkozy in September 2011.  Morocco, France, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE all contributed funds for the high speed train project, totaling approximately USD 2 billion for the new trains, new tracks, improved signaling technology, and upgraded train station platforms.

Rabat- According to the latest study carried out by Morocco’s Ministry of Health, 70 percent of women carrying Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or HIV/AIDS, have been infected by their husbands, the Moroccan newspaper Al Massae reported in its Monday, March 12 edition. The findings, presented during a study day on women’s sexual health last week in Marrakech, show that 39 percent of Moroccans living with AIDS are women. However, homosexuals remain the most affected by this disease in Morocco, according to Aziza Bennani, head of the national program against AIDS.  The latest statistics from the Ministry of Health indicate more than 1,000 new HIV-positive cases in 2016, raising the number of Moroccans living with HIV to 22,000 people, since the disease first appeared in the country in 1986.  Moreover, the annual number of people who die from complications related to AIDS increased from an estimated 3,600 in 2000 to more than 11,000 in 2016, according to a Global Aids Update 2017 issued by UNAIDS. The ministry’s indicators also reveal that 62 percent of people with AIDS are concentrated in the Souss-Massa, Casablanca-Settat, and Marrakech-Safi regions, and 67 percent of AIDS cases were reported among people from very poor backgrounds.  To expand its strategy for fighting the disease, Morocco has adopted the World Health Organization’s recommendation, necessitating that antiretroviral therapy be initiated for every person living with HIV at any CD4 cell count. According to international standards, HIV testing is available mostly through public health facilities. Due to the stigma associated with the disease, however, most Arab countries, including Morocco, run community testing campaigns for key populations in locations where HIV risk is high.  In Morocco, testing campaigns have increased HIV-positive people’s knowledge of their HIV status from 52 percent to 63 percent, states the Global AIDs report.  Worldwide, 36.7 million people continue to live with AIDS, yet 23 percent of people living with the disease do not have access to treatment, according to the same source.

Rabat – A group of Sahrawis in the Polisario-run Tindouf camps have launched a campaign to decry the unbearable living conditions imposed on camp inhabitants, according to Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia. The movement, Sahrawi Initiative for Change, is aimed at defying the “archaism” and the “mummification” of the Polisario’s leadership, who have been accused of total detachment from the reality of the camps. According to the newspaper, the movement pushes for a radical change in approach to find a solution to the crisis that the Sahrawi populations have suffered for more than four decades. The movement is planning to hold its assembly in the Tindouf camps, in conjunction with several activities, in hopes of drawing global attention to the social, political,  and economic situation in the camps. Al Ahdath added that the movement’s founders recently released a statement asking the camp population to support them massively and openly in order to defy the separatist group, which has been accused of the illegal appropriation and resale humanitarian aid on the black market. The newspaper added that this initiative comes at a time when the separatist group and its leader, Ibrahim Ghali, are trying to prevent the Sahrawi camp population to withhold its public condemnation of the camps. Earlier this month, Morocco’s Head of Affairs in Geneva Hassan Boukili condemned the living situation of of the Sahrawi population in the Tindouf Camps, accusing Algeria of shirking its international responsibility towards the population. Speaking at the 71st session of the Standing Committee of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Boukili emphasized that Morocco’s eastern neighbor is, “the only country to oppose the implementation of all the feasible  solutions for the populations in the Tindouf camps.” Boukili added that Algeria, “has chosen to suffer an alleged situation of Sahrawi refugees of its own creation.” He notes that the country is the only one to refuse to conduct a headcount of the populations in the Tindouf camps. Boukili has also urged the international community to address the causes behind the persistence of refugee-related crises, including the militarization of Tindouf camps and the exploitation of refugees to serve Algeria’s separatist agenda.

Rabat – On Tuesday, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini arrived in Morocco’s southern city Dakhla to take part in the international Crans-Montana Forum. The event kicks off today under the high patronage of King Mohammed VI. The governor of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region, Lamine Benomar, and the President of the Regional Ccouncil, Khattat Ynja, both received the Zulu monarch. Zwelithini is the most influential monarch in the Southern African region, which has a population of over 12 million people. The Zulu comprise more than one-fifth of the South African population, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Zwelithini was born in 1948, and is the descendant of King Shaka Zulu, who founded the Zulu nation in the early 19th century. Zwelithini ascended to the throne in 1968, following the death of his father, King Cyprian Bhekuzulu Solomon. With an estimated 10-12 million people (located mainly in the Kwazulu-Natal province), the Zulu are the largest South African ethnic group.  Consequently, the Zulu language is the most widely spoken native language in South Africa. Over 1,000 high-level participants from over 100 different countries will take part in the Crans-Montana Forum. The event is being held under the theme, “Africa and South-South Cooperation,” and will run from March 15 to 20.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat – “Punish a Muslim day, April 3rd, 2018” urges the title of an anonymous letter recently sent to people across England. Hair-raising letters were sent to people in numerous communities throughout England; residents of London, West Yorkshire, and other regions reported receiving “malicious” letters inviting them to commit acts of terrorism against Muslims. The letters are identical in content—and the pale envelopes in which they arrived provide no clues to identify the sender. Printed in red and black ink, the letters begin with “Punish a Muslim day, April 3rd 2018” and continue, “They have hurt you, they have made your loved ones suffer, they have caused you pain and heartache, what are you going to do about it? […]” Furthermore, the letters contain charts which classify eight different criteria for non-Muslim to accumulate  “points” in this proposed game: ‘25 points’ for pulling off the headscarf of a Muslim woman, ‘50 points’ for throwing acid in the face of a Muslim, and ‘1,000 points’ for bombing a mosque. Iman Atta, the director of Tell Mama, an organization dedicated to monitoring anti-Muslim incidents in the United Kingdom, said that Muslim communities were disturbed by the unsettling letters. “[These letters have]  caused quite a lot of fear within the [Muslim] community […] They [Muslims] are asking if they are safe and if their children are safe to play outdoors. We have told them to remain calm,” Atta said after her organization received reports about the letters from habitants of Cardiff, Leicester, London, and Sheffield, reported the Washington Post on March 13. A member of UK Parliament, Naz Shah, also spoke on behalf of the Muslim community, saying that the letters have caused immense distress not only to the ones who received them, but also to a wider range of communities. People took to social media to decry  the letters, and UK police forces are conducting an investigation to identify the source of the “hate letters”.

Rabat – Very much like what happened with Somalia many decades ago, after the overthrow of its dictator Siad Barre in 1991, Libya is free from Qaddafi and his family but gripped with chaos, lawlessness and instability to the extent that one wonders if the country still exists as such or is it just a figment of imagination. Sometime ago, the United Nations  by the means of its special mission for Libya, UNSMIL (United Nations Support Mission in Libya,) tried sincerely to mend the country and resolve the internal conflicts and feuds, and, thus, got everyone to sign the Skhirate Agreement in SKhirate, Morocco in 2015, with the hope to form a government of national unity, but this failed miserably because it seems, unfortunately, that Libya has gone tribal anew, for some reason. Field Marshal Haftar has even declared this agreement dead. Indeed, addressing the Libyans on television, Khalifa Haftar said on December 2017: “Local and international institutions which claim they’re concerned about resolving the situation have not made any serious and practical preemptive measures that reassure people over their future,”  noting that Libyan parties’ dialogues, including the Skhirate Agreement, are mere “ink on paper.” As such, the west is ruled by the Islamists from Tripoli, the frail UNSMIL government is located in this city, too, the east is the exclusive realm of the retired Field Marshal Haftar, apparently supported by the Americans, and the south is governed by a myriad of tribes, patriarchal in essence and pan-arabist in ideology. At first glance all these players seem to put personal interest above national unity and, therefore, the country is sliding fast into oblivion and slowly but surely becoming the Somalia of North Africa. One thing is sure, if the Libyan politicians do not care about their country and its future and do all they can to get it back on its feet, the Arabs will not bother and the West will not care as long as Libya is not a security threat to the Europeans or the Americans. And this is, undoubtedly, the ideal condition for prolonged uncertainty or neglect commonly known as limbo. At first glance, it seems that oblivion suits the aims of the politicians in this country to the extent that the common people are regretting the days of Qaddafi that, at least, united the country, stabilized it, provided bread free of charge and gave it an international standing. And if there are elections held today they will probably bring to power his heir Seif al-Islam Qaddafi, and throw in the trash can of history all the actual war lords, with no exception, whatsoever. In a report entitled: “The Libyan Political Agreement” Crisis Group called for a pause and review of possible options: “Time for a Reset”: “The UN-brokered peace process in Libya has stalled, leaving unresolved pressing issues, worsening living conditions, control of oil facilities, people-smuggling and the struggle against the Jihadist groups. New negotiations are needed to engage key actors who have been excluded so far.” As of now, there does not seem to exist one Libya but many tiny Libyas in which people subsist from oil revenues and a host of other dubious trades such as some sort of modern slavery. Indeed, a recent report by CNN states that poor African migrants were sold for as little as US$ 400. This report supplemented by a video entitled; “Migrants being sold as slaves” triggered immediately demonstrations in Paris, France and worldwide uproar smearing further the already bad reputation of this country. Moussa Faki Mahamat, the chairman of the African Union Commission and the foreign minister of Chad, issued a statement  calling the auctions “despicable.” “The Chairperson of the Commission calls for an immediate end to these practices and other criminal acts of human trafficking. He urges swift action to identify all perpetrators and accomplices, with a view to bringing them to justice. In this regard, he welcomes the announcement by the Libyan authorities of an investigation into these criminal acts and looks forward to a credible outcome. He further urges the Libyan authorities to do everything in their power to improve the conditions of African migrants on their territory.” And further stating: “The Chairperson of the Commission expresses the determination of the African Union to spare no effort to help bring these acts to an end and ensure the respect of the most basic human rights. In this regard, he requests the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights to urgently launch an investigation in support of the measures announced by the Libyan authorities and to submit its conclusions as soon as possible to ensure timely follow-up and action.” He urged the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights to assist the Libyan authorities with the investigation that they opened in response to CNN’s report.   In this regard, according to the CNN report, handed on to the Libyan authorities to undertake the necessary investigations, a young Nigerian migrant by the name of Victory from Edo’s state spent all his savings and 16 months to arrive to Libya with the hope to make it afterwards to the European Eldorado, but he was detained and sold as a slave. In the last years of the life of the dictator Qaddafi, disappointed by the Arabs cold shoulder for his repetitive calls for unity, he turned to Africa where he poured millions of dollars in economic aid and declared himself in return “King of Kings of Africa” and often left Tripoli in massive motorcades to go lead the prayer in a given African country and fell important. Today, he must be turning in his grave to see his countrymen selling migrants to earn money and he sure is unhappy and depressed that his country has, alas, stooped to such  low behavior and debased, in the process, its dignity and identity for money. This political faux pas, after all, might be good news to his son Seif al-Islam  and his southern supportive tribes to win the upcoming presidential elections due to take place this year and bring the Qaddafi clan back to power, to restore stability in the country and dignity among nations of the world. Surely the Islamists of Tripoli and the secular Field Marshal of Benghazi would not like this but if people want Seif al-Islam the opponents won’t stand in the way to ensure their political survival. So would the Libyans, like the Tunisians did, sometime ago, boot the Islamists out of political prominence or remain in international disgrace? Libya needs democracy and stability, it cannot allow itself to become the Somalia of North Africa. It needs badly the political and economic support of both the Arab world and Europe and its only way out is law and order as a prelude to democracy, if ever. However, all the present players have been unable to unite the country, six years after the fall of the dictatorship, because either they are too weak (internationally-recognized government), too violent (the Field Marshal) or too fundamentalist (the Islamists) and do not show any signs of inclination to share power, in order to bring the country back from the brink of the cliff, so they are politically speaking unfit to rule and represent the Libyans. So what are the options available for the people to get out of disgrace and limbo? Today, all Libyans must unite and put the interest of their country before their  personal interest in order to restore peace and stability to their country. To achieve that Libyans must talk to Libyans in Libya without any preconditions and put aside all bad blood, if not, their beloved country will become a thing of the past. Will they listen to the voice of wisdom? Only time will show. You can follow Professor Mohamed Chtatou on Twitter: Ayurinu

Rabat  –   Several members of security forces were injured, some of them seriously, in the dispersal on Wednesday of an unauthorized sit-in in the north-eastern city of Jerada, the prefecture of Jerada said. “Despite the decision issued on March 13, 2018, by the local authorities of the province of Jerada on the ban of all unauthorized protests and gatherings, a group of individuals staged, in violation of this decision, a sit-in on the edge of abandoned wells near Al Fath high school, during which some hooded individuals provoked the public forces and threw stones at them.  These forces were forced to intervene, in coordination with the competent prosecutor’s office, to disperse this demonstration,” the source pointed out in a statement. These violent acts caused injuries among public forces, including serious injuries, which required their evacuation to the University Hospital Center (CHU) of the city of Oujda, the source added.  Protesters also burned five police cars and caused extensive damage to vehicles and equipment used by the same forces. Nine people were arrested following the events, the statement said, adding that they will be brought to justice.  Public forces will maintain measures aimed at protecting the security and public order, while showing restraint and self-control so as not to give in to provocations and scrupulously respecting the law, the statement said.

Rabat – Spanish football club Girona FC has named Morocco’s international goalkeeper Yassine Bounou as its best player of the month for February. The title recognizes the footballer’s excellent performance with his Spanish squad in some of their most decisive games this season. ?

Rabat – The head of Saudi Arabia’s General Sports Authority, Turki Al-Sheikh, expressed his opinion, or lack thereof, about the 2026 World Cup official bids, stating that he places “the interest of Saudi Arabia is above everything.” In his interview with the Saudi-based sports news outlet Arriyadiyah, the Saudi official, one of the main advisers of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Al Saud,  reaffirmed the priority of Saudi interests, regardless of mutual international relations.  “Friendship and fraternity have been very detrimental to the Saudis…what really matters to me is that the 2026 World Cup needs to be hosted in the best conditions.” The statement might raise eyebrows in Morocco, as it suggests that Saudi Arabia will not support Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. A Middle East analyst who spoke to MWN and asked not to be identified said that the statement of the Saudi official is hardly surprising. “In the current global context, marked by the frenetic attempts of Saudi Crown Prince to clinch the support of the Trump Administration, the statement might be indicative that the Saudi leadership has no intention to support Morocco’s bid, but rather supports the tripartite bid led by the United States. “As the Saudi Crown Prince needs the support of the Trump administration to consolidate his power, the interest of Saudi Arabia lies in supporting the US-led bid, thus returning the favor to an American administration that has proved instrumental in his rise to power,” he added. Despite Al Sheikh’s remarks on the World Cup bid, Morocco is determined to clinch as many votes as it can. On March 10, the chairman of Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid committee, Moulay Hafid Elalamy and President of Morocco’s Royal Federation Fouzi Lekjaa traveled to Amman, Jordan, to introduce the strengths of Morocco’s bid, with the aim of targeting the votes of the Jordan Football Federation and the Union of West Federations (WAFF). WAFF is an association with 12 members: Iran, Yemen, Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates. The kingdom is counting on the support of Middle Eastern and African countries to boost its chances of organizing the FIFA flagship tournament. But this statement should serve as a wake-up call for Moroccan officials: nothing can be taken for granted and efforts should be doubled to avoid any last-minute surprises.

Rabat – The French Minister of the Economy and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, vowed on Wednesday to sue the US digital giants Apple and Google over “abusive business practices,” against French startups and software developers.  “We will take Google and Apple to the court for abusive business practices,” Le Maire wrote in a tweet from his official account.  Speaking on RTL radio on Wednesday, the French minister said he will take Google and Apple before the Paris Commercial Court for the conditions imposed on developers wishing to sell their apps to the two firms.  Le Maire added he finds “unacceptable” that both companies can gather data from the developers and “unilaterally modify contracts,” expecting the Paris commercial court to impose sanctions that would likely cost Google and Apple “several million of euros.” “I consider that Google and Apple, as powerful as they are, shouldn’t treat our startups and our developers in the way they do today,” said Le Maire. “My responsibility is to ensure economic law and order…There are rules. There is justice. It should be respected,” he added.  The French official has previously threatened to tax the American giants, based on their sales revenue in France, lambasting the tax optimization practices they use to pay taxes at lower rates in other EU countries. He then reiterated that his government was working to establish international rules obliging digital behemoths to pay taxes wherever they operate.

Rabat – Morocco’s 2026 World Cup Bid Committee will publicly unveil its formal application in a press conference to be held on Saturday, March 17. The Moroccan committee has finalized its formal application for the international football organization, FIFA, to be submitted on Friday in Bogotá, Colombia. The chairman of the Moroccan bid, Moulay Hafid Elalamy, will unveil Morocco’s bid file on Saturday at a press conference following the FIFA submission. During the press conference, according to Moroccan newspaper Al Massae, Elalamy will explain the financing sources of the Moroccan bid promotion campaign, as well as the infrastructure projects that will accompany the construction of the new stadiums. A budget of MAD 10 billion would be devoted to preparation for the competition, which will take place in 12 cities if Morocco were to secure the bid, according to Morocco’s Minister of Sports and Youth Rachid Talbi Alami. The list of the cities includes Casablanca, Rabat, El Jadida, Marrakech, Agadir, Ouarzazate, Oujda, Nador, Fez, Meknes, Tangier, and Tetouan. The 2026 World Cup will see the participation of 48 squads. To host the tournament, the host country must be equipped with stadiums with a capacity of 40,000 for pool matches, 60,000 for the semi-final games, and 80,000 spots for the final match. Morocco is planning to build six 40,000-seat stadiums, in addition to a seventh 100,000-seat stadium in Casablanca. The new stadiums would join five stadiums already built in the country. Two others are currently being built in Tetouan and Oujda. Rachid Talbi Alami, Morocco’s Minister of Sports and Youth, told Moroccan news outlet Media24 that the construction of the stadiums and the renovation of older existing ones will cost between USD 800 million and one billion. In early March, the North African country emphasized its strengths to prove that it has the assets to host the world tournament, including Morocco’s ideal geographical situation of Morocco and time zone similar to that of Europe and Africa, as well as the flying time between the hosting cities. Morocco submitted its candidacy to host the tournament on August 11, 2017. Two hundred and eleven football associations are set to cast their vote for their favorite bids on June 13, in Moscow, Russia. Morocco’s bid is competing against the three-nations North American bid (USA-Mexico-Canada).

Rabat – Friday, March 9, false rumors entailing the alleged “demise” of King Mohammed VI began to brew on social media. The rumors claim that Morocco’s king “passed away due to a heart attack.” The fake news about King Mohammed VI’s “demise” seeped like poison into the hearts of the Moroccan social media users, who resolved to identify the source of the information and prove its “falsehood.” The fake news allegedly sparked from a website related to the Polisario. This might have caused a mix up in information, and led to the spreading of the false rumor of the King’s death through social media, according to Le 360. Soon after the fake news was released, posts were shared on to social media networks to reassure Moroccan users that their King was, in fact, safe and well. One post on Facebook shows a photo of King Mohammed VI in Paris and reads, “Our beloved [King] is well and in good health, may God protect him from all harm […] the rest is nothing but rumors.”

Rabat- Abdelhak Khiame, Head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ), has once again expressed his concerns over the security threat in Sahel, where terror groups continue to jeopardize the stability of the region. In an interview with the Casablanca-based  Le Reporter  the Moroccan official deplored the security situation in the Sahel region, describing it as “a fertile ground for terrorism.” This was not the only concern of the BCIJ chief: several other security weaknesses have emerged in the Sahel region. Khiame explicitly underscored the link between terrorism and drug trafficking. Khiame explained that Morocco has managed to arrest many suspects involved in drug trafficking. Speaking about the security threats in the Sahel region, the BCIK chief said that illegal activity serves as a means of escaping from poverty for many separatists living in Tindouf in southern Algeria. Many of the same separatist groups are members of terrorist organizations, including Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Khiame described these trafficking circles as a clear means of financing terrorism in the  region, which is already a “fertile ground for terrorism,”posing a threat not only to Morocco, but also Algeria and the entire region. He added that Morocco has put in place an “efficient” policy, as well as a security system, in order to confront all dangers related to terrorism and drug trafficking. The security apparatus has produced “record seizures” of cocaine and the dismantlement of several drug trafficking rings across Morocco. This is not the first time when Khiame expressed his deep concerns over the region. In April 2017, Khiame told French TV Channel France 24, that regional cooperation is very important in battling the transnational threat of terrorism. In a February interview with Le Monde, Khiame verified that Morocco works with its partners, efficiently exchanging information about binationals tied to terrorist cells. “We have liaison officers in the partner countries and Western liaison officers herein Morocco,” he said. Khiame, however, has expressed his concerns over the lack of cooperation between Morocco and its eastern neighbor. “The problem is the absence of collaboration from the Algerians and the existence of an area controlled by a terrorist group,” he said, referring to the Polisario Front.

Rabat – Spain’s National Court, the country’s highest judiciary body, recently sentenced two Moroccan nationals to a two-year prison term for inciting terrorism. The accused had allegedly been under close surveillance since 2014, with Spanish authorities closely their online activity. Fouad Bouchiman and Ilyass Chentouf, the two Moroccan nationals aged 27 and 20, respectively, are said to have posted and shared online content promoting terrorism and glorifying terrorist organizations like the Islamic State. El Pais, commenting on the National Court’s press release about the topic, reported that Bouchiman and Chentouf had “jihadist files” in their electronic gadgets, which they latere published on Facebook. Bouchiman is reported to have used “six or seven” different Facebook profiles in 2016, on which he reportedly expressed his support for terrorism, condoning violence and glorifying Daesh in his posts, according to El Pais. “Victory will come from the hands of the Emir of believers, Bakr al Bahgdadi,” read one of his posts, with El Pais pointing to the fact that even Moroccan’s profile picture featured a popular Daesh fighter. For his part, Ilyass Chentouf is said to have praised Bin Laden, the famed Al-Qaida leader killed by American Special Forces in 2011. “May Allah have mercy upon you, oh lion of jihad,” read one of Chentouf’s numerous posts supporting jihadism. Despite the court’s condemnation of  the two Moroccans, it stressed that “there was no proof that the accused were involved in activities of terrorist organizations, or were in touch with members of a terrorist cell.” The court’s verdict specified that Bouchiman and Chentouf are sentenced for “ideological radicalization,” which entails sharing violent content and condoning terrorist beliefs or ideas. The court, however, acquitted the accused “terrorist charges,” as they “had no intention to travel to combat zones or recruit others to do so.”

Rabat – On Thursday last week, an important governmental delegation from Mali, led by Prime Minister Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga, paid a visit to Morocco. The visit was meant to strengthen bilateral ties between the two countries, and boost exchanges on various fronts. According to reports, both in Malian and Moroccan news agencies, the visit was seen as “an event”, especially as King Mohammed VI honored his Malian hosts with an ultimate state reception program, including an impressive military parade by the Royal Air Forces and a dinner at the Royal Palace. But beyond these diplomatic formalities, this “friendship and working visit” had something much more important to it: It reflected the relentless efforts that Morocco’s diplomacy has made in recent years.  In other words, spurred by the pragmatism and deal-striking abilities of King Mohammed VI, the country is but reaping what it sowed, or has been sowing, or is sowing right now. Plainly put, one of the lessons one gets from King Mohammed’s own investment in reconfiguring Moroccan diplomacy is this: the unrelenting pursuit of diplomatic perfection never disappoints. Which brings me back to the core of Malian Prime Minister’s visit to Morocco: signing strategic agreements in many sectors, promoting Morocco’s Africa initiative, furthering the two countries’ bilateral ties. On top of all, however, Mali, which is terribly suffering from the chaos in the Sahel Terror Corridor, is seeking partners that can help the country dismantle the deep-seated jihadist ideology in its northern provinces. And Morocco, whose military proved itself on many fronts in the continent, is a reliable and able partner to turn to. Speaking on the sidelines of his official visit, Malian PM called for a regional action to face the mounting threats in the Sahel region, adding that Morocco, with its expertise and proven abilities, would be a plus to Mali’s security agenda. Maiga did not, however, confine his visit to security matters: logistics, transports, water development, employment, and education (professional trainings, especially) were also an important part of the agreements signed during the visit. “An agreement on international road transport of passengers and goods was signed by minister of Equipment, Transport, Logistics and Water, Abdelkader Amara, and Malian minister of Transport, Moulaye Ahmed Boubacar,” MAP reported on March 8. In the water development sector, for example, Mali’s PM paid a visit to the Bou Regreg site in western Morocco, a visit that prompted him to ask Moroccan officials to help his government transform and design the Niger River site in the image of Bou Regreg. His request received a positive answer, with a team of Moroccan water engineers set to pay a working visit to Mali in mid-May this year. But all this, ultimately, seems to be beside the point. Instead, the overall point here is this: the “fire and fury” of the Kingdom’s new diplomatic guidelines, which is a byproduct of King Mohammed’s Africa-Africa initiative, has transformed the country into an essential player that can no longer be sniffed at, especially in the fuzzy landscape of African politics. From its re-admission to the African Union to its election to AU’s Peace and Security Council, not to mention the King’s insistence on embracing and promoting the kingdom’s Africanness, Morocco has succeeded, in a remarkably short span, to challenge Algeria’s hitherto stranglehold on the Sahara question inside the most strategic body of the AU: the AU Peace and Security Council. But let me not get ahead of myself here. Algeria will not easily relinquish on its position, and while King Mohammed’s good image in the continent has so far been on Morocco’s side, facilitating the works of Moroccan officials and diplomats, it bears reminding that what lies ahead is indeed a strenuous climb. Or, as Moroccan journalist Noureddine Jouhari said in a column for Maroc Hebdo’s 2-8 February printed edition, “the scramble for Africa is just getting started.” In essence, then, whereas Morocco needs considerable African support to further its Sahara Plan, most sub-Saharan states, especially the French speaking ones, need the Kingdom’s expertise and development model. I had the chance, last Sunday, to participate, as a speaker, in a conference organized by an association of African students in Settat, a small city an hour’s drive from Casablanca. At the conference, we spoke of Panafricanism and all the “isms” often associated with the continent. We were four speakers to be invited, and despite the obviously diverging and sometimes conflicting perspectives we brought to the table, we all seemed convince that Africa can still make it, that the continent’s vibrant and dynamic youth has not yet said its last words. I even called upon the marvel movie ‘Black Panther’, suggesting to my audience that beyond the symbolism of the narrative, there is a genuine belief in the continent’s existing transformative potentials. At one point, however, a tenacious and well-articulated freshman, tired of what he called “sweet talks we’ve been hearing for ages”, asked: “Do you have any practical suggestions for tackling our problems?” I answered in my traditional way: give a five-minute talk on African social scientists and novelists who “have remarkably addressed these issues”, cite names and books to follow. A thunderous supportive noise filled the room. Another speaker from Senegal, spoke of “Morocco as an answer to the question.” He hailed the kingdom’s security, transport industry, education, and what have you. “Vision, strategy, creating requisite means to attain set goals—that is what is currently propelling Morocco,” he argued, adding that “though Morocco is not an ideal case, its current status, compared to my country for instance, sets the Kingdom as an inspiration and a country from which we should seek technical assistance.” Considering Morocco’s investments in many such countries, the number of scholarships the kingdom provides to students from many of the said countries, in addition to the enormous agricultural program being run by OCP Africa, all indicators seem to suggest that my Senegalese fellow is right, which is probably why he got an uproarious ovation at the conference. The foundation of Morocco-Africa is after all an investment in South-South cooperation, or “Africa trusting Africa”, as one of the Moroccan officials said while commenting on the “meaning” of Malian PM’s visit. But the conclusion that Morocco has won the battle, that it has already converted hearts and minds, would be grossly misleading. Many in the continent still look at the Kingdom’s with reluctance and suspicion: the old myth that Morocco arrogantly acts towards sub-Saharan Africa like its backyard is still dominant in some African circles. Now King Mohammed has made enormous efforts to dispel that long-standing myth and show the sincerity and genuineness of his Africa agenda. It is now time that Moroccan ministers and high-ranking officials replicate the king’s move: deal squarely and considerately with sub-Saharan counterparts, because only then can Morocco hope to get the support it so badly wants on its Sahara position.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI appears to be back to full health after experiencing a heart rate disorder two weeks ago, as he appeared in several pictures taking with Moroccans of the Diaspora during a stroll in Paris.  The pictures of the King, who appeared outside of the traditional protocol, were published by an unofficial Facebook page of King Mohammed VI with more than 3.5 million fans. King Mohammed VI has been staying in Paris since late February, after he successfully underwent surgery on February 26 for his heart rate disorder, according to a communique from the royal palace. “The doctors of the King indicated that medical investigations confirm that he experienced an atrial flutter on an otherwise healthy heart,” said the communique.  “The radiofrequency ablation of this arrhythmia, performed today at the Ambroise Paré clinic in Paris has normalized the heart rate,” it added.  The surgery will not affect the monarch’s ability to resume his daily activities.

Rabat –The world’s prominent British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, who devoted his life probing the secrets of the universe, passed away at the age of 76, in the university city of Cambridge in the early hours of Wednesday morning, March 14, according to a family spokesman.   “We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today. He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years,” Hawking’s children, Lucy, Robert, and Tim, said in a statement. The cause of his death, which coincides with the 139th anniversary of the birth of Albert Einstein, has not yet been disclosed. Considered by many to be an inspiration across the globe,  Hawking defied predictions that he would only live for a few years after developing a neurodegenerative disease, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, in his early 20s in 1964. Hawking’s illness progressively deprived him of mobility and left him confined to a wheelchair, almost completely paralyzed and unable to speak except through his iconic voice synthesizer. “His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world. He once said, ‘It would not be much of a universe if it wasn’t home to the people you love.’ We will miss him forever,” his family said. Born on January 8, 1942, the well-regarded scientist was a cosmologist, astronomer, mathematician and author of numerous books including the worldwide bestseller “A Brief History of Time,” which has sold more than 10 million copies. “A star just went out in the cosmos. We have lost an amazing human being,” Lawrence Krauss, a theoretical physicist and cosmologist, wrote on Twitter. Forever pushing the bounds of his fascination with the nature of space and time, relativity and quantum theory, Hawking’s groundbreaking work aimed to give the world new insights into the creation of the universe. “My goal is simple, it is complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all,” he once said.

Rabat – The campaign to decide who will host the 2026 World Cup is going to get very interesting. FIFA’s member associations are set to vote on a site at a June 13 gathering. Morocco is in competition with a joint bid from Canada, Mexico and the United States to host the month-long soccer tournament. Identified by some as a heavy odds-on favorite to win the right to host the tournament, there is now a perception that the US-led bid is “in jeopardy.” Perception is sometimes reality, sometimes not. The June 13 vote is in many ways an election, with grand promises of stadiums filled to capacity, high TV ratings, and lucrative corporate sponsorships. Vote counting and arm-twisting often go hand in hand in any election campaign. FIFA’s Congress includes 211 member soccer federations. None of the four bidding nations can vote during the selection vote so the winning bid will need to attract 104 votes. Both the Moroccan and the North American joint bid will emphasize their respective strengths, and perhaps also play up the drawbacks and challenges of the rival bid. As the vote nears, three concepts will inform both bids. Both sides will spin these factors to their advantage. The 2026 FIFA World Cup will include 48 teams, up from 32 teams for the 2018 and 2022 tournament.  The North American bid will highlight the fact that the US has dozens of large recently built stadiums to host World Cup matches. Canada and Mexico will likely provide three to five additional large venues in total. Interstate highways, stadiums with comprehensive satellite TV resources, countless hotel rooms and a nearly full embrace of the sharing economy in which countless soccer fans will be expecting to couch surf or utilize Airbnb. Lots to like. Morocco’s bid will feature the less is more concept. A lean compact tournament that would serve in stark contrast to FIFA’s previous obsession with the big and the expensive. Flight times within Morocco would not be more than 90 minutes between any two stadium sites. More time to rest and to play for players and fans. Modular lean stadiums that are relatively quick to assemble. This is an important concept as international sports associations and nations are beginning to consider affordability and rationality in stadium construction. In one interview, the chair of Morocco’s bid committee, Moulay Hafid Elalamy, promised “no dirham will be spent if it cannot ultimately serve the population.” Additionally, currency exchange hassles for fans would be significantly less during a Morocco World Cup. Visually, Morocco packs a lot into its California-plus-sized landscape. Coastal metro areas like Rabat, Casablanca and Tangier easily connect with regional centers like Marrakech, Fes, and Oujda. Train service in the kingdom reaches nearly all proposed stadium sites. FIFA relies on the World Cup tournament to generate a large portion of its revenue and yearly income. The 2014 World Cup in Brazil earned FIFA around $2.6 billion, a vast majority of which came through TV broadcast rights and sponsorships. The North American bid will highlight the fact that the three nations comprise nearly half a billion people. The US economy is the largest in the world and Mexico is the 11th most populous country in the world. The opportunities for new corporate sponsorships are significant, particularly since FIFA has struggled recently to land new high-profile sponsors. North America is a vast underutilized resource in regards to FIFA sponsorship opportunities. Morocco is on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), a big advantage for TV broadcasters for the many millions of soccer fans across Europe, the Middle East and Africa who would watch games live during lucrative and optimal late afternoon and evening hours. Five thousand miles and more than a billion people away southward in Africa, Cape Town is just two hours ahead of GMT. If the North American bid were selected, millions of viewers would likely be watching games televised at midnight or later. European television markets would provide significant revenue to FIFA during a Morocco World Cup. Equally important, a North American World Cup would mean a significant increase in television broadcasting revenue for FIFA and TV networks from an American market that now has 20 soccer teams playing in the professional MLS league. If Morocco is selected, numerous European and African teams would likely enjoy the luxury of practicing in their home training facilities during the run-up to the tournament. Both bids will promote the collaborative nature of their bids but in slightly different ways. Morocco will highlight its bid as an African endeavor that will show the unity and growing prosperity that exists on the continent. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) is the largest (by membership) of the six continental soccer federations that constitute FIFA. Several African national soccer federations have come out publicly in support of Morocco’s bid, including neighboring Algeria. CAF head Ahmed Ahmad has said recently that Morocco’s bid has a larger meaning for the continent: “Africa is a family and has a solidarity culture which we must see during the voting.” The United Bid Committee, North America’s bid leadership group, recently restructured its leadership to better reflect the tripartite makeup of the effort. The soccer federation presidents for Canada, Mexico and the US will now be considered co-chairs of the United Bid Committee. Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter recently declared his support for Morocco’s bid, noting the challenges of multi-nation bids. The United Bid Committee’s initial plans for the 2026 tournament envisioned the US hosting 60 games while Mexico and Canada would each host 10 matches. This formula may change, too. Lots of extraneous noise and peripheral issues will surround the selection campaign over the next three months that may help or hurt one bid or another. Regionalization and the quest to promote equitable development opportunities beyond a north-south paradigm, President Trump’s global image, the true opportunity costs of building sports tournament infrastructure for short duration events, Morocco’s image within a vast diverse continent that stretches 5,000 miles from Tangier to Cape Town, FIFA’s past history of graft and lack of transparency. All this and more for 80 games spread over 32 days. Perhaps its best if FIFA’s member associations follow the advice given by CAF president Ahmad Ahmad during a recent press conference held in Casablanca: “Let the best bid win.”

Rabat- The Moroccan dirham depreciated by 0.5 percent against the euro and appreciated by 1 percent vis-à-vis the dollar, according to the latest weekly indicators of the week from March 1 to 7, published by Bank Al Maghrib (BAM). The central Bank’s indicators for this period also show that net international reserves are set at MAD 233.5 billion, which slightly decreased by 0.3 percent on a week-to-week basis, compared to a 5.5 percent decline on a year-over-year basis. During this period, Bank Al-Maghrib injected MAD 47 billion in 7-day advances through a call for tenders and granted MAD 3.4 billion to the SME financing support program , with a total market intervention amounting to MAD 50.4 billion. On the interbank market, the weighted average rate was 2.26 percent, while the volume of trade has increased from MAD 3 billion to MAD 3.5 billion, BAM said.  In terms of the stock market indicators, the MASI slightly rose by 0.1 percent, bringing its performance since the beginning of the year to 6.2 percent and the overall volume of trade amounted to MAD 719.3 million. On January 15, Morocco’s Ministry of Economy and Finance officially widened the band in which the Moroccan dirham trades against a basket of currencies, 60 percent for the euro and 40 percent for the dollar, from ±0.3 percent to ±2.5 percent. Over a timeframe of 10 to 15 years, the ministry explained that it will move towards a free floating currency.  According to BMI Research, a Fitch Group firm that provides macroeconomic, industry and financial market analysis, Morocco’s new reform is “unlikely to prompt a sharp currency sell-off, limiting near-term risks to growth and inflation.”  The group also pointed out that this move is “likely to help the country in its efforts to attract greater investment to the kingdom and diversify trade, while the risks of disorderly depreciation are well contained given the country’s robust financial buffers.”

Rabat – After months of reported policy difference between President Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the rift reached a point of no return this week, with Trump publicly announcing at a press conference that he has decided to outs Tillerson from his post as the U.S.’ top diplomat. “I am proud to nominate the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Mike Pompeo, to be our new Secretary of State,” Trump said in his statement, praising his new man’s professional and academic records, and saying that he will be “a great Secretary of State.” Trump nominated, in the same move, Gina Haspel as the replacement for Mike Pompeo’s previous position, therefore elevating Haspel as the first ever woman director of the CIA. So Tillerson, who recently brought his Africa visit to an abrupt end to fly home, had after all been recalled home in order to be ousted from his position. Sources close to the White House reported calling Secretary Tillerson to advise him to rush back as he would soon be replaced. And while Trump said at today’s press conference that he had discussed his decision with former Secretary of State, Tillerson’s spokesperson Steve Goldstein is adamant that he [Tillerson] is “unaware of the reason” that motivated Trump’s move, as “he did not directly speak to the president.” But Trump later explained why he “sacked” Tillerson, pointing towards their differences on various policies and strategic issues: “It was a different mindset,” Trump said. He added: “When you look at the Iran deal, I think it’s terrible. I guess he thought it was OK. . . So we were not really thinking the same. With Mike, Mike Pompeo, we have a very similar thought process. I think it’s going to go very well.”  Rexit? However, Trump’s abrupt move, as always, met with some harsh criticisms, accusing the president of hunting down difference of opinions and those committed to high standards in his administration, favoring “men and women” who see the world as the president does, and who would almost never challenge or disagree with him. Some on the internet are already using the nickname Rexit to refer to how rapid and unforeseen and quite out of sense the whole process was unfolded to the public. Tillerson was an unapologetic critic of a scores of Trumps’ foreign policy positions, including, among others, the Iran deal, the Paris climate deal, and most recently Trump’s breakthrough towards holding negotiations with North Korea, and as Trump prepares to see through his North Korea plan, Tillerson became a possible hindrance to quickly sideline.

Rabat – Algerian politician Mohcine Belabbas announced that “the opening of the Algerian-Moroccan borders depends largely on the Algerian government,” in an interview with Algerian news source TSA, on Sunday. Benabbas, who is the president of the opposition party Rally of Culture and Democracy (RCD), believes that “a consensus exists among Algerian political actors to reopen the Algerian-Moroccan borders.” According to the politician, the idea of the reopening “obviously requires talks between the leaders of the two countries in order to establish cooperation on their security against the banditry and trafficking that enhanced due to the closure.” The Algerian political added that the RCD, along with three other parties from the Maghreb, including Morocco’s Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM), launched an initiative with political parties from Tunisia and Libya. The initiative aims to influence international decisions in these countries around issues of trade, border security, and illegal emigration. “For several years, the bilateral and multilateral relations between the countries that make up this region have broken down. We see a status quo where there are a lot of problems that have to be solved,” noted Belabbas. The political parties involved in the initiative includes the Tunisian party Al Joumhouri  and the Libyan National Party (PNL). “I would add that this initiative will be extended to other political formations in these different countries or even in other countries of the region such as Mauritania,” he added. “This initiative is driven by the historical criteria and political considerations whose geopolitical implications are more and more pressing,” according to a joint statement by the parties. The statement was also printed in the interview publication. The parties also invite “all the progressive forces” of the Maghreb to join the initiative. Asked if his party contacted political parties in Algeria to join the initiative, Belabbas said that the idea is not new for the RCD. “We talked about it at the national convention in June 2013 and then at the economy symposium we organized. So, it had to be realized.” The closure of the border between the neighbors dates back to 1994. The decision to close the borders was taken by Algeria “after Rabat imposed visa regulations on Algerian visitors in the wake of a terrorist attack on the Atlas Asni Hotel in Marrakech,” according to Al Jazeera.

Rabat – Two members of the Royal Gendarmerie were arrested on charges of corruption and financial diversions in the province of Safi, stated the daily Al Akhbar in its March 13 edition. After imposing disciplinary sanctions on several senior officials in Mohamed Haramou’s department, two members of the military establishment were detained in custody in the barracks of Tamesna in Rabat. The two gendarmes, including the driver of Colonel Houssine Kaamouz and the officer responsible for the management of social housing for the gendarmerie in Safi, were jailed pending the end of the department investigation. The initial stages of the investigation reveal that the officers diverted an allocation from the high command of the Royal Gendarmerie that was intended for the creation of social housing, specifically, the construction of a four-floor building in the city of Safi. General Haramou, head of the Royal Gendarmerie, has also made several changes in the ranks of his department. Haramou was appointed by King Mohammed VI in early December 2017, replacing Lieutenant General Hosni Benslimane.

Rabat- Last weekend, an unlikely and unprecedented technical mistake in Barid-Bank’s operating system caused scores of the bank’s customers to be millionaires, with some of the “lucky” customers then taking steps to go to ATMs to immediately siphon received sums, in a move to definitely make the money theirs. This is the first instance that a Moroccan bank mistakenly transfers 300 million MAD to its customers’ accounts, Assabah and Al Massae reported in their Monday editions, adding that Barid-bank’s authorities have sent a steady series of text messages to many of its customers, pleading with them to cooperate with the bank in solving this big problem by willingly returning the “undue surpluses” on their accounts. Seizing the moment to try and make sense of the unfolding drama of this spectacular banking mistake, Al Massae reports that pictures leaked on Facebook have showed some current accounts jumping from some few thousands MAD to 400,000 or 50 million MAD, in the space of a mistaken click. While 30 million of the concerned amount are said to have already been siphoned via ATMs, Barid-Bank is said to have successfully annulled many ATM cards, thus making it impossible to withdraw money via that channel until the bank settles the problem. Barid-Bank, which has so far issued no press release concerning the situation or the extent of the financial loss thereof, is still said to be relying on the private text messages it sent its customers, telling them to restitute the entirety of “undue sums” they may have already withdrawn. And with some clients not being responsive or receptive to the bank’s numerous entireties, Barid-Bank is threatening to take appropriate legal action.

Rabat – The Public Prosecutor of Casablanca’s Court of Appeal, Najim Bensami, has decided to prosecute Afaf Bernani, one of the complainants in the Taoufik Bouachrine case. According to the Public prosecutor,  Bernani will be prosecuted for accusing the judicial police (BNPJ) of falsifying her statements. Bernani is one of the complainants who allegedly accused jailed journalist Bouachrine of rape and violence. The complainant has now accused Morocco’s judicial police of falsifying her statements during investigations. She claims that she never said she had been harassed by Bouachrine.  In a press conference held on March 12, the prosecutor said Bernani asserted that she was sexually harassed by Bouachrine.  The Public Prosecutor added that the police have a video of her initial questioning, in which she allegedly confirms that she was harassed.Subsequently, the Public Prosecutor decided to try Bernani for defaming the judicial police. The complainant will appear before the court on April 3. Bouachrine, who was arrested on February 28, is facing charges of sexual harassment, gendered violence, and rape. The police claim to be in possession of 50 videos backing the charges facing the prominent journalist. The police have further hinted that said videos were recorded by Bouachrine himself. The journalist appeared before the court on March 8. The hearing was tense, with numerous journalists and over  20 lawyers present. During the first trial, Bouachrine’s lawyers made the case for their client’s innocence, claiming the videographic evidence  the police claim to possess have been “falsified.” During a press conference held on March 12, the Public Prosecutor said that Bouachrine’s appeal against the judicial police “has no legal basis” and the accusations of falsification are “unfounded.”

Rabat- Vehicles of the world’s biggest carmaker, Volkswagen, are reportedly using more fuel and still emit four times the allowable level of noxious gases, despite pollution enforcement measures implemented after the worldwide “dieselgate” emissions cheating scandal, revealed a study conducted by the Australian Automobile Association (AAA) on Monday.  The German car manufacturer Volkswagen has come under fire after a group of West Virginia University (WVU) scientists discovered in 2015, that the car manufacturer had installed a “defeat device” into its diesel-engine vehicles to cheat fuel emission tests, angering environmental authorities and car owners alike. Although the affected cars were recalled by VW, the Australian Automobile Association said tests it commissioned on local vehicles before and after being updated showed they were still exceeding regulations in real-world settings, guzzling up to 14 percent more diesel fuel than the standard.  “Emissions analysis… found an affected VW diesel vehicle to be using up to 14 percent more diesel after recall, and still emitting noxious emissions more than 400 per cent higher than levels observed in laboratory testing,” the AAA said in a statement.  Following the revelations, Volkswagen rejected AAA’s findings on the fuel efficiency of its recalled cars, saying that Germany’s KBA motor vehicle authority had approved its software update, and the fixed vehicles “continue to satisfy European and Australian emissions standards”.  The sale of diesel cars in Europe and United States has been in steady decline, as several studies showed that even the newest diesel-engine cars produce pollution far above what is legally permitted.  One study carried out by Transport &amp; Environment, a Brussels-based lobby for sustainable transport, has found that “a typical diesel car emits 42.65 tonnes of carbon dioxide over its lifecycle, or 3.65 tonnes more than a petrol car.”  Volkswagen has been under pressure internationally, not only after the company installed misleading gauges to make car engines appear less polluting than they actually were, but also after the New York Times reported on January 25, 2018 that a US institut commissioned by the German auto firm carried out diesel fume inhalation tests on humans and monkeys in 2014.

Rabat- Middle East’s biggest bank, Qatar National Bank (QNB), is seeking to almost double its foreign ownership limit to 49 percent from 25 percent, according to a statement released by the group on Monday. “QNB Group intends to recommend to the Extraordinary General Assembly (EGA) of the Bank, to approve increasing the percentage of non-Qatari ownership in the Company’s capital to 49 percent instead of 25 percent,” reads the statement, adding that the bank it would announce the date for the EGA “in due course.” The Qatar National Bank, is seeking shareholder approval to boost foreign ownership, as most Qatari companies limit it to a quarter of  total company ownership, unless otherwise stipulated by shareholders.  Current shareholders include the Qatar Investment Authority, which holds significant stakes in real estate in London and other various companies, including the German automotive group Volkswagen. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, about 7 percent of QNB is currently held by foreign investors.  The move comes amid Qatar’s ongoing economic and diplomatic crisis, due to the blockade by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and Egypt, following accusations of suspicious links between the Gulf country and extremist groups, in addition to its  friendly relationship with Iran.  Since the beginning of the regional crisis, Qatar has reportedly injected an amount of USD 43 billion into the Doha banks.   However, the region’s largest lender, QNB said it’s seeking to increase foreign ownership to “encourage more foreign funds to invest in the bank and diversify investors,” and that the move is not related to the standoff.

(@eemscully) January 29, 2018  “Caftan” (alternative spelling:“kaftan”) was originally worn by Ottoman sultans, but due to the Ottoman Empire’s strong global influence in the last few centuries, it has been adopted by different cultures throughout the world (for example, in northern and western Africa). Caftan reached Morocco after its spread through Andalusia which first adopted it in the 9th century. Morocco later refashioned and added its unique touch to the caftan, which is now known as “Moroccan Caftan.” Today, caftans are embraced in the Arab world of fashion, and are mainly worn by women during events like weddings.

Rabat – The French frigate Hermione, which carried the Marquis de Lafayette to the U.S. colonies, successfully arrived on March 7 in Tangier Med port, its first and only stopover in Africa. Symbolizing freedom, solidarity, and peace, the Navy has been sailing since January 30 from its home port in Rochefort, France, to bring worldwide youths closer as it carries onboard 350 volunteer sailors from 34 French-speaking countries. “I do not know if our experience can save the world, but it can serve as an example and make life more harmonious between people of different cultures, different countries, to be more open and more patient,” says Dani, one of the sailors from Canada. Launched in April 1779, the original Hermione is famed for having taken General Lafayette from Rochefort, France to Boston, USA, to deliver the secret news that he had secured 5,500 French troops and 5 frigates to support George Washington in fighting the American Revolutionary War. Miles Young, president of the Friends of Hermione-Lafayette in America, said that the resurrection of Hermione makes history alive again. A crowd of several hundred people cheered its arrival at the port, including Morocco’s Minister of Justice, Mohamed Aujjar, and the French ambassador to Morocco, Jean-François Girault, who praised the commitment of these young gabiers participating in the movement “Freedom Together,” describing this first stopover of the Hermione in Tangier to be of  “great importance” as it symbolizes the “exceptional friendship between France and Morocco.” The Hermione crew set sail for a total of twelve stopovers including La Rochelle, Tangier, Barcelona, Sète, Toulon, Marseilles, Port Vendres, Nice, Bastia, Portimão, Pasaia, and Bordeaux, before the ship returns to Rochefort in France in June 2018.

The same source added that the DA (Democratic Alliance), South Africa’s main opposition party, will also be represented at the conference, with details that the DA delegation will be led by Stevens Mokagalapa, the party’s spokesperson for foreign policy-related matters. In addition to the two political representations, 15 South African civil society organizations are also said to be expected at the forum. This year’s edition will be held under the theme of: “Africa and South-South Cooperation: Improving governance and the living standards of populations, and Morocco’s regional and international roles.” Participants to a previous edition had already described the event as “an opportunity to promote peace and dialogue”, hailing the modern infrastructures in Dakhla as “a model for the future of Morocco and Africa.” The important South African presence at this fourth edition is bound to send signals that the new administration may after all uphold the terms of the Rabat-Pretoria rapprochement signed between King Mohamed VI and President Zuma, in the final months of the latter’s reign.

Rabat – Following the rape and murder of an 11-year-old schoolgirl in Ait Imour (located in the Marrakesh-Tensift-El Haouz suburb), the Moroccan Association of Human Rights branch in Marrakech called to intensify punishments against convicts of pedophilia. The human rights organization called for the, “tightening and toughening [of] penalties for sexual crimes against minors,” declared a statement given to the Moroccan electronic news outlet Hespress. The organization also called upon authorities to ensure the safe return of all of the victim’s classmates to their classes—to help appease their anxiety after the incident. To avoid the occurrence of other monstrous crimes, the organization also called upon officials to reduce the distance between schools and villages, or to provide safe school transport services.  The criminal, aged 20, has reportedly been given a light sentence— only a year and a half in prison—for the rape of the  11-year-old girl. In an act of solidarity with women working in the education sector in the region, the organization has condemned all forms of sexual harassment made against them. According to the organization, several teachers from Ait Imour reported acts of sexual harassment to the authorities during the last school season but were forced to abandon their complaints out of fear of retaliation (including fear of physical assault).

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat – The 1923 Leica camera prototype o-Series broke the records as the most expensive item sold at Vienna’s Westlicht Camera auction house on Saturday, March 10. The initial bid for the German-made camera was EUR 400.000 before a bidding war emerged, resulting in an astonishing increase in the camera’s bid price: the winning bidder offered EUR 2.4 million ( approximately MAD 27 million) to seal the deal with the world’s highest price placed in a camera bid auction. A Westlicht report revealed that the buyer is a private collector from Asia, and that the camera’s original condition played an important role in the increase of its bid price. “The remarkable price certainly also reflects the camera’s fantastic original condition […] in 1923, two years before the first Leica was introduced to the market, Ernst Leitz produced 25 of this test camera, only three of which are known to still be in the original condition,” according to the German news site DW. The first prototype Leica camera was made in the 1920s in Germany by Ernst Leitz Company; it was initially intended to photograph mountains and landscapes.

Rotary International’s 9010 Maghreb District has joined the Royal Pan-African Vision in organizing this major event, a first in Rotary’s history. This is why Rotary International President Ian Riseley, accompanied by his wife Lady Juliet, will graciously Chair this event for what will be his first official trip to Morocco. “We have reached a turning point where we need to meet to know each other, to discuss the situation of our continent and the role that Rotary can and must play as an actor in civil society, but also to design and build a sustainable strategy and set a vision of what tomorrow’s African Rotary will look like. ” said Dr. Abdelilah Lahlali, Governor of the 9010 Maghreb District. At this Summit, the organizers will discuss the economic, social, and environmental aspects of the six strategic areas of Rotary International and the resulting actions that will have a real impact on the African continent. The Summit will bring together more than 750 leaders (decision makers, businessmen, lawyers, etc.), coming from 50 African countries but also from Australia, America, Europe, and Asia. This event will also be the opportunity for the organization of a forum for young African entrepreneurs. The ultimate goal of this meeting is to provide an opportunity for Rotarians and their guests to share their perspectives on regional challenges and the evolution of Rotary around the world. And last, but not least, there will be the launching, for the first time in Africa, of a training program on the Systemic Analysis of Development (ASD). Developed by the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi (UQAC) in collaboration with the International Organization of La Francophonie (OIF), this project is initiated by Rotary of Morocco in partnership with the university through its Center for Canadian University Studies in Morocco (CEUCM) and the International Organization of La Francophonie through its subsidiary body, the Institute of Francophonie for Sustainable Development (IFDD). The program that will be taught by Canadian experts and professors will make possible the use of the tools allowing for the operation of the program of sustainable development by 2030, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. This training will be attended by about twenty selected candidates coming from several countries of French-speaking Africa in addition to Morocco, a world first for Rotary. This program will enable the training of national experts that will be able to integrate in their national context the ASD to design and evaluate, in terms of sustainable development, the policies, strategies, programs, and projects (PSPP) of their countries in the perspective of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (PDD-H2030) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). ASD is defined as, “A participatory process of questioning and analyzing all the impacts of a policy, strategy, program, or project, taking into account the dimensions and objectives of the sustainable development, their interactions and the reference values that motivate their implementation, monitoring, and accountability, with a view to continuous improvement.” Khalid Kabbaj, organizing committee chair declared, “This project is a continuation of the actions of Rotary International, one of whose strategic focuses is the preservation of the environment and sustainable development. On the sidelines of the Summit, International Rotary President Ian Risley will plant the last of the 1,200,000 trees challenge, a 9010 district governor challenge launched with Rotary clubs in the district”.

Rabat – Protests decrying social disparity continue to shake Jerada, where four local miners have died working in illegal mines in recent months.  On Sunday, national and international news sources reported the arrest of two leaders of the ongoing protests, while the public prosecutor at the Oujda  Court of Appeal says that the arrest “has no connection with the events in the city of Jerada.” The alleged activists, Amine Mkallech and Mustapha Idanine, were arrested on Saturday and were still under detention on Sunday, relatives said. In a statement sent to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the prosecutor said that the arrest of Mustapha Idanine resulted from a traffic accident. “After investigations conducted by the judicial police, it turned out that this was a traffic accident committed by the individual in question on March 8, 2018 at 01:00 a.m. and that the inquiry is still ongoing,” said the statement. The state-owned news agency, however, did not reveal any information about the arrest of the second alleged activist. Protests erupted last December after two brothers were killed in a tunnel accident, 85 meters below ground. The third victim was killed under the same circumstances, while the most recent victim was killed after being shocked by a compressor in the abandoned Sidi Boubker mine in the province of Jerada, sparking another wave of protests denouncing regional social inequalities. Since 2017, King Mohammed VI has been urging the government to reshuffle the current development model, as it failed to “reduce social and inter-regional disparities,” said the King in a message addressed to the 3rd parliamentary forum on social justice, which took place on February 19 in Rabat. The monarch also stressed the importance of giving the social disparities issue a special consideration in order to respond to citizens’ growing demands and needs. The death of the most recent victim came only after the government spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said that the cabinet is “currently at an advanced stage to honor its commitments and implement them in the province of Jerada.” After the weekly cabinet meeting on Thursday, El Khalfi told the press that “efforts on the ground [have] resulted in the implementation of a number of measures since the visits made to the province by several ministers.” On February 10, Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani visited the city of Oujda with a delegation of officials and ministers to meet regional and local leaders and discuss measures to support the economic and social conditions of Jerada’s residents. During the meeting, El Othmani promised the immediate suspension of illegal mining activities in the region.

Rabat – The city of Agadir will host the first annual international conference on education quality, from March 14-16 at the National School of Commerce and Management. Organized by the Ibn Zohr University, the conference will cover areas like education, including early childhood, primary, secondary, higher education, and vocational training contexts. According to organizers, this year’s theme of “Quality in Education: Local Needs, Global Challenges” has been adopted “to promote local needs and expectations while keeping up with a rapidly developing world.” The event’s agenda will focus on strategies for addressing both local educational needs and global educational challenges, through keynote sessions of prominent speakers and a variety of panel discussions from participants representing 21 countries from Africa, Europe, America, Asia, and North America. The conference will feature six keynote speakers, namely Professor Mohammed Aboussalah, Secretary General of the Ministry of National Education, Vocational Training and Higher Education of Morocco; Professor Rached Boussema at the National Engineering School of Tunisia (ENIT) in the University of Tunis El Manar; Professor Tony Bertram, Honorary Director of the Centre for Research in Early Childhood in Birmingham, United Kingdom; Professor Alma Fleet, Honorary Associate Professor in the Department of Educational Studies of Macquarie University in Australia; Professor Chris Pascal (OBE), President and founding member of the European Early Childhood Education Research Association (EECERA); and Professor Kenneth Bartlett, Associate Dean of Faculty Development and International Initiatives University of Minnesota in United States. “The conference successfully provides the opportunity for education leaders, researchers and practitioners to exchange visions and discuss the problems and challenges and to come up with scientific and practical recommendations that contribute to raising the quality of education,” Mustapha Aabi, President of Scientific Committee, said in a statement.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Rock Heritage Park has successfully identified more than 400 new archaeological heritage sites across the country. Aiming to study, document, and protect the deep-rooted heritage of Morocco, the park is planning more scientific and archaeological research programs, according to a statement made by the Ministry of Culture. The park has also contributed to the establishment of excavation programs in the areas of Tata, Tan Tan, Al-Haouz, Aousserd, and other Moroccan regions.Furthermore, it is working to protect rock engravings from plunder and destruction in southern regions, according to the statement.  The Ministry also chaired a series of scientific and communication meetings which aimed to protect rock art sites. These meetings, according to the Ministry, help promote cultural heritage and encourage local and regional authorities to adhere to the program regulations to preserve the sites. The Ministry also organizes training sessions for local actors that teach preservation of rock heritage, and offer tools and various means to raise awareness for the need to protect the national archeological sites. The statement added that the ministry has set up a Provincial Center for the Preservation and Interpretation of Rock Carvings in Tata—a province located in southwestern Morocco. Recently, the Ministry promoted a draft law which would significantly bolster the protection and preservation of Morocco’s vast cultural heritage. The Ministry is promising a higher level of consistency in its role of overseeing preservation. Additionally, the strategy integrates newly recognized international concepts of cultural heritage, said the ministry in a statement released by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).

Rabat – The 21st annual New York Sephardic Film Festival opened on March 5 with a focus on Morocco. The featured performance involved the Grammy-nominated group Innov Gnawa summoning the spirits of Shabbat with the Israeli Sephardic jazz musician Itamar Borochov; for the third year in a row, this cultural exchange happened thanks to the partnership with the Mimouna Association, a grassroots Moroccan organization which introduces Jewish culture to Muslim university students. Gnawa music, which arose out of musical traditions of black Moroccans, and was adopted and adapted by Jews for post-Shabbat gatherings that would go on all night, is a novelty for most American Jews, even those who are familiar with the more general Moroccan musical tradition and who have had the occasion to see Gnawa groups perform all over Morocco. The novelty of the beautiful costumes, and the creative fusion of the  Gnawa songs with  Itamar Borochov’s jazz performance should come as no surprise thanks to Morocco’s rich mosaic of cultures, and encouragement not of mere coexistence, but curiosity and mutual exploration of each other’s traditions by the people from various backgrounds – Arab, Amazigh, Jewish, black tribes from other African regions who have since added their touch to Morocco’s diversity. Already famous for preserving its multifaceted cultural identity at home, Morocco is also leading by example among other MENA countries. Morocco’s leadership manifests in two ways: through the impact, its own culture has in other countries, and second, by promoting peace and good relations with other states through cultural exchanges and participation in other events. Moroccan communities are strong and active in many European countries, but they are also making an impact in the United States. In New York, for instance, a community movement called Moroccan Americans in New York, led by Simo Elaissaoui, who was recognized at the Opening Night for his contribution to the monthly Jewish and Moroccan social networking dinners, is now an NGO that is working together to build bridges between the Moroccan American community in New York and other groups, including American Jewish professionals, as well as doing broad cultural outreach by introducing Moroccan culture to the diversity of the busy city life. Despite being thousands of miles away from Morocco, the community spirit, values, and connection to their culture is strong and carries the message of openness and warmth wherever these communities settle. For that reason, Moroccans are also successful messengers of peace and bridgebuilding wherever they go.  In fact, this year, American Sephardi Federation, which is the organizer of the film festival, made history by successfully nominating two young Moroccan filmmakers to the Jerusalem Film Festival study program. They will spend 6-8 weeks learning and shooting short films in Israel over the summer. The films will then be presented at the next NY Sephardic Film festival in 2019. Moreover, the opening ceremony, held in the spirit of Moroccan tolerance, honored the Golden Globe-winning Franco-Tunisian director Said Ben Said with a Pomegranate Award for Moral Courage in response to his valiant stand against Jew-hatred in the Arab world. Mr. Ben Said, in a conversation, explained that his strong opposition to anti-Semitism arose as he grew up as a minority in France, and came to feel a sense of solidarity with other such groups, including Jews. He made it clear that he views much of the hatred aimed at Israel not as a form of support for Palestinian aspirations to statehood, or empathy for their suffering (for there is no mass outrage about the fate of the Palestinians trapped in refugee camps in Syria, for instance), but rather, hatred of Jewish presence in the Middle East. In his acceptance speech, he quoted Kafka’s response on that issue, which compared Zionism to a caravan peacefully sojourning to its destination. Kafka contrasted it with the virulent forms of extreme and ethnocentric European nationalism which contributed to the major wars plaguing the 20th century. Some would say, that such a presentation was political and therefore controversial. However, Morocco had sent an official representative to be at the event, who, along with officials from a number of other countries, correctly understood Ben Said’s message – political disputes, however, heated, should be settled without besmirching entire nations with hateful and defamatory messaging, nor should political conflicts between governments be an impediment to cultural exchanges between their peoples. Among MENA states, Morocco, again, is a leader in underscoring that cultural and athletic exchanges are not a place to resolve external political issues, but rather moments of bonding, learning, and friendly competition. In an inspiring lesson of true sportsmanship that places merit above propaganda and political agendas, Morocco hosted a world championship tournament in judo in Agadir, where two Israelis won medals. A female judoka took home the gold, and was allowed to display the Israeli national flag, while the Israeli anthem:”HaTikvah” played during the ceremony. This event is monumental, because it showed Morocco’s growing leadership, strength, and security as a rising star in Africa and an increasingly influential MENA country. Strong countries need not be afraid of athletes and other non-political figures visiting, partaking in cultural events – and even taking the risk of winning under their own flags, even when the governments of these countries are in dispute over some issue of considerable importance. The role of athletic events is precisely in overcoming such barriers. Nor should athletes who happen to be living in a particular state should be penalized for the actions of their governments.  Athletic competitions are the healthiest outlets for aggressive energy; just as cultural exchanges are much more preferrable fora to discuss controversial ideas than never-ending political battles, where all sides are compelled to play to public expectations of their constituents and agenda-driven groups, rather than to humanize one another and come to any sort of understanding. By refusing to boycott such events, or even hosting them, Morocco is accomplishing something important not just for herself but for all MENA countries looking to overcome past and present issues in dealing with each other, and sorting out various problems. It is setting an example of separating ideas from the people who carry them. That ability is what defines moderation, and what is unthinkable to extremists. Blind hatred has never led to any resolutions of conflicts, any improvements in human rights, any growth in understanding. On the contrary, inability to view individual members of any particular group as individual human beings with motivations, aspirations, and interests apart from the larger goals of that group have only fueled continuous problems and separation. Engaging in a discussion or an exchange does not mean acceptance or agreement with any political agenda, or for that matter, any particular paradigm or idea. Yet for too long, conflicts in MENA have turned into total wars, which, rather than focusing on separating the politics from the human endeavors, conflated conflcts with complete dehumanization of all participants, sowing distrust, bigotry, and fear. Morocco’s willingness to take steps which go far beyond what some of its neighors are willing to do, at a risk of raising eyebrows, is the only pragmatic solution to move past the endless and self-fulfilling need to nod to the public expectations and appearances and actually lead not only its own society, but all others hampered by misgivings and uncertainty, into a better direction. In essence, these steps have carved out a room where discussion of even the most controversial subjects is permissible, where openness to engage directly sets the tone for potential resolutions and creative ideas rather than talking past one another, and where the natural curiosity inherent to all human beings can finally satisfy itself through knowledge, learning, and experience rather than through rumors, conspiracy theories, fantasies, and distortions. We should be under no illusion that there is a quick fix to all of the current impediments to peaceful coexistence within MENA. There are far too many factors, issues, and questions to be addressed, too many decades of disinformation, misinformation, and accumulated biases.  However, the sowing of the seeds for growth is that first step that can bring about a journey of discovery and exploration, that will eventually lead to more and more people of various backgrounds coming together to resolve these issues rather than use them as weapons to perpetuate misunderstandings and tensions. There was, however, one magic ingredient that should not be forgotten before any such serious discussion. Moroccans know that secret well, and for that reason, their efforts in coexistence have been so successful. That secret is… plenty of good food and laughter. Before entering the auditorium to listen to all the speeches,  we ate copious amounts of delicious Moroccan food, drank Moroccan tea, partook in henna decorations, flaunted caftans, and mingled in a relaxed setting – meeting each other, talking, laughing, taking pictures, and seeing incredible opportunities for a rich, fascinating, and joyous future together. Only after we were satiated and not a crumb was left, did we get to the presentations. And it went very well. The lesson in that, of course, is first – if you want a great event, make sure to invite Moroccans. Not only will they show up, and be present in every moment, but you will have plenty to talk about and remember for years to come. And… never engage in any serious discussions or controversies on an empty stomach. Moroccans know that, and for that reason, they lead the way. Full people are happy people, and happy people make things happen. Moroccan opening night was a spectacular success thanks to its many partners – Association Mimouna, the Consulate General of Morocco in New York, and of course, Morocco Tourism Office… and it was but just one of the many more great events to come. Now when people hear Morocco, they no longer ask me about safety issues or express fear… they are starting to think of good food, of great music, of natural diversity, and of openness… and they want to come back for much more.

According to a statement issued March 11 by tournament organizers, the Moroccan delegation will compete across nine sports: athletics, swimming, tennis, volleyball, bocci, equestrian, weight-lifting, table tennis, and skating. Established in 1994, the Moroccan Special Olympics program has supported 11,850 athletes, according to the statement. The communiqué recalled the important role of late Princess Lalla Amina of Morocco, who was “instrumental in supporting the activities of Morocco’s Special Olympics, from the hosting of the second Regional Games in 2000 in Rabat to the 2010 World Strategic Conference.” President of the Moroccan Special Olympics, Sharifa Lalla Sumaya Al Wazzani, underscored the role of Special Olympics in improving the lives of people with intellectual disabilities by providing them with opportunities to develop their physical fitness and to highlight their sporting talents and skills. The president of the Moroccan Special Olympics said that “the 9th Special Olympics for the Middle East and North Africa region […] will be a great event for our athletes to showcase their skills and abilities and to develop them.” “It also provides a platform for people with intellectual disabilities to interact with the community, which will enable them to gain self-confidence and facilitate their integration,” she added. The event will see the participation of 1,000 athletes from 31 countries. The event, according to the statement, “will be the first major sporting event ahead of Special Olympics World Games Abu Dhabi 2019.” Participating athletes will take part in 16 different sports that will be “hosted in eight different venues including ADNEC, Zayed Sports City, Yas Marina Circuit, NYUAD, Officer’s Club, Mubadala IPC Arena, Al Jazira Sports Club and Al Forsan Club.” The statement added that the two events are part of “the UAE’s National Vision 2021 that highlights the full integration of people of determination into everyday society.”

Rabat – On Saturday, Israel’s national anthem was played at the 2018 Agadir Judo Grand Prix, an international judo competition being held March 9-11. The anthem was played following the victory by Israeli judoka Timna Nelson-Levy, a situation that was strongly condemned by the youth wing of the Justice and Development Party (PJD). During the medal ceremony following Nelson-Levy’s victory, the Israeli flag was also raised. In a statement published Sunday, March 11, on the PJD website, the party’s youth branch said that “raising the flag of the Zionist entity and playing its anthem for the first time in the history of the Kingdom of Morocco is a step of normalization, which is unacceptable and provocative to the feelings of the Moroccan people.” The youth of the party urged the “Moroccan authorities to expel the representatives immediately of the Zionist entity from the Moroccan territories”, and to punish people or the entity that allowed the “desecration of Moroccan soil.” The youth wing of PJD concluded its statement affirming that Jerusalem was and will always be the capital of Palestine.

During a March 7 Foreign Affairs Committee session at the Austrian parliament, several leftist politicians attempted to pass a draft resolution which was hostile to Morocco’s official stance on the four-decade-long conflict over Western Sahara. The attempt to adopt a pro-separatist resolution was guided by a member of the Austrian Social Democratic Party, Petra Baur. The draft resolution called for the “extension of the mandate of MINURSO to include the monitoring of human rights,” an unidentified diplomatic source told Moroccan news outlet Le360. The resolution, however, received “strong opposition” from other Austrian political parties and was outvoted and was put off forever, added the source. “As soon as the draft resolution was tabled in early March, Moroccan authorities carried out an awareness campaign,” said the Moroccan diplomat. In response to the draft resolution, “the Moroccan ambassador in Austria, Lotfi Bouchaara, met with several members of parliament from different political parties to alert them to the biased and subjective content of this draft resolution,” added the source. According to the same source, “No resolution of the Security Council recommends the extension of MINURSO’s mandate to human rights. On the contrary, UN resolutions welcome the initiatives taken by Morocco in this regard.” Quoting the Moroccan diplomat, Le360 added that “it is legally incorrect to say that all peacekeeping operations have a human rights component. This is inaccurate and unjustified in the cause of MINURSO because the Moroccan national institutions function perfectly as evidenced by the Security Council resolutions.” Morocco has maintained long diplomatic ties with Austria. The bonds linking the two nations began in 1783. “It is a very old friendship that binds the two countries. In recent years, bilateral relations have intensified” between the two sides at different levels, including political-diplomatic, economic and cultural levels,” said the diplomatic source. “We are committed to preserving and strengthening this positive dynamic. We took note of the Parliament’s decision not to adopt this resolution. It is a wise approach,” the Moroccan ambassador said.

Rabat – On Saturday, three houses and a coffee shop collapsed in the old medina of Casablanca causing significant physical damage to the structures. The incident created a panic among nearby residents of the medina. Nobody was injured during the collapse of the homes, according to the initial reports published by Moroccan media. However, the collapse of the coffee shop at Hay Bouchentouf in Derb Sultan injured several people, including two who are in critical condition, according to Moroccan newssource H24. Investigations are now underway to determine the circumstances of the incident. Saturday’s incident is not the only tragic accident that happened this month. On March 3, a 17-year-old girl died in Casablanca following the collapse of a roof of a house in the Mers Sultan district.

Rabat – After a year of record sales in 2017, the Moroccan automotive market is seeing a slight decline in sales in its early-year performance.  According to monthly statistics published by the Association of Importers of Vehicles in Morocco (AIVAM), only 25,860 vehicles were sold in February 2018 compared to 26,578 vehicles sold in the same period of last year, down by 2.7 percent. The passenger cars sector (VP) fell by 1.2 percent as sales reached 24,171 units at the end of February 2018 against 24,464 units sold last year.  As for light commercial vehicles (LCVs), statistics revealed a noticeable decline of 20.1 percent, equivalent to 1.682 units sold in 2018 against 2.114 vehicles sold over the same period in 2017.   AVIAM statistics add that the sector of imported cars (CBU) registered a decrease in sales, down by 1.89 percent. Only 22,058 units were sold in February 2018 against 22,482 vehicles sold last year.  According to AVIAM’s study, the top five highest-selling car brands are Dacia, Renault, Ford, Hyundai, and Peugeot. Dacia is the market’s favorite, with 7.799 vehicles sold, marking an increase of 4.2 percent compared to the end of February 2017. The fifth place went to Peugeot with 1,382 vehicles sold, down by 15.32 percent over the same period last year.  Despite the slow start of this season, the Moroccan automotive market continues to lead the way in the MENA region as the best performer in BMI Research Group’s Autos Production Risk/Reward Index, due to the Kingdom’s strong production growth outlook, low labor costs, and favorable industry policy.  With an overall Autos Production RRI score of 48.9 out of 100, BMI ranked the Moroccan automotive industry as the most attractive market in the MENA region for production opportunities.  One of the other main factors making Morocco’s automotive industry attractive to foreign investors is its average labor cost, rated 89.1 points out of 100.  In addition to the low labor prices, the Kingdom’s industry policy and the government’s efforts to develop this division also play a key role in luring more manufacturers to invest in the country.

Rabat – The National Criminal Police Brigade, in collaboration with Agadir and Inezgane judicial police, arrested on Saturday evening a suspect for allegedly being the “Souss serial killer,” who murdered 8 homeless people in the South. Eight identical murders were recently recorded, seven in Agadir and one in Marrakech, said the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) in a statement. These crimes were executed by the same person, as the nature of the assault, the weapon, and the targeted victims were all similar, said the same source. “Investigations, supported by technical and scientific expertise, including DNA evidence, resulted in the arrest of the main suspect,” said the statement, adding that the suspect is himself a homeless person. The suspect, aged 29, was taken into custody, pending investigations by the prosecutor’s office  Al Ahdath Al Maghribia stated, in its March 9 edition, that the investigators have found that all of the “serial killer” victims were stoned in their heads, leading to their demise. The paper also revealed that most of his victims were in their fifties. The DGSN said that it is coordinating with the Royal Gendarmerie to identify similar crimes committed in the same manner that may have involved the 29-year-old suspect.

Rabat – The Ministry of Administration and Civil Service Reform announced Saturday that Morocco will switch to daylight saving time on Sunday, March 25 at 2:00 a.m. The measure is expected to increase the competitiveness of the national economy through a reduction in energy consumption. It will also reduce the time difference between Morocco and its regional and international trading partners. In late February, several member countries urged the EU to consider abolishing daylight saving. The energy-saving practice is under review by the European Parliament, which backed a possible plan to end daylight saving time across the 28 member states after 384 deputies out of 549 voted in favor of the resolution. The growing international debate over the seasonal practice has created a debate within Morocco as to whether the North African country will follow its European business partners in this decision. Daylight saving time was first adopted during the First World War in the UK to give factories more daylight hours to operate in, thereby aiding the war. The issue has divided MEPs within the European assembly. An October 2017 EU Parliament study stated that, “while daylight-saving time benefits the transport industry, helps outdoor leisure activities and reduces energy consumption, it is associated with disruptions to the human biorhythm.”

Rabat – Morocco’s company of breweries (SBM), a subsidiary of the French group Castel for the production of beverages, has recently provided its Tit Mellil factory with a photovoltaic power plant designed and built by the Moroccan subsidiary of the French group GreenYellow.  According to the company, this installation, which is made up of 2,208 panels on a surface of 7,500 square meters, will cover more than 17 percent of the power consumption in SBM’s manufacturing process and will prevent the emission of nearly 700 tons of CO2 per year. A grant of an undisclosed amount, but is said to be composed of several million MAD, has been allocated to this project, which is part of a global approach of the Castel group.  The Moroccan company said in a statement that SBM has become the first subsidiary of the group to carry out this project in Africa and plans to replicate this venture on other sites with other subsidiaries.  “I am particularly proud to have worked with all the employees of SBM, Groupe Castel, and our Green Yellow partners to implement this project in record time, which will provide our company with a renewable source of energy. […] I hope that we will open the way to other Pan-African projects,” Brahim Laroui, General Manager of SBM, said in a statement.  To carry out this project, SBM worked alongside GreenYellow, an energy management company specializing in energy services, energy efficiency solutions, and photovoltaic production.  Founded in 2007, GreenYellow, which has existed in Morocco since last year, has a total of 200 employees in France, South America, Asia, Africa, and the Indian Ocean region. It has already invested more than EUR 700 million worldwide to reduce the energy bills of local companies.  “We are honored to support the Société des Brasseries du Maroc in this major photovoltaic project. It demonstrates our deep conviction that economic performance and environmental responsibility must go hand in hand in the service of the competitiveness of Moroccan industrialists and the common good,” said Khalid Semmaoui, General Manager of GreenYellow Morocco.

Rabat – The leader of the Polisario Front, Ibrahim Ghali, addressed a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, urging him to condemn “any illegal exploitation of natural resources of Western Sahara” that would “hinder” the UN political process. In the letter, printed in the official separatist news agency and Algeria’s official news agency, Ghali urges the UN top chief to put pressure on Morocco and the European Union, calling for the suspension of the signed agreements, including the fisheries deal. “I urge you to call on the European Union and its member states to abandon their ongoing negotiations on trade and fisheries agreements with the Kingdom of Morocco in case [those agreements] include Western Sahara,” said the separatist leader. Recalling the ruling of the European Union Court of Justice (ECJ), Ghali said that “ the EU-Morocco Fisheries agreement cannot be applied neither in Western Sahara nor to the waters adjacent to it.” On February 27, the ECJ decided  that if the EU and Morocco included the Western Sahara territory in the scope of their fisheries agreement “that would be contrary to certain rules of general international law that are applicable in relations between the EU and Kingdom of Morocco.” The EU court added that the fisheries deal is applicable to “waters falling within the sovereignty or jurisdiction” of Morocco. The separatist representative claimed that this ruling confirms that “Western Sahara does not form part of the soil of the Kingdom of Morocco.” Reacting to the ECJ, Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, hinted at the possibility that Morocco may suspend its fisheries agreement with the EU.  In an interview that aired on March 4 on Moroccan TV channel 2M, Aziz Akhannouch did not exclude the possibility of the suspension of the fisheries agreement if it affects Morocco’s sovereignty. When asked about the possibility of ending the EU-Morocco agreement, Akhannouch remarked that “Anything is possible. It could stop [this week], but that depends on the position of the European Union because we are not part of the ECJ’s decision.” The Moroccan official added that the ECJ’s decision did not recognize the role of the Polisario Front in this matter, as the separatist group has long-been appealing against the EU-Morocco Fisheries and Agriculture Agreements. According to Akhannouch, the interests of Morocco and the EU require a review of the ECJ’s decision “with the aim of a final result.” “It is Europe’s duty to give Morocco the value it deserves,” Akhannouch  added.“If the EU offers a positive interaction that meets Morocco’s conditions, we will work together, if not, we will abandon the agreement without any problem,” stressed the Moroccan official.

Rabat – Illegal hunting threatens the survival of the Magot monkey, a species known as “Barbary Macaque” in Morocco, warns the High Commissioner for Water and Forests and the Fight Against Desertification (HCEFLCD). The destruction of the Magot habitat of this species is caused by overgrazing,  diminishing populations from the illegal trade of Magot, and as well as the climatic changes that affect Moroccan forests and water scarcity of water resources. Although the preferred habitat of the Magot Monkey is old-growth large-tree forest, a rich and diverse herbaceous layer, and the presence of water, the species has colonized various habitat types, including mixed cedar and oak forests and rocky mountains, devoid of vegetation. Some key populations of the Magot monkey maintain limited habitat to the cedar forests of Sidi M’Guild, Ifrane, and Michlifen; the green oak forests of Ain Leuh and El Hammam, between Azrou and Ain Leuh; and the southern forests of Ouiouane. The Middle Atlas hosts about 67 percent of the last remaining Magot monkey in the world. The total number of monkeys has decreased by 65 percent over the last three decades, from 15,000 to 5,000, reports the HCEFLCD. The species can also be found in certain areas of the High Atlas, with an estimated population of 1,000, as well as in the Rif where the population is currently at 2,000. “Despite the measures taken, the species is subject to several threats, in particular, the loss of its habitats, poaching, and the illegal trade of these monkeys, used as pets,” the High Commission said, days after the celebration of World Wildlife Day. Magot monkeys are classified as “vulnerable” by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and listed in the appendices of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) among species whose international trade is prohibited. The HCEFLCD indicated that it has implemented several measures for the protection of the species in its natural habitat, based on a national action plan for endangered species.

Rabat – “Ghazali Ghazali,” the latest song by Moroccan singer Saad Lamjarred has surpassed 5 million views on Youtube in less than 24 hours since its release on March 9. This latest song is Lamjarred’s second hit since his second arrest in late October 2016 for sexual assault allegations. On March 5, Lamjarred announced that he will be coming to Morocco to release his newest hit “Ghazali Ghazali.” The controversial singer said, “I would like to share with you my interim return to my country Morocco in the coming days. God willing, I will take this opportunity to present my new work, Ghazali Ghazali, from my beloved country.” The pop singer has been temporarily released on bail under electronic surveillance since April 13, 2017, after spending almost six months at the Marriott Champs Elysées in Paris to face rape and assault charges.

Rabat – Moroccan authorities seized almost 2.96 tons of banned plastic bags intended for sale in a warehouse in Tangier last Wednesday, the Ministry of Industry, Trade, Investment and Digital Economy announced in a statement.  “A supervisory commission composed of representatives of the Delegation of the Ministry of Industry, Trade, Investment and Digital Economy; the services of the Wilaya of Tangier; local authorities; the Royal Gendarmerie; and the national security forces seized last Wednesday, 2 tons and 960 kilograms of banned plastic bags intended for sale, during an investigation in a depot, located in the allotment of Al Bassatine in Tangier,” reads the statement.  The ministry mentions that a report was submitted, and the owner of the warehouse was summoned to the State services, adding that the seized goods will be burned.. The move comes as part of Morocco’s 2016 landmark bill banning the production, import, sale, and distribution of plastic bags across the kingdom, which was ranked as one the largest consumers of plastic bags–at 26 billion units, or 800 bags per person—each year. Since the law took effect in July 2016, the authorities have been strict to ensure its application, especially in shops and supermarkets in larger cities and towns.
With the legislation nicknamed “zero mika”, or “zero plastic bags” in Arabic, Morocco became one of the first countries in Africa to impose a total ban on plastic bags, joining the ranks of South Africa, Uganda, Somalia, and Rwanda.  The legislation further aligns Moroccan consumers with the kingdom’s new environmentally friendly policies, given that plastic bags take up to 1000 years to disintegrate, unlike bags made of paper or other biodegradable substances.  In light of the recent legislation, the Ministry of Industry released that 57 companies pro­duce alternatives to plastic bags, with a 1 billion woven bags, 1.8 billion non-woven bags, 8 billion paper bags, and 1,000 tonnes of thermoforming products produced annually.

Rabat – The disciplinary commission in charge of hearing the public officials suspended from their positions due to dysfunctions is set to submit its report to Moroccan Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit. The committee was appointed by Laftit in December 2017, holding its first meeting on December 25. In 2017, a wave of political earthquakes hit Morocco after King Mohammed VI ordered the dismissal of three ministers and two high officials over the dysfunction in the Al Hoceima development projects. A wali, or provincial leader, six governors, six secretaries general, eight high-ranking officials knowns as pachas, presidents of districts, 122 caids, or administrative officials, and 17 Khalifa caids, or vice-officials, were all suspended from their duties by King Mohammed VI in December 11. During the same day, the interior minister proposed disciplinary sanctions against the officials concerned, which include the suspension of the wali, governors, and 86 accused officials, to be later summoned to the disciplinary councils; and appropriate disciplinary measures to be taken against the remaining 87 accused After hearing court sessions for the most recently accused, who were subject to the sanctions affecting nearly 200 officials, the committee will present the minister with a detailed report about the investigation findings, reported Moroccan newspaper Assabah. Exemplary sanctions are expected to be issued against the officials within the month.

Rabat – The British gas company SDX Energy continues to outperform expectations. The UK-based company announced on Friday, March 9, a new gas discovery at the SAH-2 well in Sebou only a few weeks after it made a new gas discovery in the Gharb basin.  “The well was drilled to a depth of 1,304 meters and found porosity of 33 percent, exceeding the initial forecasts of the company,” said the company in an official statement.  The well, SAH-2, is the fifth discovered by the company and one of the seven wells drilled as part of its nine-well campaign in Morocco.  According to the company, the well will be tested before being connected to the existing infrastructure. An update on the results of the tests will be announced next April. “The drilling operations will proceed with the eighth well, dubbed LNB-1, located at Lalla Mimouna,” Ecofin Agency said in a statement. SDX was granted a four-month extension to July 22, 2018 at its Lalla Mimouna permit, allowing it sufficient time to evaluate the results of its exploration drilling campaign. SDX is an international oil and gas exploration, production, and development company, headquartered in London with a principal focus on North Africa.  The exploration company entered the Moroccan market in January after acquiring Circle Oil’s shares in Morocco for USD 30 million. The British company is now endowed with an eight-year permit to drill for gas in the Gharb basin.  In addition, the company successfully renewed their permits for the Gueddari Northwest, Gueddari South, Sidi Al Harati Southwest, and Ksiri Center sites. These permits will expire in 2019, 2020, 2023, and 2023, respectively.  In total, SDX Energy obtained licenses for seven drilling sites from the National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines, which holds 25 percent of working interests of SDX Energy’s activity in Morocco. SDX’s portfolio also includes high impact exploration opportunities in Egypt. The group has a 50 percent working interest in two producing assets located onshore in the Eastern Desert, adjacent to the Gulf of Suez.  These producing assets are characterized by exceptionally low operating costs, making them particularly resilient in a low oil price environment.

Rabat – Prominent Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan, who has been detained since February for his alleged sexual misconduct in France, was hospitalized once again on Thursday, according to French-based news outlet Le Figaro. Le Figaro added that Ramadan was transferred Thursday from Fleury-Merogis to a supervised facility at the Pitié-Salpetriere hospital in Paris, according to Ramadan’s lawyer, Emmanuel Marsigny Reuters. “The prison administration and medical staff have estimated that his health condition requires hospitalization,” said the lawyer. Ramadan suffers from multiple sclerosis, which required his hospitalization on February 16. The scholar appealed the decision by French authorities to keep him in custody. He is being held as “part of a preliminary inquiry” into the allegations against him. The Paris Court of Appeal, however, kept him in pretrial detention, a decision that may prevent the alleged suspect from putting pressure on witnesses and victims or escaping France, according to Le Figaro. Ramadan is undergoing a new medical examination. The findings of the examination are expected to be unveiled by the end of March. After he was taken to the hospital for treatment of multiple sclerosis on February 16, his lawyers claimed that his health deteriorated since his detainment, and argued that his condition is incompatible with imprisonment in an attempt to attain his release under bail. The French court ordered a new medical report and found, on Monday, his health to be compatible with his continued detention. The medical expert also said that Ramadan’s pathologies are unlikely to severely deteriorate. Ramadan fully denies the accusation and deemed them to be part of a “campaign of lies launched by adversaries”, which is a sentiment that was shared by his supporters.

Rabat – The increase of stampedes in the Spanish enclave of Ceuta has pushed the Moroccan-Spanish authorities to find a solution to reduce the fatalities caused by stampedes annually. For the neighbors, building a bridge in the Morocco-Spain Tarajal border checkpoints will ensure smooth traffic flow. In January, two Moroccan women died while several others suffered injuries after a stampede at one of the entrance gates of the Ceuta’s crossing border. Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported in its weekend issue that the Moroccan Spanish authorities have reached an agreement to build a bridge that will ensure the smooth flow of traffic and add two additional passages: one entrance to the Spanish protectorate and one exit.  The two other passages will be dedicated to the circulation of travelers and tourists. Al Ahdath added that the Spanish authorities will only allow access to cars whose legal documents comply with European regulations, especially the stipulation that the driver be the owner of the vehicle. The vehicle queue will be organized along the perimeter of the Moroccan side of the border to unclog the national road 352, which serves as a major thoroughfare in  Ceuta, connecting the city center and the port.  Nearly 900 cars cross the border each day. The border has also served as a  major crossing point for illegal goods. According to Spanish news outlet Ceuta Actualidad, the Spanish Ministry of Interior and Treasury have already set a plan for the modernization of the border point, known as El Tarajal I. According to the Spanish source, the construction works might begin in early 2019. The newsource added that a seven-lane expansion is planned, one of which will be reserved for the security officials. Three stampedes were reported in 2017. The first incident occurred on March 28, 2017,, while the second dates back to April 24. One Moroccan woman was killed in each respective incident. The third tragedy occurred on August 28: two Moroccan women died, while others suffered injuries. In June 2017, Spanish authorities made an agreement with the Moroccan government to prevent the so-called “human mules,” or Moroccan women who carry heavy loads of trade goods across the border, from crossing through Ceuta’s El Tarajal II checkpoint in the same day. According to the agreement, women are allowed to cross the border only on Mondays and Wednesdays, while men will be permitted on  Tuesdays and Thursdays.In the same month, Spanish parliament discussed a suggestion by Podemos Party to improve the working conditions of Ceuta and Melilla’s “human mules,” though no decisive action has occurred in the time since.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – The purser told girls to ‘live their passions without limits’ passengers onboard a Royal Air Maroc (RAM) flight on March 8. The chief flight attendant of a Royal Air Maroc (RAM) flight sent a heartfelt message to her passengers on the occasion of International Women’s Day, captured in a video shared widely on social media. In her speech, she gave the passengers a glimpse into the struggles that women endure: “Us, women, we seldom speak up. We fight sometimes, to study, to work, and to become independent.” She added, “We never say that things aren’t going well, and we never say that we’re afraid of never reaching our objectives.” For International Women’s Day, the flight attendant declared that what women really need aren’t material gifts, but in fact need a chance to speak up and be heard. “We only want to talk, raise our voices, and recognize the obstacles that make us believe we will never reach our dreams.” At the end, she addressed little girls onboard, asking them to hold on to their dreams and ambitions, while highlighting her struggle in a society that frowns upon her job. “I was always to ‘No’: ‘no you can’t pursue this career,’ ‘a woman can’t travel all the time for a living,’ ‘a woman’s place is her house not an airplane,’  “But I have ignored these voices, and I followed my passion because I wanted to live my own dream.” “I want all the little girls to dream of studying and working, and living their passions without limits. Don’t doubt your capacities: you’re strong, and you deserve a chance, don’t let it ever pass you by,” she concluded.

Rabat – In a tense human rights debate, a Moroccan delegation broke its silence in Geneva on Thursday, denouncing the hostility displayed by Algeria against “Morocco and its Sahara,” according to Morocco’s Head of Affairs in Geneva Hassan Boukili. “The Moroccan delegation deplores the hostility that Algeria has established against Morocco and its Sahara,” said Boukili during a debate with the  High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein. The statements made by Boukili came in response to “the lies” made by the Algerian ambassador on human rights in the Saharan provinces of Morocco during the 37th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council held in Geneva, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). “We regret the insistence of Algeria to pollute the Council’s debates by referring to its political dispute with Morocco over the Moroccan Sahara,” said Boukili. The Moroccan diplomat added that “the only thing left to be decolonized in our region, is the state of mind of the Algerian diplomacy with regard to Morocco and its territorial integrity.” Boukili added that Algeria is not in the right position to give Morocco lessons in democracy and human rights. “It must first sweep in front of its doors and respond to the autonomist demands of the Kabyle populations and Mozabites, whose activists are persecuted, tortured, imprisoned and forced into silence or exile.” Kabyle and Mozabite people are two minority groups in Algeria; Kabyle people are native to Kabylia in the north of Algeria, one hundred miles east of Algiers, while Mozabite inhabit the M’zab region in the northern Sahara.  The Kabyle population represents the largest Amazigh-speaking population in Algeria. Boukili added that Algeria “has no credibility to discuss human rights, because of past and present grave crimes and violations of human rights under its full responsibility in the Tindouf camps.” Boukili recalled that Algeria remains the only country in the Maghreb to prevent Algerian activists from attending the Human Rights Council in Geneva. Boukili also referred to the inhumane situation facing many sub-Saharan migrants in Algeria. In this regard, the Moroccan diplomat asked the High Commissioner for Human Rights to directly confront Algeria about its multiple human rights violations, including its responsibility for the violations in the Tindouf camps. On March 2, the Moroccan diplomat addressed the human rights issues that the Sahrawi populations suffer in the camps. Speaking at the 71st session of the Standing Committee of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Boukili emphasized that Morocco’s eastern neighbor is, “the only country to oppose the implementation of all the feasible solutions for the populations in the Tindouf camps.” The 71st session was held in Geneva March 6-8. The diplomat stressed that, unlike other refugee host countries that  generously commit to help and protect refugees, “Algeria is a unique case and a unique situation in the history of protecting and providing international assistance to refugees.” Boukili added that Algeria, “has chosen to suffer an alleged situation of Sahrawi refugees of its own creation.” He notes that the country is the only one to refuse to conduct a headcount of the populations in the Tindouf camps.

Rabat- Airports Council International (ACI), an entity that self-describes as “The voice of the world’s airports”, and in charge of monitoring and evaluating airports’ performances in satisfying customers at the global level, has recently unveiled its list of the world best airports. And Casablanca’s Mohamed V International has made it to the global top, thus jumping to the coveted place of number one in Africa, and also establishing or securing a reputation of a customer-friendly atmosphere, especially regarding comfort, security, and traffic. In the global ranking published on its website, ACI, which also gives prominence to restaurants and lounges in its overall assessment, said: “ASQ is the only worldwide program to survey passengers at the airport on their day of travel. The program measures passengers’ views of 34 key performance indicators. 74% of the world’s top 100 busiest airports are part of the ASQ network which delivers 600,000 individual surveys per year in 42 languages in 84 countries. The program served 343 airports in 2017,” adding that Casablanca is “Africa’s grand winner”, followed by Mauritius and Durban airports. ACI further noted that this year’s list of countries that made the cut was characterized by an “unprecedented”, “challenging”, and “increasingly competitive airport industry operating environment, where continuous service improvement is a key ingredient in business performance”, which would then suggest that Casablanca’s Mohamed V International, fulfilling the above criteria, reflects the considerable efforts that Moroccan airports-linked authorities have been deploying to drastically improve the country’s aviation business, especially as the Kingdom is very keen on further keeping or capitalizing on its long-standing and undisputed stature  of  “touristic hub.” But while the Kingdom’s can pride itself on its airports, the country’s national airlines (Royal Air Maroc) did not unfortunately make it to aviation companies’ ‘La cour des grands.’ In that category, considering some other criteria, essentially travel cost (low cost with good quality), the best African airlines are said to be, respectively, Ethiopian Airlines, Kenya Airways, South African Airways, Egypt Air, and Fast Jet (Tanzania), among others. The improving image of Africa-based airlines has prompted many observes to argue that the African Union’s recent Single African Market Initiative, a project aiming to submit African air travel practititioners to the “same regulatory framework”,  is perhaps the principal but ‘invisible’ incubator of this emerging image of trustworthy and reliable “African” aviation companies. While that observation has considerable legitimacy, recent indications that Africa’s airports traffics will almost triple in the next two decades, reaching the impressive figure of 303 million passengers per year, is another indicator that the continents authorities still have a lot on their plates, if, anyways, they are in the mindset ok maintaining this nascent favorable view of the continent’s business sector.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – The Museum of African Contemporary Art Al Maaden (MACAAL) held an official international opening on Saturday, February 24, at the Maaden luxury compound in Marrakech. MACAAL is the first of its kind in North Africa: a nonprofit art museum that showcases not only contemporary Moroccan art but also artists from across the continent. The same weekend, Marrakech hosted the 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair, which debuted on the African continent after earlier iterations in London and New York. Though MACAAL launched locally in 2016, the museum’s February 24 international opening built on the momentum and crowds drawn to Marrakech for the weekend. MACAAL was both founded and funded by Othman Lazraq and his father Alami Lazraq, a multimillionaire Moroccan property magnate and art collector. Othman Lazraq is the president of the museum, which now displays some of his family’s 2000-piece collection. The museum also avows an ambitious education and outreach agenda. “Our mission is to disseminate, educate, and popularize art in Morocco and within the continent, namely among younger audiences. We believe that culture is a shared asset that can be an outstanding lever for development,” according to Othman Lazraq. Tetouan-based, Los Angeles-born art historian Tina Barouti believes this is a trend across the continent, with museums such as MACAAL and the Zeit Modern Art Museum in South Africa creating “spaces by Africans to represent themselves on their own terms and soil.” Speaking to Morocco World News, Barouti noted that Morocco is uniquely situated at a “crossroads,” and that MACAAL’s “breathtaking” architecture and ambitious education programs demonstrate the ways that Morocco is asserting itself as African. “We are seeing Morocco value its African identity by supporting not only emerging Moroccan artists but also emerging African artists. In this climate, it’s really important for North Africa to represent itself as African.” The Contemporary African Art Fair also held FORUM, a series of seven talks curated by Omar Berrada, a Moroccan writer, translator, and co-director of the Dar al-Mamûn library and artist residency. “There’s been a lot of talk about Africa in Morocco in recent years, for many reasons,” said Berrada, referencing to Morocco’s 2017 decision to rejoin the African Union after a 33-year absence. “There is a serious [Moroccan] interest in reclaiming a sense of belonging on the continent, which wasn’t the case five or ten years ago.” Morocco has begun establishing itself as a both a destination for and a cultivator of contemporary African artists. In 2014, Morocco’s King Mohammed VI opened the kingdom’s first museum of modern and contemporary art in Rabat. However, Berrada continued, “it cannot only be based on economic investment—there needs to be cultural substance in terms of research, knowledge, and art production. For that to happen, there needs to be more presence, more exchange, more crossing of borders, until artists from all over Africa are more present here and vice-versa.” With 900 square meters for exhibitions divided between two floors, MACAAL creates an impressive space for African artists to display their works and promote cultural exchange. The Grand Opening also inaugurated the temporary photography exhibit “Africa is No Island,” available through August 24. It surveys works by 40 emerging and established photographers from across the continent and the wider African diaspora. As MACAAL explains, the exhibit examines “universally relevant cultural concepts of tradition, spirituality, family and the environment, within the context of modern African experiences and daily life.” The museum captured the new exhibition and the greater international opening on Twitter: “Africa is not an island but rather a connected territory, full of possibilities.”

Rabat- The National Society of Transport and Logistics (SNTL) is refuting claims that placed the department on a list of corrupt public institutions in a recent report from the Court of Auditors. The Audits Court wrote in a report released Tuesday that one of SNTL officials had received unjustified travel abroad expenses, “knowing that the person concerned had benefited from travel expenses for this mission, in accordance with the regulations in force.” The Court of Auditors’s verdict states that the director in question must refund the State for the sums collected. In a statement, reported by Maghreb Arab Press, Moroccan Games and Sports (MDJS) said that the findings of the Court of Auditors “are fully contained in in its 2008 annual report,” adding that “this mismanagement took place between 1995 to 2008.” “These facts concern the former management of the company,” the statement said, explaining that Younes El Mechrafi, current CEO of the company, is totally “unaware of the facts reported by the Court of Auditors.” At the time of the incident in 2008, El Mechrafi was CEO of Archos company. “El Mechrafi is not a civil servant and does not receive any form of salary other than his remuneration as General Manager of the MDJS,” said the National Society of Transport and Logistics, adding that the same applies for all the employees of the company. The Court of Auditors, “which regularly checks the implementation of these recommendations… has noted the full compliance of the MDJS with the court’s recommendations.”

All of the Casablanca terrorists were between the age of 20 and 23 and were residents of the same shanty towns in Sidi Moumen in Casablanca. In May 2004, Moroccan authorities arrested 2,000 suspects involved in the terrorist attack.

Rabat – Morocco’s national railway company (ONCF) launched a series of final operational trials of the High-Speed Train or LGV in February, preceding its launch scheduled for next summer. According to a statement by the ONCF released on Thursday, “These tests are aimed at validating the rolling stock and its entire infrastructure, with its power supply, signaling, and telecommunication systems and its connections to the Tangier and Kenitra railway stations.” The high-speed train is the first of its kind in Africa. The LGV will link between the cities of Tangier and Kenitra in only 1.5 hours. The train services will be expanded to connect between Tangier to Casablanca in a period of 2 hours and 10 minutes. According to the communiqué, a new speed record will be established during the so-called “overspend” tests, with expected round trim at 352 km/h  minimum. These test will take place in a few weeks, added ONCF. The LGV project is in the process of passing the last inspections, before moving on to the final organizational phase prior to its launch. To meet operational readiness standards, ONCF teams have mobilized to recruit, train, and support its railway workforce. New standards and procedures are being developed, added the company. The first tests, which took place in February and March 2017, covered over forty kilometers near Kenitra, verifying the running of the train on the ground. The second test phase, which began in September, consisted of testing the rolling stock in all possible configurations, according to ONCF.

Rabat – Burkinabe authorities expressed their gratitude to Morocco for its solidarity following the double terrorist attacks that hit Burkina Faso’s capital Ouagadougou on March 2. Last week’s deadly attacks on army headquarters and the French Embassy claimed the lives eight Burkinabe soldiers, while 61 members of the security forces were injured. The attack also injured 24 civilians. The eight attackers, who struck the headquarters, were killed in the attacks, identified by the Burkinabe government as violent acts of terror. Following the attacks, Morocco’s Ambassador in Burkina Faso Farhat Bouazza contacted Burkinabe officials to express condolences and solidarity. “Contacted by the ambassador in the aftermath of the events, the high authorities of Burkina Faso’s high authorities have not failed to express their gratitude to Morocco for the gesture of friendship, solidarity, and support that the Kingdom brings them in these very difficult circumstances,” Morocco’s ambassador told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The Burkinabe authorities have also reported the message of condolence and support addressed by King Mohammed VI to the President of Burkina Faso, March Christian Kaboré. In his message, King Mohammed VI voiced his solidarity and support for the “despicable terrorist acts.” According to the monarch, such terror acts aimed at undermining the security and stability of Burkina Faso and of the Sahel-Saharan region. The King has also expressed his “strongest condemnation” of this cowardly terrorist attacks, assuring the president of Burkina Faso of the solidarity and support of the Moroccan Kingdom in this terrible ordeal. Farhat responded saying that like other official embassies in the country, the Moroccan embassy was not surprised by these terrorist attacks. The Moroccan diplomat said that since the uprising of October 2014, Burkina Faso has been the target of attacks, not only in Ouagadougou, but also in northern regions of the country. “What was really surprising, is the chosen targets, timing and modus operandi,” said Farhat. The Moroccan ambassador added that as soon as he was informed of these attacks, the Moroccan embassy immediately reacted, setting up a crisis unit to protect the Moroccan community living in Ouagadougou. All Moroccan nationals registered with the embassy were contacted by telephone or email to warning them to avoid the areas affected by the attacks, Farhat added. The Moroccan official stated that it is necessary for the embassy to contact the Burkinabe authorities to make sure that no Moroccan victim is reported. A coalition of Sahelian jihadist groups linked to Al Qaeda, the Islamist and Muslim Support Group (GSIM), claimed credit for the Ouagadougou double attack. Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, Mali, and Mauritania launched the G5 Sahel anda joint military force in 2017, to an attempt to eradicate the jihadist groups that still ravage the area.

Rabat – The African squads qualified for the Russia 2018 World Cup campaign do not have the same paychecks for their coaches. In fact, there seems to be a sea of difference, almost an unbridgeable gulf, among those in the top five of Africa’s most paid managers. Atlas Lions’ coach Hervé Renard, with a current monthly paycheck of 800,000 MAD, is by far the highest paid coach on the African continent. But why such a large and impressive monthly paycheck for Renard? Al Massae has the answer, at east they’ve claimed so: gratitude for the impressive achievements of the national squad under his direction; acknowledgement that the French was successful in building a strong morale in the team, therefore bringing to Moroccan football the glory and visibility it has for so long been hankering after; and finally, the belief that if there is such a thing as footballing renaissance going on in Morocco, Hervé is its centerpiece, its backbone. And so naturally, for “services rendus” to Moroccan football and fans, the “white wizard” is said to deserve being spoiled! In its March 6 edition, the Casablanca-based daily noted that Renard was until recently getting 600,000 MAD per month, further adding that the 200,000 MAD increase may be explained by the fact that Moroccan federation wanted to honor and “strengthen” its commitment with a coach who has handed them everything they’d asked for. When Renard took over Morocco’s squad, Al Massae explained, the federation set him two primary goals: pass the group phase during CAN 2017, and qualify for the 2018 World Cup. And Hervé Renard achieved both goals, Al Massae exclaimed. Very far behind Renard come coaches of equally qualified squad for Russia 2018. Hervé’s direct follower in the ranking is Nigeria’s Super Eagles’ coach Gernot Rohr. The German, who makes 460,000 MAD per month, is applauded by many for bringing the harmony and pace that the Super Eagles need to compete in a challenging group at the World Cup. Others, however, have been denouncing the fact that players in Nigeria’s first division are not being considered for the Russian Campaign. With 300,000 MAD per month, Egypt’s Hector Cuper is third on the list. Qualifying for football’s ultimate tournament is surely something that a squad used to African glory has been seeking for a very long time. The Argentinean coach, with two consecutive European Champions League finals with Valencia in 2000 and 2001, and the La Liga prize for best coach in 2000, is without doubt a heavyweight in the profession. He brought Egypt to the CAN 2017 final, though he lost that one, too. Tunisia’s Nabil Mâaloul comes in fourth with 220,000 MAD. The Tunisian national, who is also a former footballer, is relatively young for the managerial position, and therefore he still has some years before him to make a name for himself. The final name in the top five is Aliou Cissé, Senegal’s coach. Aged 41, the Senegalese is obviously young and so has a lot to conquer in the future, provided, of course, that the Teranga Lions keep their current shape. With Poland, Colombia, and Japan in group H, the former defensive midfielder (also captain of the national squad at the 2002 World Cup) will be fighting for replicating or perhaps even surpassing the country’s impressive display in the 2002 campaign.

Bouachrine arrived late to his first court appearance on March 8, prompting the judge, Bouchaib Farah, to postpone the hearing for half an hour, reported Akhbar Al Yaoum, noting a number of Moroccan political and media figures in courtroom attendance. The judge adjourned the hearing for the first time after Bouachrine’s lawyer, Mohammed Ziane, accused the prosecutor, Twimi Benjellou, of representing the National Press Union and pleading against Bouachrine and, “pushing” him in the presence of the judge. Moments later, when the hearing resumed the prosecutor Khadija Arroukani caused another courtroom breakdown when she pointed out that the trial coincided with International Women’s Day, provoking Bouachrine’s defense. The hearing adjourned again when Zian requested that the defense present the pre-file negotiations, initiating another round of fighting between the lawyers. The hearing adjourned for the third time when the judge refused to call witnesses in favor of Bouachrine to the court prior to listening to Bouachrine’s appeal. Bouachrine’s defense presented a list of six names of witnesses to the Crown Prosecutor prior to the trial, but the judge did not call the witnesses before the accused’s plea. One member of Bouachrine’s defense party, Abd Assamad Idrissi, noted the absence of trust in the courtroom, adding that there is a difference between the evidence for criminal conviction and evidence supporting Bouachrine’s claim of innocence. Taoufik Bouachrine was put into custody on February 28, after his previous employees accused him of human trafficking, rape, and sexual harassment.

Rabat – When a Moroccan delegation met with the UNSG Personal Envoy for the Western Sahara Horst Kohler in Lisbon on Tuesday, it was not “talks process,” but rather a first meeting to discuss the evolution of the issue, said Minister Delegate for Relations with Parliament and Civil Society, Mustapha El Khalfi, on Thursday, March 8. The meeting was an occasion to talk about the roots of this Western Sahara conflict, which dates back to the ‘70s, and recall the conditions that led to the emergence of this regional conflict and its legal, political, and geostrategic dimensions, said El Khalfi at a press briefing held after the weekly cabinet meeting. The Lisbon meeting was also an occasion to recall the outstanding efforts made nationally concerning the regional development model, the extensive regionalization or the autonomy proposal presented by Morocco, El Khalfi said.  “The Moroccan delegation gave, on this occasion, additional details about the autonomy plan, its very rich content and its very solid legal bases,” he added. He also underlined that all components were tackled as part of the fundamentals of the national position as stressed in the King’s speech on the 42nd anniversary of the Green March, on November 6, 2017, when the sovereign highlighted the four broad lines of the Moroccan position:  First, Morocco denies any solution to the Sahara question outside of the framework of Morocco’s full sovereignty over its Sahara and the Autonomy Plan Initiative, which has been declared serious and credible by the international community. Scond, the kingdom draws lessons from past experience, as a problem is not so much finding a solution as determining the process that produces it. Third, Morocco ensures full compliance with the terms of reference adopted by the UN Security Council when addressing this regional dispute, for the Security Council is the only international body tasked with overseeing the settlement process. Finally, Morocco rejects outright any transgression or attempt to infringe on Morocco’s legitimate rights or its best interests, including obsolete proposals designed to divert the settlement process from the set terms of reference, or to introduce or impose other issues handled by other relevant bodies.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – Three of the world’s largest cranes have been installed off the coast of Tangier, where a new port terminal is set to open in 2019. The cranes represent state of the art technology that promise to help the new terminal cope with even bigger vessels, manage massive cargo coming through the Strait of Gibraltar, and point to a bright future for Tangier’s already prominent port. As some of the largest ship-to-shore (STS) cranes in the world, each machine weighs 2500 metric tons and measuring 144 meters high. They are also world’s largest double trolley STS cranes with the ability to manage ships that carry 22,000 Twenty-Foot Equivalent Unit (TEU) or more. In a February 23 press release, APM Terminals stated that the “remote-controlled cranes will enable fast, safe and efficient loading and unloading services to some of the largest container ships on the sea.” “It’s a great day for APM Terminals,” said General Manager of APM Terminals Medport Tangier Dennis Lenthe Olesen, speaking at the February 22 installation ceremony. “These cranes use digital technology to ensure the most efficiency during their movements. This will help us to deliver increased productivity throughout the process, from lifting a container box off the ship until it is delivered to its stack in the yard, and vice-versa.” Each year, more than 60,000 vessels cross the narrow strait between North Africa and Southern Europe. Given that APM Terminals Medport Tangier is located at this nautical crossroads, the port already services over 200 cargo vessels daily, according to APM Terminals website. Now, with the addition of new technology, the new terminal is ideally situated to serve one of the most important shipping routes for Europe, Asia, the Americas, and pan-African markets. Olesen promised the new equipment enables a “very high productivity standard.” The terminal will facilitate pivotal transshipment operations for Maersk Line and its partners. APM Terminals Medport Tangier has invested USD 800 million into its new terminal. Maersk Line and its partners hope to improve the port’s performance and attract new vessels by creating new routing options. “Maersk Line commissioned APM Terminals to build and operate APM Terminals MedPort Tangier so we are designing it around the customer by integrating operational excellence, the most modern cargo handling equipment and an ideal location for connecting global supply chains. This creates the necessary port capacity for the future. Equally important, this port creates another wave of future investment momentum in Morocco as a business and trade center,” said Keith Svendsen, Chief Operating Officer of APM Terminals. In recent years, Tangier has already established itself as a major Mediterranean industrial zone whose ports influence regional industrial projects such as Renault Automotive factories based in the Tangier area.

Other regional winners include Russia’s Sochi Airport (AER), Abu Dhabi Airport (AUH), and India’s Delhi Airport (DEL). Airports Council International released its official rankings on Tuesday, March 6, from their headquarters in Montreal, noting that the awards are growing increasingly competitive as the airline industry expands and air travel becomes more common. The Airport Service Quality Awards (ASQ) will be awarded during the ACI Customer Excellence Global Summit in September in Nova Scotia. In 2017, Mohammed V Airport exceeded 9 million passengers for the first time, making it one of the top airport hubs in Africa.

On March 8, the Ireland-based airline Ryanair announced five new flights out of Marrakech: Athens, Berlin, Brussels, Karlsruhe, and Zaventem. With these new flights and the continued momentum, Morocco looks to have busy skies in the years ahead.

Rabat – The red fruits sector has experienced considerable growth since its introduction in the Loukkos perimeter, according to data report from the Regional Directorate of Agriculture of Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima. The perimeter of the Loukkos basin accounts for 80 percent of the national production of the small red berries sector, which includes strawberry, raspberry, and blueberry crops. The red fruits sector generates an estimated turnover of 3 billion dirhams and more than 6 million working days per year, or 23 percent of agricultural employment in the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region, notes the report. According to the figures from the Office of , exports of strawberries and raspberries reached more than 2 billion dirhams in 2017. Strawberry farming accounts for 48 percent of working days, compared with 32 percent for blueberries and 20 percent for raspberries. In addition, this sector has shown a strong dynamism in exports, with a volume of 65 percent of total production of strawberries, 90 percent of raspberries and 95 percent of blueberries, said the same source. The exports market includes a total of 30 recipient countries, namely 16 European Union countries, the Gulf countries, Australia, North Africa, and Latin America. This growth is linked to the geographical proximity with Europe, the favorable pedoclimatic conditions, the availability of the water resources, the qualified labor force, the production control techniques, and the relocation of the production of some European companies towards Morocco, in addition to state incentives for investment. The majority of the objectives set under the 2014-2020 proposed program contract have been achieved, with an area  dedicated to the cultivation of small red berries in the Loukkos area, which contains approximately twenty packaging units that cover 4,656 ha and exceed 134,000 tons in overall production.

Rabat – Princess Lalla Meryem, Chairwoman of the National Union of Women of Morocco (UNFM), presided over a ceremony in celebration of International Women’s Day on Thursday, March 8, at the Mohammed VI Conference Center in Marrakech. Princess Lalla Meryem delivered, on behalf of UNFM, an opening speech under the theme “Women’s Dignity: Between Violence and Instability”. The princess highlighted that “Moroccan women have witnessed a significant evolution in various fields, where they have managed to reach tangible achievements,” noting that said rights have not been granted but were “the fruit of militant actions and sacrifices made by successive generations of women.” In this regard, Lalla Meryem reiterated the crucial, and often overlooked, role played by those who resisted in order to liberate the country, andtheir solid commitment to educating the rising generation at the time of independence. “They have thus made their contribution to the building of modern Morocco,” she concluded.  The princess also highlighted the efforts made by King Mohammed VI, “His Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God assist him, does all he can to guarantee to women the fulfillment of their rights, improve their situation, and open promising future prospects for them.” The princess lauded the 2004 Family Code, known as Moudawana, as one of the crucial advances made by Moroccan women, indicating that this law, in addition to promoting justice for women, protects the children’s rights and creates a balanced and stable climate within the family. Lalla Meryem responded to critics that doubt the implementation of the Family Code, and emphasized the necessity of informing women about their acquired rights. “Some people wrongly claim that the Code isn’t applied, while the family courts ensure its implementation.” She continued, “In reality, the problem is that too many women, living in rural and remote areas, in particular, are unaware of the existence of this code and therefore oblivious to the forms of protection and rights that it guarantees.” However, the princess recognized the pressing gender issues such as child marriage, violence against women, and child labor in the domestic environment. In order to confront to this issue, Lalla Meryem called on all the components of civil society to participate constructively in the national debate around these challenges. “I suggest that a memorandum setting out the[se] various issues and proposing reasonable solutions to this problem be brought to the attention of His Majesty the King, ” she recommended. UN-Women Representative in the Maghreb Leila Rhioui appraised the Princess’s actions towards advancing women’s rights and the progress made by the kingdom in this regard in the last two decades. However, the UN-Women’s representative for the Maghreb asserted that the fight towards gender equality is far from over, particularly when it comes to raising women’s awareness of their rights and obligations.

Rabat – In a move aimed at countering and undermining the growing appeal of Morocco’s 2026 bid within the international footballing community, authorities in charge of piloting the North American bid have taken upon themselves to announce the creation of a “tripartite committee” which will from now on be charged with organizing and supervising the North American bid. According to a letter  that United 2026 sent to all members of FIFA, this change of strategy—the bid was until now led by the United States’ football federation—is a response to the recent resignation of Sunil Gulati. Although recently voted out of the presidency of the US’s football federation (he chose not to run in the election), Sunil Gulati maintained his post as chief of the United 2026’s organizing committee, with the North American bid hoping, until recently at least, to capitalize on his long-standing “positive image” within footballing communities.   Now, instead of the bid being led by US footballing authorities, a joint committee of Canadian, American, and Mexican federations will oversee the countries’ associated bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup. According to a recent ESPN report, the organizing committee will from now on be presided over by a joint presidency, namely America’s Carlos Cardeiro, Mexico’s Decio de Maria, and Canada’s Steve Reed. “United, as one, Canada, Mexico, and the United States are ready to host the FIFA World Cup in 2026 and help propel the global game to new insights,” the letter also said. “The joint bid from the United States, Canada and Mexico to win the hosting rights for the 2026 World Cup has undergone a leadership shuffle aimed at changing the bid’s campaign tactics,” ESPN wrote, adding that it “reported last week that the bid could be in jeopardy.” Although “United 2026” (the organizing committee) has explained on its website that “the strategic change” is purely a traditional and needed formality aimed at showcasing and strengthening “unity” within the three federations, especially following Gulati’s resignation, ESPN has offered a different reading of the situation. According to the sporting media giant, this abrupt change speaks volumes about the seriousness of “the Moroccan threat”, especially given the fact that the new FIFA bidding regulations are, at least on paper, bordering on a Moroccan Victor on June 13.  “The move comes as amid concerns that the joint bid, long considered the favorite to win the hosting rights, is in danger of losing out to Morocco,” ESPN further noted. It should be noted here that Morocco, which has already secured the voting bloc of Africa, its home continent, is also said to be the most favored bid for the Arab world, many European federations, as well as South America (said to be holding “special grudges” against Trump’s America). Politics-wise, however, this new strategy might also be aimed at undermining the effect of any malign influence that Trump’s unfavorable international reputation could have on “United 2026.” After all, by saying that the US is no longer single-handedly leading the bid, “United 2026” is surreptitiously telling national federations not to consider Donald Trump while voting on June 13. But, with the Kingdom being said to “finally deserve a World Cup, for the sake of Africa”, will United 2026’s new strategy succeed in dislodging Morocco’s already established reputation as an appropriate  and serious candidate for holding the 2026 FIFAWorld Cup? Considering recent reports, the answer to that question is a resounding “No.”

By François Koundounou Rabat – The horrendous Syrian civil war has caused over 400,000 deaths in seven years, according to a high-ranking official at the UN, who then went on to accuse the Damascus regime of planning “the apocalypse.” In a speech he gave before the UN’s Council for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, who is the high commissioner for human rights, said that the year 2017 alone witnessed more than 1000 bombings. The situation keeps deteriorating, escalating, and transforming into a “hell on earth,” the high commissioner said, in reference to the recent escalations in east Ghouta, near the Syrian capital. “Recent attempts to justify indiscriminate and brutal attacks against thousands of civilians are legally and morally unacceptable,” al-Hussein said, as he referred to the mass killings of civilians while supposedly targeting combatants. He added: “This month, … the situation in east Ghouta that has been described by UN Secretary General as a hell on earth.” Following the Human Rights Council’s recent decision to investigate on the causes and scale of the horrifying death toll in Ghouta, Great Britain presented a resolution that indicated the absence of sustainable humanitarian aid in the region, as well as the recent use of chemical weapons. A UN-led investigation supported Britain’s resolution, saying that there are indications that some recent deaths in Ghouta were due to the use of chemical weapons, with two children among victims. On Tuesday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that he is “preoccupied” by the escalating situation in Syria. “A convoy of UN agencies, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, and an international Red Cross committee, who were providing vital humanitarian aids to 27,500 needy people in Douma, in east Ghouta, were unable to do so because of insecurity,” said the spokesperson for the UN Secretary General. Guterres is also reported to have “exhorted” all involved parties “to put in application, without further ado, UN Security Council resolution 2401,” in order to stop further escalation of the already horrifying humanitarian crisis.

Rabat- The world’s oldest known message in a bottle has been found in a remote area in Western Australia, nearly 132 years after it was thrown into the sea, Australian experts say.   The Australian Tonya Illman discovered the bottle of gin, half buried in the dunes near Wedge Island in southwest Australia, in January while walking with a group of six people.  “I picked it up thinking it might look nice on display in my home,” Illman says, according to a post on her husband’s website. Illman said that while her son’s girlfriend was trying to empty the sand from the bottle, she saw what she thought to be a cigarette, but discovered that it was a damp, tightly-rolled note tied with string. After several weeks of thorough examination, experts have confirmed it is an authentic message launched in 1886 from a German ship named “Paula,” as part of an experiment about ocean and shipping routes by the German Naval Observatory. The note, which was written in German, contained a form on which the ship’s captain had written the date, the coordinates, and the name of the ship. This information, according to experts, was valuable in certifying the origin of the note. After the find, Illman was then asked to write where and when the bottle was found. Instructions were given by Australian authorities to send it back to the German Naval Observatory in Hamburg or the nearest German consulate. This note is believed to be the oldest-known message in a bottle, given the amount of time that has passed between when it was written and when it was found. Previously, the Guinness World Records said that the oldest was 108 years old, found in Germany in 2015.

Rabat- The visit of King Felipe VI from Spain to Morocco is a priority in the foreign policy agenda of Spain, reported the Spanish newspaper El Confidencial.  The news outlet said that the Spanish monarch wanted the official visit, which was postponed more than five times since 2016, to finally be organized.  “King Felipe VI received an invitation from Raul Castro, President of Cuba, except that he simply declined it in order to focus on the preparations for his visit to the Moroccan kingdom,” reads the statement. The media outlet points out that the Spanish monarchy’s priority is to set a date for the visit, adding that “King Felipe VI wanted to talk to King Mohammed VI at all costs.” The Spanish news outlet Vozpopuli, quoting Spanish government sources, recently reported that it is “Moroccan authorities who will have to tell us when they want” the Spanish royal family to visit Morocco.  In December 2017, Spanish media reported that King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia would pay a visit to Morocco in January 2018. However, the visit was postponed until March 2018.  The royal visit to Morocco may be once again postponed as King Mohammed VI just underwent heart surgery on February 26.  Furthermore, a source from the Spanish Ministry of Interior said in January, “the state trip will take place next March as the exact dates will be specified later.”  The Spanish monarchs’ visit is aimed at discussing cultural and business opportunities with King Mohammed VI. The Spanish monarchs’ last visit to Morocco was in 2014. They were received by King Mohammed VI and Princess Lalla Salma for an Iftar, which was attended by more than three hundred guests.

By Hajar El Khaldi Rabat – International Women’s Day is an opportunity to celebrate the “social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. The day also marks a call to action for accelerating gender parity. But women struggles in a male-dominated society continue to  go underappreciated, and the obstacles that stand in the way of obtaining justice for women remain largely unacknowledged. Hence, International Women’s Day is a  suitable time to look back at some of the major stories that drew the public’s attention to the suffering of Moroccan women  during the year 2017-2018. It is important to acknowledge the severity of the discrimination facing women, so that something can be done about it. Amid August heat, a video of a girl being assaulted on a bus in Casablanca by a gang of teenage boys sparked outrage and ignited bitter debate about sexual harassment in Morocco. According to authorities the heart-wrenching video, which was  shared on social media, shows four boys molesting a woman with a learning disability. The men met her tears and cries for help with careless laughter, while the bus driver and passengers displayed utter  nonchalance. While empathy for  the victim seems the most suitable and natural reaction, many have instead pointed fingers at her, accusing her of “dressing inappropriately,” and thus of bringing the harassment upon herself. On August 23rd, approximately  300 protesters gathered at the United Nations Square in Casablanca, and in front of the Parliament in Rabat. They gathered together in solidarity with the victim. “How many women must endure rape, die, or kill themselves before the government does something?” shouted the protesters. “What about those whose assaults have not been  documented? Where is the justice for them?” According to a national survey, around two-thirds of Moroccan women have experienced physical, psychological, sexual, or economic abuse amid an absence of effective laws and regulations to protect them. “The 103.13 ‘Violence Against Women’ bill has been gathering dust in the parliament’s drawers since 2013,” proclaimed the spokesmen of a feminist collective in Rabat. A couple of days prior to the protests, the authorities announced that they had  apprehended six teenage males (aged 15 to 17), and placed them under surveillance amid. Protesting voices blamed the aggressors’ criminal behavior on teenage recklessness and—once again,—their victim’s clothing.  2018 kicked off with a tragic accident. At the gates of Ceuta’s border, two Moroccan women were crushed in a human stampede, and several others were left injured. This is not the first incident of its  kind. In Ceuta and Melilla, thousands of “mule women” cross the Morocco-Spain borders each year, carrying heavy bundles that sometimes weigh over 70 kilos. These bundles contain goods such as food, and second-hand clothes that sell for as little as 10 euros. June 2017, the Moroccan and Spanish governments agreed to prevent all of these so-called “human mules” from crossing the borders through Ceuta’s El-Tarajal II at  the same time. This consensus came as an answer to Moroccan authorities, who requested help in decreasing pedestrian traffic at the border, allowing women to cross only on Mondays and Wednesdays, while permitting men  to cross on Tuesdays and Thursdays. In Melilla, NGOs estimate the number of these women at a staggering 5,000-8,000. But reportedly, Spanish authorities , tolerate this phenomenon because it is profitable for the autonomous city. If reluctantly, these “mule women” take on the role of family breadwinner that is traditionally assumed by men. They  risk their lives to put food on their families’ tables. Although the stampeding accidents are fatal, the bigger risks to these women are the  long-term effects of continuing to bear heavy weights despite, in many cases, suffering from health conditions. Women’s physique is not as naturally strong and muscled as that of men’s, and their bodies often suffer the consequences from the strain of hard, physical labor. “When I die, I know I am going straight to heaven. Why would God punish me any longer? He hasn’t given me anything in life, except  suffering.” Said one of the “human mules” to Portuguese photographer Gonçalo Fonseca. After years of anticipation and desperation for a law to ensure some of women’s basic rights, the Moroccan government finally had a chance to take action with law 103.13—but expectations for the law were not met. This year, Valentine’s day witnessed the passing of the long-awaited violence against women law by the Moroccan House of Representatives. But those who actually read beyond the “shiny” title will find themselves utterly disappointed. As a matter of fact, this law was deemed mere a “window dressing” that aims to present Morocco to the west as a country that protects women’s rights while the facts beg to differ. The law increases prison time and fines for certain acts of violence; for example if the perpetrator is a relative of the victim, or if the victim suffers from a disability. However, the law fails  to address the real issues, as it does nothing to protect women, or to ensure that those in charge of women’s security execute their duties. It also does not offer concrete services to victims of violence. When it comes to sexual harassment, 103.13 expands the definition to include the workplace for the first time. However, it falls short of  offering sincere solutions, as it does not address sexual violence. Rape survivors are often discouraged by their victim-shaming culture from  reporting crimes. There is also a law that criminalizes sexual relationships out of wedlock without differentiating between consensual intercourse and coerced sex. As a result, only three percent of rape cases get reported—a staggeringly low percentage. The new regulation has performed mediocrely in this regard, adding to the distress and silence that surround sexual violence and its victims. The law also ignored marital rape, although women across Morocco emphasized  its urgency. Moments after its adoption, the Alternative Movement for Individual Liberties (MALI) and other associations declared the need to address this issue. While many have supported MALI’s move, others seemed unwilling to fathom the notion of marital rape—mostly based on a famously disputed Hadith that states, “If a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses [and does not come], and he spends the night angry with her, the angels will curse her until morning.” In an interview with Morocco World News, Stephanie Willman Bordat, human rights activist and founding partner of Mobilizing for Rights, asserted that these conflicting opinions do not exempt the government from creating a just law that criminalizes all forms of abuses. “People will always find a host of excuses to justify violence against women, but that does not exempt the government from doing its job. The government is still obligated to make marital rape illegal and provide services for women who suffer from it,” affirmed Bordat. While these stories have piqued medias’ interest, many others remain untold waiting for tragedy to ignite the public’s anger and, hopefully, make a change.

Rabat- With seven Muslim-majority countries to compete in the Russia 2018 World Cup (Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Senegal and Nigeria), the International Federation of Football Association will release a Muslim-friendly travel guide.  This guide will help the expected 100,000 Muslim fans locate mosques, halal restaurants, and prayer times, among other commodities.  In an interview with Arab News, FIFA Secretary General Fatma Samoura declared that the governing body of the football association strives to make traveling to Russia as comfortable as possible for Muslim fans.  “The World Cup this year will feature seven teams that will have a majority of Muslim players and most of the fans will be fasting during Ramadan, which ends just before the opening game,” Samoura added. “We at FIFA would like to make sure all Muslims, be they players, staff or fans, have all the information they need.” Russia will meet Saudi Arabia in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on June 14, which coincides with the celebration of Eid Al-Fitr at the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.  Around 30 million Muslims live in Russia with 50,000 mosques catering to their religious needs, according to the Central Muslim Spiritual Board of Russia. “I can assure you there will be no discrimination whatsoever and the assistance Muslims will receive will be as they were at home,” affirmed Samoura.   After an absence that lasted two decades, the Moroccan team will play its first World Cup match on June 15 against Iran.  “The Atlas Lions are back at the World Cup for the first time in two decades, having topped and emerged unbeaten from a group that included Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon and Mali,” reported FIFA.

Rabat – Accused of several sexual misconducts, rape and sexual harassment among others, Ahkbar Al Yaoum’s director, Taoufik Bouachrine, appeared this Thursday, and for the first time, before the Casablanca criminal court. Bouachrine, who was arrested on February 28, is facing charges of sexual harassment, gendered violence and rape, with the police claiming to be in possession of 50 videos backing the charges facing the prominent journalist, with the police further specifying that the said videos were recorded by Bouachrine himself. By 9 a.m. this Thursday morning, the atmosphere in room 7 of the Casablanca criminal court was already tense, with the presence of numerous journalists (locals and international), and more than 20 lawyers defending both sides. It was however the public at large, which had “come in great numbers,” that gave Bouachrine’s first court appearance the character of a solemn ritual. And as soon as Bouachrine appeared to face the judges and recount his version of the events, whispers of insult and judgment of character filled the room, with the already hot atmosphere visibly on the verge of getting physical, especially when Mohamed Ziane (one of Boucahrine’s lawyers) and Benjelloun Touimi (a lawyer defending some of the alleged victims) threatening each other with a fight. The public uproar and unfriendly exchanges in room 7, Bouachrine’s lawyers made the case for their client’s innocence, claiming that the videos that the police is said to be in possession of have been “falsified,” an appeal that did not sit well with judges and the Casablanca Attorney General who, still convinced of the authenticity of the “proof,” described the appeal of Bouachrine’s lawyers as unacceptable and “illegal.”

Rabat – With the presentation of the UN’s annual report on Western Sahara around the corner, Morocco, emboldened by the increasing public support for its Sahara position, is choosing to adopt the “offensive”, therefore deterring any hostilities towards its position. “Morocco is no longer trifling with the Western Sahara question,” relevant Moroccan authorities are reported to have said, referring to the increasing approval of the Kingdom’s position by many in the international community. Morocco’s proposal, autonomy under the auspices of Morocco’s sovereignty, has been saluted by many countries, which have described it as “serious, credible, and feasible.” Recently meeting in Lisbon with the UN personal envoy for Western Sahara Horst Kohler, Moroccan delegation, which was led by foreign affairs minister Nasser Bourita, reiterated the Kingdom’s position, reaffirming that it would not even consider any other offer. In its March 8 edition, Akhbar Al Yaoum reported that Morocco is now ready to launch a “political offensive” against those in the international community who are still advocating for an unfeasible and utopian solution for Western Sahara. Of the meeting in Lisbon, Al Yaoum wrote: “No sooner has the meeting in Lisbon ended than a diplomatic war is already on the horizons, announcing new battles by April.” The UN Secretary General is due to submit his annual report on the Western Sahara to the Security Council in early April. Based on the report, the 15-member body will decide whether to renew the mandate of the UN Mission in the region, known as MINURSO. “After Morocco’s formal victory by preventing the UN Secretary General’s personal envoy from imposing his own agenda, Morocco is now ready to take the lead by launching a new offensive,” Al Yaoum further reported. Hassan Boukili, who is in charge of Moroccan affairs in Geneva, told the press that Algeria is now the only country opposing the idea of a thorough census of “sequestered Sahrawi.” The Moroccan diplomat also said that at the ongoing HCR 71st session on refugees, Algerian delegation maneuvered to hide “the real number of Sahrawi refugees.” “Algeria is afraid that the world finally discovers the number of Algerian settled in camps such Tindouf,” the diplomat said, stressing that although of foreign nationalities, some Polisario fighters are still benefiting from humanitarian aids and other Tindouf-related international actions.

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat – On Saturday, March 10th, Marrakech’s École Nationale des Sciences Appliquées (ENSA) will be hosting “Junior CEOs,” an event for young aspiring entrepreneurs.  The event will be held at the Emerging Business Factory (EBF)—an industrial quarter in Marrakech. The goal of the event is to create a space where junior enterprises throughout Morocco can come together and collaborate—making connections for their future endeavors. It’s also an opportunity to pool shared experiences, and for the junior enterprise of ENSA to promote its brand. Manal Soufi, an 18 year-old member of ENSA and aspiring engineer, told Morocco World News that “Junior CEOs” is an occasion, “to celebrate the camouflaged entrepreneurial spirit and talents of young students.” ENSA was founded in 2000, and has since produced many highly educated young engineers who are now working abroad, and in various service and industry sectors. “Junior CEOs” will be the first event ENSA has hosted of its kind, and is designed to unite both new and already successful Moroccan enterprises across the country. 8:30-9:00 a.m.: Guest reception and breakfast 9:00-11:00 a.m.: Inaugural conference addressing, “Young Entrepreneurship: A Strategic Choice in the face of Socio-Economic Imbalances” 11:00-12:00 p.m.: Round-table activity on, “Why Appeal to Junior Enterprises?” 12:00-2:00 p.m.: Panel inauguration and lunch 2:00-4:00 p.m.: “Failure Stories” 4:00-6:00 p.m.: Competition (team presentations and results) 6:00 p.m.: Coffee and concluding remarks “During the event, you will learn which steps to follow and which mistakes to avoid [as an aspiring entrepreneur]. Through the experience of the speakers at the inaugural conference, you will explore the prospecting techniques that new enterprises follow, and their inner-workings. You will learn how to stand out and how to survive in a merciless market. You will also get to discover all the discrepancies between the legal, administrative, financial, networking, and outreach components of entrepreneurship. We [at ENSA] are the event organizers, so on one hand, we will take care of all the logistics […] but on the other hand, the event will provide networking opportunities for everyone,” Soufi explains. Soufi goes on to add, “The junior enterprise at ENSA has a strong will to create its own companies and wages […] but we have to take the initiative […], and this is our first step. My personal goal is create a platform where all students discover and shape their ambitions before they throw themselves out into the world of wage labor. In the future, I aspire to create a video game studio (which is a rare thing in Morocco), and to travel across the globe to share and listen to all the unusual experiences and stories of other entrepreneurs.” All students, young entrepreneurs, and ambitious persons looking to develop their own enterprises are invited to attend! To register or get an event schedule, just send an email to [email protected] requesting more information, or stating your desire to participate.

Rabat – A French woman of Moroccan origin has filed a rape accusation at the Paris prosecutor’s office against the already-detained Tariq Ramadan, reported French Newspaper L’Express on March 7. The  40-year-old French woman is accusing the Islamologist of nine accounts of rape over the span of a year and a half, from February 2013 to June 2014 in Paris, Roissy, Lille, London, and Brussels. The affair began in February 2013, when the woman, under the false name of Marie, was “going through a difficult period, as she had just separated from her partner and was raising two children alone, without a stable job,” her lawyer wrote in the complaint, seen by L’Express. Tariq Ramadan contacted her through Facebook and asked if she attended one of his lectures given around the same time. Marie  “was surprised because she had not participated in any Ramadan conference and was at first suspicious because she suspected that it wa Ramadan talking to her. But after a Skype conversation, the woman “was surprised and flattered that such a famous and busy man could devote time to her.” Soon after, she began telling him her secrets. Their first meeting took place on February 15, 2013, at the Radisson Blue Hotel in Brussels, where Tariq Ramadan was holding a conference. According to the complainant, the Islamologist changed his behavior in person. The express  recounts that he ordered her to call him “master” and wear an alluring outfit.

Ramadan also allegedly threatened her “to tell her family all the confessions she revealed to him, if she did not obey his desires.” After four years of torture , Marie decided to confide in the justice system. A judicial source confirmed  that the complaint was filed and is currently being analyzed. The women, who spoke to L’Express anonymously, is the third complainant to accuse Ramadan of rape.The theologian has been under investigation in the Fleury-Mérogis for two other rape allegations of rape since February 2.

Rabat – A delegation made up of representatives of Muslims, Jews, and Christians from southwest France has been visiting Morocco since last Sunday in collaboration with France’s Union of Mosques (UMF). UMF, which facilitates interreligious dialogue in France, initiated this trip as part of a mission to represent French Islam, said Hauman Yaakoubi, Secretary-General of the Union. Led by the president of the Regional Council of the Muslim Religion of Provence-Alpes-Cote d’Azur (PACA), Khalid Belkhadir, the delegation is expected to hold interviews with officials, and visit, until next Friday, a number of places of worship for the three monotheistic religions as well as sites in Morocco’s holy cities. Morocco is home to many religious sites and some of the places the delegation will visit are Mosque Hassan II, the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes, and the Museum of Judaism in Casablanca. The delegation is also expected to visit the Mohammed V Mausoleum and the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams in Rabat. In Fes, the delegation will visit the Al Quaraouiyine Mosque, the Slat Al Fassiyine Synagogue, Aben Danan Synagogue, and other historical sites in the city. The delegation was received Tuesday in Rabat by the Minister for Islamic Affairs, Ahmed Toufiq. They attended talks that focused on the Moroccan model of management in the religious field. Toufiq applauded the delegation’s initiative and its willingness to discover the Moroccan model that advocates the values of moderate Islam, stressing that “the world today needs people who believe in moderation to affirm the universality of religious discourse.” Morocco has long since sought to promote the vision of “tolerant Islam“ and to prevent proliferation of extremists in mosques by training imams in “best practices” of moderate traditions. A considerable number of imams and mourchidates (female religious guides) come to Morocco from Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe, particularly France, to obtain theological training from Morocco’s religious scholars. Morocco has also encouraged some of its eminent scholars to hold conferences in France and other parts of Europe, and has urged Sub-Saharan African mosques to preach the values of Islam.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat – UNICEF released a data report on Tuesday, March 6, revealing that child marriage has seen a worldwide decrease over the course of the past decade. Child marriage has globally decreased by 15 percent as 25 million children under the age of 18 have been protected from entering wedlock in the last ten years, according to the UNICEF report. Child marriage saw reductions by an estimated 30 to 50 percent in South Asia over the past ten years, with marked increase in girls’ education in India. Meanwhile, child marriage decreased by a third in Ethiopia, one of the five Sub-Saharan African countries that experienced a significant reduction. Still, twelve million girls are married before the age of 18 each year worldwide. UNICEF’s Principal Gender Advisor, Anju Malhotra, acknowledged the good news regarding the decrease in child marriage in many parts of the globe, but also reminded the public that more progress needs to be made. “Given the life-altering impact child marriage has on a young girl’s life, any reduction is welcome news, but we’ve got a long way to go,” Malhotra concluded. UNICEF has taken into account the necessity of accelerating the efforts to end child marriage completely by 2030. Without increased efforts,“150 million additional girls will marry before their 18th birthday by 2030,” UNICEF emphasized. UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) resolved to put an end to child marriage by 2030 through a global programme initiated on International Women’s Day, March 8, 2016, which also aims to support millions of girls who were already married at a young age in different parts of the world. “As part of this global programme, we will work with governments of countries with a high prevalence of child marriage to uphold the rights of adolescent girls, so that girls can reach their potential and countries can attain their social and economic development goals,” the United Nations stated, in line with the announcement of its initiative in 2016.

Rabat – On Tuesday, Morocco’s Head of Affairs in Geneva, Hassan Boukili, condemned the continuous ignorance displayed by Algeria toward the Sahrawi populations living in Tindouf refugee camps. Speaking at the 71st session of the Standing Committee of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Boukili emphasized that Morocco’s eastern neighbor is, “the only country to oppose the implementation of all the feasible  solutions for the populations in the Tindouf camps.” The 71st session is being held in Geneva from March 6-8th. According to Boukili, Algeria is also the only country to impose “the implementation of an obsolete settlement plan that is definitely ruled out by the United Nations” on the Sahrawi populations. The diplomat added that unlike other refugee host countries which  generously committed to help and protect refugees, “Algeria is a unique case in the history of protecting and providing international assistance to refugees.” Boukili added that Algeria, “has chosen to suffer an alleged situation of Sahrawi refugees, which is of its own creation.” He notes that the country is the only one to refuse to conduct a headcount of the populations in the Tindouf camps. Algeria’s opposition totally the camps’ populations and resistance to their free return to Morocco, integration into Algeria, resettlement, and road to self-sufficiency confirm that the country is shirking its international responsibility. The little attention it gives to these populations is a humanitarian tragedy, according to Maghreb Arab Press. In 2014, Morocco urged Algeria to conduct a population census in the Tindouf camps—a request that was not accepted by the eastern host country. In recent remarks made during the 71st UNHCR’s session in Geneva, Boukili echoed what he had said during a high-level meeting of the Executive Committee of UNHCR in 2014.Boukili said that the “commitment for humanitarian assistance, protection, and sustainable solutions require the identification and registration of refugees,” noting that this prerequisite applied also to the populations in Tindouf camps (which remain the only non-registered global refugees). Boukili has urged the international community to address the causes behind the persistence of refugee-related crises, including the militarization of Tindouf camps, and the exploitation of refugees to serve Algeria ’s separatist agenda. The diplomat also expressed Morocco’s deep concern over the high number of refugees and internally-displaced persons in Africa, especially those in protracted situations. During the 17th meeting of the UN Human Rights Council in  2011, several humanitarian NGOs and former Polisario officials urged Algeria to respect and meet its international responsibilities.

Rabat – The Secretariat of the Justice and Development Party (PJD) released a statement on Tuesday, saying that it will sue a Moroccan e-news outlet for accusing an unidentified PJD minister of raping a journalist. PJD’s statement came a few days after Moroccan news outlet Barlamane claimed on March 4th that a Moroccan official of the PJD allegedly raped a journalist questioned by Morocco’s Judicial Police (BNPJ) about the case of Moroccan journalist Bouachrine, who is currently facing charges for alleged sexual misconduct. Barlamane added that the unidentified official, who allegedly served as a minister under the government of former head Abdelilah Benkirane, still holds the same position under the new cabinet of the current Head of Government (Saad Eddine El-Othmani). Barlamane claimed that after the unidentified alleged victim filed a complaint against Bouachrine, she told the press that the detained journalist “was not the only one to attack her, but a minister of the current government had also raped her.” In response to these allegations, the PJD secretariat said that the allegations made against one its ministers are proof of a “lack of ethics and professionalism” with the e-news outlet, which was the one to falsely report “these allegations.” “We decided to file a complaint against the newsource,” concluded PJD. Bouachrine will be presented before the court tomorrow, March 8th, for several charges, including “human trafficking, the exploitation of people in need, and the abuse of power for sexual purposes.” Bouachrine is also accused of other crimes, including “violent rape and attempted rape.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs,  Nasser Bourita, told the press that the bilateral meeting held in Lisbon between the Moroccan delegation and the United Nations  Personal Envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, is “neither a negotiation process nor a step toward one.” After expressing satisfaction over the bilateral meeting held in Lisbon on Tuesday, Bourita said that the talks held with Kohler were a “contact [established specifically] to discuss the evolution of the Moroccan Sahara issue.”The Moroccan diplomat also noted that the discussions the Moroccan and the UN official were held in “an atmosphere of serenity and the debates were rich and fruitful.” Bourita, who led the Moroccan delegation during the talks, said that the “debates allowed the Moroccan delegation to recall the genesis of the regional dispute and the political, legal, and geostrategic considerations that brought about its birth in the 70s.” In statements printed by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Bourita had added that the meeting was an opportunity for the members of the Moroccan delegation to present Morocco’s efforts to implement the regional development model and structures of advanced regionalization. Morocco’s Autonomy initiative was one of the most important talks held between both the UNSG Personal Envoy and the Moroccan delegation.The meeting offered both sides the chance  to discuss the main issues occurring in “the Maghreb, the cost of the No Maghreb, and the reasons for the blockage of the Maghreb integration.” Bourita stressed that during the meeting, the delegation kept in mind the speech made by King Mohammed VI in conjunction with the 42nd anniversary of the Green March last November 6, 2017. In his speech monarch had emphasized Morocco’s established principles and framework of reference. These are the foundations upon which the Moroccan position on the Western Sahara issue is based. At Kohler’s invitation, the Moroccan delegation also included Omar Hilale (Permanent Representative of Morocco to the United Nations), Sidi Hamdi Ould Errachid (President of the Laayoun-Sakia El Hamra region), and Yajna Khattat (President of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region)—according to a statement made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The diplomatic meeting, which started at  9:50 a.m (GMT) yesterday, was the last one held before the submission of an annual report prepared by Kohler on the Western Sahara conflict. Kohler will submit his report to the United Nations’ Security Council in early April. This meeting is part of Morocco’s permanent cooperation with the UN, which seeks to find a fair solution to end the conflict over Western Sahara

Washington, DC – Rabat’s persistence on using traditional diplomatic avenues to address a judicial conundrum led to its recent stumble in Brussels. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) Ruling against Morocco excluding waters off the coast of “Western Sahara” from fisheries agreements between Morocco and the EU should not come as a surprise. Since the International Court of Justice issued an unfavorable advisory opinion against the Kingdom in 1975 and the United Nations does not recognize the territory as Moroccan, the chance of any court ruling in favoring Morocco is slim to none. In fact, Morocco is in need of a framework to challenge past adverse legal opinions and channel its momentum toward finding a synergy that would bond its diplomacy to a legal doctrine that would amplify the Moroccan positions in Western Sahara. Despite Algeria and its proxy the Polisario Front’s claims that this court decision is a victory for their position in this conflict, the ruling has no impact on the diplomatic and political standings of the United Nations and its mission to the Western Sahara. However, this upset is yet another wakeup call for the Moroccan government to spend energy and resources to explain the legal aspects of the Sahara conflict. By focusing on the diplomatic channels to respond to a court ruling, Moroccan diplomats are wasting time and resource again. This the second time the ECJ ruled against Morocco and thus it is obvious that Rabat’s approach to the problem is a flaw. It is also worth understanding that no amount of money or diplomatic weight would make the European Court rule for Morocco. The issue is legal and not political. Most European governments favor economic agreements with Morocco that include the so-called “Western Sahara” even if it means an EU de facto recognition of the territory as Moroccan. Nonetheless, in nations of the rule of law, courts have the power to overrule policies and politics. Hence, Morocco should go back to court to defend its rights and entitlement to its historic land.  Political and diplomatic pressures on European governments will produce scant results in this case. Morocco can either go back to the international court to re-open the case since it was non-binding rulings or peruse new judiciary venues to give its presence in the Western Sahara a legitimate shell and consequently provide friendly European governments with a legal cover to plead its case. Moroccan foreign affairs officials cannot keep trying the same failed approach and hope for different results. The fight is in the ICJ and the United Nations and not Paris, Madrid or Stockholm. European Courts will continue their anti-Moroccan ruling as long as there is no change to the UN position on the Western Sahara. Therefore, Morocco should accept this reality in Brussels and adopt new economic and trade postures at the EU. The nullification of the Fisheries Agreement between the two sides is a financial loss to some European nations, especially Spain, but not to Morocco that can easily invite more Japanese, Russian or Chinese boats to fish off its costs including the Sahara. This ECJ ruling is neither a diplomatic breakthrough nor a police event. It is simply a restatement of a 43 years old edict that has been thus far ignored by most governments and never adopted by international organizations.

Rabat – To the surprise of many Moroccan and Arab viewers, MBC Group has suspended broadcasting of Turkish TV series, reports Al Jazeera today, Wednesday, March 8. The chairman of the Dubai-based group i, Waleed Al Ibrahim, announced the decision following his release tied to a mass arrest that swept the Gulf countries a few months ago. According to Allied Media Corp., Moroccan viewers of MBC are the largest audience the group receives. The household watching MBC  were estimated at 2,344,500, while the potential audience in Morocco reaches sweeping 9,378,000. While Al Ibrahim did not justify his decision, MBC spokesman Mazen Hayek told The Associated Press on Monday that “There is a decision to remove all Turkish drama off several TV outlets in the region,” adding that he cannot confirm who took the final decision. For him, “This may be an incentive for Arab producers to create high-level Arabic drama that can be a good alternative to those taken off the air,” according to Asharq Al-Awsat news outlet. He explained one episode of an Arabic series costs between USD 40,000 and USD 100,000. Meanwhile, producing an episode of Turkish soap opera costs a minimum of USD 250,000. Al Jazeera reports that MBC’s decision is fueled by underlying politics, as relations between Saudi Arabia and Turkey “are at a low,” in light of Turkey’s support of Qatar as Saudi Arabia imposes a blockade on its neighboring gulf county. The Turkish Minister of Culture responded saying  that “it is not a couple of politicians who are supposed to decide who will watch which movies or shows from their desks.”

Rabat – A Russian military transport plane crashed in Syria on Tuesday, killing 32 people on board. The A-26 plane crashed while attempting to land at Hmeimim airbase, near the Syrian coastal city of Latakia. The impact resulted in the death of 26 passengers and six crew members. Russian media reported that the plane wasn’t shot down by Syrian fighters, and the crash may have been caused by a technical malfunction. The Russian defense ministry says the plane crashed at about 15:00 Moscow Time (12:00 GMT), adding that the plane went down about 500 meters short of the runway. A special commission will be set up to investigate potential causes of the crash. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, “Putin has offered his condolences to relatives of those killed, and to all Russian service personnel,” the RIA news agency reported. This incident is not the first aircraft crash. Another occurred last February when a Russian Sukhoi-25 ground-attack aircraft was shot down in a rebel-held area in Syria’s north-western province of Idlib. In October 2017, a Su-24 bomber crashed during takeoff from Hmeimim, killing both pilots. In December 2016, a plane carrying Russian military personnel to Syria crashed in the Black Sea, killing all 92 passengers on board. Since Russia launched its operations in Syria in September 2015, the number of incidents has increased.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – On the occasion of International Women’s Day (IWD), Tunisian women are planning to protest for equal inheritance rights on March 10. Several feminist, human rights NGOs, unions and professional orders have joined hands to form the Tunisian Coalition for Equality in Inheritance with the key objective of leveraging Women’s Day to call for a national march for equality in inheritance.  The initiative, which was launched under the slogan “Equality: A Right, Not a Privilege,, aims to overcome inheritance laws seen as inconsistent with gender equality granted by the 2014 Tunisian Constitution.  “Our Coalition is open to all entities interested in joining and plans to mobilize all its forces during this time frame, in order to call for and organize a national march whose route is highly symbolic of the constitutional combat in 2013,” stated the online publishing platform Medium.  This march also comes in support of the initiative launched by the Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi, on August 13, 2017, to reform inheritance laws. Essebsi’s proposal sparked outrage among conservatives in Tunisia and in other Islamic majority countries.  Inheritance Islamic jurisprudence regarding women is based on Surat Nisa’ (4:11)  which states that women have a right to half of the inheritance owed to men. “Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females.” The Tunisian President has set up a commission on individual freedoms and gender equality to draft a detailed report in order to facilitate implementing reforms.  The commission was supposed to present its conclusion on February 20, but requested an extension until after the municipal elections on May 6.

Rabat – Saad Eddine El Othmani’s government is set to adopt a decree that will suspend the tax on kosher meat consumed by the Jewish community, at the government council on Thursday, March 8, in Rabat. Decree 2.81.180 was introduced by former Minister of the Interior Driss Basri and former Minister of Finance Abdellatif Jouahri in 1985, establishing a parafiscal tax, commonly known as the meat tax, on behalf of Moroccan Jewish community committees. “Kosher tax amounted to 50 cents per kilogram. All taxes collected were paid monthly, to the municipalities by Moroccan Jewish communities. In the fifties, Morocco’s Jewish community included about 250,000 people. The community declined considerably after the creation of the state of Israel and Morocco’s independence around mid-twentieth century. Today, the Moroccan Jewish community only totals a few thousand members. While the El Othmani government tries to end the virtually non-practiced tax, Morocco’s Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM) announced in January 2018 its intention to propose a bill to withdraw Moroccan citizenship from Moroccan Jewish people living in the occupied Palestinian territories. In the end, PAM backed down from submitting the bill to the parliament, further showcasing Morocco’s controversial stance vis à vis Israel. Since the establishment of the Israeli state in 1948, Morocco and Israel have had a complicated relationship.  Israel has long since tried to bring Morocco to its side. The country has hosted three Moroccan delegations, the latest of which was in 2016, to strengthen the bonds of friendship between the two countries.

Rabat – A Moroccan delegation, led by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, is currently holding talks with the United Nations Personal Envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler in Lisbon, Portugal. The delegation will inform Kohler of Morocco’s firm stance over the four-decade-long conflict. The high-level meeting is the second of its kind since the appointment of Kohler in August 2017. After expressing his gratitude to the Moroccan delegation for accepting his request, Kohler seized the opportunity to wish King Mohammed VI a speedy recovery after he successfully underwent heart surgery, according to Moroccan TV channel 2M. At Kohler’s invitation, the Moroccan delegation also included Omar Hilale (Permanent Representative of Morocco to the United Nations), Sidi Hamdi Ould Errachid (President of the Laayoun-Sakia El Hamra region), and Yajna Khattat (President of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region), according to a statement made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The diplomatic meeting, which started at  9:50 a.m (GMT), will be the last one held before the submission of an annual report prepared by Kohler on the Western Sahara conflict. Kohler will submit his report to the United Nations’ Security Council in early April. This meeting is part of Morocco’s permanent cooperation with the UN, which seeks to find a fair solution to end the conflict over the Western Sahara. The Moroccan delegation is intended to inform Kohler of Morocco’s firm position on the Western Saharan conflict, as outlined in the speech of the King commemorating the 42nd anniversary of the Green March last  November 6, 2017. Throughout his speech, the King emphasized Morocco’s established principles and framework of reference on which the Moroccan position is based. The principles include the following: Morocco had received a similar invitation from Kohler in January to hold indirect talks with the parties regarding  the four-decade-long conflict. The talks would have be hosted in Berlin, Germany. However, Morocco refused to attend the meeting due to the attendance of the Polisario Front, which had been conducting illegal operations in the Guerguerat during the past few months. In addition to Morocco and the Polisario Front, Kohler also invited Algeria and Mauritania to attend, in the hopes of opening another round of negotiations in Berlin, Germany. Algeria, Mauritania, and the Polisario all attended previous meetings hosted by the Personal Envoy.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – Morocco held a business day at the ongoing 22nd Ghana International Trade Fair and Exhibition in the capital city of Accra.  The business day, which was attended by a large number of prospective investors and visitors on March 3, was Morocco’s first participation in the Fair. Agnes Adu, Chief Executive Officer of the Ghana Trade Fair Company, lauded Morocco’s participation in the fair, which is Ghana’s largest trade exhibition platform, and expressed optimism that it would strengthen relationships between Moroccan and Ghanaian firms. Morocco aims to explore business opportunities in Ghana and Morocco. Six Moroccan companies, which plan on entering the Ghana market, have showcased their products and services in many industries, including agro-processing, solar energy, construction, water and sewerage, and textiles. Several officials from the Moroccan Centerre for Export Promotion informed patrons about the viable investments and trade potentials that are available for Ghanaian businesses to examine. In his opening remarks, the Deputy Head of Mission at the Moroccan Embassy in Accra, Moulay Zaine El Moussaoui, expressed Morocco’s commitment to facilitate trade between Ghana and the Kingdom in the spirit of the South-South cooperation. El Moussaoui stated that the Embassy is collaborating with the Ghana Export Promotion Council and the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre to identify and evaluate more investment possibilities in both Ghana and Morocco. Following its readmission into the African Union on January 30, 2017, after a 33-year absence, Morocco announced its request to join the 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).  ECOWAS approved Morocco’s membership in principle, but also asserted that the implications of this membership must be considered. A second impact study will take place in mid-March of this year. The Senior Minister to the president of the Republic of Ghana, Yaw Osafo Marfo, reaffirmed his country’s support for Morocco’s bid to join ECOWAS in a recent meeting with Morocco’s Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani.

Rabat – Sixty Moroccan women are being held in custody with their children in “Mabrouka” Camps in the Syrian desert. In its March 6, Al Massae newspaper reported that the Moroccan women have been living in miserable conditions for five months as the wives of Moroccan Daesh fighters, and they will soon be transported to the prison “Rouge” at Ain al-Arab Kobané.  The inmates were arrested near the Al Chadadi border while fleeing an attack by the international coalition. The inmates are calling on the Moroccan authorities and human rights defenders to intervene urgently to save them from their current dire situation.  Out of the 285 Moroccans who joined Daesh, only 52 have returned to Morocco, while the rest remain in Syria. Only 15 of the 378 Moroccan children residing in Syrian conflict areas have managed to safely return to Morocco.

Rabat – In just a few months, Morocco’s Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Aziz Akhannouch has once again managed to be named Morocco’s richest man, according to Forbes list of 2018 World’s Billionaires. According to Forbes 2018’s list, Akhannouch’s fortune is now worth USD 2.2  billion. His wealth increased from USD to 2.1 billion in December 2017 to USD 2.2 billion in March 2018. Morocco’s second richest man is renowned businessman Othmane Benjelloun, who was dethroned by Akhannouch on Forber’s March and December lists. Benjeloune’s fortune weighs in at USD 1.6 billion, according to Forbes. In its December’s list, Forbes listed Akhannouch, who is also the Secretary-General of the National Rally of Independence Party, as Morocco’s first richest billionaire. The second place was taken by Benjelloun. The increase mirrors the positive performance of Akhannouch’s projects: Akwa Group, a multibillion-dollar Moroccan conglomerate with interests in petroleum, gas and chemicals through, as well as his publicly-traded subsidiaries Afriquia Gas and Maghreb Oxygene. Akhannouch’s fortune was boosted through his activities in media, real estate and in the field of hospitality. Forbes also highlighted his wife’s, Salwa Akhannouch, activities. Salwa, businesswoman and Aksal group founder, has launched earlier this year her new smart beauty and cosmetics store, Yan&amp;One, in Casablanca’s Morocco Mall.

Rabat – Morocco knows two healthcare systems: private and governmental, the first of which is only accessible by money and the second is often associated with decreased quality of care which may also apply to the private sector. Experiences from people seeking health care in Morocco show everything but a humane and accessible healthcare system. Patients of governmental hospitals are required to pay for equipment such as sterile syringes or bandages. Prescribed medications are always excessive in amount, aimed at increased turnover of the collaborating pharmacy and often not affordable by the (on average, poor) population. In a country where 41.3% of the population lives in rural areas with no fixed income or form of social security, disease and illness result in decrease of income, progressive poverty, and stress. Furthermore, corruption is common within the wards to receive attention from the nurses or get the doctor to check up on a patient. Even though the government has provided insurance coverage for 8 million of the poor, little is observed in reality when poor citizens of the rural areas travel to the city seeking care. And when care in hospitals is provided, a large proportion of the population is not capable of covering the medical costs. The 2011 Constitution emphasizes equal access of citizens to health care. The same law addresses basic medical coverage, solidarity, health equality and equal distribution of health resources. The World Health Organization reports in collaboration with the Moroccan Ministry of Health to emphasize equality of access to health care, which fails according to scientific studies. A good example is the case of late diagnosis of lymphoma (a form of cancer), where social factors discriminate access to health care. A delay in diagnosis has an impact on the survival status. Being non-married, having more than 3 children, and having low social economic status increase the odds of a delay by 2.5, 4.39, and 5.82 percent, respectively. This data indicates poor health outcomes based on factors related to decreased and unequal access to health care. Therefore, the current health care system fails to meet the requirements and promises the government makes regarding equality of access to health care. Failing healthcare systems, public health services, surveillance, and proactive care from the government to the population are visible in large quantities. For example, in 2010, 112 women per 100,000 births died during labor. A recent published study conducted in the region of Bni Hssen has followed up the maternal death surveillance system for 1.5 years. They found that the system systematically underreports maternal death within and outside health care facilities. The study’s maternal mortality rate was 2.5 times higher than that reported by the local surveillance system. It could be that this form of underreporting is done throughout the country, thus resulting in false improvement reports of the maternal health care system.

Rabat – A twelve-year-old girl loses balance and falls off her home’s rooftop in Nador on Monday, March 5th, because of violent winds. Reliable sources told Akhbar Al-Yaoum, the girl is currently under medical supervision in a local hospital in Nador. The girl was allegedly looking out over the wall of her family’s rooftop in the “Oulad Bou Tayeb” neighbourhood in the Moroccan city of Nador, when the raging gusts of wind swept her off her feet, reported the same source. The victim of the violent winds ended up with severe fractures on her limbs and back, and was immediately transferred to a local hospital to receive intensive treatment, confirmed Akhbar Al- Yaoum. For the past week, speedy rainstorms have surged throughout the kingdom, especially along the Atlantic and northern coasts, the Rif and the highlands. The wind-speed ranged from 60 to 80 km/h in Nador on March 5th, the day the incident occurred, Akhbar Al- Yaoum reported.

Rabat – On Monday, the General Delegation for Administration and Rehabilitation (DGAPR) released a statement responding to the allegations of a woman who claims to be the sister of one of the detainees involved in the Al-Hoceima protests. Speaking before the European Parliament, the woman accused the director and staff of Casablanca’s Ain Sebaa Prison of torturing the Hirak detainees awaiting trial for their participation in unauthorized protests in the Rif. The woman accused prison staff of forcing the detainees to consume poisoned water, unprescribed medications, and of threatening to rape their relatives. In response, DGAPR stated that the allegations are “unfounded,” adding that the prison’s director and the supervisory team treat the detainees in a responsible manner and ensure that detention conditions comply with national legislation.  DGAPR added that the detainees would not be alive if they had consumed toxic medications and poisoned water. The prison, according to DGAPR,  upholds the “rules of treatment that can in no way affect their physical and psychological integrity.” The administration added that the prison offers detainees continuous medical examinations,  allows visits from inmates’ defense lawyers, and enables them to attend weekly hearings in court. DGARP insists that if Hirak activists were, in fact, being mistreated, nothing would stop them from placing a formal complaint before the court during these regular meetings. The DGAPR also stated that the relatives of the detainees visit them on a weekly basis and have never placed a complaint against the prison staff. The relatives’ visits are directly monitored by the National Council of Rights of the Homme (CNDH), a national institution for the protection and promotion of human rights in Morocco. Approximately 400 Hirak activists were arrested in a crackdown in Al-Hoceima province between 2016 and 2017, following the death of Mouhcine Fikri—a local fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck. Fikri’s death sparked many protests in Al-Hoceima and the surrounding areas. Chanting slogans, the protesters decried social disparities in the region.  In response to the Rif demonstrations, King Mohammed VI tasked Driss Jettou, First President of the Court of Auditors, to present him with a report regarding the royal development projects delayed in Al-Hoceima.

Rabat – In the aftermath of the Arab Spring that some people are now calling the “Arab Winter,” the MENA region has been defined by escalating conflict and failing states.  Like a row of dominos nation after nation has fallen into complete chaos: Syria, Libya, Iraq, and Yemen have followed this path, but where does the next domino fall? All eyes seem to be looking to Algeria, and the situation there seems to be a perfect storm waiting to break. So what exactly is that situation and why is the state that was barely touched by the Arab Spring about to collapse? And if it does collapse what will that look like? To answer all those questions, one must look at Algeria’s recent past to provide a sense of the country’s political environment and identify the forces that could cause Algeria’s regime to collapse and the ways it can be avoided. Lastly, one must bring it all together to speculate on what the future of Algeria will look like.  Incapacitated president, incapacitated country To begin, Algeria is no stranger to violence. France’s brutal cultural war and dismal treatment of Algerians during the colonial period instilled a sense of violence in the hearts and minds of Algerians. This violence has a name, “revolutionary violence” and is the idea that because of the violent acts committed by the French, violence done to achieve independence was not just permitted but necessary. The war for independence spared few. Both sides used brutal tactics and by the time the French fully pulled out of Algeria, the trauma had left its mark on the psyche of the nation. This psychological impact showed itself again in the early 90s of the last century when democratically elected Islamist party FIS (Front islamique du Salut) threatened to remove the military from power. The Military responded once again with brutal violence and managed to consolidate their chokehold on political power by the end of the civil war in the year 2000 at the cost of thousands of lives (250 000 dead.) Today, about 30 generals control the government of Algeria. They use terror and torture to subdue their rivals and generous handouts funded by hydrocarbon revenues to pacify the general population. On the other hand, the president of the country, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, is in very poor health and wasn’t even expected to live long enough to run in the last elections. If this already sounds like an awful situation, brace yourself, because it is about to get worse. Human Rights Watch, however, gives a grim picture of human rights in Algeria in 2017 in the areas of freedom of assembly:[i] “Algerian authorities routinely violate the right to freedom of assembly, despite constitutional guarantees of that right. The penal code punishes organizing or participating in an unauthorized demonstration in a public place with up to one year in prison (article 98). Authorities in Algiers, the capital, banned public demonstrations indefinitely in 2001, when the country was under a state of emergency. Authorities did not rescind the ban when they lifted the state of emergency in 2011. The ban on demonstrations in Algiers is strictly enforced by authorities, who mobilize large numbers of police to thwart demonstrations and detain participants, usually holding them for a few hours before releasing them. For example, on September 6, 2017, dozens of protesters took to a square in central Algiers wearing t-shirts with the words “Article 102,” referring to the constitutional article that stipu­lates a president can be removed from office if he cannot carry out his duties. At least six of them were detained for six hours before being released without charge, according to local media.” as well as freedom of association, freedom of speech, women’s right, freedom of religion, sexual orientation and gender identity. Not to forget, also, that Sub-Saharan migrants are badly treated, repressed and deported by busloads to Mali and Niger in the most abject conditions. Worse, the authorities are accusing them of bringing into the country sexually transmissible diseases, drugs and petty and organized crime.  Diverse population, diverse cultural aspirations Algeria relies on hydrocarbons for roughly 60% of government revenues, and In January of 2015 Algeria’s sovereign fund dropped by 11.6 billion USD. At that rate the sovereign fund will be depleted by the summer of 2016. While oil prices will rise, prolonging the emptying of the fund, unless there is a drastic change the fund won’t last longer than two years at the most. As a rentier state, the robustness of Algeria’s coercive apparatus, and therein its ability to maintain control, is dependent on hydrocarbon revenue. When the salaries of soldiers, civil servants and the subsidized food and medicine evaporate, so will Bouteflika’s legitimacy, and the state will undoubtedly fail. Furthermore, Bouteflika may not live to see that moment, so it would be a new president, the first Algeria has seen since 1999, that would be at the head of this crisis. This is not to say that this disaster is totally unavoidable. The government of Algeria could make moves to prevent this catastrophe by looking to international organizations for aid. Robert S. Ford, senior fellow, at the American think tank The Middle East Institute, highlights, in a paper, the frailty of the economy of Algeria: “At the heart of Algeria’s economic frailty is the sustained distrust of the private sector and decades of dependence on the oil and gas sector. Bouteflika has urged his economic team to find ways to attract more investment, such as offering tax incentives. But no grand policies to entice foreign capital have come to fruition. In response to opposition criticism in November of a limited opening of shares in state-owned enterprises, Finance Minister Abderrahmane Benkhalfa highlighted that investment projects with foreigners still require a minimum Algerian ownership of 51 percent. In addition, the government is instituting in 2016 new, more restrictive licensing requirements for foreign trade and services. The Heritage Foundation recently rated Algeria next to last in the Middle East/North Africa region for economic freedom, labeling the economic system as “repressed”.” However, there is no such thing as a free lunch, and in order for Algeria to receive funding it will first have to make changes, such as opening its political system. A rational government would make these changes, but those who rule Algeria today got their power through unbelievable bloodshed and violence be it psychological or physical, and it wouldn’t be surprising if they would rather watch their country be consumed in flames than relinquish the power they fought so hard to attain. International solution One solution is to radically boost hydrocarbon production to make up for the drop in prices. Algeria has already started looking into shale gas but this has just heightened tensions between the politically divided north and south and is just prolonging the inevitable. The only internal solution left would be to radically change the structure of Algeria’s economy and diversify away from hydrocarbon rents. This is the long shot of all long shots though, and the unrest caused by a rapid shift in the economy could be enough to cause a revolution. No matter what way you look at it Algeria seems to be headed towards disaster. When the sovereign fund runs out the country will probably breakout in violence as Islamist groups will seek to use the popular unrest to gain power. The government will, undoubtedly, hold on to power as long as possible using any means they have. Massive human rights violations will attract the attention of international powers and the situation will deteriorate. Algeria will likely look a whole lot like its neighbor Libya, with the state divided into at least three sub states controlled by opposing forces. With no real hope for Algeria’s future, all anyone can do is prepare for the worst, and begin working on solutions to eventually pull the country up from the ashes of the impending civil war.

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat – On February 21st, the Minister of Communications and Spokesman of the Government, Mustapha El-Khalfi, announced Morocco’s decision to sign on to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). FATCA was first introduced under Obama in 2014, with a goal of preventing United States citizens from evading taxes on assets held outside of the States.  In recent years, the U.S. has experienced a large gap between its projected and actual tax revenues. The U.S. Government has speculated that citizens with large investments abroad as well as “green card” holders are avoiding fully paying taxes by falsely reporting their assets. FATCA was proposed to “fix” this. In short, FATCA is a request to other Foreign Financial Institutions (FFI) to annually report information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about bank accounts held abroad by U.S. citizens.  What motivation do countries like Morocco have to agree to FATCA?  Naturally, it seems unlikely that other countries would take a special interest in helping the States to catch its non-compliant taxpayers. By identifying its tax-evading citizens, the U.S. would be able to increase its own revenues. But for other countries, FATCA would only involve more “paperwork” with no compensation.  Due to a low initial participation rate in FATCA, the U.S. Government decided to modify its policy in order to motivate others to sign onto FATCA. The spokesman of the American Treasury stated to L ’Agence France Presse that, “Generally, the foreign financial institutions that have not signed with the United States have to register [individually] with American tax services […] or otherwise be subject to a 30% tax levy on payments they receive from the United States.” Therefore, unless an FFI is explicitly exempt, 30% of all U.S.-sourced income will be withheld if it opts to not participate. Since payments from the States are a huge source of income for many global banks, over 100 countries have now decided to adopt FATCA to avoid losses. While FATCA was originally introduced to FFIs to be signed, it was later changed to be more of an agreement between entire countries and the U.S. Government. Local banks are often prohibited from reporting information to non-local authorities, so Inter-Government Agreements (IGA) were introduced, allowing FATCA to be passed and enforced as local law. This meant that many local banks were forced into FATCA without reaching individual agreements. Controversy Surrounding FATCA  Morocco has now signed on to FATCA after years of “radio silence.” Other countries similarly withheld from agreeing to FATCA’s terms,—and not just because of the extra work involved. A statement made by an American-Swiss man sheds some light on some of the unfairness in the system. In an interview with Swiff Info, he claims, “I was born in the United States, but I have never even lived there. I now have two layers—one in Switzerland, and one in the States,—as well an accounting firm that is helping me with my financial issues. My Swiss bank told me directly that they wanted to be more strict with their American clients, and that I had to sell all of my shares at once. So I sold every share that I owned, and transferred all of my money to the Valiant Bank AG [of Switzerland] where I held my other accounts.  One year later, I received a letter from the bank telling me that I had to sign a contract that would force me to pay penalties if it was challenged by the IRS for any problems with my accounts.” Even those who do not identify as “American” are unjustly affected by FATCA simply because they happened to be born on U.S. soil. Those who are not ethnically American and do not live in the States have nothing to do with the United States economy. Forcing them to contribute to it from abroad has sparked an immense amount of controversy, and has left the impression that the U.S. is getting too extreme and greedy with its taxation laws. It also brings into question who should truly qualify as a U.S. “citizen,” as people are being exploited for financial gain.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat – “The Shape of Water” has risen to the top as the winner of Best Picture at the 90th annual Academy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday night, March 4. A fantasy/drama film, “The Shape of Water” is two hours in length and was originally released on December 1, 2017. Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, “The Shape of Water” follows the story of Elisa (played by Sally Hawkins), a mute janitress working night shifts at a top-secret government laboratory in 1962 Baltimore. Elisa’s life takes a major turn when she comes across and falls in love with the lab’s secret experiment, an aquatic-human hybrid creature that lives in a water tank. Del Toro described “The Shape of Water” as a “simple story […] a fable, a fairytale for troubled times about a woman that falls in love with a creature, an amphibian man, and she’s a cleaner in a secret government facility during the Cold War, 1962, and the plot is simple so that we can then make the characters complex and the interactions thematic […]. It’s a movie that mixes thriller, musical, drama, melodrama, creature.” Dialogue is not a part of the two protagonists’ roles, as del Toro said in an interview, they are “speechless, mute because, to me, love renders you speechless. And it was not about what they said to each other but how they recognized each other.” Mexican director Guillermo del Toro has emerged triumphant with two Oscars to his name, one for Best Picture and one for Best Director. Starring Sally Hawkins, Doug Jones, Michael Shannon, and Octavia Spencer, “The Shape of Water” has earned USD 57.4 million nationally and USD 126.4 million worldwide, according to The Hollywood Reporter website. “The Shape of Water” won against the hit movies “Dunkirk,” “Get Out,” “Call Me By Your Name,” and “Lady Bird.”

Rabat – A Moroccan delegation, led by Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, will hold a bilateral meeting on Tuesday in Lisbon (Portugal) with Horst Kohler, the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations for Western Sahara. The news was confirmed by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) on Friday. The delegation traveling to Lisbon, will include Omar Hilale, Permanent Representative of Morocco to the United Nations, Sidi Hamdi Ould Errachid, President of the Laayoun-Sakia El Hamra region and Yajna Khattat, President of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region, according to a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At Kohler’s invitation, Morocco’s participation “in this bilateral meeting is part of Morocco’s continuous cooperation with the United Nations to reach a final political solution to the regional dispute over the Moroccan Sahara,” said the statement. The ministry added that the Moroccan delegation will follow the basis of “the national position as outlined in the speech of King Mohammed VI to the Nation, in conjunction with the commemoration of the 42nd anniversary of the Green March, on November 6, 2017. Morocco received a similar invitation from Kohler in January to hold indirect talks with the parties to the four-decade-long conflict in Berlin, Germany. Morocco, however, refused to attend the meeting due to the attendance of the Polisario Front, which has been executing illegal maneuvers in the Guerguerat during the past few months. In addition to Morocco and the separatist Polisario Front, Kohler also invited Algeria and Mauritania to attend, in hopes of opening another round of negotiations in Berlin, Germany. Algeria, Mauritania, and the Polisario all attended previous meetings hosted by the Personal Envoy. Morocco’s refusal to engage reinforced the kingdom’s firm refusal to acknowledge the illegal separatist group as a commensurate political entity.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat– Although Sunday’s parliamentary election result proved inconclusive for the Italian government, significant gains by far-right, anti-immigrant parties send a signal across Europe and the Mediterranean. While no single party gained the majority vote, the general trend is clear: over 50 percent of voters backed candidates from parties against immigration, opposed to the political establishment, and skeptical of the European Union (EU). The populist Five Star Movement garnered over a third of votes cast on Sunday. At the same time, a conservative alliance between the League, a hardline anti-Europe, anti-immigrant party, and center-right party Forza Italia collected 37 percent, the latter party running under the slogan “Stop the Invasion” in reference to people migrating to Europe via Italy’s Mediterranean coast.   Migration proved to be a key issue for Italian voters. Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi likened migration to a “social time bomb.” Although a tax fraud conviction bans Berlusconi from public office, he continues to head Forza Italia and is expected to play a part in the coalition government formed in the coming weeks. Five Star leader Alessandro Di Battista jubilantly hailed the election as a “triumph.” Weighing in on Twitter, France’s far-right leader Marine Le Pen hailed the League’s gains as “spectacular.” However, sentiment towards immigrants is hardening on both the right and the left. Matteo Renzi, former prime minister and head of the center-left Democrats, stated in 2016 that Italians need to “free” themselves “from a sense of guilt.” “We do not have the moral duty to welcome into Italy people who are worse off than ourselves.”  Roughly 700,000 mostly African men and women have migrated to Italy in recent years, and nearly 10 percent of the people in Italy today are of non-Italian origin. According to data from the Italian National Institute of Statistics, as of 2016 there are some 35,000 Moroccans living in Italy with Italian citizenship. However, 2016 Italian census reported over 420,000 Moroccans living in Italy, regardless of citizenship or residency. The League made international headlines earlier this year when a registered League member and local political candidate, Luca Traini, wounded six African migrants in a drive-by shooting in the town of Macerata. Director of the Italian Institute for International Political Studies Paolo Magri told the BBC that Italy was on “the front line” of European politics. “We are surrounded by bizarre politics,” he lamented. Noting Great Britain’s decision to leave the European Union in 2016, Magri added that Italy now “feel[s like a] member of the club.” The 2017 French, Dutch, and German elections all seemingly bucked the populist groundswell credited with Brexit and buoying Donald Trump into the White House a year earlier.  However, Italy’s conservative victory marks the first major EU election in 2018 and has analysts and officials concerned that the Italian election foreshadows anti-European elections in 2018. Meanwhile, the hardening of Italian attitudes towards foreigners, migrants, and refugees may suggest future fortification along Italy’s southern border.

Rabat – During the opening of the first-ever Confederation of African Football (CAF) Women’s Football Symposium, which is currently taking place in Marrakech, CAF President Ahmad Ahmad once again reaffirmed his full support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. The CAF president made his statements during the opening ceremony of the two-day event. Speaking to the symposium attendees, Ahmad lauded King Mohammed VI’s efforts to promote the African football, calling it a source of pride for the African continent “King Mohammed VI has sponsored the first CAF symposium with USD 3 million. He also sponsored the African Nations Championship of local players with USD 15 million. The CAF only paid USD 3 million. And today, this symposium of women’s football is also supported by the King.” During the event, which is taking place under the theme “raising our game,”  participants will discuss several football-related topics expected to put women’s football in Africa on the global map. The panels will also discuss measures and the means to expand the practice of women’s football, develop the technical formation of the trainers, referees and instructors. The attendees will also discuss the role of women’s football in gender promotion and socialization. CAF’s President has also wished the King a speedy recovery after he successfully underwent a heart surgery. In July 2017, the North African country hosted a similar CAF symposium in Rabat to discuss key features of African football. CAF’s 40th Ordinary General Assembly was also held in Morocco in Casablanca on February 2, 2018, with FIFA president Gianni Infantino and CAF’s president in attendance. During the meeting, Ahmad made his position clear regarding the Moroccan bid, emphasizing that Morocco has proven its capacity to host major sports events like the World Cup. “I can reassure you that I will not be neutral. I say it loud and clear,” said Ahmad. His statements come in response to remarks from FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino. At the same meeting, Infantino urged CAF to remain neutral in the selection process for the 2026 World Cup host. However, Ahmad argued FIFA’s point, emphasizing that “nothing says that [he] cannot” support Morocco’s bid.

Rabat – New faces will be part of Morocco’s final squad for the upcoming friendlies that the Moroccan football team will play before the 2018 World Cup that begins in June. Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum reported today that head football coach Herve Renard will call up new names for two scheduled friendlies, one against Serbia on March 23 in Turin and one against Uzbekistan on March 27 in Casablanca. The coach’s list will almost certainly include Yassine Ayoub and Zakaria Labyad who both play for Dutch club FC Utrecht. Labyad confirmed the news that he was called by Renard for the friendlies. The footballer told Dutch media outlet De Telegraaf, “I am very happy. My last international match was in 2015. It is hard for me to be with the Lions in the World Cup Russia 2018, but my selection for the friendlies is a good sign.” Labyad also told De Telegraaf that Renard had contacted him after his team’s victory against PEC Zwolle on February 10. Renard is also set to call up Ait Melloul-born Walid Azaro, a striker for Egypt’s Al-Ahly Cairo team. The French coach is also expected to add other players, including defender Yunis Abdelhamid (Reims) and CHAN tournament standout Ayoub El Kaabi (RS Berkane). Two Raja of Casablanca stars will likely also earn a spot on the roster. Center-back Badr Benoun and forward Zakaria Hadraf. Wydad Casablanca’s Salaheddine Essaidi is also expected to be on Renard’s list. Renard has only a couple months to think about his final squad for the World Cup tournament. After the friendlies are over, the final list of 23 players for each tournament team is due June 4. When the tournament begins, the Atlas Lions will first battle Iran on June 15. Its second game on June 20 is against Portugal, while the final first-round match for Morocco will be against Spain on June 25.

Rabat – The Spanish outlet canariasenred has released clarification regarding the recent controversial video circulating social media that shows a policeman physically assaulting a young Moroccan man.  Prior to the scene in the video, the young man allegedly threatened the officer and his family saying, “I know you, I know your wife and your kids, and I’m going to cut their throats.” The presumed victim assaulted two cops moments before the scene. In the video, the police officer throws the man onto the floor and kicks and punches him before picking up a chair, aiming to throw it at him. Así redujo un policía local de Lleida a un marroquí.

By Mohamed Reddad Rabat – First introduced in 2017, the #MeToo phenomenon has spread rapidly across social media with the goal of raising awareness of the prevalence of sexual assault—particularly in the workplace. The movement has swept through the United States, resulting in the fall of many powerful men from grace. The movement has progressed as far eastward as Japan and China—albeit with very faint resonance. Morocco has not been immune to the effects of the movement. Recently,  renowned journalist Taoufik Bouachrine and a staff member from Al-Bayane newspaper were both accused of sexual harassment. Social media has been pointing fingers, claiming there is a  political vendetta against certain journalists. Regardless of a political agenda hidden in the government, the #MeToo Movement is not likely to take root in a patriarchal society like Morocco’s. Sexual harassment is a crime that is not always easy to catch because proving it beyond a reasonable doubt is a difficult task. In fact, law enforcement may not even see it as a serious offence—nor may many prosecutors, the majority of whom are male. Therefore, many women do not see the point in coming forward for a lawsuit. They may only do so if they were severely harmed and had significant evidence. However, even if they have a strong case, other factors may also prevent them from speaking up. Sexual harassment is defined as any unwanted sexual advance or remark, but the term is largely excluded from our vocabulary as an offense, especially amongst those with minimal education. Action is taken only if an assault occurs, and very few cases make it to the courts because of social mediation or if not much merit is seen in the case (for example, in the assault of a sex worker). Society might choose to see the victim as the one who broke societal norms, and brought the assault upon herself.  As a collectivist society, shame rears its ugly head and prevents many women from defending both themselves and others. Many women who are sexually harassed or assaulted happen to be soft-spoken and reserved. They oftentimes come from low socio-economic backgrounds, or families that raised them to be traditional compliant, quiet vulnerable women. A boss, for example, would be less likely to harass an outspoken and highly educated female employee, or a female with relatives holding positions of power.  He would be more likely to know that she would not tolerate it, or fear that either she or her family would speak out against him. Sexual harassment is not only about sexual gratification…it is a low ploy for power, stemming from a need to satisfy ego. If a man feels he cannot do so without jeopardizing himself, he is less likely to sexually harass a woman. Coming forward with a sexual assault case could also put a woman’s job in jeopardy; therefore, many women would not even seek support, let alone justice in a court. Enduring the pain of the memory or of the ongoing harassment is more bearable than losing the means of subsistence. Some women might even see harassment as a normal thing. It is something they think they simply have to deal with. Although the women have come forward and brought a lawsuit against the journalist and staff member mentioned before, many women have qualms about joining the #MeToo movement. Even just using the phrase, “Me Too” sometimes draws more criticism than sympathy—even from other women. Women continue to be falsely demonized as sorcerers, seductresses, marriage breakers, and just plain evil.  Coming forward could victimize them twice even when their complaints are legitimate. Thus, fear of losing face or job opportunities, of incurring the wrath and criticism of society, and of being victimized twice deters many women from involving themselves with #MeToo Movement. So whether or not the journalists are convicted, the #MeToo phenomenon is very likely to fade away from collective memory in Moroccan society. Statistically, women rarely ever harass men. It is also worth noting here that “flirting” is not analogous to sexually harassing. Sexual harassment is scary, and if gets physical, a woman would be at a disadvantage because her physical build-up (due to a relative lack of testosterone, women’s bodies are not as naturally muscular as that of most men).

Rabat – Banks in North Africa will overpower revenue shares in South Africa by 2022, according to a recent report on retail banking in Africa from the management consulting firm McKinsey and Company. North African revenue shares before risk costs are predicted to reach 30 percent in 2022, up from 28 percent in 2017 and 24 percent in 2012. South Africa will see its share fall to 26 percent in 2020, down from 30 percent in 2017 and 37 percent in 2012. Central Africa exhibits the same downward trend. “There is a shift underway in exchange rate adjusted revenue pools towards North Africa, East Africa, and West Africa, and away from South Africa and Central Africa,” said the report. The same report indicates that about 65 percent of African banks’ profitability and 94 percent of their revenue growth, are attributable to their “geographic footprint,” with Morocco featuring among the leading countries. “There are huge variations in growth and profitability at the country level, with nations such as Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, and Morocco featuring positively.” Morocco, along with South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt and Angola account for 68 percent of the total banking revenue pool for the 54 countries on the continent, “leading to some inevitable fragmentation of the banking opportunity.” Between 2017 and 2020, Africa’s banking revenue pools are expected to grow at 8.5 percent each year between 2017 and 2022, bringing the continent’s total banking revenues to USD 129 billion. “Africa’s banking markets are roaring to life. They will grow robustly over the next five years, and as a group, Africa’s banks are second-most profitable on a global level”, writes the McKinsey group. USD 53 billion will be produced in retail banking, compared to the USD 35 billion generated in 2017, recording a growth of USD 18 billion. Three-quarters of the USD 18 billion in absolute retail revenue growth will be concentrated in 10 countries; though the greatest retail growth will be in South Africa, Morocco will feature among the leading growth markets in the sector. Nevertheless, the report explains that with such remarkable growth, certain challenges are inescapable: Africa’s banking markets face a high percentage of low-income customers, high cash usage, and low levels of physical distribution and variation flowing from the relatively advanced markets of South Africa and Morocco to the nascent markets of Ethiopia and the DRC.

Rabat – Moroccan pop star Saad Lamjarred, who stands accused of rape on two accounts, plans to release his new song titled “Ghzali Ghzali” in Morocco amid mixed reception. Lamjarred announced that he will be coming to Morocco soon via a post on his official Instagram account on Monday, March 5.  The controversial singer said, “I would like to share with you my interim return to my country Morocco in the coming days.God willing, I will take this opportunity to present my new work, Ghazali Ghazali, from my beloved country.”  While many have welcomed Lamjarred’s anticipated return, others are angry  by the news given the outstanding rape accusations against him in the French courts.  The pop singer has been temporarily released on bail under electronic surveillance since April 13, 2017, after spending almost six months at the Marriott Champs Elysées in Paris to face rape and assault charges. In 2010, Lamjarred was accused of rape for the first time in the US by an American woman.  However, Lamjarred’s supporters far outweigh his opponents, as he remains one of the most successful singers in the Middle East and North Africa.  ???? ?????? ?? ??????? ??? ????? ??????? ??? ???? ?????? ???? ?????? ??????? ??????? ?? ??? ???? ? ??? ????? ??? ?????? ?? ???? ???? ?????? “????? ?????” ?? ???? ?????? . ????? #????_????_????? #saadlamjarred1 #love_my_fans_forever_and_ever A post shared by  saadlamjarred (@saadlamjarred1) on Mar 5, 2018 at 6:49am PST

Rabat – The Republic of Azerbaijan expressed on Monday its support for the territorial integrity of Morocco and the autonomy plan proposed by the Kingdom to find a fair solution to the issue of the Western Sahara. At the meeting of the first session of the joint commission of cooperation between Morocco and the Republic of Azerbaijan, held on Monday in Baku, Azerbaijan authorities expressed their “support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Morocco” and “the country’s autonomy plan,” which has been welcomed by the United Nations Security Council, and has been considered a serious, realistic, and credible basis for finding a fair solution to the Sahara issue. The meeting was co-chaired by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita, and his Azerbaijan counterpart, Elmar Mammadyarov. They will also co-chair the second political consultation session of the joint cooperation commission between the two countries. The Moroccan minister was received earlier this morning at Baku’s Presidential Palace by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, to whom Bourita conveyed the greetings of King Mohammed VI. The visit was also an occasion to sign several agreements regarding a non-double taxation and fight against tax evasion between the two countries, which are related to security. The fight against crime agreement was also signed. In addition, the two parties concluded two memoranda of intent, one concerning the Higher Institute of Maritime Studies of Morocco and the other relating to cooperation between Azerbaijan Railways and the Moroccan railway company, ONCF.

Rabat – Former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez is expected to arrive in Rabat on March 8 to pay a tribute to Moroccan former Head of Government, Abderrahmane Youssoufi during his 94th birthday. Gonzalez, who has many friends in Morocco, is expected to visit the North African country next Thursday to participate in his long-time friend’s birthday, according to Spanish news agency EFE. EFE also recalled Gonzalez’s visit to Morocco to attend the 2014 Throne Day as a personal guest. Several international officials are expected to land in Morocco next Thursday to pay a tribute to the 94-year old Moroccan politician,  including Algerian former UN Special Representative for Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi and Egypt’s President of the National Human Rights Council, Mohamed Fayeq. Youssoufi, who held the position of Prime Minister between 1998 and 2002, is one of the most respected political leaders in Morocco’s history, and an icon of Morocco’s resistance to French colonialism. Born in Tangier, he was also a human rights lawyer. In July 2016, King Mohammed VI inaugurated an avenue bearing the name of Abderrahmane Youssoufi in the city of Tangier. The King’s gesture was a tribute to Youssoufi and his loyalty to the kingdom. Abderrahmane Youssoufi Avenue, which was previously called “Assalam,” is located in downtown Tangier.

Rabat – Lancôme, the French luxury perfumes and cosmetics house, recently launched the “Write Her Future” project as a global commitment to fight illiteracy among women. 76 million young women around the world are illiterate—a staggering number that has not changed over the last two decades. This what has inspired Lancôme to light a candle in illiteracy’s darkness, with a pledge to invest a sum of two million euros to fund international literacy programs and to develop local support communities. Lancôme’s International President, Françoise Lehmann, remarked that, “Today, 76 million young women lack basic reading and writing skills. Often hidden, this handicap causes young women to face exclusion and becoming dependents, creating  serious consequences for themselves, their families, and their loved  ones. This is why Lancôme is  committed to ?ght against young women’s illiteracy and to lend a voice to this invisible reality. There is a natural draw  for Lancôme to help with this cause, because  since the very beginning, our goal has always been to help women in their quest for self-ful?llment and expression of what makes them unique. “Write Her Future,” Lancôme’s very ?rst global philanthropic program, is a civic and long-term commitment that  aims to  raise awareness, implement concrete actions in the ?eld, and to initiate a movement in favor of women.” In addition to increasing self-confidence and opening up career prospects, the brand believes that literacy also allows people to lead longer and healthier lives. “Knowing how to read and write means having the freedom to express yourself fully and build your own future freely,” affirms Lancôme. To fulfill its mission, Lancôme has also joined hands with Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE), a humanitarian agency that delivers emergency relief and long-term international projects. Morocco will witness this project’s first steps as a pilot literacy program. Two other programs in Guatemala and Thailand will follow in suit . Together, these three programs aim to help around 8,000 women, who will directly benefit from educational resources, while more than 40,000 people are expected to benefit from educational training. To help further this ambitious campaign, Lancôme evoked its Ambassadors, which include A-list Hollywood stars such as Julia Roberts, Lupita Nyong’o, Kate Winslet, and Penélope Cruz, who will work alongside the brand’s employees and CARE workers to develop social networks and help build the vision of global literacy. “Literacy is one of the most defining human skills. We need to be able read and write—that’s how we communicate, share, express our feelings and opinions, and how we learn to understand the world. To not have that accessible to everyone is a crime. It’s so great that  Lancôme is getting seriously involved and supporting young girls in the world through the work of ‘Write Her Future,’”  remarked  Julia Roberts.

Rabat – As the 2026 World Cup bidders prepare to submit their formal application on March 16th, Morocco once again emphasizes its strengths to prove that it has all the assets to host the world tournament. Morocco is determined to convince the majority of the 211 associations affiliated with  FIFA to vote for its bid. Ahead of submitting its formal application, the North African country unveiled some of the arguments it will use to defend its application. According to the Atlas Lions sports website, the Moroccan 2026 World Cup Bid Committee will take advantage of its ideal geographical situation—which has a time zone similar to that of Europe and Africa. According to authorities, Morocco’s Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), is another asset that would attract more votes as this would be beneficial for both traveling teams, potential spectators, and fans.Europeans would struggle to watch the games if they aired at late hours. British news outlet BBC quoted a document provided by  Morocco’s committee, emphasizing that “beyond profitability, Morocco’s sweet-spot location will allow all European fans to watch World Cup games in decent and premium hours.” Morocco first applied to host the tournament on August 11th, 2017— but the country’s bid campaign was only launched by the Moroccan committee on January 23rd. In January, Moroccan Minister of Sports and Youth said during a press conference that the country selected 12 different cities to host the tournament. The cities that were chosen are some of the most attractive ones, and receive thousands of tourists every year. The list of the cities selected by Morocco includes Casablanca, Marrakech, Tetouan, Nador, Meknes, El-Jadida, Fez, Oujda, Tangier, Agadir, Rabat, and Ouarzazate. To travel between cities in Morocco , the flying time will not exceed 75 minutes, according to Moroccan authorities. This is in stark contrast to the multiple-hour flights between the three nations of the North American Bid (USA-Mexico-Canada). , Morocco is also planning to build 7 new stadiums if the country wins the bid. In order to win, Morocco will need 104 votes from the 211 members federations to host the enormous event in 2026. The Moroccan bid has received unwavering support from several African countries, including Tunisia, Algeria, Botswana, and Nigeria. Sports officials from both FIFA and CAF have also voiced their support  of the bid. Since the submission of Morocco’s bid in August, the President of the African Football Confederation, Ahmad Ahmad, has shown full support for Morocco’s bid, emphasizing that the time has come for Africa to host the tournament again. If Morocco wins the bid to host the 23rd FIFA World Cup, it will be the second African country ever to host the World Cup. The first to host was  South Africa, back in 2010. Ahmad’s statements were echoed by ex-FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who believes that Morocco is the logical host of the 2026 World Cup. In January, chairman of the American bid Sunil Gulati described the Moroccan bid as a “tough battle” for the three American nations. While the three American nations believe that they already have the infrastructure to host any sports event, for Gulati, “This is not only about our stadiums and hotels. It is about perceptions of America [especially the United States], because  and it is a difficult time for  the world.” Gulati’s statements came in response to the international political issues surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump. Gulati added that there are many political factors beyond his control. “We can’t control what happens at the 38th parallel in Korea, and we can’t control what happens with embassies in Tel Aviv, or what happens with climate change accords. We do the best we can. We have the support of Washington.” In December, Gulati said that the North American bidders are expecting Morocco to “campaign hard” in order to host the 2026 World Cup. “We expect Morocco to put forward a very good bid […], we expect them to campaign hard,” he said.

Rabat – In an interview that aired last night on Moroccan TV (channel 2M), Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch discussed the ruling of the European Union Court of Justice (ECJ) on the EU-Morocco Fisheries Agreement, emphasizing that it could be suspended (this week) if the verdict affects Morocco’s sovereignty over the southern provinces. On February 27th, the ECJ decreed that the fisheries agreement between the EU and Morocco is, “valid insofar as it is not applicable to Western Sahara or to its adjacent waters,” adding that, if the EU and Morocco included the Western Sahara region in their agreement, it would violate certain rules of “international law applicable to relations between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco.” In response to the verdict, Akhannouch pointed out  that the court, “did not consult with  the populations in the southern provinces, because the agreements [signed between Morocco and the EU] were  in favor of these areas.” He  added that “If an agreement is reached within the framework of national sovereignty, which is a red line, [Morocco then] will negotiate with the Europeans.” Akhannouch also said that nothing is more important than Morocco’s sovereignty. So the agreement, which is in favor of the European Union, might be suspended if it affects the sovereignty of Morocco over its southern provinces. “Morocco does not need the 40 million EUR that the European Union would pay for Morocco in exchange for allowing European fishermen [to use Morocco’s waters]. There are agreements amounting to 35 billion EUR, all of which are in favor of the EU.” When asked about the possibility of ending the EU-Morocco agreement, Akhannouch remarked that, “Anything is possible. It could stop [this week], but that depends on the position of the European Union because we are not part of the ECJ’s decision.” The Moroccan official added that the ECJ’s decision did not recognize the role of the Polisario Front in this matter, as the separatist group has long-been appealing against the EU-Morocco Fisheries and Agriculture Agreements. “The matter must be clarified, and the interests of Morocco and the Europeans require a review of the decision of the European Court, with the aim of reaching a final result. It is Europe’s duty to give Morocco the value it deserves,” Akhannouch  added.“If the  EU offers a positive interaction that meets Morocco’s conditions, we will work together, if not, we will abandon the agreement without any problem.” Akhannouch has echoed statements made by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Bourita, and Head of Government, Saad Eddine El-Othmani, in response to the ECJ’s ruling. In an interview with  news outlet Le360, Bourita said  that “nothing in the [ECJ’s] verdict challenges the political legitimacy of Morocco to conclude agreements regarding the Moroccan Sahara with the EU.The Kingdom is equivalent to the sum of all of its territories from Tangier to Lagouira.” According to El-Othmani, Morocco’s Head of Government, Saad Eddine El-Othmani, stressed that Morocco always strives to preserve its “sovereignty, unity, and sense of connection to its southern provinces,” in whatever agreements are approved and signed.

The arrest of the 38-year-old undocumented migrant came after a complaint was filed by a Moroccan citizen who was the victim of the suspect and his accomplices related to a scheme that is often known as a black money scam. The scheme involves convincing victims, via email or phone, to invest significant sums of money to buy a so-called “magic” liquid. The perpetrators promise victims that a large stash of currency-sized black papers are actually real currency notes which are covered in a dye and which only need to be washed in this special liquid to make the bills clean and usable. The arrest operation resulted in the seizure of a mobile phone and a cupboard with black papers in the form of currency. The suspect was placed in custody while the investigation continues to determine the circumstances of the case. Further arrests are possible in the case.

Rabat – Ten days after the arrest of Moroccan journalist Taoufik Bouachrine, the administration of Casablanca’s Ain Borja prison said that the inspection applied in the case of Bouachrine is a measure applicable for all individuals during the prison registration or incarceration process. The communiqé of the administration came a few days after Bouachrine, who is facing charges for his alleged sexual misconduct, released a statement from the prison claiming that his arrest was a “conspiracy.” Bouachrine, as quoted by one of his lawyers, stated that the Moroccan judicial police “did not operate in accordance with the law and legality throughout their inspection.” But in a response statement quoted by the General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR), Casablanca’s prison administration said that “the fact of not carrying out this search constitutes a violation of the professional duty by the officials.” The statement added that prison officials are obliged to apply this measure to comply with legal regulations “in order to preserve the dignity of prisoners.” Various Moroccan media reported earlier this week that prison officials did not allow Bouachrine to sign certain documents. These allegations, according to the  Ain Borja prison statement, “are completely baseless” and that document control procedure resulted in the discovery of two documents that were not on the list of documents whose signatures were authorized by the Public Prosecutor. According to the statement, which was reported by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Bouachrine has benefited since his detention from medical treatment and medical examinations and prescribed drugs “which are currently in his cell.” The communiqué added that the detained journalist has not filed a complaint regarding this matter. “The allegations made by some lawyers of the detainee, will not deter the administration of the institution to enforce the law against all prisoners without distinction,” concluded the statement. Bouachrine was arrested on February 24, at the headquarters of Akhbar Al Yaoum. He is facing several charges, including human trafficking, the exploitation of people in need, and the abuse of power for sexual purposes. Bouachrine is also suspected of other crimes, including violent rape and attempted rape. The communiqué added that there are nearly 50 tapes of sexual assault incidents recorded on a hard disk and a digital video recorder. The public prosecutor of Casablanca’s Court of Appeal has reportedly received eight new complaints from eight victims alleging additional claims of sexual assault against the journalist. Bouachrine will be presented before the court in Casablanca on March 8.

Rabat – Two events highlight Morocco’s rising role as both a catalyst and a facilitator of African artistic renaissances, as well as the connector of the African art scene to the global connoisseurs. Morocco’s upcoming participation in the third annual “Morocco in Abu Dhabi” arts festival, which takes place March 6-19, highlights the growing political, economic, and cultural ties between Morocco and UAE, but also showcases the preservation of Morocco’s traditional arts.  In February, Morocco hosted a contemporary African arts fair called “Decolonize Always!“, which explores breaking down stereotypes and barriers to indigenous self-expression which rose as a result of colonial rule and culture. Two seemingly polar opposite events show the rich spectrum of Morocco’s growing role as a global player in an area previously relegated to the specialist collectors and the rare lovers of the exotic. Morocco is leading the way in mainstreaming and normalizing the idea of African art – and that is great for everyone. Morocco in Abu Dhabi exhibit seeks to attract younger people, both to the exhibit itself and to heritage preservation efforts, featuring an entire gallery focused on Design and Youth. The African Arts fair featured an artist from Ghana, who, to contrast the limiting nature of colonial-era museums that no one visits, came up with an idea of a traveling exhibit with walls that can be broken down and folded away when the museum stops at a particular place. There are several likely developments to follow from these events.  First, successful Morocco in Abu Dhabi series is likely to continue, growing and taking on new forms and idea with time. In the future, it may inspire local Abu Dhabi-based artists to experiment with fusion styles that will affect their own culture. The effects of this can already be seen thanks to the Moroccan artisans who work in UAE. Second, Morocco’s craftsmanship will likely become increasingly international, with more opportunities to showcase folk arts in other parts of the Middle East, and around the world. Transporting these exhibits is costly, and would require major investments from governments or private institutions, but well worth it for the effects of cultural diplomacy as well as attracting tourists, customers, and expanding the appreciation of Moroccan art on a global level. Third, it could motivate more students to go into heritage preservation-related projects, and ultimately attract an infusion of funding that would improve the otherwise uninspiring educational system. Morocco has a rich history and a spectrum of diverse artisanship; increased exposure would benefit tribes in rural areas, and provide an incentive for continuing these traditions, as well as improve local economies, with a possibility of an international customer network. Eventually, classes related to these arts could be taught in universities around the world and become an important part of world heritage, while influencing artistic movements, as well as interior designs and objects of decor in a more positive and interesting way due to the traditional yet unfamiliar roots, perhaps finally taking away contemporary art scenes from shock-based postmodernism. No less interesting is the role Morocco can play in creating innovation in art inside Africa itself. Importantly,  it facilitates the return to the roots of indigenous art and creates a space where new perspectives can flourish based on new paradigms and starting points. Nevertheless, the question here arises where complete decolonization can ever really happen – and whether it is desirable.  Cultures influence each other – and regardless of how it actually started, that is how growth occurs. Arab empires once colonized what is now Morocco, subsuming local black cultures, and spreading across the continent. Though they dominated over the indigenous cultures, their presence left an indelible mark, and Morocco’s rich and diverse cultural mosaic, and the tradition of tolerance, would not have evolved if not for having to deal with these experience, and figure out a way of coexisting peacefully among the different traditions that could have clashed, but ultimately ended up complementing one another.  European culture, too, is an important mark that imbues Moroccan culture. Though the argument of how much influence should remain after France and Spain have withdrawn their presence, there is no denying that these influences are not only important to the creation of the multifaceted modern Moroccan identity, but are a source of pride for Moroccans who find their beautifully complex heritage unique and position to serve as connections between countries, cultures, and continents. Other African countries, despite whatever benefits colonialism may have brought, have a more challenging relationship with the past. More so than the physical burdens of what is perceived as one-sided and exploitative relationships with European state, decolonialization refers to the mindset free of foreign influence and finding pride in one’s own cultural heritage and traditions, particularly the original practices that were in place prior to the imposition of alien customs and rules. Indeed, colonial expectations and boundaries, people like the artist from Ghana, feel place limitations on the possibilities of creative self-expression which are inline with the rigid European social expectations. The theme of Decolonize Africa! then refers to the practice of undoing the damage and liberating from the social and cultural constraints.  What does the re-imagining of African traditions in the light of modernity look like? That is what the art fair is set to explore, celebrating a wide spectrum of African artists across three continents.  Marrakech, with its rich tradition of multiculturalism yet close ties to the land and local identity, is the perfect place to host one of them.  Until now, the Western media has devoted little coverage to such events. In the imaginations of most Westerners, Africa remains either an exotic yet inaccessible world, or a continent of victims with vestiges of abuse left over from centuries of foreign invasions, or for some, still, a distant and dangerous place where 54 countries all blur into one, with each portion more threatening than the next. The series of art fairs may do something that no supposedly objective Western coverage has been able to achieve – demystifying Africa and bringing it down to a human, accessible, and easy-to-understand level. Bringing Africa to every home is something to aspire to. Because ultimately, the more people can touch a culture, the more they can see beyond stereotypes, fantasies, and rumors, and break down the internal barriers that prevent them from reaching out and exploring the country or the region. It means they understand something about the individuals and traditions and why they express themselves in a particular way. And it means that their own world has just gotten a little bigger and a little richer. When I visited Morocco for the first time, the first question my friends and family asked me was whether it’s safe to go. Aside from the fact that no one bothered looking up crime statistics, nor Morocco’s geography, and the exceptionally safe and stable Morocco appeared to be no different than the war-torn DRC – it surprised me how little interest there seemed to be in any other aspect of my travel. No one’s concern was about the weather, the climate, the infrastructure, the bureaucracy, the accommodations, the ability to interact in English, or the single most important issue that ACTUALLY matters – the food. That African countries, even the safest ones that attract millions of tourists every year, are reduced to fears about crime statistics, ultimately means that those countries and their culture are nothing more than just dots on a travel map to most people, and there is no incentive for them to put more effort into learning more until they get enough information to peak their interests. Travel stories and photos from friends are one way to do this; but bringing down a little of the country right where a person can see it, touch it, participate a little, and want to see and do a lot more of it, is really the way to go. If a society is not used to traveling or not yet open to the idea of physically exploring a particular region, introduction to that culture within their comfort zone is one step towards getting them out of their shell. Thanks to the forces of globalization, US music, fast food, big fashion brands, and moves have touched most of the world in some capacity. Big urban areas in the United States, like NYC, proudly boasts of dozens of Moroccan restaurants (also, a few Ethiopian, maybe one or two Egyptian and Tunisian, and maybe a couple of Western African ones), and proudly display some traditional arts in an assortment of museums. University students can take hundreds of classes on just about any culture, and musical tour groups come to the city all the time; one needs only to look. Still, unless one already has friends from a particular culture, making the exploration of something that is slightly off the beaten path a priority amidst all the other events and distractions is not easy. And in most of the country, outside the major cities, even that level of exposure does not exist. For that reason, these arts festivals play a central part in peope-to-people cultural diplomacy, in building the bridges that even a conversation might not suffice right away. People who are not open to conversing with individuals from another culture out of fear, biases, discomfort, or simply not knowing what to say and how to say it, will find fewer inhibitions in observing a beautiful dance, hearing an appealing song, or handling an intricately crafted object. For that reason, “Decolonize Africa!” has a potential to make the kind of global impact even social media with its instantaneous connections between users from all over the world cannot make as effectively. Without the downsides of misunderstandings, or simply stumbling into the wrong people, arts festivals bring the visuals that just makes one stop, think, enjoy, or question without having to agonize about the implications of this or that statement or comment. Hopefully, this exhibit will tour far and wide, and comes to the US, and not just to NYC but to the deepest corners of the country where there may not be all the biggest museums, where Moroccans or other Africans are unheard of, where everything people know about African countries is from the news and the Internet, and where there is an opportunity to make the biggest impact simply by appearing, being, and allowing the communities to enjoy and to ask for more. Conversations build bridges, but arts open doors, and hearts. Morocco is increasingly in the best possible place to do both.

Rabat – Recalling the increasing number of countries that have withdrawn their recognition of the Polisario Front-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), the Argentinian Independent news agency, Total News, said that many nations across the world have become aware of the danger posed by the separatist group. In a publication posted on March 2 under the title, “ the isolation of Polisario in constant growth on the international scene,” the news agency explains in depth how the isolation of the separatist movement has become notable on the continent and internationally, where the separatist group continues to lose its few remaining supporters. “With the recent decision of the Republic of Zambia, there are 36 African countries that have withdrawn their recognition to the false state of the SADR,” wrote the publication’s author, Alberto Carlos Agozino. On March 1, Zambia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Malanji reaffirmed that his country has severed all ties with the so-called SADR. The Zambian official, who joined Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita at a press conference in Rabat, said that “Lusaka no longer maintains bilateral relations with SADR.” Referring to the separatist group’s core ideological beliefs that seek to undermine the integrity and sovereignty of nations, the Argentinian source said that many countries have become aware of the “the danger of separatism and [how it can affect] the stability of the world.” These countries, according to Total News, “have begun to reconsider their relations with the groups, who use their ideologies as a pretext to justify their activities.” Agozino also emphasized that several nations have managed to decode the separatists’ group motives, especially on the African continent, where Moroccan diplomacy has led to increasing support from several countries for the Moroccan position on the Western Sahara conflict, based in part on the personal diplomacy of King Mohammad VI. Total News added, “At the beginning of 2017, Morocco returned to the African Union, the only international organization where the Polisario enjoyed some recognition.” Referring to King Mohammed VI’s Migration Agenda which is intended to gain stability for immigration on the continent, Argentina’s independent news agency said that this move “reflects Morocco’s leadership in African affairs.” In his analysis, Agozino, who is also the author of “Geopolitics of the Sahara and the Sahel,” emphasizes that the influence of Morocco’s diplomacy is not limited just to Africa, but extends to other parts of the world. “Morocco has established diplomatic relations with Cuba,” which earlier had supported Polisario during the long rule of its former president, Fidel Castro The tension between the two countries goes back to the 1960s when Cuba chose to side with Algeria on the Sahara issue, sending their military troops to Algiers during its conflict with Morocco that later became known as the “Sand War.” In April 2017, King Mohammed VI and his royal family spent a vacation in Cuba. The vacation, however, raised the front’s fear about a loss of influence and support. According to Total News, “the establishment of direct links between Rabat and Havana, and the development of an increasing economic cooperation between both government put in check the ties between Cubans and Polisario.” Agozinio, who is also a professor at the John F. Kennedy University in Buenos Aires, concluded his analysis by saying that the growing isolation of the Polisario Front may lead it to adopt a more radical position at the international level. But many countries have developed a fuller understanding of the decades-long conflict in Western Sahara and the intentions of the Polisario Front.

The broad strategy, according to the study, will constitute a qualitative leap in the protection and advancement of cultural heritage in the kingdom through the strengthening of administrative and technical provisions relating to conservation, preservation, site excavation and development. The Ministry is promising a higher level of consistency in its preservation oversight role. Additionally, the strategy also integrates new internationally recognized concepts of cultural heritage, said the ministry in a statement released by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The ministry is also emphasizing the importance of decree 2.17.664, which classifies the archaeological site Jebel Irhoud as an official national heritage site. Jebel Irhoud is where archaeologists discovered the oldest remains of Homosapiens in June 2017. The decree gives the ministry significant oversight responsibility to protect the archaeological site as excavation work continues. Research work and experiments at the site now require authorization from the Ministry of Culture and can only be carried out under the supervision of the same department. The ministry statement also noted a draft decree which is currently being developed that would add the Amridil Kasbah located in Ouarzazate to the list of national heritage sites. The decree also seeks to include other sites including Noul Lamta in the rural town of Asrir in Guelmim Province, the Kasbah of Ghalian in Tangier, the archaeological site Zilil in the Had Gharbia commune, the Gulf of Tangier, and the Medina of Taza. The Ministry expects these ambitious new policies for identifying, protecting and promoting these important cultural resources will be a driving force for economic development and cultural appreciation efforts, as well as an essential element of genuine sustainable development.

Rabat – They call him “the bad boy”, in reference to his troublesome past. He calls himself “the best, the number one, the absolute best.” Badr Hari, one of the most celebrated kickboxing heavyweight fighters, was facing yesterday Hesday Gerges, a rematch that fans had been waiting for nearly eight years.  For Badr’s fans, this was finally the opportunity to show that he, not Hesday, deserved to win their first confrontation in 2010 when judges decided to disqualify Badr for giving a non-reglementary punch to a fallen Hesday. So this was no traditional heavyweights’ fight; it was the epic second encounter of two wounded lions excited at the prospect of finally settling a common unfinished business, of ending eight years of speculations, of finally deciding who between Badr and Hesday is the best. But while Badr came to “beat Hesday up, win more fans, and prove that he is in shape and the best”, Hesday came to prove that he deserved the win he got nearly eight years ago, “to make Badr quit”. No wonder the confrontation turned out to be what it was, what was expected: a scene of “two animals trying to kill each other,” as Hesday himself put it before the fight. But yesterday in Rotterdam, like on countless other occasions, it was Badr who won. And this time, his victory (29-28, 30-27, 30-27, 30-27, 30-27) was unanimously accepted by judges, thus settling down long-running speculations. Badr ot what he’s always wanted: to be acknowledged as the best. When handed the microphone to say what his emotional state was after a major win, Badr, with all his might in his fatigued state, shouted: “Morocco, I love you.” He then went on to spill a litany of countries to which he feels some sense of attachment. “The Netherlands I love you; Italy, I love you; America I love you; Porto Rico, I love you.” He briefly stopped. Wild with emotions, pensive, tired but explosive, he added, with particular attachment: “But I love Morocco the most.”  At which point Moroccan fans in the audience felt like kissing the heavens, ecstatic and uproarious as the hero they had come to support showed them that their love mattered to him, that their presence was his best motivation. “As people know, I don’t lose revenge,” he said, referencing his painful experience during the pair’s encounter in 2010. “When you give me a second chance, I beat you up.” But despite the almost explosive self-confidence and the not-so-ideal deeds outside out of the ring for which he is notorious, Badr usually comes across as a likable guy, always ready to acknowledge, in that “exotic” simile that is his landmark, his opponents’ qualities. “Hesday is no easy guy. He has a big heart. But tonight my heart was bigger.” After expressing his “big” and unconditional love for Morocco, Badr thanked all his personal fans and Kickboxing fans for believing in him, Glory 51 for allowing him to “come back.” He also thanked his family and friends, and especially his father, ending his victory speech in darija,  with Moroccan fans cheering him like a national hero–“their Badr.” On Friday, when Badr announced his “big fight” with Hesday on Facebook, a fan commented: “I know this will be a piece of cake for you Badr. We know you will win. Go get Rico after this. We want Rico.” After Badr’s victory on Saturday night, some fans in the audience were also shouting “Rico”, showing that, like the fan on Facebook, they are still harboring enormous grudges against the person who “humiliated” their star in December 2016. Glory 51, the Rotterdam-based Kickboxing giant, is said to be working on arranging a rematch between Badr Hari and Rico Verhoeven “very soon”. When asked about his message to Rico, Badr said: “tonight’s fight is his message.”

Rabat – Driss Jettou and the Court of Auditors is set to audit seven Casablanca-based promotion and development companies, reports Assabah daily in its weekend edition. The first visits by the Court of Auditors are scheduled in the coming days. This is the first time in ten years that these companies will be subjected to an audit. The first company, Casablanca Aménagement, was created in October 2008. Three other companies were established soon after. The last three of the seven, Casa Heritage, Casa Events and Animation and Casa Prestation, were launched in April 2015. According to Assabah, the seven companies have faced controversy and criticism since their inception, especially among members of the city council, who accuse the companies of encroaching on the prerogatives of the municipality. Recently, the city’s complaints are directed at the companies’ allowances and deficiencies in human resource management. According to the same source, these companies have never submitted reports of their activities to the city council. The municipality also notes that periodic boards of directors reports from the respective firms have never been submitted, as required in Article 131 of the laws governing communes.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – President of the Africa Commission and south-south of the General Confederation of Enterprises in Morocco (CGEM), Abdou Diop, discusses Morocco’s adhesion to ECOWAS and the efforts carried by the CGEM in this regard. While a second impact study is scheduled to take place mid-March, CGEM has shown a great desire to collaborate with the West African neighbors.  “We will have a meeting with the Federation of West African Employers’ Association (FWAEA), which is now presided by the Ivory Coast,” said Diop in an interview that will air this weekend. “A certain number of missions will also take place in four countries in the following weeks: Nigeria, Senegal, Ivory Coast, and Ghana,” he explained. These four countries haven’t been chosen at random, as they are the most powerful economies in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). He reminds that the General Confederation of Enterprises in Morocco, known under its French acronym, “has met multiple patronages during the African-European Union forum in Abidjan. So there are multiple actions. However, it is a continuous process, but it’s insufficient.” According to him, a multichannel communication must involve think tanks, academics, and civil society.  Following its readmission into the African Union in January 2017, Morocco applied to join ECOWAS. Alasanne Ouattara, the Ivory Coast President, announced in June of last year that Morocco’s request has been approved in principle despite it being a North African country; however, ECOWAS leaders asserted that the implications that Morocco’s membership would carry need to be considered before the kingdom can formally join.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – March 2 is “She Decides Day”, a broad movement aiming to ensure women’s reproductive rights.  On January 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump issued a Memorandum that expanded the Mexico City Policy, a government policy also known as the Global Gag Rule that blocks federal funding for non-governmental organizations that provide abortion counseling or referrals, or advocate to expand abortion services or to decriminalize abortions.   Lilianne Ploumen, Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, launched the “She Decides” movement on January 24, urging global support for the initiative to which the Dutch government contributed a sum of 29 million dollars.   On March 2 of 2017, the international conference on She Decides was held in Brussels and was attended by various actors, governments, UN organizations, and civil society organizations, with a vision to form a broad coalition that promotes sexual and reproductive health and family planning.  “She Decides Whether, When, and With Whom,” states the movement’s slogan, reflecting its aim to promote, provide, protect, and enhance the fundamental rights of girls and women around the world, including the right to choose what they do with their bodies and the right to health, as these affect women’s personal development participation in society, their livelihood, and their communities’ development.  “She Decides means that every girl and every woman can safely exercise her right to decide for herself what she does with her body, who she shares her body with and whether she wants to have children. She must have access to education and information about her body and her options, modern contraception, and safe abortion,” affirms the She Decides website.  This growing movement unites the efforts, drive, anger, and influence of people who hope to ensure that every girl and woman has access to quality care that she needs without fear, judgment, or question, which includes citizens, businesses, governments, parliamentarians, grassroots activists, health and legal professionals, NGOs, etc.  In the Moroccan context, Article 453 of the penal code mandates that abortions should only be permissible when the mother’s life is at stake. However, this does not stop abortions from happening illegally and under unsafe conditions.  In 2016, the Moroccan Association for the Fight against Clandestine Abortion reported that 800 abortions were performed daily in the kingdom, adding up to an estimate of 220,000 abortions yearly.  Following this statistic, King Mohammed VI ordered the government to reform abortion laws; sure enough, in June 2016 the Government’s Council adopted a bill that amended the law to allow abortions in cases of rape, incest, and birth defects.  However, two years after its adoption, the bill seems to have sunk into oblivion. Chafik Chraibi, founder of the Moroccan Association for the Fight against Clandestine Abortions, recently sent a letter to Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, reminding him of the urgency of this law, and of the fact that he was the first one to open the parliament’s doors for this discussion despite his party’s opposition.  “Being a doctor and a psychiatrist, he knows better than anyone the physical and psychological consequences of an unwanted pregnancy. But I haven’t heard from him in three weeks,” explained Chraibi in an interview with Medias 24. In another interview with Maghreb Voices, Chraibi declared that the delay, counterproductively, kills lives every day given the fact that abortions are more prominent in countries where it is illegal, according to him. “Just because I have the remedy doesn’t mean that I will make myself sick,” explained the gynecologist and social activist.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat – Newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum has reported a study provided it by “Droit &amp; Justice,” an organization specializing in promoting “Rule of Law” in Morocco, showing a record of 30,000 marriage contracts of female minors in Morocco. Marriage contracts belonging to female minors in Morocco reached 230,000 contracts in 2015, increasing by 10.2 percent compared to the year 2007, which recorded 29,847 contracts. There were 33,253 contracts in 2009 and 35,152 in 2013, making up 30,000 marriage contacts of females under the age of eighteen in Morocco, according to the same source. The study shows that 98.47 percent of married female minors are unemployed: 46,210 girls against 1,53 women in the workforce. The study shows Moroccan girls who enter wedlock before the legal age of marriage to be the most prone to domestic violence, added Akhbar Al Yaoum. Akhbar Al Yaoum emphasizes that the study conducted by “Droit &amp; Justice” shows that marriage requests belonging to females are higher than males by a rate of 99.31 percent; there were more than 466,000 requests for the marriage of female minors, against 326 requests of males. 48.99 percent of marriage requests of female minors were rejected and 420,000 requests were accepted. The increase of marriage of minors in Morocco goes back to the existing influence of traditional customs and to a crisis of deteriorated values, says “Droit &amp; Justice”. Despite the 2004-Moudawana’s (family code) article 20 that illegalizes the marriage of Moroccan citizens under the age of 18, the phenomenon in question is ever-increasing, noted “Droit &amp; Justice.”

In 2017, nearly 7,000 Moroccan doctors practiced medicine in France, 6,510 of which were regular activity and 430 intermittent, representing 15.6 percent of foreign-born doctors in these same respective categories practicing in French institutions. Women represent 32 percent of Moroccan doctors in France, compared to 57 percent of those born in the EU. Most of the Moroccan doctors practicing in France have graduated there. Those who studied in Morocco represent only 19.3 percent, a similar number for Tunisian doctors who studied in their homeland and work in France. This percentage, however, was much higher among Algerians at 37.5 percent. Trends Over a Decade  Between 2007 and 2017, the share of Moroccans in the population of foreign-born doctors fell slightly, from 11.5 percent to 10.7 percent, including retired doctors. Most Maghrebian doctors in France are over the age of 40 the study found. Physicians born abroad represent an important part of the French medical profession. In 2017, they totaled 58,441, or 20 percent of all physicians. The total membership of the Order of Physicians of France was 290,974 in the same year.

Rabat – The Denmark-based sporting ethics foundation, Play the Game, has criticized the international governing body of football (FIFA) for its “strong support in favor of an American World Cup.” In a publication published on Thursday under the title “Even before the process began it was biased,” the organization wrote that “the North American bid has taken a clear lead” in front of Morocco’s bid “for weighty financial and political reasons.” Quoting an expert in international football, the publication’s author, Steve Menary, said that FIFA has been biased before concerning the selection process for the 2026 World Cup. “Expanding the World Cup to 48 teams was another bias and a way to make sure that no-one else could bid but North America.” The publication continued, “To avoid the bid-rigging that dogged previous World Cups, FIFA is also allowing all of its members to vote on the 2026 World Cup rather than the executive committee.” However, the majority of the members who are set to vote during the World Cup selection process supported FIFA’s President during the 2016 FIFA leadership election, “because the Swiss football political proposed increasing the $1 million paid every four years through the Financial Assistance Programme to $5 million.” World Cup is a significant source of income for FIFA, from ticket sales to TV revenues. FIFA has likely determined that the North American bid will help the governing body increase its earnings if the American bid wins the right to host the 2026 World Cup. However, the governing body sponsors were obliged to support Russia’s bid to host the 2018 tournament “due to years of corruption stories dogging the world body.” The author of the publication emphasized that the North American bid chairman Sunil Gulati is taking advantage of the financial crisis that FIFA has been facing. On January 29, the American news daily The New York Times quoted Gulati saying “FIFA’s finances are heavily, heavily dependent on one event, the men’s World Cup,” said Mr. Gulati, the chairman of the North American bid. “So there’s a direct line between funding for programs around the world and what happens at the World Cup, and the revenue that’s generated.” The New York Times story added that the three-nation North American bid is forming a financial advantage due to a “broadcast agreement” signed in 2015 between FIFA and two American broadcasters: Fox and Telemundo. In December 2017, Infantino expressed his support for the North American bid, saying that, “Joint biddings are certainly positive.” FIFA’s president also said at a conference in Dubai, “Let me say one more thing, to have Canada, U.S., and Mexico coming together for a joint project, already this is a positive message,” reported The New York Times last year. Morocco Determined to Provide Tournament with All its needs Strongly supported by the Moroccan Government, Morocco’s 2026 Bid Committee has long been showing its determination to present a credible and thorough submission file to FIFA on March 16 in order to prove that it is able to organize enormous events like the World Cup. As only a few months remain before the mid-June decision of FIFA regarding the host of the tournament, the bid committee along with the Moroccan government and Morocco’s Royal Football Federation are giving their utmost to win the right to host the tournament. During the public launch of Morocco’s bid on January 23 in Casablanca, Moulay Hafid Elalamy, chairman of Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid committee, said that the Moroccan filing “will be of big importance.” Referring to Morocco’s unsuccessful bids, the Minister of Trade and Investment said that “this is another Morocco, not that of the 2010 bid […] FIFA knows that when we launch [infrastructure] projects, we deliver.” FIFA will choose the host country for the 2026 World Cup on the eve of the 2018 World Cup tournament in Russia, which includes participation by Morocco’s national team.

Rabat – Spanish authorities reported on Saturday that two sub-Saharan migrants died as they were trying to swim to the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. International media reported that two remains of sub-Saharan women were recovered by the Spanish Civil Guard. The migrants were on board a makeshift boat before they jumped into the sea trying to swim to the shore of Ceuta. Two other sub-Saharan migrants, who were on board the same boat have managed to reach Ceuta after they jumped off the boat. The group of migrants jumped into the water due to the bad weather that prevented their makeshift boat from approaching the Spanish enclave. On February 20, Morocco’s Royal Navy managed to rescue a total of 71 passengers, including 13 women from two different inflatable rafts. The majority of the men and women aboard were originally from sub-Saharan countries. The number of migrants using the sea route from Morocco to Spain has more than tripled between 2016-1017. Approximately 3,300 refugees crossed to Europe from Morocco in the first four months of 2017 compared to about a thousand in the same period in 2016. These numbers are expected to continue rising. “The flows arriving from Maghreb countries to Spain are very likely to increase in 2018,” the director of Europe’s border agency, Fabrice Leggeri told Reuters, adding that the flows were boosted by the use of fast boats capable of transporting large numbers of migrants.

More than 650,000 Britons visited Morocco in 2017, making the UK the second largest source of tourists in the kingdom after France. The prediction was one of the conclusions of a conference panel discussion entitled “Tourism sector in Morocco: Levers of competitiveness and challenges.” To achieve this goal, Jamal Younes Mikou, director of marketing and strategy at the Moroccan National Office of Tourism (ONMT) calls for the expansion of air links, especially to key provincial cities that are popular tourist hubs. “We need 200,000 new seats. We must launch new hotlines like Manchester-Tangier and Bristol-Fez,” says Mikou, as reported by Le Matin. ONMT’s director believes Morocco should promote new destinations as tourist attractions. “We should sell them new destinations such as Tangier and Fez and focus on tourism in Dakhla, he said. Victoria Bacon, Brand and Development Manager at the Association of British Travel Agencies said that Morocco should focus on the travel trends that interest British tourists. An overwhelming 70 percent of British tourists are interested in sustainable tourism. “The current trend in the UK is environmentally friendly and responsible tourism products that tourists want to purchase from locals.” Bacon also explained that 70 percent of British tourists book their flights online, an area in which “Morocco is not well positioned.” Mikou responded saying that the Office of Tourism is aware of this issue and that it is currently working on the enhancement of tourism sector online services. In 2017, the tourism sector generated MAD 70 billion, with strong growth in the number of non-resident tourist arrivals, overnight stays in Tourist Accommodation Establishments (EHTC) and foreign currency exchange earnings, announced the Ministry of Tourism. The number of visitors arriving to the kingdom reached 11.35 million in 2017, a ten percent increase from 2016.

Rabat – When judges of the Luxembourg-based ECJ convened on 27 to deliver on the “legality” of EU-Morocco fisheries agreements, the overwhelming majority of European observers and legal experts were of the opinion that ECJ would not make the unwarranted step of meddling into political matters. But not only that: they also thought that ECJ judges would not, could not, possibly make a decision that would arouse the wrath of a strategic partner. However, on Tuesday this week, deaf to this sea of warnings, and in total disregard of the conclusions of a European Commission-sponsored study, ECJ judges ruled almost in favor of ECJ’s former Advisor General Wathelet Melchior’s early January ‘opinions’ that the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement, as it involves “waters adjacent to Western Sahara”, should be annulled. In its verdict, the ECJ said that the agreement “is valid in so far as it is not applicable to Western Sahara and adjacent waters.” Which, however intelligent a move to “distance” ECJ from Melchior’s call for annulling the deal, did echo the Belgian’s claim of territorial legitimacy, questioning Morocco’s rights over its southern provinces. This did not, however, alarm relevant Moroccan authorities who, right after ECJ’s ruling, announced that the Kingdom would reiterate its commitment to its EU partners, and that the ruling would in no manner whatsoever affect the strategic and longstanding partnership between Morocco and the E.U. “ECJ did not clearly mention a ban,” said Moroccan Minister of agriculture Azziz Akhannouch, later explaining that the two parties, Morocco and the EU, would maintain their relationships. Nasser Bourita, Moroccan minister of foreign affairs, made similar remarks in a recent interview. “Nothing in the ECJ ruling challenges the political legitimacy of Morocco to conclude agreements regarding the Moroccan Sahara with the EU,” he said, adding that the court had distanced itself from the opinions of its Advocate general who had called for the agreement to be annulled. So, days after ECJ’s obviously biased ruling, Moroccan officials had a different reading, as they chose to tenaciously commit themselves to a relationship which the other party’s highest judicial body was already questioning. No Sahara, No Deal? But after what we might now call a period of evaluation and hedging, like a student anxiously considering options of a multiple choice quiz before committing to one, Moroccan officials are now toughening their stance, they seem to have finally located the right option. They are now saying what observers had expected them to say right after the ruling: Morocco is not ready to commit to a partnership that does not respect its territorial integrity. At a government council on Thursday this week, Moroccan ministers, upon thoroughly evaluating the meaning and potential ramifications of renewing the fisheries deal under the condition that “it is not applicable to Western Sahara and its adjacent waters”, came to the conclusion that any renewed agreement that would not be applicable to Western Sahara is to be declined. In his summary of the government’s position, spokesperson Mustapha EL Khalifi said the government’s position is to only engage with deals and agreements that respect the country’s national integrity. He said that although Morocco is keen on its strategic partnership with the EU, it will allow no one to question or challenge its national borders. So: ‘No Sahara, no deal.’ But what happened? Why now? And can this toughening of Morocco’s position affect subsequent rulings, hence forcing the EU to compromise on its court’s decision? To be sure, Morocco’s recent move was predictable enough , for anyone with an inch of knowledge of international affairs would know this fundamental truth: although alliances are not particularly binding, failing to satisfy a strategic partner does come with severe consequences. But more importantly, in international politics, “betrayals” have a steeper price when the other party has considerable bargaining power. And Morocco does have huge bargaining power vis-à-vis its European partners. On terrorism and immigration, for example, the kingdom has been a staunch and indefatigable ally, sharing intelligence and thwarting plans of terrorist attacks targeting European cities. As for the fisheries agreement in question in this particular case, the European Commission acknowledged that the agreement is “vitally important.” “For the EU, the need is to keep an instrument supporting in-depth cooperation with an important player in ocean governance”, said a study initiated by EU’s highest institutional body, concluding that: “For EU shipowners, there is still a need for fishing opportunities in the Morocco fishing zone. This need could even increase given Brexit.” In Brussels, before the ECJ’s unwarranted verdict on 27 February, the crushing majority of European MPs were forthcoming about how indispensable and crucial Morocco has been in helping Europe face many of its recent challenges. Morocco is not only an economic partner, they said. The Kingdom is, above all else, the EU’s most reliable option to “maintain stability and security” in EU’s southern borders and in large parts of the Mediterranean. “Given all these positive developments,” a member of the European parliament wrote prior to the ECJ’s verdict, “the strategic partnership between the EU and Morocco, which started as early as 1960, should not be undermined by certain lobbying groups, willing to use the existing legal void to act against the Union’s best interests.” But we’re long passed that. The verdict has been delivered. Which leaves the Kingdom with only one effective move: make it abundantly clear to the EU that alliances in international affairs are like personal relationships: betrayals have consequences. Now, that does not mean shutting the EU off or boycotting any prospects of return to normalcy (the old terms of the agreement). Rather, what it means is that Moroccan officials should—as they have already started—let the EU know that they have no intention of sitting at a biased negotiation table. Or, asI said in a recent piece, Morocco, however affected by any prospects of escalations of hostilities with the EU, can turn to other partners (China, for example) for the exploitation of its stupendous sea products. As for Europe, losing Morocco’s partnership, and at this particularly crisis-laden time, would be akin to self-immolation. This is no rocket science. In fact, it is an elementary principle of international relations. It is called reciprocity: “You scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours.” Moroccan officials should make sure that their EU counterparts understand that.

Rabat – A new tragedy has shaken the city of Jerada. A 25-year old man was killed on Thursday after being shocked by a compressor in the abandoned Sidi Boubker mine in the province of Jerada, home to several protests since the death of three other local miners. Local authorities confirmed the news to Moroccan news website Le360. The compressor, which was in bad condition, did not support the extraction loads, according to local authorities. This incident is the fourth of its kind in the Jerada province.  At the end of 2017, two brothers were killed in a tunnel accident, 85 meters (90 yards) below ground.The third victim was killed under the same circumstances in an abandoned mine in Jerada, sparking a wave of protests to decry social disparities that lead thousands of people to risk their lives mining in Jerada. The death of the most recent victim came only a few days after the government spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said that the cabinet is “currently at an advanced stage to honor its commitments and implement them in the province of Jerada.” After the weekly cabinet meeting on Thursday, El Khalfi told the press that “efforts on the ground [have] resulted in the implementation of a number of measures since the visits made to the province by several ministers.” On February 10, Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani visited the city of Oujda with a delegation of officials and ministers to meet regional and local leaders and discuss measures to support the economic and social conditions of Jerada’s residents. During the meeting, El Othmani promised the suspension of illegal mining activities in the region.

Rabat – Amal Houari, a Moroccan journalist and alleged victim of sexual assault has broken her silence and said that she never lodged a complaint against detained journalist Taoufik Bouachrine, who is facing charges for his alleged sexual misconduct. In a Facebook publication, Houari wrote on Friday that Bouachrine has never tried nor attempted to rape her. Contacted by Moroccan news outlets after she was questioned by the police on Saturday, February 24, one day after the arrest of Bouachrine. Houari refused to comment on the incident before his first trial that is scheduled to take place March 8. Several other women have reportedly lodged complaints against Bouachrine, who is facing charges for several alleged crimes, including “human trafficking, the exploitation of people in need, and the abuse of power for sexual purposes,” according to a statement by the Public Prosecutor. Bouachrine is also suspected of other crimes, including “violent rape and attempted rape.” The prosecutor’s communiqué added that there are “nearly 50 tapes of the sexual assault incidents recorded on a hard disk and a digital video recorder.” Bouachrine was arrested on February 23 at the headquarters of Akhbar Al-Yaoum. Recently, the suspect made a statement from the Ain El Borja prison in Casablanca, where he denounced the sexual assault charges that he is facing. Bouachrine called his arrest the result of “a conspiracy that he will reveal before the court on his trial, which is scheduled to take place on March 8. Bouachrine added that he is “certain” that “King Mohammed VI will not allow, in any way, [anyone] to tarnish the reputation of a citizen and a journalist, and to harm his rights and threaten his life and the life of his family by defaming him in the media.”

Rabat – During  Foreign Affairs Committee meeting, held on Thursday, March 1, Spain’s ruling Popular Party (PP) rejected two separatist motions in opposition to the EU-Morocco Fisheries Agreement. The hostile motions were suggested by the leftist Spanish political coalition, Podemos-Compromís. The motions sought to urge the European Union and all authorities to ensure compliance with the EU Court of Justice (ECJ), which decided on February 27, that the EU-Morocco fisheries deal “is valid in so far as it is not applicable to Western Sahara [and] to its adjacent waters.” The parties also suggested that the Spanish government has to express its concerns over the fisheries and agriculture agreements signed between the EU and Morocco, reported Spanish news outlet Cuatro. The Spanish government, according to the coalition, needs to stand against “the exploitation of the natural resources of Western Sahara by European companies, which are violating the international law.” The deputy spokesman of the conservative party, Pedro Agramunt, said that the adoption of such an institutional declaration “would be very counterproductive” for technical contacts between the EU and Morocco. The motions, according to Agramunt, would even “lead to a political crisis with Morocco.” “Spain as a neighboring country would be affected,” added the Spanish official. On Thursday, Lidia Senra and Estefania Torres, two Spanish members of parliament called on the European Union to “exclude Western Sahara from its fisheries agreement with Morocco,” reported Spanish news agency EFE. “The EU must exclude Western Sahara from its next agreement with Morocco,” demanded Torres, who also demanded the signing of a bilateral agreement between the EU and Western Sahara, “which must legally control its waters, as recognized by the Court of Justice and the EU in its recent ruling,” said the parliamentarians. Morocco has already made its position clear on this issue, reaffirming that Morocco always strives to preserve its “sovereignty, unity, and belonging to its southern provinces,” in all international agreements. Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita also responded to the ECJ ruling, emphasizing that “nothing in the [ECJ’s] verdict challenges the political legitimacy of Morocco to  conclude agreements regarding the Moroccan Sahara with the EU.” This is not the first time Podemos made a separatist remark regarding the Western Sahara issue. In February, a parliamentarian from the Podemos coalition urged Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs Alfonso Dastis to use diplomatic powers to “prevent” multinational companies from exploiting the natural resources of a marine area that is considered a “cetacean sanctuary.” The Podemos parliamentarian claimed that the waters between the cities of Tan-Tan and Sidi, where oil exploration projects are carried out by the Italian company, ENI, belong to the area ‘taken away from the Sahrawi people.” In response to the accusations made by the MP against Morocco, Dastis said that Morocco and Spain have not delineated their waters. Instead, both countries are acting in accordance with standard equidistance principles. The minister reinforced his statement by emphasizing that applying this criterion would further prove that the waters are undoubtedly within the jurisdiction of Morocco.

Rabat – The Moroccan Capital Markets Authority (AMMC) announced that the Abu Dhabi Fund For Development (ADFD) has sold 35,517 Ciments du Maroc shares to the central market at a unit price of MAD 1,660, decreasing the ownership threshold to 5 percent. As a result of this transaction, which took place February 21,  ADFD  now holds 691,160 Ciments du Maroc shares, or 4.79 percent of the capital, according to a  statement from Casablanca’s stocks, issued March 1. ADFD is an autonomous institution established by the Government of Abu Dhabi in July 1971 and located in Abu Dhabi. Its main purpose is to support developing countries. Starting 1974, ADFD managed UAE government grants totaling AED 5.5 billion across 55 projects in Morocco. The fund has provided the country with approximately AED 3.5 billion in loans to finance 17 projects across the transport, housing, water, healthcare, and education sectors. During 2016, the stagnation of the Moroccan cement market highlighted the crisis of the construction industry. Pushed by a severe drop in national economic growth, the cement market closed the year with a 0.70 percent decrease in domestic sales. While sales showed a 5.9 percent increase during the beginning of 2016, they tumbled in subsequent quarters, canceling out the initial growth with three major declines: 10.8 percent for June, 19.1 percent for September, and 12.5 percent for December. However, in July 2017 the cement market experienced a sursprising surge of sales, only to fall in August by 10.33 percent to 1.28 million tons against 1.31 percent in the same month of 2016, following the decline in construction activity.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat – Moroccan Salafist Hammad Kabbaj shown his support for the director of the newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum, Taoufik Bouachrine, who was recently arrested on charges of “sexual assault and human trafficking.” On Wednesday, February 28, Hammad Kabbaj explained his reasons for siding with Bouachrine, after listening to the press conference held in journalist’s defense. Kabbaj linked his support to the “unjust” manner with which Bouachrine was treated. He explains: “No Moroccan citizen deserves to be treated in such an oppressive manner, let alone an intellectual and cultivated journalist like Bouachrine.” “[Bouachrine] is one of the most prominent activists who strive for Morocco’s democratic development […] as he is one of the leading advocates who work for the precise application of Morocco’s Constitution of 2011. Kabbaj emphasized that Bouachrine’s activism should be met with support and encouragement rather than repression and shame, and that if citizens like Bouachrine were to ever appear before court in developed countries, they would be provided with better conditions. Kabbaj went to add that though he cannot state his opinion about the details of the charges held against Bouachrine, he can raise some observations about the case.  “Some [of the charges] are exaggerated and this raises questions about the timing and circumstances [of the charges].” Kabbaj said that he hopes the judiciary will perform its duty according to the law and preserve Bouachrine’s rights and position. Heconcluded his statement saying, “I hereby pronounce my full support for the professor Bouachrine and I stand by to participate in all forms of judicial procedures to preserve his constitutional rights.” Bouachrine was put in custody on February 24, after his previous employees filed complaints for sexual assault and human trafficking allegations. Bouachrine will appear before the Criminal Chamber on March 8.

Rabat – With its numerous ongoing intra and inter-states conflicts, the MENA region is generally seen as a highly unstable hub of wars and confrontations, demonstrated by its ranking as the world’s most violent region by the Institute for Economics and Peace in its most recent Global Peace Index. Such a climate of instability requires that governments engage in deep military investments to defend disputed territorial integrity, sustain national security, deter increasing terrorist threats, and maintain a strong image, in the face of power rivalries among many of the region’s states. Despite mounting security challenges and constant insurgencies, the MENA region is still home to some of the best armies in the world, as evidenced by the increasingly powerful military forces in Turkey, Israel, and Iran. According to the most recent Global Firepower (GFP) index, Morocco can take pride in its military power, which is among the strongest in the MENA region. The GFP, which provides a comprehensive assessment of countries “military might, as it entails criteria such as military budget, home-based security industry, active manpower, quality of military equipment, sailors and pilots that can be relied on in case of emergency, diverse range in the defense arsenal, etc, has ranked Morocco 54th strongest army in the world, and 8th in the MENA region. Morocco, whose active personnel is estimated at 195,000 (175,000 army personnel, 13,000 in the Royal Air Force and 7,800 in the navy) also possesses the 5th largest armed forces in the MENA region. Moreover, the kingdom’s GFP score at 0.8702 (with low scores indicating military might) illustrates its undisputed experience in securing stability and security in an otherwise conflict-torn region, observers. However, Morocco’s one weakness remains its small military budget. With a current defense budget of  USD3.5 billion, Morocco is one of the lowest spenders in the region; comparatively,Saudi Arabia spends  USD76.7 billion on its military, a number greater than that of the next five largest MENA spenders combined. According to recent reports, Morocco is planning to engage in a comprehensive program of military equipment recapitalisation. The defense budget is set to increase to $3.9 bn by 2022, while a number of surface-to-air missiles, fighters, and other state-of-the art military equipment were recently purchased, as demonstrated by the kingdom’s acquisition of the China-made Sky Dragon 50–the latest generation of air defense system. “In the next five years, Morocco’s goal is to acquire eight GM radars, 16 stations for long-range radars, and several other stations for medium and low-range radars,” military expert Abdelhamid Harifi recently told the press, underlining that Morocco possesses some of the best-performing F16s in the region.  Here is Forbes’ ranking based on the GFP index: 10) United Arab Emirates Active Personnel: 63,000. 2017 budget: unknown. GFP score: 0.9087 9) Iraq Active Personnel: 64,000. 2017 budget: $19.3bn. GFP score: 0.8961 8) Morocco Active Personnel: 195,000. 2017 Budget: $3.5bn. GFP score: 0.8702 7) Syria Active Personnel: 142,500. 2017 budget: unknown.

Rabat – Electricity consumption rose by 4.5 percent  at the end of 2017, up by 1.9 percent recorded  at the end of 2016, amounting for the largest increase in five years. This growth is mainly due to the country’s socio-economic development, including infrastructure projects, programs to increase access to electricity and drinking water in rural areas and  sector strategies. Coping with the increased demand, the production of electrical energy improved by 3.4 percent  at the end of 2017, following a rise of 3.1 percent  in 2016,  according to figures published by the Department of Studies and Financial Forecasts (DEPF), under the Ministry of Economy and Finance. This increase was due to the good performance of the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) which rose by 3.4 percent. Private production also increased by 2.4 percent in 2017. This upward trend was also recorded in the volume of imports from Spain, which also increased at a rate of 14.5 percent. As a result, net energy demand rose 5.1 percent last year, after rising 2.9 percent a year earlier. This is apparent from According to the DEPF, this trend is due to the strengthening of sales of very high, medium and high voltage energy by 5 percent, compared to 1.2 percent a year earlier, according to the same source. Similarly, the consumption of low-voltage energy, mainly in households, improved by 3 percent at the end of 2017. In terms of prices, the year 2017 saw increases that affected several cities, mainly Casablanca, Tangier and  Jerada. Lydec, the company managing water, electricity and sanitation in Casablanca, raised electricity prices in the city early 2017.  It has also to create an exemption for the city’s most vulnerable citizens. Lydec explained  that this sudden rise of prices has been by the Delegated Management Committee, which reports to City Council and abides by the 2014 contract signed between the ONEE and the State.

Rabat – In the video published on Casa Aislado’s Twitter account, a police officer throws a young man onto the floor, kicks and punches him aggressively before picking up a chair and aiming at him. Numerous tweeps criticized such a violent act, calling it “an act out of racism” while others argued that the lack of context made it hard to determine whether such an act was racist or defensive.

Rabat – France is stepping up efforts to improve French student’s English language skills to help them “act and move in globalization,” according to French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. In a tweet posted on February 23, the French official wrote, “To master English,  is to better control one’s future.” Philippe said that the French government will provide students with help to pass internationally recognized English language tests, including TOEIC, Cambridge, and IELTS.   Bien maîtriser l’anglais, c’est mieux maîtriser son avenir : chaque étudiant, à la fin de son lycée et au plus tard en fin de licence, aura passé un test de type TOEIC, Cambridge, IELTS, financé par l’État. #TeamFranceExport pic.twitter.com/X2kvSe35Vk — Edouard Philippe (@EPhilippePM) February 23, 2018  “Every student will have to pass TOEIC, Cambridge, and IELTS tests at the end of high school and at the end of the bachelor’s degree.” According to the French Prime Minister, the tests will be “financed by the State.” Speaking in a press conference in EDHEC Business School, Philippe said that his country aims to “accelerate the transformation of learning.” “English is now the lingua franca. That’s how it is. You have to speak English if you want to act and move in globalization,” said the French official. The Prime Minister said that these measures would offer more help to “French people go and conquer the world.” In 2014 and 2015, French students performed poorly in a worldwide English proficiency ranking, according to a report by international language training firm Education First. Reporting on the Education First’s 2015 report, The Local, said that “France finished 37th out of 70 countries in the new world ranking.” In March 2013, there was a wave of demonstrations against a bill that sought more English-medium courses at university level in France. At the time, the government was targeting more international students from emerging countries who generally prefer English-medium universities. However, many students and academics protested against what they viewed as an “Americanization disguised as globalization.”

Rabat – Following some hostile responses at the 2018 African Union Summit, regarding the kingdom’s stance in the Western Sahara conflict, Morocco is ready to initiate a new counter-strategy. Morocco is determined to counter any hostility within the African Union and its bodies that could undermine its position on the four-decade-long Western Sahara conflict, according to Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum. Moroccan experts of African affairs are working on a strategy to defend Morocco’s interests in the AU and the Peace and Security Council, one of the most important organs of the pan-African bloc. During the 30th Summit of African Heads of State and Government, which took place in January, Algeria’s pro-separatist Commissioner for Peace and Security Ismail Chergui submitted a controversial report to the AU, asking the organization to urge Morocco to make certain decisions that would be detrimental to Morocco’s sovereignty in its Saharan provinces. In his report, Chergui asked AU to pressure Morocco to accept the return of the AU Mission for Western Sahara to the Moroccan southern city Laayoune, a demand that Morocco has strongly denounced. The pro-separatist document included statements contradictory to the historical and current positions of the UN and Morocco and calls upon the AU to create a human rights monitoring in Morocco’s southern provinces. With its return to the AU and its recent election to the Peace and Security Council, Morocco has successfully thwarted Algeria’s pro-separatist attempt to undermine its position on the conflict. At the end of the summit, Moussa Faki Mahamat, the Chairperson of the AU Commission, expressed the AU’s support for the United Nations, which has long been engaged in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict in Western Sahara. In its March 2 edition, Akhbar Al Yaoum reported that the Peace and Security Council has long been dominated by Algeria’s political agenda, but with Morocco’s election into the Peace and Security Council, the country is committed to balance and defend its interests.

Rabat –  Following an earlier delivery of 25,000 tons of phosphates to Tanzania, OCP Africa proceeded, on February 27, with delivering a much more substantial load of 32,000 tons of fertilizers to the Eastern African country. Far from being an isolated move, OCP Africa-Tanzania is another important step in the Moroccan giant’s goal of helping Africa attain its objectives of integrated and sustainable growth, with a particular emphasis on boosting agriculture and providing material and technical assistance to sub-Saharan African farmers, governments, and agricultural entrepreneurs. OCP Africa, in the framework of its African venture, has developed a strategic partnership with Tanzanian government and TFC (Tanzanian Fertilizer Company), the entity in charge of facilitating access to agriculture-related products in the country. OCP is also interested in extending its partnership to Tanzania Fertilizer Regulation Authority, as well as Mlingano Agricultural Research Institute, especially in technical assistance and training. With the Agricultural Research Institute, OCP is seeking to bring its expertise, and help Tanzania in its bid to develop a local-based agricultural industry, which entails boosting local expertise and area-specific fertilizers in order to help sustain and rekindle Tanzania’s existing potentials for producing maize and rice. OCP and Tanzania’s Agricultural Institute are particularly working on analyzing local soils, which they say would allow them to help provide local farmers with fertilizers and agricultural products adapted to each type of soil. In that regard, over 800 types of soil had been collected in 63 agro-ecological areas throughout Tanzania, which were then analyzed by OCP Africa and Tanzania’s Agricultural Institute experts. The second phase of soil-analysis is set to take place in the course of 2018, with a much bigger sample of 1400 types of soil. Together with the production of maize and rice already examined, this phase will also integrate feasibility studies regarding the production of potatoes and kindred products. With OCP Africa-Tanzania, Morocco, faithful to its plan of exporting its technical know-how as well as its proven experience to the Kingdom’s “African brothers”, envisions to help combat the prevailing lack of “informed agriculture” in the country, by not only providing fertilizers, but most essentially by providing the training and knowledge necessary for their optimal use. OCP hopes to promote an agriculture that is more productive, but also takes into account biological and ecological diversities, OCP-Africa said in a recent statement about its Tanzanian projects.

Rabat – The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) has decided to exceptionally promote two policemen in the Fez prefecture, after they were badly injured on duty on the morning of Wednesday, March 1. The two policemen were injured during an intervention mission to arrest ten members implicated in several crimes. The promotion of the two policemen recognizes their distinguished professional sense, as well as their selflessness and sacrifice in the performance of their duties, said the General Directorate of National Security in a statement. Following the decision, one policeman was promoted to brigadier general, while his colleague, who previously held the position of chief inspector of police was promoted to police officer grade, added the DGSN, emphasizing that the hospitalization expenses of the two cops were covered, and they will each receive a financial reward.

Rabat – An Eni-operated drilling vessel is heading for Morocco after being blocked by Turkish navy from exploring for gas off Cyprus, according to Offshore Energy Today. Saipem 12000, a drillship currently operating under the auspices of Italy’s energy giant Eni, was allegedly blocked by a two-week standoff with Turkish warships on Cypriot coasts, with Ankara accusing the operation of violating the rights of Turkish Cyprus, as well as warning the energy giant “not to overstep the mark” in the Mediterranean. In an announcement following the standoff with Turkish Navy, Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi explained that they were postponing exploration in Cyprus, adding that they would be “waiting for Turkish, Greek, Cyprus… diplomacy to find a solution.” He added that they would return to Cyprus when circumstances allow. Meanwhile, it should be noted that Eni’s choice of Morocco as safe haven was not an ad hoc decision, as the company, which had earlier reported having a drilling project in Morocco starting March 2018, would have in any case moved to the kingdom. Back in January, Eni had a deal with Chariot Oil and Gas, allowing the former to take over the Rabat Deep project from the latter. “This well will be closely watched by the industry as one of the larger prospects likely to be drilled in the world during 2018. The Rabat Deep Permits have an additional six leads in the same play which have the potential to be de-risked by the RD-1 well,” Chariot Oil and Gas announced late last January in a statement about Eni’s Rabat project. The statement added that “the JP-1 prospect will be spud in March 2018 using the Saipem-owned sixth generation ultra-deepwater drillship, the Saipem 12000.” The Saipem 12000 drilling vessel is set to arrive in Morocco by March 9.

Rabat – Forcibly deported from the USA late last December, Moroccan activist Siham Byah has said that the circumstances of her “inhumane” deportation point towards “a possible collusion between US and Moroccan authorities.”  Byah sees her deportation from America as a politically motivated vendetta, and an act of “political vengeance” aimed at “punishing” her for supporting social movements and human rights, both in Morocco and in the U.S. During a press conference yesterday in Rabat, the 40-year-old activist described her painful deportation memories, explaining that American authorities had first confiscated her residency permit in 2012, denied her basic rights on multiple occasions while still in the U.S., before finally deporting her, on December 28, “without due process and under direct instructions from Washington.” For Byah, her deportation from the U.S was a calculated move made possible through “coordination between US and Moroccan governments.” The whole story, she explained, is “politically motivated” and aims to “take revenge” on her for her support for the Rif movements, as well as her general “outspoken criticism and fearless activism,” adding that before being deported from the U.S, in July 2017, she had participated in two demonstrations in support of the Hirak Rif. Of her deportation, Byah said that she was lied to by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officials, denied family contact, and was made to board the plane handcuffed and with shackled wrists and ankles. Officials never told her why she’d been “chosen” for deportation, she said. Byah also seized the press conference opportunity to call upon U.S authorities to review the legality of her deportation, and to duly investigate the reasons for her mistreatments by American police. She urged American authorities to provide her eight-year-old Naseem –who has American nationality and is allegedly in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Family–with necessary psychological assistance

Rabat – Speaking at a press conference in Rabat, Zambia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Malanji reaffirmed on Thursday that his country has severed all ties with the Polisario Front-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). During a press conference co-chaired with the Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Bourita, the Zambian official said that “Lusaka no longer maintains bilateral relations with SADR. Lauding the bilateral ties between Morocco and Zambia, Malanji said that Zambian diplomatic missions “will inform countries and the international and regional organizations of this decisive break” with the Polisario Front. According to the Zambian official, the talks between both ministers of foreign affairs focused  “on the very good relations between Morocco and Zambia, which are expected to be reinforced in several areas, especially on  political and economic levels.” The diplomat also lauded King Mohammed VI “historic visit” to Zambia in February 2017. After Morocco’s official return to the African Union on January 31, 2017, King Mohammed VI began an African tour on February 1, 2017. The King’s tour started from the Republic of South Sudan and then continued into Ghana, Zambia, Guinea, and Cote d’Ivoire. During his visit to Zambia, King Mohammed VI co-chaired the signing ceremony of 19 partnership agreements with the Zambian leader Edgar Chagwa. After the King’s visit, Zambia’s Former Minister Harry Kalaba announced his country’s decision to withdraw its recognition of the self-proclaimed SADR. The announcement was made less than a month after Morocco’s return to the African Union and few days following King Mohammed VI’s first official visit to Zambia.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – A long-lost Nigerian masterpiece broke an African record at auction on Wednesday, February 28. Ben Enwonwu’s painting “Tutu,” lost for 40 years, sold for GBP 1.2 million at Bonhams International Auction House in London, setting a new record in Nigerian art. The event generated such interest that, in a world first, Bonhams live-streamed the auction to African audiences, hoping to engage eager bidders interested in bringing the painting back to the continent.  Initially expected to sell for between GBP 200,000 and 300,000, the painting sold for four times the estimate.  Bonham modern art director Giles Peppiatt called the portrait a Nigerian “national icon,” adding that it was “of huge cultural significance.” Following the brutal civil war between federal forces and Biafran separatists in the late 1960s, “Tutu” became a symbol of reconciliation. “Tutu” draws natural comparisons with the Da Vinci classic, each featuring a three-quarter profile of a young woman captured with an enigmatic expression. The woman behind Enwonwu’s iconic 1974 portrait is of Adetutu “Tutu” Ademiluyi, the princess of Ife in south-western Nigeria. She appears in traditional attire, gazing past the viewers outside the frame.  The painting’s cultural mystique grew over the course of its mysterious decades-long year disappearance. Last seen in 1975 at the Italian Embassy in Nigeria, “Tutu” reappeared late last year in a London apartment building.  Booker Prize-winning Nigerian poet and novelist Ben Okri likened the painting’s rediscovery to a “rare archaeological find,” declaring it the “most significant discovery in contemporary African art in over 50 years.” “It is a cause for celebration, a potentially transforming moment in the world of art.” Reflecting on the Enwonwu’s significance as a painter, Okri remarked, “He wasn’t just painting the girl, he was painting the whole tradition. It’s a symbol of hope and regeneration to Nigeria, it’s a symbol of the phoenix rising.” Ben Enwonwu is considered to be the father of Nigerian modernism and the nation’s most significant painter. He trained at Goldsmiths College, Oxford University, and the Slade art school in England during the 1940s.  Enwonwu painted not only African royalty, but also British royalty: he was commissioned to do a bronze sculpture of Queen Elizabeth II for her visit in 1956. He died in 1994 without knowing the whereabouts of “Tutu.” The painting’s reappearance sparked renewed interest in the life of the real Princess Tutu. Peppiatt hopes to learn more about the woman herself and is currently investigating various sources that say she is still alive in Lagos, Nigeria.

Rabat – On Wednesday, Morocco’s ambassador to the European Union (EU), Ahmed Reda Chami, reaffirmed the importance of the strategic EU-Morocco partnership in light of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling on the EU- Morocco fisheries deal. The Moroccan diplomat, was quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) saying that the court has confirmed the validity of the fisheries agreement between the EU and Morocco, and “distanced itself from the political opinion of its advocate general [Melchior Wathelet].” On Tuesday, the ECJ confirmed the validity of the fisheries agreement, separating the court opinion from specific ECJ members, such as Advocate General Melchior Wathelet, based Luxembourg-based ECJ, who said that the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement should be declared null and void because it includes Western Sahara. Chami told the press that the ECJ has crushed the goal of Polisario and its supporters, who were previously appealing the EU agreement with Morocco. “The determination and willingness of both parties to move forward transcend anything that is likely to strain their longstanding partnership,” said Chami. The Moroccan diplomat added that the EU and Morocco maintain contact in a “climate of serenity and trust” to tailor their agreements to the rulings of the European Court of Justice. Chami echoed a statement made by Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita, who told Le360, “nothing in the [ECJ’s] verdict challenges the political legitimacy of Morocco to conclude agreements regarding the Moroccan Sahara with the EU.” Backing Bourita’s argument, Chami said that Morocco will not accept any agreement that does not involve its southern provinces. Underscoring the importance of the agreements between the two parties, Chami said that the EU and Morocco share a strong desire to strengthen their partnership. “Beyond the commercial aspect, the Morocco-EU partnership is reinforced by various agreements at different levels,” including police cooperation with Interpol, migration, crisis management in the Mediterranean, security issues, and the fight against terrorism and extremism. Chami, who is also the president of the Morocco-EU friendship group in the European Parliament told MAP, “it is with a serenity that we can approach the next trade negotiations between the EU and Morocco.” In a joint statement issued after the ruling of the ECJ on Tuesday, February 27, Federica Mogherini, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice President of the European Commission, and Bourita “took note of the verdict handed today by the EU Court of Justice” on the fisheries deal between the two parties andhave agreed to further reinforce their political dialogue and preserve the stability of their trade relations. Fishery ties between Morocco and the European Union date back to 1988. Negotiated four years ago, the fisheries agreement provides annual permits without restriction, according to the European Union. Since that time, partnerships between the two entities have expanded to involve protocols from different fields, including trade activities. Morocco Keen on Preserving its Sovereignty During the government council meeting today, Morocco’s Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, stressed that Morocco always strives to preserve its “sovereignty, unity, and belonging to its southern provinces,” in whatever agreement the country signed. Commenting on the ECJ’s ruling, El Othmani said that this matter is “being followed by King Mohammed VI personally.” El Othmani noted public interest in this topic, adding that he has been following the matter with the Ministries of Agriculture and Foreign Affairs. The Moroccan head of government emphasized that the EU and Morocco are determined to preserve their partnership and its future. El Othmani added that Morocco “is flexible in negotiation, cooperation, and partnership and is proud that its international relations are diverse and balanced.”

Rabat – The  “#MeToo” campaign that has led numerous women to speak against sexual harassment in the US, is making its impact felt in Morocco. After the recent arrest of Taoufik Bouachrine, the director Akhbar Al Yaoum and Alyaoum24 news, new accusations of sexual harassment are shaking Moroccan newspaper Al Bayane. An employee for Al Bayane, a daily francophone Moroccan newspaper, has filed a complaint against an administrative and financial director of the company. The director, who also serves on the board of the publishing company, was tried on February 28, after police received a complaint sexual assault. His identity remains unknown. The Al Bayane and Bayane Al Yaoum board of directors, which affiliated with the Party of Progress and Socialism (PPS), released a statement refuting the claims. “The company Bayane SA, publisher of the daily Bayane Al Yaoum and Al Bayane was surprised by the initiative of an employee, who still works for the company and who still receives her monthly salary to file a complaint for sexual harassment against the administrative and financial director and member of the board of directors of the company.” While the identity of the alleged victim of sexual harassment was not revealed, the statement indicated that she worked “under the former administration,” and that she continues to come to work everyday and attend court hearings regarding her complaint against her administrator.”  The company stated that the plaintiff is merely taking advantage of  “a context that currently dominates the media and legal field,” referring to the Bouachrine case that has recently dominated the media. The statement also adds that her accusation has surprised everyone, including other employees of the company. “The complaint does not only affect the person who is the subject of the complaint, but the entire institution and the political formation it represents, something that we will not allow,” the statement continued. The board of directors of Al Bayane confirmed that they will not allow the complainant to tarnish the company and the party’s image. The same source said that the company has the right to resort to justice to defend its reputation and that of its executives.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat – Moroccan Higher Planning Commission (HCP) presents an analysis that shows an increase in industrial production by 0.1 percent in January 2018, with the exception of the oil refinery. The Moroccan Higher Planning Commission (HCP), who is in charge of economic, demographic, and social statistics released a report indicating the price indexes of industrial productions in each sector for January 2018. The information was then compared with statistics from December 2017. The report focuses on the price indexes of manufacturing industries, as well as energy and machinery products, and reveals an increase in the price index of industrial production. The cause of this is linked to the increased prices of manufacturing products. Manufacturing industries which included  food and beverages, clothing and textiles, shoes and leather, electrical equipment, plastic, and rubber products—increased by a total of 0.1 percent (the exception was leather clothing.) Non-metallic mineral products also saw an increase in prices by about 0.8 percent, while furniture manufacturing increased by 1.4 percent, textile manufacturing by 0.5 percent, leather and shoe manufacturing by 0.6 percent. Furniture manufacturing increased by 1.4 percent while metal fabrication (not including the production of machinery and equipment), and computer, electronic, and optics manufacturing all boosted by 0.3 percent. While tobacco manufacturing prices remained constant during both December 2017 and January 2018. As for non-metal based manufacturing prices, they increased by 0.8 percent. Metallurgy also increased by 0.2 percent while other manufacturing industries decreased by 0.6 percent.Woodworking (excluding furniture manufacturing), cork, and wood manufacturing, straw plaiting, and basketry all reduced by 0.9 percent. Extractive industries including hydrocarbons, metallic mineral extractions, and others remained and amounted to a total of MAD100,2 in December 2017, and in January 2018. Machinery equipment products (not elsewhere classified), automotive industries, and manufacturing of other transportation equipment all remained stable. Likewise, production and distribution of electric power and water distribution experienced no change and amounted to a total of  MAD 115,3. Pulp and paper industries, printing and digital media reproduction, chemical and pharmaceutical industry prices all remained constant.

Rabat – The TV channel 2M has been fined MAD 3 million by the High Authority of Audiovisual Communication (HACA) for excessive broadcasting of commercials. HACA penalized 2M for exaggerated and redundant broadcasting of commercials, exceeding the threshold authorized by the HACA for advertising on television, which is 16 minutes per hour. The decision was published in the official bulletin on February 27. For instance, HACA noted that 2M broadcasted on May 31, 2017, more than 27 minutes of advertising in one hour. Similarly, on June 21, 2017, 2M diffused more than 23 minutes of advertising. HACA also indicated that the TV channel exceeds the authorized interval between two advertisements, which is 20 minutes. The most watched Moroccan TV channel in the country has successively aired two advertisements in 50-second intervals. In total, the High Authority for Audiovisual Communication also said that 47 times 2M has exceeded the total duration of advertising allowed in one hour and 279 times the maximum period between two commercials, from May 27, 2016, to May 24, 2017. HACA said that it had already warned 2M against the same overruns during the months of Ramadan of 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. The fine will weigh heavily on 2M as the Minister of Communication, Mohamed El Aaraj, indicated in late 2017 that the  company has been suffering from a financial crisis since 2008. Mohamed El Wafy, Secretary-General of the 2M Staff Union, said that the crisis began in 2008, “because the state gave no money to the channel, which was fatal.” He indicated that in 2017 state aid to 2M has exceeded MAD 20 million, but the channel continues to suffer financially. According to the figures of the HACA and Marocmétrie, 2M remains the first channel in viewership, accounting for 34 percent of market share, while the SNRT, with its 7 channels, accounts only for 13 percent.

Rabat – On Monday, February 26th, Morocco’s 2026 World Cup Bid Committee met with a delegation from the Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) to discuss key elements of the country’s candidacy before it submits its formal application to host the event. The meeting was held in Rabat and chaired by Moulay Hafid Elalamy, a chairman of Morocco’s Bid Committee and the Moroccan Minister of Industry. During the meeting, the Moroccan committee (along with the FIFA delegation) explored key aspects related to government guarantees and other legal elements, read a statement issued by the Committee on Wednesday. Morocco’s Head of Government, Saad Eddine El-Othmani, received the FIFA delegation with  Rachid Talbi Alami, the Moroccan Minister of Youth and Sports. FIFA’s meeting with El-Othmani was a chance for the Moroccan government to reaffirm its full support of the Moroccan bid to organize a “World Cup that is impeccable and meets all FIFA terms and specifications,” added the statement. Both Morocco and the competing three joint  North American bidders (Mexico, Canada, and the United States) will have to submit their formal a proposals to FIFA on March 16th. Morocco first applied to host the tournament on August 11th, 2017— but the country’s bid campaign was only launched by the Moroccan committee on January 23rd. Elalamy said that the Moroccan filing “will be of big importance.” Referring to Morocco’s unsuccessful bids, the Minister of Trade and Investment said that, “this is a new  Morocco, not that of the 2010 bid […] FIFA knows that when we launch [infrastructure] projects, we deliver.” #DIDYOUKNOW The deadline for the submission of our authentic, passionate and compact vision for the 2026 #FIFAWorldCup is 16th March#Morocco is ready to welcome the ? in 2026
???? pic.twitter.com/Hmsm3ivSD4 — Morocco 2026 (@Morocco2026_EN) March 1, 2018  Reinforcing his statement, Elalamy said that one of the strengths of the North African is its stability, “which is good for both investment and football.Moroccans are fans of football. Our fans are known, and our infrastructure meets the international standards.”  If Morocco wins the bid to host the 23rd FIFA World Cup, it will be the second African country to host the World Cup. The first was South Africa, which hosted the international sports event back in 2010. Several sports officials, including the President of the African Football Confederation (CAF), Ahmad Ahmad, and former president of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, expressed their support for Morocco’s bid, emphasizing that the time has come for an African country to again host the tournament.

Rabat- Answering an invitation extended to him by Niger’s president Mahamadou Issoufou, King Mohamed VI instructed a number of high-ranking Moroccan government officials to take part in a conference on the Lake Chad that was held on February 26-28 in Abuja (Nigeria). The conference, whose main objective was to discuss and devise a comprehensive action plan to resolve the region’s environmental and social concerns and save the Lake Chad from extinction, marked the participations of multiple international partners, including foreign officials, experts, international organization. Morocco was represented by Minister of agriculture fisheries, rural development, waters and forests, Aziz Akhannouch, and Minister Delegate in charge of African cooperation, Mouhcine Jazouli. They took part in the three-day conference, holding talks with several heads of delegation and international partners on strategic topics of “common interests,” MAP reported. The Lake Chad Basin, which is made up of four countries (Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon), is facing severe drought and intense insecurity. According to the UN, 2 million people have fled the area due to a massive Bocco Haram presence, whereas a further 10.7 million are dependent on food and economic aid. This week’s conference is part of an ongoing international coalition to quash the rampant terrorist threat and rekindle the region’s economic prospects, some participants told the press.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – The director of the Institute of International and Strategic Relations (IRIS), Pascal Boniface, asserts that the rotation system will favor the Moroccan bid in the 2026 World Cup. In August of 2017, Morocco expressed its interest to the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) to host the 2026 World Cup. Thus, Morocco will be bidding against the United States, Canada, and Mexico—all of whom have already expressed similar interest in hosting the event through a joint proposal. “On paper, this is reminiscent of David against Goliath,” Boniface said, comparing the competitive situation  to the biblical story in which a young David fought and won a seemingly impossible battle against the giant “Goliath.” Morocco is outnumbered, with 34 million inhabitants against the combined 500 million of the other countries, and a GDP of 100 million dollars versus an astounding 20,000 billion dollars. However, Boniface asserts that the “geographic gigantism” of the joint bid has its shortcomings.  If the joint bid were accepted, it would mean that the event would have to take place over an entire continent, which would potentially dilute the uniting interest of the World Cup, especially given the fact that 48 teams, rather than the current 32, will be competing in 2026. Thus, select a  country of more convenient size would be a better option. According to Boniface, Morocco’s size would be an advantage, as it would make transportation around the country easy, —especially given that the existing infrastructure (such as hotels, stadiums, highways, and the LGV) will be ameliorated by 2026. Most importantly, Boniface noted the “Trump Effect” is a major factor in helping secure  Morocco’s bid. It is crucial to bear in mind that the American President, Donald J. Trump, intends to build a wall that separates the U.S. from Mexico, thus making a joint bid between the two countries seem like an odd suggestion. According to Boniface, although Trump may not be in office in 2026, countries will vote in 2018 for the host of FIFA 2026, and the American President’s “repulsive character”may discourage many countries from supporting the joint bid. Furthermore, Boniface declared that America hosting FIFA would be directly harmful to FIFA and  its goal to change its management.  The  U.S. Department of Justice indicated top FIFA executives were involved in a case of widespread corruption, and that  FIFA must no longer be an  organism that controls football, but rather a  private company that will be listed on the stock market in NY. But this gives little  guaranty of an aim for transparency. The privatization of football can potentially scare off many voters. Boniface highlighted the important geopolitical role that hosting the tournament would play if organized in Morocco, given the country’s identity as both an ethnically  “Arab” and “African” kingdom. Religion would factor in.  Although Islam is the country’s major religion, the kingdom maintains good relations with western countries and a high tolerance/openness to other religions. “[Morocco] can be a bridge between civilizations. At a moment where geostrategic clouds accumulate, Morocco, as a peaceful country, would send a positive message,” said Boniface. The IRIS director advised Morocco to join hands with one of the countries of the Maghreb, namely Algeria or Tunisia, in organizing the bid and ultimately projecting a good-will alliance. “Sometimes David triumphs over Goliath,” said Boniface. Morocco can aspire to be victorious, as it is the matter of a candidature of relative proximity against overpowering gigantism. It is also the competition of a peaceful candidate against the aggressive discourse that has been presented by the U.S. President.

Rabat – The Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Bourita, has responded to the ruling of the European Court of Justice regarding the EU-Morocco relationship and the Moroccan Sahara, reaffirming that “nothing in the [ECJ’s] verdict challenges the political legitimacy of Morocco to  conclude agreements regarding the Moroccan Sahara with the EU.” On February 27, the ECJ decided that the fisheries agreement between the EU and Morocco is, “valid insofar as it is not applicable to Western Sahara or to its adjacent waters,” adding that, if the EU and Morocco included the Western Sahara region in their agreement, it would violate certain rules of “international law applicable to relations between the EU and Kingdom of Morocco.” In an interview with Moroccan news outlet Le360, the official said that the court has not followed the opinions of the Advocate General at the ECJ, Wathelet Melchior, who previously said that the EU-Morocco Fisheries Agreement should be “annulled.” Bourita reaffirmed that the high court of the EU has at no time “invalidated” the Morocco-EU fisheries agreement. The Moroccan diplomat also lauded the strategic partnership that links between Morocco and EU on different levels, stating that the two parties will continue to work to consolidate their cooperation and fishery ties. “The Kingdom is equivalent to the sum of all of its territories from Tangier to Lagouira,” Bourita added.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – After launching a vast control operation targeting several private clinics, tax services have discovered potential fiscal fraud. According to the February 26 edition of Assabah, auditors have discovered anomalies in the tax returns from private clinics, specifically in health insurance records and doctors’ declarations. The first control operation revealed that services invoiced to patients had not been declared.  The auditors observed other fiscal irregularities by cross-referencing the insurance company case files with the clinics income reports. In fact, the benefits paid by insurers were not systematically noted in the clinics’ income.  The tax inspectors, reinforced with 200 supplementary executives for this operation, also looked at the compensation of doctors from the public sector who work in private clinics on a full- or part-time basis. Here again, the data provided by the clinics did not agree with those presented to the tax services. Additionally, several patients have complained to the tax services about, excessive charges without receiving any invoice in return. The audit supported this claim, illustrating that medical expenses paid in cash surpassed the 20,000 dirhams authorized by the law in many situations. Typically, any payment beyond this amount, must be paid by check or bank transfer. Inspectors were surprised to find these violations, given the fact that practitioners are subject to two separate reporting regimes: the corporate tax, or the direct tax imposed on corporations by jurisdiction, and the professional income tax. Ultimately, the clinics will face surcharges of 5% to 20%, depending on the gravity of the offense. However, these penalties are only related the accounting documents violation,  as opposed to the more serious charges of tax fraud.
