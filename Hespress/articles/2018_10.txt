During a press briefing following the UN Security Council’s adoption of Resolution 2440 extending MINURSO’s mandate for six months on Wednesday, Hilale pointed out the council’s inclusion of Algeria “for the first time.” It is the first time that the council mentioned Algeria in its draft resolution since the launch of the UN-led political process in 2007. Algeria has long avoided any direct involvement in the Western Sahara conflict and striven to ensure that the language of Security Council resolutions refers to it as a neighboring country, as opposed to part of the conflict. Hilale said that to have Morocco, Mauritania, and Algeria participate in the meeting in Geneva, as the main concerned parties, is a “historic” event. Hilale asserted that the “exclusive demand” for Algeria’s participation “does not stop at the Geneva roundtable meeting, but is to last through the entire political process, until the very end” of the conflict. Morocco has long called on Algeria to shoulder its responsibility and admit its role as a main party to the conflict. According to exclusive information obtained by Morocco World News, Algeria’s inclusion in the draft resolution raised eyebrows in pro-Algeria quarters.

“After Resolution 2414 of last April, the new Resolution 2440 signifies a major development in the Western Sahara question initiated by the security council,” Hilale concluded. The debate between the US, demanding a six-month the UN mission in the Western Sahara (MINURSO) extension, and France, pushing for a one-year extension, has ended with 12 votes in favor of six months until April 2019 by the 15-member Security Council, with three abstentions. According to the final draft of the resolution, the Security Council expresses “full support” for the Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Kohler and his efforts to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution for the Western Sahara conflict.

Rabat – After a debate between the US and France and other members of the Security Council, the Council decided on the mandate of the UN mission in the Western Sahara, also known as MINURSO. The powerful organ at the UN decided that the MINURSO mandate should be renewed for six months, which the US supported, instead of one year, which France supported. The resolution “emphasizes the need to achieve a realistic, practicable and enduring political solution to the question of Western Sahara based on compromise and the importance of aligning the strategic focus of MINURSO and orienting resources of the United Nations to this end.”
 According to the final draft of the resolution, the Security Council expresses “full support” for the Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Kohler and his efforts to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution for the Western Sahara conflict. The resolution also includes a paragraph in which the Security Council welcomed the parties’ favorable response to Kohler’s invitations for round-table talks in Geneva on December 5-6. The Security Council “expresses its full support for the intention of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy to initiate a renewed negotiations process before the end of 2018; notes that invitations to an initial roundtable meeting in Geneva on 5 and 6 December 2018 were sent on 28 September 2018, welcomes that Morocco, the Frente Polisario, Algeria, and Mauritania have responded positively, and encourages them to work constructively with the Personal Envoy, in the spirit of compromise, throughout the duration of this process to ensure a successful outcome.” The language of this paragraph carries significant political weight in that it mentions Algeria and Mauritania on equal footing with Morocco and the Polisario. Algeria has long sought to deny any direct involvement in the conflict and striven to ensure that the language of Security Council resolutions refers to it as a neighboring country. Sources acquainted with the conflict told Morocco World News that the letter that the UNSG Personal Envoy sent to Algeria and Mauritania in late September is identical to the one he sent to Morocco and the Polisario. The same source added that the UN official made no distinction in the letter between the parties and neighboring countries. On October 3, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres submitted a report to the Security Council, informing them that Kohler invited Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and Polisario to the roundtable talks. Guterres said that all parties should respond to Kohler’s invitation without preconditions. Kohler’s invitation to Algeria is a diplomatic gain for Morocco as it is the first time the Security Council has mentioned Algeria in its draft resolution since the launch of the UN-led political process in 2007. After receiving the draft resolution from the US, which wrote it in its capacity as a penholder of the resolution, the members of the Security Council held their first meeting to discuss the MINURSO mandate Monday, October 29. According to exclusive information obtained by Morocco World News, Algeria’s inclusion in the draft resolution raised eyebrows in pro-Algeria quarters. Morocco has been calling on Algeria to shoulder its responsibility and admit its role as a main party to the conflict. However, Bouteflika’s government considers itself only a neighboring country to the conflict. Monday’s meeting also witnessed a debate between the US and other countries which support Morocco’s demand to extend MINURSO’s mandate to one year, including France, Côte d’Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, and Kuwait. According to MWN’s information, the US was determined to extend MINURSO’s mandate for no more than six months. Through this move, the US aims to pressure the parties to the conflict to show their willingness to be involved in serious negotiations before accepting a one-year extension for the MINURSO mandate. In response to Polisario’s provocative actions east of Morocco’s defense wall and Western Sahara, the resolution calls on the front to refrain from taking any action that might destabilize the region or that seeks to change the status quo of the area located east of Morocco’s defense wall. “Further calls on the Frente Polisario to fully adhere to its commitments to the Personal Envoy with respect to Bir Lahlou, Tifariti, and the buffer strip at Guerguerat,” reads the second part of operative paragraph 6.  Tifariti, which has long been called a liberated zone by the Polisario, was also included in the final version of the resolution. The area was not included in the first draft of the resolution obtained by Morocco World News on Monday. The Security Council, therefore, is using language that can be seen as a blow to the Polisario’s claims that Tifariti, located east of the Moroccan defense wall, is a “liberated territory.” After the adoption of the new resolution, Polisario is unlikely to take similar provocative steps to the actions of its armed elements in the past two years.  At Monday’s meeting, some members of the Security Council contested the resolutions’ provisions deemed as “strong” against the Polisario Front. Influential members at the Council, including the US, appear to be very careful to warn against any action that might disrupt the UN-led political process because Polisario attempts to change the status quo and impose a fait accompli in the buffer zone.  The resolution also “calls upon the parties to respect their relevant obligations and assurances, and refrain from any actions that could undermine UN-facilitated negotiations or further destabilize the situation in the Western Sahara.” Earlier in October, local news outlets reported that armed Polisario elements assaulted a MINURSO-controlled site in Mijek in Western Sahara.  Mijek is located east of the Moroccan defense wall in Western Sahara, which makes it a part of the Military Agreement 1 and a no-go area for Polisario. Following the alleged provocative action, Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said that Morocco’s diplomatic achievements anger Polisario. El Khalfi said that Polisario’s provocations in Western Sahara “are a desperate attempt that is doomed to fail like those that preceded it.” The Security Council resolution “reaffirms the need for full respect of the military agreements reached with MINURSO with regard to the ceasefire and calls on the parties to adhere fully to those agreements.”

To motivate youth with the sense of commitment and common good, the Hult Prize launches, every September, a challenge for MBA and university students all over the world to come up with a problem-solving project on topics ranging from the environment to energy and education. The 2019 challenge will be to “provide meaningful work for 10,000 young people within the next decade.” The competition contains three phases. The first local phase is in Rabat at Mohammadia School of Engineering, where the participating teams present their project ideas before a highly qualified jury on December 13. The winner will represent Morocco in the next phase. A second “regional” phase will take place in March in 15 cities around the world, including London, Shanghai, Dubai, San Francisco, and Boston. The final phase will take place in September 2019 at the United Nations headquarters in New York. Former US President Bill Clinton announces the theme each year under which the participants will build their projects. He also designates the winner. Mohammadia School of Engineering had the honor of representing Morocco last year, the first time Morocco competed for the Hult Prize. More than 600 engineers and engineering students forming 23 teams participated in the first local phase on December 7, 2017.  Of the 23 teams that took up the challenge, 9 finalists were chosen to present their ideas before the jury.  Two teams were chosen to represent Morocco in London and Tunisia. Mohammadia School of Engineering, which is Morocco’s only school to compete in the challenge, took up the challenge once again and called on its students to form teams and prepare their project ideas to represent Morocco in the regional phase.

The sources indicated that the decrease in oil prices is expected to be implemented by tomorrow, November 1. The changes will operate as follows: A decrease of 35 centimes per liter in diesel prices and a 21 centimes per liter decrease in gasoline. The news will be welcomed by many Moroccans, especially following recent demonstrations and frustration at the high prices at Moroccan gas stations. Rising global oil prices led to higher gas prices across the world. The shock affected Moroccan prices, leading to a proportional increase in domestic market prices. It is understood that the drop in prices also follows the direction of global fluctuations. On October 30, the price of a barrel of oil dropped from $85 to $75.

The Istanbul prosecutor’s office also confirmed previously leaked details which reported that Khashoggi was dismembered inside the Saudi consulate. The news came after a two-day trip to Istanbul by a Saudi public prosecutor, Saud al-Mojeb. Speaking anonymously to the Washington Post, a Turkish official criticized the prosecutor’s visit. He claimed, “Saudi officials seemed primarily interested in finding out what evidence the Turkish authorities had against the perpetrators.” The official added that Mojeb had not provided the location of Khashoggi’s body or the name of the “local collaborator” who Saudi authorities have implicated as helping them dispose of Khashoggi’s body. The latest accusation comes nearly a full month after Khashoggi was last seen walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. The Saudi narrative regarding Khashoggi’s death has shifted several times. Most recently Saudi officials admitted Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate but blamed his death on rogue agents acting outside Riyadh’s authority. The Saudis have arrested 18 in connection with Khashoggi’s death. Following the arrests, Turkey demanded extradition to allow them to be tried in Istanbul, where the crime was committed. Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister denied the extradition request, stating the suspects will instead be tried domestically. Khashoggi’s death has brought international pressure on the Saudis to explain their role in the killing and has cast a harsh light specifically on Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who many suspect ordered the killing.

Minister of Economy Mohamed Benchaaboun and German Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Gerd Muller signed the declaration Tuesday, October 30, at the G20 Investment Summit. The aim of the declaration is to launch discussions under the name “Partnership to Encourage Reforms,” Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. Benchaaboun and Muller held a previous meeting during which “they commended the quality of bilateral relations, which testifies to Morocco’s central place in German cooperation policy with the Mediterranean.” Benchaaboun thanked Germany for choosing Morocco as a priority country eligible for the “Partnership to Encourage Reforms” initiative, according to MAP. Benchaaboun asserted that the new partnership “will give a new impetus to Moroccan-German cooperation.” Muller stressed, for his part, that Africa is the continent of opportunities, located near Europe with which Africa shares common objectives and interests. The continent will be younger in 2025 with a population close to 2 billion inhabitants and will face many challenges related to fighting famine, Muller said. The challenges can be addressed through country-specific instruments, increasing production, and the industrialization of agricultural products, he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel launched the G20 “Compact with Africa” initiative in 2017 to encourage African countries to introduce reforms. It also aims to promote private investment, particularly in infrastructure, for Africa’s sustainable economic development. In addition to Morocco, 11 African countries joined the  G20 Investment Summit: Senegal, Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Tunisia, Egypt, and Ethiopia. During the summit, Merkel urged German companies to shift focus from Asia to Africa’s “huge” economic opportunities. “For many years we have been very focused on Asia. I think that in future we should turn our sights more on Africa,” Merkel  said. According to Merkel, the development of Africa could help curb undocumented immigration to Europe. “Apart from strengthening Africa as a location for investment, it is also important to establish fair trade relations between Europe and Africa,” German outlet Deutsche Welle quoted Merkel as saying.

President Trump recently claimed the ability to reverse the US Constitution’s 14th Amendment with an executive order. The amendment states, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.” Trump’s executive order would end the right to citizenship of undocumented people born on US soil.  In an interview with Axios Tuesday morning, Trump defended his immigration policy, claim, “We’re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits.” According to the Center for Immigration Studies, 29 other countries grant automatic citizenship to all people born within their borders. Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan blatantly dismissed Trump’s plans in a radio interview, stating, “You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order.” Ryan’s rejection of the idea is shared by much of the legal community. The general consensus among legal scholars considers Trump’s proposal as unconstitutional because it insinuates the president is above the legal process.  It is unlikely the executive order will be unchallenged, or upheld in court. A formal amendment to change the US Constitution requires a two-thirds Congressional majority vote in both houses, or two-thirds of state government approval.  The interpretation of the 14th amendment has been part of an ongoing debate among politicians regarding its exclusion of undocumented citizens, but legislation regarding the issue has never passed a vote in Congress.  A study conducted by the Migration Policy Institute projected a surge of nearly 5 million undocumented citizens in the US between 2015 and 2050 if Trump’s plan succeeds, putting further strain on local authorities to crack down on undocumented immigrants.  Trump’s announcement is stirring political and public controversy across the US, leaving many questioning the legitimacy of his claims and the limits of his presidential power.

In a one-minute video, Amjoun talked about receiving the King’s phone call.  She said that King Mohammed VI asked her about her “experience in the competition and the challenges” she faces in prestigious reading competitions. “He also congratulated me,” said the young bookworm. The Moroccan public and celebrities took to their social media to congratulate Amjoun on her achievement. The young reader beat 10.5 million participants from 40 countries.  After her outstanding win, Amjoun addressed a message to Arab children, advising them to read “because reading is the lighthouse of civilization.”  “If I want to describe my country in two words, I would say ‘a piece of heaven,’” Amjoun said confidently. Amjoun won the competition for her ability to read. She participated in the challenge with only 60 books. Amjoun won nearly MAD 1.3 million in prize money, which she will use for her university education and for her family for encouraging her to read, Gulf news reported. The award ceremony took place on October 30 at the Dubai Opera House. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum presented the award. She thanked him after her win. “I would like to thank his Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum for this amazing initiative which developed our cognitive curiosity and increased our love for reading books,” she said.

Rabat-Flooding from heavy rain stopped Casablanca trams Tuesday afternoon and evening, prompting Moroccans to complain on social media. The Casablanca tramway was stopped from Tuesday afternoon into the night, according to a statement on Casa Tramway’s official Facebook page. The floods impeded the flow of traffic in the center of the city. Moroccans took to social media to share videos of flooded streets and complaining about the overflowing streets. Lately, Casablanca inhabitants have also been denouncing the city’s pollution and “bad odor,” which they say is spreading to its outskirts and destroying the environment. RATP Dev, the company in charge of urban transport in Casablanca, stated that road workers are currently “mobilized” to clear up floodwaters in the area to ensure safe transportation. The Casablanca-Settat region and many regions across the country are experiencing a cold snap and rainfalls early in the season. Since Sunday, October 28, temperatures dropped drastically in Morocco, leading to the first snowfall of 30 centimeters in the Atlas Mountain cities of Ifrane and Midelt and the villages of Imouzzer, El Hajeb, and Boulemane. Severe floods hit several regions of Morocco in late September in Rhamna and Al Haouz, Sidi Ifni, Meknes, and Guelmim, causing up to five deaths. The floods also caused extensive property damage and agricultural casualties, from flooding houses to drowning livestock and blocked roads.

On October 26, the government adopted Draft Decree 2.18.855, adding 60 minutes to standard time in Morocco, moving Morocco to GMT+1 year-round. Before the decree, Morocco was set to move off of DST (GMT₊1) and back to standard time (GMT) on Sunday, October 28. The decision stirred confusion and questions about the government’s hasty move without prior notice. Clocks set by the internet with Moroccan cities selected as the time zone returned to GMT on Sunday and, as of Wednesday, are still showing the wrong time. In an interview with Morocco World News, MP Abdellatif Ouahbi called on the government to reveal the study that the government claimed to have conducted on time change. Following the backlash, a source at the government told Telquel Arabi that the minister delegate in charge of administration reform, Mohamed Benabdelkader, had the idea to stop the biennial time change in March. However, the government did not say anything about it until October 25, when it abruptly announced an emergency government council meeting the following day. The council decided to stop the upcoming time change by adding 60 minutes to standard time. Benabdelkader, according to Telquel Arabi, said that the research aimed to study the reactions of Moroccans to time changes. He added that the study kicked off in May. The government received the preliminary results of the study on October 9. The government never mentioned the alleged study until Benabdelkader told a press conference that the government based its decision on a survey. A Telquel source said the study was conducted under the supervision of Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. Benabdelkader admitted, “The study did not include direct questions about the preferences of Moroccans.” When the minister announced the decision on October 26, Benabdelkader said the decision aims to end the public’s confusion about time changes, which come four times a year. In addition to moving to DST in the summer, Morocco temporarily returns to standard time over Ramadan when the holy month falls in the summer. “The purpose of the study was to know the effects of the time change on Moroccans. We found that 68 percent of them prefer stability. The decision to maintain daylight saving time is a political decision,”  Benabdelkader said. Benabdelkader also claimed that the survey studied the impacts of the time change on Moroccans. “It caused tensions and diseases. We have also studied the economic aspect of this problem. I repeat it is a political decision of the government. This decision was adopted on the basis of a comparative study with developed countries.” Besides Benabdelkader, Telquel’s government source also defended the Ministry of Education’s decision to change school time-tables. Instead of 8 a.m., students will have to start school at 9 a.m.  On Monday, El Othmani said that there will be more measures accompanying the government decision to adopt DST year-round, without giving further details. He also explained that the government is aware of the public’s confusion about the time change, but it would be “risky to go back to the Standard Time,because we want to ensure sustainability in the supply of electricity.” “The electricity supply must be continuous all day long and throughout the year, but in the summer, we have a peak in electricity consumption that poses risks … and that can sometimes lead to power cuts.” He said that staying on GMT+1 will save Morocco MAD 240 million annually.

By Josh Babb Mattis, speaking in Washington, D.C., says that Saudi Arabia and their Emirati allies are ready to come to the table for negotiations to end Yemen’s civil war.  The UN Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths is to broker talks between the Houthi rebels and the Saudi-led coalition in Sweden by the end of the year.  Speaking several hours after the announcement, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement outlining further details for a ceasefire: “The time is now for the cessation of hostilities, including missile and UAV strikes from Houthi-controlled areas into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Subsequently, Coalition air strikes must cease in all populated areas in Yemen.” Talks between the Saudi coalition and Houthi rebels had previously been scheduled to take place in Geneva last September, but fell through after the Saudis failed to promise safe passage for wounded Houthi soldiers. The two sides have not held talks in more than two years.  The Yemen civil war began in March of 2015 and has directly killed more than 10,000, among them some 5,200 civilians.  It has been widely reported that the Saudi-led blockade of Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen has regularly brought millions of the civilian population to the brink of a “catastrophic” famine. UN sources state that nearly half the country’s population, or 14 million people, are at risk.  Save the Children estimated that in 2017 alone, some 50,000 children died of starvation or disease in Yemen. The US has faced continued international criticism for its role in supporting the Saudi coalition, both through coordinating with the Saudi air force and providing Riyadh with weapons.  The calls for a ceasefire also come as US ties with Saudi Arabia have come under question, both abroad and within the US, following the premeditated murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi by a Saudi hit-squad on October 2 in Istanbul. Khashoggi was a US resident and a contributor for the Washington Post at the time of his death. According to Jeremy Konyndyk, the former head of US disaster relief assistance, UN envoy Martin Griffiths was in Washington, D.C., last week briefing administration officials of the current crisis facing Yemen’s civilian population, perhaps pressuring officials to announce their most recent plans. He added, “No administration wants a famine on its watch—and particularly one that would be so closely tied to the White House’s Saudi policy.” On October 10, a bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to Mike Pompeo calling on him to further detail US involvement in Yemen’s civil war. They specifically asked if the US has taken steps to ensure that the Saudi coalition has taken “demonstrable actions to reduce the risk of harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure.” Pompeo is expected to release a statement answering the questions later today, October 31.

Morocco, an important EU ally, enjoys good relations with a number of EU member states. During a Monday meeting in Marrakech however, Germany and Morocco decided that there was room for further cooperation and integration of their agricultural policies. Aziz Akhannouch, Morocco’s agriculture minister, and Julia Klockner, Germany’s food and agriculture minister, signed the convention. The two ministers highlighted the need “to give a new impetus” to the bilateral ties already binding the two nations. In addition to increased agricultural output, the long-term goals of the cooperation include channeling Germany’s technological knowhow and its human and financial resources to Morocco’s evolving food sector. The convention is set to be a “true platform of sharing and collaboration.” According to an official statement by the Moroccan government, Monday’s convention comes as a follow-up and a reinforcement of the German-Moroccan Center for Agricultural Council (CECAMA). Created in 2014, CEMACA was meant to help Morocco reach its Green Morocco Plan of “high-performing, modern, and ecologically sustainable agriculture.” Together with CEMACA, the newly signed convention is expected to create more pathways to achieve the goals of the Green Morocco Plan. Investing in Africa While the two may not be directly linked, the convention comes at a time when Germany—and Europe in general—is giving momentum to its Africa-oriented foreign policy. Faced with a flow of African “economic migrants,” many European leaders and policymakers have said that Europe needs to engage more with the continent. Such voices have argued that, unless African states show signs of socio-economic prosperity, European borders will not be at ease. Speaking to German investors on Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed similar sentiments. The German leader told her compatriots to ditch Asian markets, where they have heavily invested in recent years, in favor of Africa, “where the future is.” “For many years we have been focusing on Asia. I think the future is increasingly turning towards Africa,” Merkel said at the Compact Africa, a Berlin-held summit of Germany’s diplomatic and trade efforts in the African continent. European countries would “greatly benefit” from promoting economic development in Africa, Merkel argued. The unarticulated sentiment is that the safest bet in containing the dynamic Europe-bound African mobility is to invest in African markets and create opportunities to accommodate the continent’s many unemployed youth.

The center is for the H125 and H135 helicopters operating in West Africa, reported the Moroccan portal of aeronautics Aeronautique.ma. With the new center, Airbus will expand its network of four service centers on the African continent. Airbus Helicopters and Heliconia celebrated their long-standing partnership during the 2018 Marrakech Airshow October 24-27, at the RMAF military base in Marrakech. This year’s airshow expected 300 exhibitors in the aviation industry, and more than 100 international civil and military delegations made the trip to attend the event. Gerard Franchini, Airbus Helicopters sales manager for Africa, commented on the opening of the new service center, saying, “We are very pleased to extend our collaboration with Heliconia, a maintenance expert, to benefit our customers in West Africa.” “Being close to our customers is an essential part of Airbus’ strategy for support and services, and thanks to the excellent quality of Heliconia’s equipment and infrastructure, this new service center will be operational immediately,” Franchini added. Heliconia has been operating in Morocco since 2008 as a helicopter operator and maintenance service provider. The company operates a fleet of Airbus helicopters made up of the H125, H135 and Dauphin for training, offshore missions, emergency medical services, and passenger and VIP transport. Airbus Helicopters has a global network of 31 sites and more than 100 service centers specializing in maintenance, repair and overhaul. On October 26, the German thyssenkrupp Aerospace company announced the commissioning of a materials processing and logistics center in Casablanca by the end of 2018. The aim of the center is to supply the company’s “local customers with the required materials and services,” said  Patrick Marous, thyssenkrupp Aerospace CEO. Morocco has more than 130 aeronautics companies. According to a recent briefing of the US’s export.gov, “The aerospace industry in Morocco plans to double its capacity and number of operators and create 23,000 new jobs by 2020.” The briefing noted, “Morocco boasts nearly 11,500 aviation professionals, of whom 50 percent are women.”

Daoudi, a senior figure in Morocco’s ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD), made his remarks on Monday at the third EU-Arab World summit in Athens, Greece. The Greek government launched the summit in 2016 to provide “the necessary platforms of cooperation for a more efficient future.” Speaking to journalists at the Athens summit, Daoudi drew attention to the cultural and historical ties between Europe and the Arab world. As a bridging country between Europe and the Arab world, Morocco has repeatedly proven an invaluable partner for the EU, the PJD official argued. Explaining that strategic alliance with Rabat is vital for Europe, he added, “Europe is lucky to have Morocco as neighbor.” While European leaders search for ways to limit the wave of immigrants from Africa and the Middle East to European countries, the Moroccan official suggested that Europe change its perception of the non-Western world. Global solutions to global crises Rather than singly focusing on how threatening and chaotic the outside world can be to so-called European norms and values, European leaders and citizens should shift their focus from security to common values and crises with the non-European world. “The Mediterranean sea should unite us,” he said, adding that Europe cannot on its own meet the ever-growing challenges of contemporary life. Be it on climate change, intercontinental mobility, or the fight against global terrorism, “We need to act together for global peace and stability,” Daoudi noted. The Moroccan’s ideas chimed with the guiding principles of the summit he was attending. Themed “Shared Horizons,” the annual EU-Arab World summit prides itself as a venue for academics, media personalities, and policy makers to devise ways of living in harmony. Described as “a unique bridge of communication between two rapidly changing worlds,” the summit discussed topics as wide-ranging as cultural cooperation between Europe and the Arab world, cooperative architecture to face transnational terrorism, and an array of other global crises. When dealing with geopolitical challenges in this globalized and interconnected world, the Moroccan official argued, Europe should opt for an intercultural perspective that fosters genuine dialogue, rather than flaunting its cultural exceptionalism. More than an interest-focused choice, “Relations between Europe and the Arab world constitute a necessity of our times,” he said. “We need to face common problems together.” Both Europe and the Arab world face a new political landscape of crises and geopolitical perturbations, and “it is now imperative to cooperate.”

The new direct flight will be available on Mondays and Fridays. Departing flights will take off from Marrakech at 6 a.m. and return flights are scheduled to leave 12:50 p.m. (Athens time). According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the new line reflects the company’s interest in Marrakech, from which it operates international flights to Rome, Budapest, London, Brussels, Madrid, Venice, Paris, and Eindhoven. Ryanair will also launch new flights in the future from Marrakech to Berlin, Nuremberg, and Baden-Baden in Germany. In 2013, the company opened its first flight to Morocco at Marrakech’s Menara International Airport. Ryanair represents more than 19 percent of commercial transport and 16 percent of aircraft movement at the Marrakech-Menara airport, according to MAP. In September Ryanair announced that it will launch four new flights between Morocco and France. The first two flights, which will start operation in April 2019, will link Bordeau to Ouarzazate and Tangier. The other two lines will link Marseille with Agadir and Ouarzazate. The new flights are in line with Ryanair’s 2019 summer program. Ryanair currently offers nearly 37 weekly connections to Marrakech. The list includes eight flights to France; eight to Germany; six to Italy; five to Spain; three to the UK; two to Belgium and Athens; and one each to Dublin, Eindhoven in the Netherlands, Krakow, and Budapest.

There are three major themes within the Amazigh culture, defined as the “trinity,” and easily recognizable in Moroccan culture. The three themes have transcended Amazigh culture and been accepted as the wider Moroccan identity: The importance of language (Tamazight), the pervasiveness of the tribal system and kinship (ddm), and the strong connection to the land (tammurt). Without the wider Moroccan community or original Moroccan Arabs accepting the three pillars in Amazigh culture, Morocco would have a very different culture. In short, the similarities between Amazigh and Moroccan Arab culture ensured wide acceptance of Amazigh cultural aspects with Moroccans. The most obvious theme in the Moroccan community of Amazigh nature is the importance of language within society. When one looks at the Amazigh people, there is a clear correlation between the relevance of language and the preservation of the culture. The Amazigh people’s history and belief system was preserved in oral fashion where one generation would pass the history, wisdom, and laws to another. Despite having three distinct dialects, the history and laws of the Amazigh people synced and survived countless invasions. When the Arab invasion occurred, the Arabs brought a similar appreciation for the essential nature of language and the role that the elderly should play in the preservation of Tamazight. Even if one were to overlook the fact that both Arabic and Tamazight, the languages spoken by the Amazigh people, come from the Afro-Asiatic language family, both languages place a heavy emphasis on elders to ensure the continuation of language, either through writing or oral recitation.  Though the Arabs expressed themselves in more poetic and eloquent language, it is believed that they appreciated the way in which the Amazigh people used language as a uniting factor. The relevance of language as a binding element became very apparent when King Mohammed VI amended the Moroccan constitution in 2011 to include Tamazight as a national language. A new written language was formed in neither Arabic script or Latin script but an entirely new alphabet—Tifinagh—to ensure the preservation of Amazigh history, traditions, laws, and wisdom. This recognition provided the Amazigh an even greater acceptance into contemporary Moroccan culture. Despite the similarities, the move to recognize the Amazigh was more a political gesture than an inclusion of Tamazight into society.  A second theme that one must look at when comparing Amazigh and contemporary Moroccan culture is the idea of kinship that spawns from the tribal system.  The idea of a nation-state was a foreign concept from the West that both the Amazigh and Arab invaders in Morocco rejected.  For both the Amazigh and the Arabs, there is an acceptance that similarities between people are not defined by imaginary lines but rather that an identity stems from a shared language, shared history, and for the Arabs, a shared religion. This shared definition of identity resulted in a pervasive tribal system in both Amazigh and Moroccan culture. The tribal system is defined in terms of economically socialist but socially democratic that can still be found in the hospitality of Moroccans today.  However, the idea of kinship that accepts people of different backgrounds is a relevant distinction between Amazigh and Moroccan culture. Even though the tribal system places an emphasis on the matriarch, Moroccan culture prefers an influential patriarch. The relevance of this is that there continues to be a disenfranchisement of the Amazigh people in the laws and politics of Morocco. Finally, one must understand the idea of a homeland resonates with the Amazigh people. There is a unique relationship to the land that extends beyond the physical and into the spiritual.  The Amazigh viewed the land as a thing that not only sustained life but provided protection from imperialistic Western and Arab campaigns that helped to preserve the language and tribal system. The spiritual aspect of the land can be found in the Moroccan Islam (closely related to Sufism) today and that there was a strong relationship between the people in the city and the people in the mountains.  This relates back to the idea that the Amazigh people accepted those who lived in the urban areas of Morocco. The relevance of this relationship between urban and rural emphasizes two distinct cultures in Morocco that coexist and share similar linguistic and societal norms.  There is a complex relationship with language, societal tribal norms, and the connection to the land between Amazigh cultural traditions and their place in Moroccan society. The societal structure and relationship to the land strongly correlate to their acceptance into Moroccan culture today.  Language also has Amazigh cultural characteristics but the acceptance of Tamazight within Moroccan culture still remains to be seen. However, if one were to remove any one of these Amazigh cultural aspects, it is fairly likely Morocco would have a different set of beliefs and way of life.

Ziani is reportedly linked to Mocro Maffia, a criminal network in the Netherlands and has been notorious for his involvement in a ‘cocaine war’ in Utrecht. The 33-year-old victim, who was eating in a restaurant with a foreign couple, was fired upon by a masked man who shot him 9 times in the head and upper body and fled the scene in a white van. The victim died later at the hospital, according to Dutch E-newspaper Telegraaf. The Dutch newspaper linked the killing of Ziani to a Moroccan-Dutch criminal, Redouane Taghi, who is also one of the leaders of the criminal network. He is also accused for being responsible for most of the killings that happened in the Netherlands in recent years. Taghi has been the subject of a continental search warrant. He is one of the most wanted criminals in the Netherlands. Dutch authorities placed a € 25,000 for any tips leading to his arrest.  He is the main suspect in the murder of Ziani .The victim, father of three children, was part of a rival criminal organization that was on a continental manhunt for Taghi. At the beginning of October, Police in Marbella arrested Ziani for carrying weapons and explosives and placing home-made bombs in a trash bin. Few weeks later, he was released on bail. The murder of Hamza Ziani is similar to the one that took place at Café La Créme in Marrakech. Redouane is suspected of giving the order for the shooting that occurred on November 2017. On November 2, two masked individuals were looking for the cafe owner for stealing €27 million from their criminal network leader. They fired on a 26-year old medical student instead. Authorities arrested the two Dutch individuals along with Taghi’s two brothers who are believed to have helped the two men responsible for the Marrakech shooting.

The Netherlands’ Supreme Court has upheld the decision of the Zeeland-West Brabant Court not to extradite suspected drug lord Said Chaou to Morocco. The Supreme Court’s judgment could have consequences for political cooperation between Netherland and Morocco, Dutch Crimesite reported October 30. The Dutch police arrested Chaou in June 2017  on charges of “drug trafficking, corruption, and criminal conspiracy.” On February 22, the Dutch Zeeland-West Brabant court ruled against Chaou’s extradition to Morocco with the justification that he would not receive a “fair trial” in his home country. However, the Dutch prosecution service did not agree with the decision and made an appeal to the Dutch Supreme Court. According to the prosecution service, the Zeeland-West Brabant court incorrectly assumed that Chaou would not receive a fair trial. The court’s assumption was based on an argument that Morocco had “tortured Chaou’s co-defendants and treated them in an inhuman manner” to force them to give false testimony against Chaou.  On October 2, the Dutch advocate general advised the Supreme Court to support the Dutch prosecution service’s appeal. He said that the Supreme Court should consider Morocco’s extradition request, Dutch newspaper Bode reported.  However, the Supreme Court did not take his advice into consideration. According to Crimesite, the prosecution service did not see a real risk of human rights violations in Morocco. Chaou’s lawyer Inez Weski said that Chaou’s co-defendants were heard in Morocco and their testimonials were used in Dutch criminal cases, reported Crimesite. If the Dutch Supreme Court supports the assumption that Chaou’s co-defendants made their testimonials under torture, “it means the testimonials cannot be used in the Netherlands,” Weski asserted. Weski believes that the Supreme Court’s decision “will certainly have consequences for cooperation between the judiciary and the police in the Netherlands and those in Morocco.”  After several months of discussions with Dutch authorities, Chaou’s case nearly caused a diplomatic crisis between the two countries. In June 2017, Morocco decided to recall its ambassador to the Hague for consultation. In Morocco, Chaou faces charges of criminal gang formation, corruption, and international drug trafficking. Chaou was born in the Rif region, north of Morocco. He was an MP in the Moroccan Parliament between 2007 and 2010 before he Morocco in March 2010.

Rabat- Hirak Rif detainee Bilal Ahabbad has become suicidal after Oukacha prison authorities did not allow him to attend his mother’s funeral. Bilal Ahabbad swore to end his life if he was denied permission to attend his mother’s funeral. “I lost the most precious person in my life and if they do not take me out to attend her funeral, they will take me out in a shroud,” Ahabbad’s lawyer Mohamed Aghnaj quoted Ahbad in a Facebook post. Aghnaj stated that Oukacha prison authorities in Casablanca, where Ahbbad is jailed, had promised Ahbbad that they would allow him to attend his mother’s funeral, but they failed to keep their promise. Ahabbad’s mother, who suffered from brain cancer and traveled to Germany for treatment, died on October 23. Her funeral took place on Friday, October 26, in Imeztoun in the Rif mountains, near Al Hoceima, according to news outlet Hespress. Dozens of neighbors and locals attended the funeral in an atmosphere of solidarity and sadness. Videos of the funeral have circulated online ever since.   A psychiatrist visited Ahabbad in prison on Monday, saying that his psychological state has spiralled. The psychiatrist also visited the Hirak leader, Nasser Zefzafi, and other Hirak activists who complained of the prison administration’s inability to fulfil its previous promises of “education, medical care and respect for the dignity of the activists and their families.” Ahbbad, one of the youngest Hirak detainees, was sentenced by a Casablanca court to 10 years in prison for participating in “unauthorized” Hirak protests. In June, a court in Casablanca sentenced 54 Hirak activists and journalists to 1-20 years in prison. Moroccan authorities had arrested the activists involved in the Hirak Rif protest movement in 2016 and 2017. The Hirak movement began in October 2016 after the death of Mohcine Fikri, a local fishmonger crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities in Al Hoceima.  The incident angered citizens, causing protests across the country, but especially in Al Hoceima province, which condemned Fikri’s death and social disparities in Morocco. Police arrested an estimated 400 activists and protesters involved in “unauthorized” protests. Following the ruling of the Casablanca court, hundreds of Moroccans rallied in protests in cities across the country, including Casablanca, Rabat, and the northern city of Nador, to denounce the “heavy” sentences. King Mohammed VI pardoned 184 Hirak prisoners on the eve of Eid al-Adha (festival of sacrifice), August 21.

Four times a year, Moroccans across the country had to reset their clocks and deal with a disruption of their life schedule. There were some who loudly complained over the changes, but many were fine with it until October 26. Morocco was set to end Daylight Saving Time (DST) and return to standard time on Sunday, October 28. Yet on Thursday, October 25, the government published a statement announcing a government council would meet Friday to discuss cancelling the time change and remaining on DST year-round. On Friday, the government approved the decree, announcing that there would be no time change Sunday. How and why? No one had a clue about the last-minute decision. An hour after the decision, officials said it would be beneficial for the public and allow the country to save energy. But with many complaining, will it really benefit the public? Angry and confused, Moroccans consider social media as the only space where they can lash out about the government’s hasty and unnecessary decisions made without any prior notice or public consultation. In an attempt to cover up for the lack of public consultation, the minister delegate in charge of the reform of administration and public service, Mohamed Benabdelkader, said the decision to stay on DST followed an evaluation study and “many indicators.” He said that “the indicators include health aspects related to time change, energy saving and Morocco’s commercial transactions.” “The study showed that adding 60 minutes to the Kingdom’s time enables us to gain an hour of light. It will enable citizens to spend their time in better conditions and reduce the peak risk of electricity consumption, which sometimes causes damage,” Benabdelkader asserted. Cafeteria lunch, anyone? He also announced that the Ministry of Education would change schools time-tables. A few hours later on Friday, the ministry issued a statement to announce new school schedules to go into effect November 7 when students return from their first school break. The statement says that school children will start at 9 a.m. and leave schools at 1 p.m. Students will have a one hour lunch break, and should go back to school at 2 p.m. Traditionally, the morning session was from 8 a.m. to 12 noon, and students used the two-hour lunch break to go home. The time-table change was implemented to ensure students are not going to school before sunrise. The new time-table is a quick fix, which is dangerous and shows extreme laziness from the government. How is it possible for a student who lives 30 minutes away from school go home for lunch and return to school within an hour? What about parents? In the public sector and some private sector jobs, employees start work at 8:30 a.m. and finish at 4:30 p.m. Did the government take into consideration how parents can drop their children off before work? Not everyone can afford to pay a school bus for a private school. If parents are to start at 8:30 a.m., they will have to drop their children off 30 minutes or an hour before school starts. MP Abdellatif Ouahbi told Morocco World News that when the European Union thought about abolishing time change, it conducted a survey to study the impact of the decision. However, the Moroccan government made the decision overnight, without even publishing the results of the alleged study. Since the government seems to sync with its European neighbors—France and Spain—and stay on DST,  they should have at least prepared measures not to affect the public. Rather than leaving their children outside schools early, parents, especially mothers, may not have much choice but to find a personal solution or leave work. The government could have prepared a suitable time-table for school children: The one-hour lunch break is not enough. Parents will be forced to either prepare lunches for their children or pay for them to buy lunches. The government may not have taken this into consideration. The government should bear responsibility for its decision. They should at least think of providing cafeterias in all schools. More transparency, please It is not the first time the government has stunned the public with last-minute decisions. In August, the government issued a statement saying that it would propose re-introducing mandatory military service again. The government council then approved the draft bill within two days. Parliament has not yet voted on the bill. The last-minute decision left people scratching their heads as it came after very little prior notice in the form of an agenda item added less than two days before the approval. Since the government claimed that it has conducted a study to see whether the DST is beneficial, why did the government not announce it? Where are the study’s findings? When the European Union conducted a consultation on the current EU summertime arrangement in July, the union published an overview on the objective of the study as well as the period of the consultation. “Following a number of requests from citizens, from the European Parliament, and from certain EU Member States, the Commission has decided to investigate the functioning of the current EU summertime arrangements and to assess whether or not they should be changed,” wrote the EU in its briefing on the consultation. Since the decision affects everyone, the government should have consulted the public to hear people’s opinion before making any move. Just because Spain and France are out of whack on GMT+1 does not mean Morocco should follow their lead. Morocco is geographically within the longitudinal lines of the GMT time zone. The government should have moved to standard time (GMT) and remained there, stopping time changes. Moving to GMT +1 puts Morocco in the same time zone as countries like Chad and Poland (far east of Morocco) and yet an hour ahead of the UK and Togo, which are roughly in the same longitudinal position. When countries are in the appropriate time zone, solar noon, the time the sun is highest in the sky, should be close to 12 noon. In Oujda, in far eastern Morocco, solar noon today was at 12:51 p.m. Yet in Dakhla, in Western Sahara, solar noon today was at 1:47, clearly showing that the country is better suited to GMT than GMT+1.

Mariam Amjoun, a 9-year-old Moroccan girl, has won the 2018 Arab Reading Challenge in Dubai, outperforming 10.5 million participants from 40 countries. Amjoun won AED 500,000 (nearly MAD 1.3 million) in prize money. She will use it for her university education and for her family for encouraging her to read, reported Gulf News. The award ceremony was held at the Dubai Opera House today, October 30. “I am extremely happy with this prize. I would like to thank his Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum for this amazing initiative which developed our cognitive curiosity and increased our love for reading books.” “I advise Arab children to read because reading is the ‘lighthouse of civilization,’” she added. Despite her young age, Amjoun said that she has read 200 books and participated in the challenge with only 60 books. “If I want to describe my country in two words, I would say ‘a piece of heaven,’” Amjoun said confidently. Amjoun was the youngest of five finalists from Egypt, Algeria, Palestine, and Jordan. Before going to Dubai, Amjoun had beaten thousands of participants in Morocco and was chosen from among 16 semi-finalists. Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE prime minister, honored the top finalists from Arab and other non-Arab countries. A panel of judges asked the finalists various questions before asking the audience to vote.The audience voted in an instant poll, choosing Amjoun.  Sheikh Mohammad presented the winners of the competition’s different categories with awards totaling AED 11 million (over $3 million). “The challenge is the largest-ever Arab literacy initiative encouraging students to read as many books as possible, over 50, in one academic year,” wrote Gulf News. The number of children participating this year increased by 26 percent since 2017, from 7.4 million to 10.5 million participants from 44 countries.  The number was described as “a record-breaking.”  The challenge included Arab students from Arab countries and non-Arab countries as well as non-native speakers of Arabic. Tasneem Aidi from France was a top winner from a non-Arab country. A total of 52,000 schools and 87,000 supervisors participated. The Ekhlas School from Kuwait won an AED 1 million prize for “having the best reading initiatives in the region.” Aisha Tuwergy from Saudi Arabia won AED 300,000 for being the “best supervisor” to encourage students in the challenge, reported Gulf News. Sheikh Mohammad launched the the Arab Reading Challenge in 2015. The challenge aims to “establish a culture of reading among the new Arab generations across the globe,” and enhance “the importance of knowledge in shaping their future as well as the future of their communities and countries.” Palestinian Afaf Raed won the title of the champion of the 2017 Arab Reading Challenge.

Rabat  – Morocco will receive its first shipment of 12 F-16V fighting falcons in 2021. Morocco ordered the new fighter planes from the US military industry giant Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of the newest and most advanced aircraft, F-16 Block 70, according to  Moroccan outlet Le360. According to Dutch military magazine, Scramble Magazine, the Moroccan government made plans to buy F-16 Block 70 fighting falcons to reinforce its air fleet in May. The warplanes will be added to Morocco’s current 23 Block fighter planes: 15 F-16C Block 52s and 8 F-16D Block 52s. Morocco will be the first country in Africa to own the F-16 fighting falcon, commonly called a viper, giving it air superiority on a continental scale. Lockheed-Martin recently exhibited the F-16V at the 2018 Marrakech Airshow. The F-16V (Viper) fighter was revealed at Singapore Airshow in February 2012. Morocco’s purchase of the fighting falcons was concluded in secrecy in late 2017, following a visit by a delegation of the Royal Armed Forces to Washington, D.C, with several industrial defense groups. It is reported that Morocco is planning to modernize all its F16s to be adapted to the newest viper standard. Morocco is a loyal consumer of American military equipment, as it constitutes 52 percent of Morocco’s total imports. Last year, Business Insider estimated the F-16Vs cost $80 million each, costing Morocco approximately $960 million for the order. Moreover, simply operating a fighter plane for one hour costs approximately $8,000. Algeria remains the largest importer of military equipment in Africa. It acquires most of its arms from Russia, spending $10 billion.

The subsidized flights are part of a partnership between the airline and the Regional Council of Souss-Massa, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The airline will serve the flights with an Airbus A320 with a capacity of 174 seats. The inaugurating flight landed in Agadir from Rabat Sunday. The airline has scheduled three weekly flights from Agadir to Rabat and two weekly flights for Fez and Tangier. Regional Council President Brahim Hafidi; the wali (governor) of the Souss-Massa region, Ahmed Haji; and the general director of Air Arabia Maroc, Laila Mechbal, attended the ceremony. Hafidi said that his goal for the domestic flights is to encourage internal tourism. “We intend to democratize access to air transport,” he said. He added that the council hopes that tourism operators are working to “support this effort by putting promotional packages in place for domestic tourists.” Hafidi said that the development of air transport is intended to accompany the Industrial Acceleration Plan by allowing investors and economic operators to move more easily. Mechbal said that the new domestic lines are “the fruit of the partnership and support of the Souss-Massa region, the local authorities, and the Ministry of Tourism and Air Transport.” On Sunday, Air Arabia Maroc launched three new flights to Dakhla from Casablanca, Marrakech, and Tangier. The company wants to add more domestic flights to promote regional tourism across the country. During the inaugural ceremony in Dakhla, Mechbal claimed that the new flights will help boost domestic tourism and promote trade between Dakhla-Oued Eddahab and other regions of Morocco. She also expressed hope about the airline which is set to encourage citizens  to visit Dakhla, a “city of national and world renown, and to discover the natural touristic and cultural potential of the region.”

Rabat- Essaouira has ranked among the top 10 retirement destinations in 2018 for foreigners to retire by the French website Retraite sans Frontieres. Morocco continues to attract foreigners from all around the world with its rich and colorful culture, mesmerizing landscapes, and hospitality.  Morocco’s Atlantic port city, Essaouira, came tenth in the list of “Top 10 Overseas Paradise Escapes for 2018.” Another North African city, Houmt-Souk on the Tunisian island of Djerba, made it to the list. The list includes Portugal’s Cascais ranking ninth, Houmt-Souk eighth, Indonesia’s Ubud seventh, Dominican Republic’s Boca Chica sixth, Greece’s Paros fifth, Thailand’s Ao Nang third, Mauritius’ Trou aux Biches second, and Portugal’s Tavira first. Like every year, the site bases its judgment on specific criteria suitable for retirees: The cost of living, security and stability, infrastructure, natural and cultural heritage, climate, and environment. The survey notes the widespread use of the French language by Moroccans which makes it easier and comfortable for French retirees to communicate with the locals, in addition to the country’s geographic proximity to Europe.  Essaouira’s charm lies in its combination of beach and desert, “its narrow streets, vivid colors, white houses with blue shutters … its medina and fish markets, fabrics and spices,” the website states. Essaouira is nicknamed both “Morocco’s windy city” and the “Atlantic Blue Pearl.” Enamoured with its charm, American actress Halle Berry and Canadian actor Keanu Reeves are currently exploring the city while shooting their action/thriller franchise, John Wick 3. “I’m free here, I’m me here,” Berry wrote of Essaouira next to an Instagram photo while enjoying a camel ride, among other photos of the star and the city. Keanu Reeves is also enjoying Essaouira. The Hollywood star shared photos of him and his fans in the city and magical moments in Essaouira’s breathtaking desert. Morocco received 8.7 million tourists from January to August 2018,  according to the latest statistics by the Ministry of Tourism. Tourist arrivals from Italy made the most considerable increase between the first eight months of 2017 and 2018, rising 14 percent. German tourist numbers increased 10 percent, French 7 percent, and Dutch 6 percent.

Morocco has been hit with the global increases on fuel prices with both diesel and gasoline becoming more expensive.  Featured prices at gas stations show that gasoline prices are about MAD 11.7 to 11.8 per liter, while diesel prices are estimated at MAD 10.5 to 10.7 per liter. ODPT Secretary General Mustapha Chaoune told Medias24 that transportation services are paralyzed across the country. He told the news outlet that taxis, passenger buses, and a few freight carriers are on strike in more than 70 provinces across Morocco. Chaoune called on the government to act and break its silence about the increase in fuel prices, which has a large impact on the cost of transportation. He added that “the cost of transportation depends 30 to 35 percent on the price of fuel.”  On October 27, the Ministry of Equipment said it would organize a meeting in November between freight haulers and the supervisory ministry to examine diesel prices and its negative impact, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Earlier this month, truck drivers went on strike over fuel prices. The strike, by drivers who transported fruit and vegetables to Casablanca, caused spikes in prices of fruit and vegetables. Moroccan newspaper Assabah reported that the supply of fruits and vegetables had decreased by 33 percent. The impact of rising oil prices globally has caused several rounds of tension in the past months. In June, the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) recognized that fuel prices increased by 9.1 percent since their deregulation in 2016. HCP explained the increase in gasoline prices due to the international oil price rising. HCP said that fuel prices continued to rise, reaching MAD 10 per liter at the end of May 2018, compared to MAD 7 at the beginning of 2017.

Morocco is planning to sell shares in Marrakech’s La Mamounia hotel to the private sector, according to a draft addendum to the 2019 Finance Bill. The finance department drafted an amendment to the 1989 privatization law, reported L’Economiste Monday. The updated bill will be scheduled for discussion at the next government council November 1.  Two sources “familiar with the plan” have confirmed that the Moroccan government plans to sell a 51-percent stake in the luxurious La Mamounia hotel next year, reported Bloomberg. “The government is expected to fix a minimum price and invite bids sometime in 2019,” according to Bloomberg. La Mamounia’s value is expected to be more than MAD 3 billion, a source familiar with the plan told L’Economiste. The assets of the sale would “serve to amortize the [state] debt and improve the institution’s cash flow,” the source said. Economy minister Mohamed Benchaaboun estimated that the treasury’s deficit in 2018 would end at 3.8 percent instead of 3 percent of GDP as planned for in the 2018 Finance Bill. Without revenue from privatization, the budget deficit is expected to stay almost flat at 3.7 percent in 2019. The privatization plan will generate MAD 10 billion, Benchaaboun told l’Economiste Friday. Benchaaboun said that Morocco will privatize some public companies to help reduce the budget deficit to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2019.  Previously, on October 22, Benchaaboun had estimated privatization would generate MAD 8 billion. The La Mamounia decision comes to improve the governance of public companies and increase state resources. “The hotel had stopped distributing dividends to shareholders for eight to 10 years through 2017, mainly because of the repayment of loans obtained to fund a major overhaul, Marrakech Mayor Mohamed Larbi Belkaid told Bloomberg. La Mamounia hotel is a prestigious hotel known worldwide. It was built in 1923 and received a makeover at the hands of French designer Jacques Garcia in 2009. The hotel has earned many awards since its reopening in 2009. In February, interior design magazine Architectural Digest listed La Mamounia among the “7 Most Historically Significant Hotels in the World.” On May 10, the Spanish version of UK travel magazine Condé Nast Traveler awarded La Mamounia “Best Urban Hotel in the World.” Many worldwide celebrities have visited La Mamounia. Winston Churchill was a frequent visitor of the hotel, and he described it as “one of the most beautiful places in the world” to Franklin Roosevelt in 1943, wrote the Architectural Digest.  Statesmen, Hollywood stars, artists, and literary figures, including Charles de Gaulle, Charlie Chaplin, Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, and Yves Saint Laurent, have all stayed at the hotel. Morocco’s state-run railway network ONCF owns 60 percent of La Mamounia. The state-owned investment management fund, Caisse de Depot and Gestion (CDG), and the city council of Marrakech own 20 percent each.  The privatization is part of the actions that the government plans to restore state coffers to avoid an increase in the budget deficit. In addition to La Mamounia, the Moroccan government also plans to privatize the Tahaddart thermal power station in northern Morocco.  The Tahaddart site opened in 2005 in the Tangier region and has a capacity of 385 megawatts. Shareholders include the Moroccan National Office of Electricity (ONEE), the Spanish Endesa company and Siemens.  According to L’Economiste, ONEE owns 48 percent of the station, Endesa 32 percent and Siemens 20 percent. The Tahaddart station building cost MAD 3 billion to build.

Rabat- Miri Regrev, Israel’s culture and sports minister, visited the UAE’s largest mosque on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi Grand Slam. Regrev toured the UAE’s Sheikh Zayed grand mosque, the world’s third largest mosque on Sunday. Wearing traditional Arab grab, the Israeli minister was spotted touring the grand mosque as a delegation of UAE officials accompanied her. In a Hebrew-language video Regrev later posted on Facebook, she spoke warmly of her visit and the hospitality of her hosts. She said the first visit by an Israeli official to the Muslim holy place was a “wonderful opportunity” and “a message of peace and unity.”
“I am happy that I was privileged to be the first senior official from Israel to sign the mosque’s guest book,” she said on Facebook. Hours before the mosque tour on Sunday, the Israeli official watched the Israeli judo team win the gold medal at the Abu Dhabi Grand Slam. In an emotional burst, the Israeli minister fought back her tears as her country’s national anthem was sung in a state that does not formally recognize the state of Israel. “It’s a dream come true. For two years we had talks in order to reach this moment and it was hard to stop the tears. I want to thank the authorities in Abu Dhabi and our hosts here who received us in an exemplary manner,” she said afterwards. The Abu Dhabi grand mosque visit was the first time an Israeli official has visited the Gulf state since 1996. Israeli news outlets have described the visit and the singing of the Israeli anthem as a sign of “normalization” of diplomatic ties between the two countries. The visit, they said, marks the beginning of “sea change in Israel’s diplomatic push in the Arab world.” Four days prior to Regrev’s Abu Dhabi moment, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited neighboring Oman. Speaking on Sunday about the positives of the two visits, he said that it was all “thanks to diplomatic efforts in the Arab world.” He then promised that “there will be more” of such visits. In the predominantly pro-Palestine Arab world, however, the signs of slow rapprochement between Israel and the Gulf states have raised questions about the fate of the Palestinians. The Palestinian cause, as the struggle of Palestinians is known is the Arab world, has been a rallying cry for Arab states, traditionally making it the first point of order in an eventual normalization process with Israel.

MP Abdellatif Ouahbi has called on the government to disclose the alleged study that informed the decision to stay on Daylight Saving Time (DST) year-round. The minister delegate in charge of the reform of administration and public service, Mohamed Benabdelkader, said Friday, October 26 that the government had conducted a study on the time change while he announced its last-minute decision to stay on DST (GMT+1). Ouahbi, a member of the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM), told Morocco World News today that Moroccan television channels and officials said that the decision was based on surveys and reports conducted by the government. “I want to see these reports,” Ouahbi said. “No problem, show us the report so we can read them. If you can convince us with your reports, then everything will be good,” Ouahbi told MWN. He added that he is “totally against the government’s decision until they can convince me  about the psychological and the socio-economic objectives of this decision.” The decision came at the last minute, he said, as he contrasted it with the EU’s potentially similar move away from time change in 2019 after studies and surveys. “We have not done anything alike. The EU took more than 2 years to decide on the issue. For us it took only two minutes to take this decision,” Ouahbi told MWN. On Friday, October 26, the government adopted Draft Decree 2.18.855, adding 60 minutes to Standard Time in Morocco, moving Morocco to GMT+1 year-round. The announcement came two days before Morocco was set to turn its clocks back on Sunday, October 28. As of today, clocks set by the internet are still displaying GMT, as if Morocco had returned to Standard Time. The decision confused the public, and some have called on the government to reverse the decision. However, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said that it will be risky for the government to reverse its decision and change back to Standard Time. He said that the government adopted the decree primarily to reduce energy consumption. It remains to be seen whether the government will make the survey public after the heavy criticism.

While acknowledging that the decision has some negative impacts, El Othmani said the government made the decision to reduce energy consumption. At Parliament, El Othmani said on Monday that the government knows that the change was “confusing and harmful.” He added that the effects of time change are limited to one week or the first 10 days. He said that the government knows that there are many people who are against the decision. However, he said it would be “risky to go back to Standard Time, because we want to ensure sustainability in the supply of electricity.” Amid criticism, El Othmani said that the government wants to “prevent our plants from buying surplus fuel and additive expenses by buying electricity from neighbors.” He asserted, “The electricity supply must be continuous all day long and throughout the year, but in the summer, we have a peak in electricity consumption that poses risks … and that can sometimes lead to power cuts.” El Othmani added that the only solution is to stay on DST to “prevent this from happening, we use summer time to ease the pressure … as the statistics show that in the last three years, there has been a steady rise in energy consumption.” El Othmani claimed that DST will save Morocco MAD 240 million annually. He told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that the government “attentively follow’s the public’s opinions” on staying on the DST. During his statement to the press, El Othmani continuously repeated that the government is aware of the anger and dissatisfaction of citizens regarding the move. However, he said that the move will end confusion among citizens.  “People have expressed dissatisfaction with the change of time four times a year, which causes a lot of confusion.”  The government did little to alleviate confusion when it cancelled the time change back to Standard Time less than two days before the switch was set to happen. People were more confused about the government’s about-turn decision than the seasonal time switch from DST to Standard Time. As of Tuesday, clocks set by the internet are still showing Standard Time (GMT) instead of remaining on DST (GMT+1). He continued that the change will be accompanied by several measures. The changes started with the new timetable for school children.  “The first impact is on children going to school early in the morning,” he said. Because of the later sunrise, instead of 8 a.m., children will go to school at 9 a.m. and will have to go back home at 1 p.m. instead of 12 noon. Students will have a one-hour lunch break instead of the traditional 2-hour lunch break. Morocco will still make two-time changes per year. El Othmani said that Morocco will go back to GMT over Ramadan. Morocco used to change time four times a year. Traditionally, the government announces the change to Standard Time at the end of October. Moroccans go back to DST again in March. When Ramadan falls in the summer, Morocco goes back to Standard Time again for five or six weeks. After Ramadan, Moroccans switch back to DST again. The abrupt decision to remain on DST has caused confusion and anger. Informal online polls by Moroccan news outlets, including Morocco World News, showed that the majority of voters were against the decision.

Rabat – Israel’s national anthem has been played for the first time at the Abu Dhabi Grand Slam in the United Arab Emirates. The Israeli anthem was played during the presentation of the gold medal to Israeli judoka, Sagi Muki, for his victory in judo in the under 81 kilogram category. The Israeli judo team was participating for the first in the tournament with its flag and anthem. “I’m so happy, I managed to use this opportunity, so that everyone could hear the anthem for the first time here in Abu Dhabi,” Muki said to an Israeli television channel after he had sung along with the anthem. In July, the International Judo Federation (IJF), warned the organizers of the Abu Dhabi Grand Slam that they might cancel the competition if Abu Dhabi did not allow all athletes, including Israelis, to compete with their flag and anthem.  The Israeli minister of sports and culture, Miri Regev, who was standing next to the podium, could not hold back her tears. It was her first time to attend an event in the Middle East. For his part, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took to his Facebook page to thank Muki for the pride and honor that he brought to Israel, emphasizing that the national anthem was played in Abu Dhabi. At the 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Slam, Israeli athletes wore neutral kimonos without the initials SRI that designate Israel in sports competitions. The three letters were replaced by IJF, standing for International Judo Federation. The United Arab Emirates does not recognize Israel as a state and does not have diplomatic ties with it.

By Mohammed Hikal Although it was launched Monday, until it becomes fully operational in January, “Istanbul Airport,” as it is called, will only serve a limited number of domestic flights and international flights to Azerbaijan and Cyprus, according to Turkish Airlines. The airport is expected to eventually handle 90 million passengers each year. The former transport minister, Ahmet Arslan, had previously claimed that the new airport would receive all flights coming into and out of Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport within 48 hours of its opening on Monday. In 10 years, Turkey plans to expand Istanbul Airport to approximately 19,000 acres with six runways, serving 200 million travelers by 2029, which would make it the world’s busiest airport. “With the operation of Istanbul Airport, European airspace will have to be restructured,” Erdogan said at the opening ceremony. Until a metro starts operating in two years’ time, a network of buses and other public transport will help passengers move to and from the city. “With this airport we aim to bring the world closer together with a major hub at the intersection of Asia, Europe, and the Middle East,” Kadri Samsunlu, head of the 5-company consortium Istanbul Grand Airport, told the Independent newspaper. “Our challenge is to be the biggest and the best.” The airport has received a lot of criticism over poor working conditions and the rush to meet Erdogan’s deadlines. According to the Ministry of Labor, 27 construction workers have died since the launch of the project in 2015. Turkey has also detained hundreds of protesting workers. “The airport has become a cemetery,” Nihat Demir, the head of a construction workers’ union, told the Associated Press. The Dev-Yapi-Is union calculated at least 37 construction deaths and “claimed more than 100 dead remain unidentified,” according to the Independent. However, the minister of labor denied the allegations and said the deaths were due to health problems and traffic accidents.

By Mohamed Bella The French-Moroccan film “Tazzeka” will be screened in Moroccan cinema theaters starting November 7. Jean-Philippe Gaud directed the movie, which stars Mahdi Belemlih, Ouidad Elma, Olivier Sitruk, and Abbes Zahmani. The movie follows the trajectory of a young man’s clandestine journey from Morocco to Paris. Elias was born and bred in the Moroccan village of Tazzeka where he learned the secrets of cooking good food. His grandmother had instilled in him a passion and love for cuisine.  Encountering a chef de cuisine from Paris and falling for a young woman will both turn Elias’ life upside down and prompt him to go to the City of Lights to experience the Western dream. In Paris, Elias faces financial hardship and precarious work as an undocumented immigrant. However, his new friend Souleymane presents a glimmer of hope reviving Elias’ passion for cooking. “Tazzeka” is a realistic reflection on issues of migration, exile, secrecy, delinquency, isolation, and integration. Jean-Philippe Gaud told Africa Vivre, “Tazzeka was born out of the desire to make a film that can talk about immigration issues with a ray of hope and a less dramatic way than we usually see in the news.” Some of the scenes in the movie were shot in Chefchaouen in northern Morocco in the spring of 2016.  “Morocco has imposed itself on me for various personal reasons that are related to my culture which is rooted in the Mediterranean basin.… Beyond the fact that it is a culture that is more familiar to me, a French-speaking country like Morocco seemed to me more relevant to address the question of the Western dream.” Jean-Philippe explained.

Rabat – The National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) has arrested 26 suspected members of a criminal network in Oujda and Berkane in northeast Morocco. Based on intelligence information provided by the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST) in coordination with local Oujda police, the BNPJ dismantled a network making forged documents and involved in irregular migration on Monday, October 29. Of the 26 suspects arrested, 12 are Algerian nationals.
The BNPJ seized a laptop, a hard disk, mobile phones, administrative documents, and other materials used for document forgery. The network used the forged documents to enable Algerian nationals to live in Morocco with forged Moroccan identification. Police will undertake further investigations and interrogate the suspects to gather evidence and demonstrate any possible ramifications and links of the network in Morocco and elsewhere. The arrests are part of Morocco’s war on terror, organized crime, and all activities that threaten the country’s sovereignty and security.

The campaign organizers described the move as a “message of unity” and shared humanity.  They argued that it is now more than ever crucial to stand united against the divisive forces of current American politics. In the online message that launched the fundraising campaign, organizers said they wished to “respond to evil with good” as Islam commands. The fundraising, they explained, is aimed at sending a vibrant message of compassion through action. All collected funds would go to the Tree of Life synagogue shooting victims, “whether it is the injured victims or the Jewish families who have lost loved ones.” “We wish to respond to evil with good, as our faith instructs us, and send a powerful message of compassion through action. Our Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said: ‘Show mercy to those on earth, and the One in the Heavens will show mercy to you.’ The Quran also teaches us to ‘Repel evil by that which is better.’” CelebrateMercy and Mpower Change, the two Muslim organizations that started the campaign, went beyond a message of simple largesse in a time of crisis, however. They argued that such expressions of generosity convey the message of a necessary and genuine interfaith dialogue to counter seeds of division facing the US and the world. “While these senseless acts have filled us with sorrow, we reflect on the message of unity, tolerance, and mutual protection found in the Constitution of Medina: a historic social contract between the Medinan Jews and the first Muslim community.” They called on other faiths to contribute, promising that the funds raised would immediately be transferred to “our local partner on the ground: The Islamic Center of Pittsburgh (ICP).”  ICP, for its part, “will be working directly with the Tree of Life synagogue to distribute funds to affected families.” The Muslim-led campaign of unity and compassion comes at an emotionally-charged time for the American Jewry, which grieves the tragic death of 11 of its members. The attack, which has been described by US authorities as a hate crime, occurred at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as the neighborhood’s Jewish community convened to celebrate the Sabbath. Minutes into the religious celebration, Robert Bowers, who is now being described as a white supremacist, entered the synagogue shouting, “Death to all Jews.” He then opened fire on the crowd, killing 11 and injuring dozens of others. The incident has since reignited debates about topics as ranging and divisive as the rise of the extremist far fight, surging anti-Semitism, and US regulations on guns.

Rabat- A Casablanca court has sentenced a qaid (official) in Hay El Hassani neighborhood to six years in jail on charges of administrative corruption. The criminal court of Ain Sebaa in Casablanca convicted the Hay El Hassani’s official of several corruption counts, reported Moroccan news outlet Hespress on Sunday. Charged with bribery, fraud, and abuse of power, the official was subject to a months-long investigation by the Judicial Police Division after he received large amounts of money from citizens he promised to employ. The same court has also convicted nine other individuals from six months to six years in prison, including an officer, the head of an unnamed organization, and an entrepreneur charged with fraud and bribery. Najim Bensami, the King’s attorney general at Casablanca’s Court of Appeals, previously ordered the prosecution the head of Hay Limouna in Hey El Hassani Prefecture, who had received MAD 100,000 in bribes. Police confiscated the money and landholdings of Hay Limouna’s head, who had held the position for 14 years, Bensami said. Similar arrests have continued to make headlines in Morocco since the launch of Morocco’s anti-corruption hotline on May 14. In the same month, the Public Prosecution Office in the Ministry of Justice reported that it had registered 599 calls from witnesses reporting corruption. The initiative comes in line with the government’s national plan to end all forms of corruption by 2050. Compared to 2016, Morocco improved slightly in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index in 2017, owing to the government’s efforts to counter administrative corruption, abuse of power, and public funds mismanagement.

Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid has stressed that Morocco is continuously developing in human rights. However, the development has experienced “some ebb and flow,” Ramid said in a meeting on “The Defense Institution and its Position in the National Action Plan on Democracy and Human Rights.” The Tangier Bar Association organized the meeting, which was held Friday. “We are at a significant stage of human rights development because we are laying solid foundations for building a state which respects human rights. We are in the process of establishing protective institutions and guaranteeing laws,” Ramid said. The minister cited such institutions as the National Preventive Mechanism Against Torture and the Authority for Parity and for Fighting All Forms of Discrimination. Ramid stressed that the importance of the national action plan lies in the fact that it is the “only document” whose texts have been approved, whether through direct consultation, correspondence, or contributions by the human rights institutional actors and civil society. The minister noted that ministries, government sectors, national councils, Parliament, judges, lawyers, the media, civil society, political parties, and trade unions all participated in developing the national action plan. The minister also noted that Morocco is the 39th country in the world to develop a national plan for democracy and human rights. The plan, he added, included 216 measures, which were increased to 435 measures after consultation, including those considered controversial, such as the death penalty and abortion. “We are working on an executive plan which will translate the plan into practical procedures with deadlines and will define the actors involved in its implementation,” the minister said. Speaking about the independence of the judiciary, Ramid described it as the “first institution that protects of rights and freedoms.” The minister stressed that defense lawyers are essential partners in judicial security and protecting citizens’ rights. The plan has not yet been published in the Official Gazette, but received the government’s approval in December 2017. Ramid expressed his anger over the 10-month delay in publishing the national plan in the official gazette. As an expression of his resentment, the minister reportedly boycotted the last four government council meetings. “The National Action Plan provides a blueprint for the promotion of the human rights situation, as well as an indicator of the evolution of human rights in Morocco, through a follow-up of the implementation of its measures,” Ramid asserted. Freedom House gave Morocco an overall score of 39/100 for political rights and civil liberties in 2018.

The US, in its capacity as penholder of the resolution, submitted the draft resolution on Western Sahara to all members of the Security Council Friday evening, October 26.  After receiving the draft resolution, the 15 members of the Security Council will hold their first meeting today at 2 p.m. in New York (7 p.m. Moroccan time) to discuss the MINURSO mandate. The document, which was obtained by Morocco World News, called for a six-month extension of the MINURSO mandate, instead of the traditional 12-month extension.  The draft requested that the MINURSO mandate, set to expire October 31, be extended until April 30, 2019. MINURSO’s mandate was only extended for six months in April 2018. Aside from the issue of the duration of MINURSO’s mandate, the draft resolution added a new operative paragraph in which it calls on the Polisario to refrain from taking any action that might change the status quo in the buffer zone. The Security Council “calls the parties to respect their relevant obligations and assurances, and refrain from any actions that could undermine UN-facilitated negotiations or further destabilize the situation in the Western Sahara, and further calls on the Frente Polisario to fully adhere to its commitments to the Personal Envoy with respect to the buffer strip at Guerguerat and Bir Lehlou,” the draft resolution reads. US wants a quick fix The rationale for the six-month period, the draft elaborated, is to “emphasize the need to achieve a realistic, practicable and enduring political solution to the question of Western Sahara based on compromise and the importance of aligning the strategic focus of MINURSO.”   UN resources should be channelled to push for an effective and rapid diplomatic process to ensure an end to the decades-long standstill, it added. The move is in line with the US position. Reports earlier this month had indicated that Washington wanted a shorter extension period to pressure the conflicting parties to commit to the UN-led political process.  John Bolton, the US national security advisor, is known for his views on keeping MINURSO operational in the disputed territory of Western Sahara. During his 2005-2006 tenure as the US representative to the UN, Bolton said MINURSO was an obstacle rather than a broker to finding a lasting and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. The length of the ongoing diplomatic stalemate has convinced the current Trump administration that the situation on the ground is “no longer business as usual,” according to diplomatic sources. By requesting a considerable shortening of the UN peacekeeping mission, the US hopes to “nudge the parties back to the negotiating table,” political analyst Sarah Feuer recently wrote in a Washington Institute policy brief. The shift in policy, she contended, “aligns with the Trump administration’s general strategy of disrupting the status quo, including in matters of diplomacy,” to get quick fixes. According to the US, the traditional one-year extension annually granted to MINURSO contributed to its ineffectiveness and prolonged hostility between Morocco and the Algeria-backed Polisario Front. France at odds with US France, however, supported the recommendation of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called for a one-year extension to the MINURSO mandate in the Western Sahara report he gave the Security Council on October 3. Guterres said a one-year extension would give him and his emissary, Horst Kohler, the time and space to establish conditions to allow the UN-led political process to continue. A source at the United Nations told Morocco World News yesterday that the Security Council would postpone the adoption of a new resolution on the Western Sahara conflict to Wednesday, October 31. The draft resolution was submitted to the members of the Security Council on Friday night. The source said the US was unable to submit the draft resolution earlier last week due to differences with France on the duration of MINURSO mandate. Calls for Algeria, Mauritania to step up The draft resolution also encourages parties and neighboring countries to the conflict to “demonstrate further political will towards a solution including by expanding upon their discussion of each other’s proposals.” Subsequently, the resolution expressed “full support” for Guterres’ and Kohler’s intention to renew the “negotiation process before the end of 2018,” referring to invitations to Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and Polisario to engage in a round-table in Geneva. The document noted that all parties agreed to attend the round table December 5-6. The draft also “encourages them to work constructively with the Personal Envoy, in the spirit of compromise, throughout the duration of this process to ensure a successful outcome.” The resolution also called on neighboring countries (without naming them) to “make contributions to the political process.” This might be a diplomatic gain for Morocco as it has been insisting that Algeria must engage in talks to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the 42-year-long conflict. In contrast to Morocco’s demands, Algeria considers itself an observer to the conflict. Like any other resolution, the document supported the efforts of Guterres, Kohler, and Special Representative and Head of MINURSO Colin Stewart to find a consensual solution to the conflict. The document also recalled Kohler’s visit to the headquarters of MINURSO and Western Sahara in August. The Security Council is set to adopt the new resolution on Western Sahara on Wednesday, October 31. It remain to be seen whether the members of the Security Council will vote for a six month or a one-year extension for the MINURSO mandate.

Rabat- A 30-year-old female suicide bomber blew herself up Monday afternoon in Tunis, injuring nine people. Habib Bourguiba Avenue, in the center of Tunis, was shaken by a “terrorist explosion” that wounded eight policemen and one civilian, Tunisian interior ministry spokesman Sofiene Zaag told Agence France Presse (AFP). Officials say the explosion took place near police vehicles and Le Palmarium shopping center in the city’s busiest location which is often frequented by tourists.  Mohamed Ekbal bin Rajib, an eyewitness, told Reuters, “I was in front of the theatre and heard a huge explosion and saw people fleeing.” Photos of the suicide bomber’s corpse at the scene have circulated social media.  Tunisia, especially its capital city has been haunted by terrorist attacks since 2015, when a mass shooting by Islamist terrorists claimed the lives of 21 foreign tourists at Bardo Museum in Tunis.

Rabat – Sunday’s drop in temperatures throughout Morocco has led to the first snowfall, reaching 30 centimeters in Ifrane.  Ifrane, known as Morocco’s “Switzerland,” is not used to seeing snowfall this early before winter. Most snow falls in January. With snow-covered evergreens and steep-peaked houses, Ifrane becomes a winter wonderland with each snowfall. The temperature in Ifrane was -1 degree Celsius yesterday.  Locals in the Atlas Mountain villages of Imouzzer, El Hajeb, and Boulemane and the city of Midelt also woke up to snow on the ground.  The National Meteorological Directorate predicts strong winds Monday—from 70 to 90 kilometers per hour—in the regions of Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima, Fez-Meknes, Rabat-Sale-Kenitra, Beni Mellal-Khenifra, and Casablanca-Settat. Heavy rains, from 30 to 50 millimeters, are forecasted for Tuesday between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. in Chefchaouen, Fahs-Anjra, Kenitra, Larache, Ouazzane, Tangier-Assilah, and Tetouan. Rain is also forecasted for Tuesday and Wednesday in Al Haouz, Azilal, Beni Mellal, Boulemane, Ifrane, Khenifra, and Midelt. Cold temperatures, between -3 and 10 degrees Celsius, will dominate Al Haouz, Azilal, Beni Mellal, Boulemane, Figuig, Guercif, Ifrane, Jerada, Khenifra, Midelt, Ouarzazate, Sefrou, Taza, and Tinghir.

Rabat- A photo of the Casablanca mayor making himself comfortable in a first class train cabin has gone viral, triggering the criticism and mockery of Moroccans. The photo showing Mayor Abdelaziz El Omari, a Justice and Development Party (PJD) member, seated nonchalantly with his socked feet resting on the seat in front of him in a first class ONCF shuttle train cabin, has inspired online controversy. Moroccans were especially angry because train rules forbid passengers from acts like putting their feet up on the seats or invading other passengers’ seats. The photo, which has been circulating social media since Sunday, has been shared with captions such as “photo of the day” and received sharp comments criticizing El Omari’s attitude, posture, and even his clothes.  Of having “the luxury” to take his shoes off, one Facebook users quipped:“I don’t know what shocks me the most in this photo, his indifferent attitude, or his white socks.”  Recently, Casablanca’s inhabitants have been denouncing the city’s condition, mainly pollution and “bad odor” spreading through its outskirts and destroying the environment. Some of the commentators went as far with the sarcasm as to blame the bad smell in the city on the mayor’s socks. “So these socks are the cause of the unbearable smell in Casa[blanca]!,” the Facebook commentator wrote.    Chers Casablancais, cette personne mal élevée, n’est autre que votre maire, qui, entre autres, est du même parti que votre @ChefGov_ma pic.twitter.com/CiwW1tEndK — Nawfal Laarabi ? (@nawfal) October 27, 2018 Aside from the controversy following the train passenger who happened to be the economic city’s mayor, the National Railway Office (ONCF) train itself is caught in a controversy of its own. Last week, Moroccan passengers decided they have had enough of the continued train delays of the only rail transport provider in the country, ONCF, calling for a boycott. A crowd of passengers blocked the tracks at Temara train station near Rabat, just south of Rabat, on Friday, October 26, due to a delay that lasted for three hours. Angry protesters told Morocco World News that they had been waiting for their train since 7 a.m. They left the tracks at 11 a.m. One bystander told MWN at Temara train station:“Most people here are commuter train travelers [Kenitra-Casablanca]. People arrive [at work] half an hour to one hour late, it has become a habit.” Some even lost their jobs due to the daily delays. What had added to the anger and frustration of travelers was the “uncooperative” officials of ONCF, the “intimidating” police who tried to clear the protest, and lack of explanations and action to solve the delays. The week before, Morocco and ONCF were shaken by a tragic catastrophe after train No. 9 linking Rabat and Kenitra on the Casablanca-Kenitra line derailed near Bouknadel on Tuesday, October 16, at 10:20 a.m., killing 7 and injuring 125. Moroccans put the blame at ONCF after a recording of a conversation between ONCF employees went viral. The recording said that faulty tracks and absence of speed-limit signs caused the accident.

Rabat- Low cost carrier Air Arabia Maroc has launched three new flights to Dakhla from Casablanca, Marrakech, and Tangier. The flights will be operated by an Airbus A320 with 174 seats. The launching ceremony took place in Dakhla in Western Sahara on Sunday with the attendance of the wali (governor) of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region, Lamine Benomar; the president of the regional council, Khattat Yanja; and the general director of Air Arabia Maroc, Laila Mechbal. Yanja told the press that the  new flights are a result of an agreement between the regional council and the airline. The agreements aim to give a new impetus to Dakhla’s tourism and to realize “the socio-economic development in this Moroccan region.” He added that the regional council seeks to support local development to promote the region’s economic and tourism assets. According to Yanja, another purpose of the flights is to attract more investment and to increase trade between Dakhla-Oued Eddahab and other parts of Morocco and beyond. Mechbal told Maghreb Arab Press ( MAP) that the new flights will help boost domestic tourism and promote trade between Dakhla-Oued Eddahab and other regions of Morocco. The airline has set ticket prices at MAD 500, according to Mechbal. She hoped to encourage citizens to visit Dakhla, a “city of national and world renown, and to discover the natural touristic and cultural potential of the region.”. She said the Ministry of Tourism and the Directorate of Air Transport helped launch the flights. Daifallah Andour, regional tourism commissioner, claimed the initiative will have a positive impact on “the influx of tourists to the region.” He added that he expects a 50 percent increase in the number of visitors following the launch of the flights.

Rabat – In power since 1999, Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika is seeking re-election for a fifth term at elections in 2019. The National Liberation Front (FLN) chairman Djamel Ould Abbes confirmed the president’s decision on Sunday. “Bouteflika… is the candidate of the FLN for the presidential election,” Ould Abbes said. He added that FLN members demanded Bouteflika’s candidacy. Ould Abbes’ chief of staff Nadir Boulegroune told the AFP news agency that the FLN central committee will meet to “formalise the candidacy” of the 81-year old president. It is no surprise that Bouteflika is seeking re-election for a fifth term; FLN had previously announced that they are in favor of his continued leadership. Bouteflika suffered a debilitating stroke in 2013. Several analysts and journalists recommended Bouteflika withdraw from the presidential election, questioning  his ability to lead. Some have also accused the Algerian regime of manoeuvers to make Bouteflika’s campaign successful. Throughout the year, Algeria has sacked several top military officers for alleged corruption. However, for analysts, the purge of military officers is a clearing of the way for Bouteflika’s candidacy. In September, the Alternative News Agency of Argentina published an article by Adalberto Agozino who analyzed the political earthquake in Algeria’s military. The analyst interpreted Algeria’s sacking of military officers as a means to “steal” the next election and questioned Bouteflika’s ability to fulfill a fifth term as president. Former French Ambassador to Algeria Bernard Bajolet also questioned Bouteflika’s ability to lead. He said that Bouteflika is kept alive “artificially.”

According to L’Observateur Du Maroc et d’Afrique, the incident was caused by the explosion of six gas cylinders. The state-owned news agency, Maghreb Arab Press, has not yet published any official information about the incident. Videos on social media show several tents catching fire during the incident. No damages were sustained, according to local news outlets.

A similar incident occurred in July, when a fire broke out during the evacuation of a group of undocumented sub-Saharan migrants from a property owned by the National Railway Office (ONCF) near Fez’ train station. The fire resulted in damage to nearly 50 plastic shelters used by migrants. The blast also caused the explosion of seven small gas cylinders that migrants used to cook, local authorities of the prefecture of the Fez-Meknes region said at the time. Every year, hundreds of sub-Saharan migrants arrive in Morocco, using perilous crossing from the North African country to Europe.  Saturday’s incident took place at a sensitive moment as the government is stepping up efforts to find concrete solutions to tackle migration issues. Morocco has refused to house reception centers of migrants to the EU. In a recent interview with German news outlet Die Welt, Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita reiterated Morocco’s position against reception centers. “Morocco is generally against all kinds of centers. It is part of our migration policy and it’s a position in the name of national sovereignty,” he said.

A source at the United Nations told Morocco World News that the draft resolution has not been presented yet to the “rest of the members of the Security Council.” Traditionally, the members of Group of Friends for Western Sahara hold a couple of meetings during which they agree on the overall language of the draft resolution.  The small group, which includes, the US, France, the UK, Russia, and Spain, circulates the Western Sahara draft resolution to all Council members a few days ahead of the adoption of the resolution.  However, the first meeting of the group took place only Thursday, October 25.  MWN’s source said that that the US, penholder of the resolution,  has been unable to submit the draft resolution due to some differences with France on the duration of MINURSO’s mandate. France wants the mandate to be renewed for one year, while the US is in favor of a six-month extension only. Morocco, France,  and the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres,  are all in favor of a one-year extension for the UN mission in Western Sahara. In his annual report on Western Sahara, submitted to the Security Council on October 3, the UN chief said that a one-year extension would be beneficial for the UN-led political process. Guterres said in his report that a one-year extension would give him and his personal envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, time and space to create the necessary conditions to allow the UN-led political process to move forward. On Monday, October 22, Morocco’s ambassador to the US Lalla Joumala met with US Under Secretary for Political Affairs David Hale. An official source, who asked to speak on the condition of anonymity, told MWN that the Moroccan ambassador sought to garner Trump’s administration support for a one-year extension for the MINURSO mandate. Following Hale’s meeting with Lalla Joumala, the US Department of State said that Guterres met with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Hale on Tuesday, October 23. Though the communique of the US Department of State did not specify the agenda of the meeting, its timing suggests that the UN chief is trying to lobby the Department of State to endorse its recommendation for a one-year extension for MINURSO’s mandate.  It remained to be seen whether the UN chief’s efforts have been successful in convincing the American administration, especially President Donald Trump’s national security advise rJohn Bolton, to mollify its position.  Bolton has been notorious for his less-than-friendly opinions about the UN whether when he was US ambassador to the UN between 2005-2006 or after he left his position.  Bolton, who served on the team of former UNSG Personal Envoy for Western Sahara, James Baker, between 1997-2004, has often slammed the UN and denounced its ineffectiveness in resolving the issues on its agenda.  Bolton has masterminded the Trump Administration’s decision to cut its contribution to MINURSO from $16 million to $8 million next year.

On October 26, Morocco World News conducted an online poll in which it asked whether Moroccans are for or against the decision to maintain the DST.   Eighty percent (862 voters) out of 1087 people voted against the move. Only 218 people said they are in favor of the decision. The majority of news outlets conducted similar polls, which showed similar results. Moroccans also created several Facebook pages and campaigns to vent their anger against the move. Parents of Moroccan students took to social media to express their rejection of the move and their worries about the long-term effects of such a decision. Most parents expressed their concerns about the negative impact of the DST on their children health and security, especially in mornings. In response, the Ministry of Education announced a new time-table for all public and private schools, vocational training institutes, and universities. The ministry said that schools will start at 9 a.m. and end at 6 p.m. Moroccan parents, however, argue that a one-hour lunch break is not enough, especially for students who live away from their schools. “The government takes a decision without taking into account citizens’ opinions. I have my daughter studying in Mohammed V high school in Kenitra. She takes the bus to get to school. The bus takes between 20 to 30 minutes to arrive to school,” a parent told Morocco World News. He added that his daughter “cannot do that anymore when she finishes school at 1 p.m. and has to get back at 2 p.m. I cannot afford to pay her launch every day.  The government should provide students with cafeterias. The situation is a total mess.” On October 27, Morocco’s National Federation of parents expressed their categorical rejection of the government decision. calling on the government to cancel its “hasty decision.”

The royal cabinet issued a statement on October 27 announcing King Mohammed VI’s decision to provide El Othmani with more time to “complete the mission” the King entrusted to him. During a  working session held on October 1, the King ordered the creation of a committee to elaborate specific solutions to curb youth unemployment. The King tasked the committee with proposing specific solutions to provide job opportunities to young Moroccans. He called on the government to create a new Vocational Training Programs, to create new training centers, to streamline vocational counseling, and to reinforce youth entrepreneurship programs. During the meeting, the King urged the government to accelerate the implementation of projects in favor of youth. The projects will focus on creating new training programs for sectors with high economic potential and upgrading training in more traditional sectors, such as handicrafts or agriculture. The projects will also implement new short-term training programs of about four months. The programs will aim to assist young people working in the informal sector, to strengthen their technical and language skills, and to integrate them in the formal sector. Three weeks later, El Othmani’s committee said his government needs more time to complete the mission. “Given the importance that the King gives to the promotion of the sector of vocational training, and his concern about the quality of programs and proposals that will be submitted to the Sovereign, the King approved this request,” said the statement. Vocational training and education have been key priorities King Mohammed VI’s recent speeches to the nation.  During the opening of Parliament’s fall session on October 12, the King said that “vocational training is a powerful lever for employment, provided it receives the attention it deserves and so long as it is given a new status as well as a broader scope.”

Surprised to find standard time on their phone screens, many Moroccans blamed mobile network operators. What time is it?

On Sunday morning, social media users expressed their anger and confusion about the situation. Many people were perplexed by the use of standard time on their phones.

Inwi told Morocco World News that the company “is not responsible for changing the clock time. This is a problem coming from the phones which are programmed automatically.”


The company added that “Morocco [is staying] on Daylight Saving Time. We are on GMT +1.”

Facebook and Twitter feeds quickly filled up with posts attempting to ascertain the actual time.

A government council adopted Draft Decree 2.18.855  on Friday, adding 60 minutes to the standard time in Morocco year-round.

The last-minute decision came only two days before Morocco was set to turn clocks back one hour, marking the end of Daylight Saving Time.

Tensions escalated when Minister Delegate for Administration Reform and Civil Service Mohamed Ben Abdelkader remarked that the sudden move was the result of an evaluative study that asserted the “adoption of ‘doubling timing’ has created a kind of confusion.”

The decision was based on various indicators that “take into account aspects relating to health, the energy economy, and the commercial transactions of the kingdom,” he said.

The government, however, never announced that it was studying the effects of time change, nor was there notice of an intent to permanently alter the time. 

A statement from Secretary-General of the Socialist Union of Popular Forces Party Driss Lachgar sparked outrage among Moroccans.

Lachgar said that Moroccan citizens are not against GMT+1, and he went on to declare debate on the issue wrong and unjustified.

He added that Moroccans would be ready to go to work at 5:00 AM if the government offered them such employment opportunities.

GMT+1 leaves door open for speculation

Rumors that Renault was behind the government’s decision to maintain GMT+1 abound.

General Directorate of Altitude RH Chikhi Adib spoke about the rumors in a comment on LinkedIn. He said that the time difference between Europe and Morocco will significantly damage the company’s expected revenue.  He added that “the CEO of Renault came to Morocco to personally demand the application of GMT+1 year-round.”

Furthermore, during a meeting between King Mohammed VI and Renault CEO Carlos Ghosn in Marrakech on Thursday, Ghosn and Elalamy informed the King of an extension project at the Renault plant that will double its production capacity by 2022.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested on Saturday an engineering student with alleged ties to ISIS in Mohammedia, a city located between Casablanca and Rabat. According to a statement from the BCIJ, the suspect “was planning a terrorism plot to undermine the stability of the country by using an explosive belt.” The statement added that BCIJ officials seized computers, two hard disks, several suspicious CDs and two mobile phones. During the operation the BCIJ also seized suspicious materials, including diving equipment, a wooden stick, electrical cables, a voltmeter, and an adhesive tape.  Authorities put the suspects in custody for further investigations to identify other potential suspects with links to terror groups. The operation followed a similar arrest in September in which 12 suspects with alleged ties to criminal and terror networks in Casablanca and Tangier were arrested.  BCIJ members have carried out several operations that resulted in the dismantling of terror cells with links to ISIS. In July, BCIJ officials arrested seven pro-ISIS extremists operating in central Morocco, near Agadir and Marrakech. During the same month, BCIJ arrested four suspects in four Moroccan cities: Casablanca, Nador, Tangier, and Tiznit. Ever since the Marrakech terror attack in 2011, Morocco has modernized and upgraded its security system to fight radicalization and organized crime.

Rabat- The Spanish government has proposed banning the speedboats that trafficking networks use to transport migrants and drugs from North Africa to Spain. The government proposed the ban of “go fast” and inflatable boats at a meeting on Friday in the Spanish Council of Ministers. The Spanish police have identified the go fast boat as one used by traffickers of cannabis or hash and by migrants across the Strait of Gibraltar to Spain from North African countries including Morocco. The decree will soon pass through the Spanish Parliament for its approval, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Morocco and the EU are cooperating to curb the flow of irregular migrants to Europe. Mustapha El Khalfi, Morocco’s government spokesperson, said that in 2017 Moroccan authorities stopped more than 65,000 irregular migrants from crossing to Europe. More than 1,500 migrants have died in the Mediterranean in 2018 while trying to reach Europe, according to UNHCR. On the drugs side, cannabis resin is one of the most exported drugs from Morocco and has continuously been the subject of seizures in recent years. The demand for the drug in Europe is high due to its powerful and high-yield hybrid varieties. Morocco is the largest supplier of cannabis resin to Europe, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In 2014, 302 tons and 85 percent of all cannabis resin seizures in Spain were linked to Morocco. According to the UNODC World Drug Report of 2017, Morocco has the third highest cannabis resin seizures of countries worldwide. The country comes behind Spain and Pakistan. Meanwhile, earlier in October, Spain dismantled a drug trafficking network trying to smuggle cannabis and advanced weapons into Morocco via speedboats. Spanish authorities stopped the boats carrying black market arms worth about MAD 8.23 million, ten minutes after their departure, reported Moroccan newspaper, Al Massae. Members of the dismantled network in Cadiz, a city in southwest Spain, confessed that in addition to smuggling machine guns and pistols, they had planned to traffick cannabis to Morocco.

Rabat – The Essaouira Atlantic Andalusia Festival will feature Said Belcadi, Sanaa Marahati, Andalucious and Hapiyout, and Haja El Hamdaouia and Raymonde El Bidaouia tonight. The festival, which opened earlier this week on October 25, continues to celebrate the “glorious and harmonious” past of the Judeo-Arabic memory and will galvanize fans and first time festival-goers in the last two days, organizers noted in an email shared with Morocco World News. Essaouira, a coastal city south of Casablanca, has long been a symbol of tolerance and socio-religious coexistence. According to Essaouira Mogador, the festival organizers, the city was the epitome of cultural exchange and religious dialogue. The remaining two days of the festival are set to continue in that direction of peaceful coexistence by “celebrating the Judeo-Islamic heritage of the Maghreb region.” Today’s program is scheduled to start at 4 p.m.. The first concert will be dedicated to the Andalusian poetic tradition. Moroccan singer Said Belcadi will immerse festival goers in the lyrically engrossing and spiritually enlivening poetry of Andalusia. The concert is expected to deliver an exceptional commemoration of the love and mysticism-loaded Andalusian poetry, organizers noted. It will be “a celebration of love and cultural encounters” through the thrilling power of poetry. At 5 p.m., Sanaa Marahati, a Moroccan master of traditional Melhoun and Gharnati music, will perform “a short foray into a history filled with vibrant memories of joy and sharing.” The penultimate concert of the day, at 9 p.m., will see a blending of voices, “a mixture of genres” to give a real feel of harmony when Judeo-Arabic verses of lyrical poetry are performed at once. That part of entertaining and educating through mingling different cultural expressions will be performed by Andalucious and Hapiyout, two bands whose musical styles cross boundaries between Islamic and Jewish musical traditions. Haja ElHamdaouia and Raymonde El Bidaouia, two strong voices in the Andalusian music genre, will give a joint performance, giving a final touch of “memorabilia” to the 15th anniversary of the first Essaouira Festival. The event closes its doors tomorrow, October 28, at 11 a.m. with the screening of “Les Guerriers de la paix” (The Peace Warriors), a 2018 movie on Jews and Palestinians foregrounding dialogue and putting their lives on the line for peace between Palestine and Israel. More than a mere nostalgic remembrance of a harmonious and joyous past between Muslim and Jewish Moroccans, however, organizers emphasized that the Essaouira Festival seeks to project itself in a future of peace between Jews and Arabs. Through classics of shared musical and poetic traditions, the festival envisions celebrating the possibility of peace and dialogue though cultural forms that transcend divisive rhetoric.

Rabat- Workers at the SAMIR oil refinery are calling on the government to bail out the company and stop the loss of jobs. SAMIR trade union members stood near the headquarters of the Ministry of Economy and Finance on Mohammed V Street in Rabat, on Thursday, carrying slogans and calling for “revival of production” and “protection of employees’ incomes.” Production at the SAMIR oil refinery has been decreasing since 2016. SAMIR’s employees are protesting “the government’s negative attitude” towards the company. They are asking the government to restore the quality of its fuel stocks and prices, re-open its lost 20,000 direct and indirect jobs, and cover its loss of MAD 20 billion in public money. The coordinator of the SAMIR trade union, Hussain al-Yamani, told Moroccan news outlet Hespress that the company’s main demand from the government is to “restore its normal production and keep the rights of its employees and dealers.” “This stand signifies a protest against the government in general,” al-Yamani stated. He specifically requested the cooperation of the economy and finance minister, Mohamed Benchaaboun, to help the company succeed. The Ministry of Economy and Finance holds a large portion of SAMIR’s debts, according to Hespress. Al-Yamani pointed out that the protest “coincides” with the government’s new plan to privatize companies, asserting that SAMIR should be taken as an example of a failed privatization. The government “should reconsider the privatization of some sectors … because privatization in our estimation is a loss from beginning to end.” Benchaaboun announced Monday, in a parliamentary session to present the 2019 draft budget, that the government seeks to privatize some public companies to improve their governance and help reduce the budget deficit to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2019. The move to increase state resources could generate MAD 8 billion. Increasing taxes on tobacco consumption will generate additional revenue estimated at MAD 1.2 billion in 2019, Benchaaboun asserted. With the privatization of SAMIR in 2016, 1,000 direct workers, and 1,500 indirect employees lost their jobs, according to Soraya Lahrache, member of the Democratic Confederation of Labor’s (CDT) executive office. The SAMIR case, she argued, is one of “lack of transparency, poor governance, and corruption.”. Established in 1959 with headquarters in Mohammedia, a coastal city north of Casablanca, SAMIR was ordered to be liquidated in 2016 by a Moroccan court. However, the company struggled to proceed and asked for several extensions in the liquidation process.  Starting in spring 2017, several foreign investors expressed interest in purchasing SAMIR. Employees have protested numerous times since SAMIR went into crisis caused by company losses since it stopped distributing fuel, said the company’s officials.

By Mohamed Hikal Sitting approximately 80 kilometers east of Agadir, Taroudant, or the “little Marrakech,” is an imperial town stretching out along the Souss Valley. The first thing a visitor will notice is the pentagon-shaped fortified wall that encircles the city. The Taroudant historical wall is the oldest wall in Morocco and the third most robust in the world, according to historian A. Hermas, after the Great Wall of China and the Kumbhalgarh Fort in India.  Though far older dynasties started building walls around the city, the Saadian dynasty, led by Mohammed Ash-Sheikh Saadi, built the current design of the wall and the city as a whole in the 16th century.   The Saadians built the defensive rampart for military purposes. It stands 8 to 10 meters high, 1.5 to 4 meters thick, and 8 kilometers long. More than 100 crenels, used to keep watch or shoot at enemies, top the wall.   The Saadians used Taroudant as a base to launch attacks against the Spanish and Portuguese armies, which occupied the regions around the coastal city of Agadir 80 kilometers away. The five large unbreachable gates, called “bab” in Arabic, were made of hard materials to withstand attack. The five entrances are known as Bab Zorgan, Bab Targhount, Bab Ouled Bounouna, Bab Lkhmis, and Bab Selsla. Bab Zorgan derives its name from the old mills or grinders that locals used to grind grains and sugar canes. Due to its proximity to the city’s bus and taxi station, a nearby gate, Bab Benyara, has been opened to facilitate traffic in out of the city.  Previously called “The Gate of Conquest,” Bab Targhount was the gate from which the Saadians started their attacks. It is considered the smallest with a 20 square meter yard. Locals say its name derives from a nearby stream. The previous local communal council had decided to use the yard for an art gallery exhibition, but someone set it on fire. The gate’s frame survived however, remaining intact thanks to its solid materials.  The name Bab Ouled Bonouna refers to a number of Andalusian families that settled in Taroudant after they were expelled from Andalusia in the 16th century.     Bab Lkhmis opened onto a space where local townspeople, or Roudanis, and  people from the Souss region did their shopping every Khmiss day (Thursday). It leads out towards the city graveyard that predates even the Saadians. The gate has a 78 square meter yard and a small mosque.  Bab Selsla is the main entrance through which the sultans and any formal convoys came. Just beside the gate are stairs that tourists use today to climb up to the terrace where they can see panoramic views of the.  Along with their military function, the wall and its gates served as control towers and checkpoints to monitor visitors, check salesmen, and collect taxes from caravans coming from nearby regions and wishing to do business in the city.  Taroudant’s kasbah, another historical site, used to be a military fort par excellence. It housed the sultan’s palace, a military base, a mosque, and a prison. The prison once housed insurgents and Portuguese captives.  In addition to the sultan’s palace in the kasbah, Taroudant boasts Dar El Baroud (the house of gunpowder), an immense late-19th-century palace built on the rubble of an earlier Saadian storehouse. As its name indicates, the Saadians used Dar El Baroud to store weapons. Unfortunately, the great edifice, which stretches out over several hectares, is not open to the public.  Today, large parts of the wall that were damaged have been repaired to preserve the city’s status as a tourist destination. Approximately 15-20,000 tourists visit the city each year to enjoy the sun and see the craft-work that has survived time. Taroudant has a working leather and wool industry with tanneries and traditional shops scattered inside the old medina (city).   The communal council and civil society have worked hard since 2015 to help the city regain its former glory. The Ministry of Culture and the municipal council are working hand in hand to save a town that seems to have lost much of its past.

Rabat – Hatice Cengiz, Jamal Khashoggi’s Turkish fiancée, has told a television outlet in Turkey that she recently declined President Trump’s invitation to the White House. Speaking to Haberturk TV on Friday, days after international pressure and Turkish media leaks compelled Saudi Arabia to admit that Khashoggi died at the hands of Saudi operatives, the teary Cengiz said that she doubted the sincerity of President Trump’s invitation. President Trump was sluggish to speak out in the Khashoggi case, Cengiz suggested. Days after the journalist’s disappearance on October 2, many in the international community started raising concerns. While Saudi Arabia originally denied all accusations, its narrative has shifted several times in the last three weeks. President Trump, however, when he could have exerted pressure on Saudi Arabia’s leadership, seemed to believe their accounts. According to Cengiz, Trump only wants to hone his own approval ratings by inviting her to the White House. He wants to show the US how much he cares when in fact he did not seem to care in the beginning of the Khashoggi saga, she argued. Cengiz also told Haberturk that she believed the White House’s invitation was a late desperate PR move to influence opinion in the US. She said she did not intend to be part of insincere efforts as she grieves her late fiancé. Tearfully recounting the day Jamal Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to never come back, Cengiz said she would not have let him go in if she had known that “Saudi Arabia would hatch a plot to kill him.” As international pressure mounts on Riyadh to clarify the circumstances of Khashoggi’s murder, Cengiz seized the opportunity to demand that her fiancé’s murderers be brought to justice. “I demand that all those involved in this savagery from the highest to the lowest levels are punished and brought to justice,” she said. Unheeded plea The interview is not Cengiz’s first public statement. A week Khashoggi’s disappearance, as Saudi Arabia strenuously denied that the journalist had been killed inside the consulate, Cengiz wrote a passionate op-ed in the Washington Post. She pleaded with Trump and Saudi Arabia to shed light in her fiancé’s case. “More than a week has passed since our last meeting outside the consulate of Saudi Arabia, before his disappearance became global news…. At this time, I implore President Trump and first lady Melania Trump to help shed light on Jamal’s disappearance. I also urge Saudi Arabia, especially King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to show the same level of sensitivity and release CCTV footage from the consulate.” Cengiz’s plea for Saudi Arabia to release evidence was not attended to, but the kingdom has been forced to admit that Khashoggi’s murder was planned.

By Samantha Tropper Rabat – Living in the southern part of the US, I’m frequently made aware that my looks are unique. I am different, and people want to know why. But in Morocco, ironically, my experience was the opposite. I was the same. I have the same hair color and texture, the same skin tone, the same eye color and shape, even a fairly similar facial form as many Moroccan women I saw. People did not inquire about my family background. That is, until I started talking. I was in Morocco learning Arabic, but I was studying Modern Standard Arabic, not Darija (the Moroccan dialect). Not knowing Darija, I struggled to understand native Moroccans when they spoke to each other. But people still spoke to me in Darija. I would respond in French, the language many Moroccans use with foreigners. Cue a pronounced look of surprise. “Oh, you are not Moroccan?” they would ask. They would be surprised again when I would say that I am American. I am not exactly the image that springs to mind when people envision a generalized American person. Morocco was not the first time I had this experience. I lived in Cairo for a few months in 2011, where I also fit in physically. I am familiar with the shocked expressions that come with discovering that I am, in fact, American, not North African. At that time, I was not sure how I felt about it all. But I have come to realize over the years and after more travel that this kind of assumption can seldom be negative. People love to fit in. People sometimes actively try to change things about themselves, whether they physically or in personality, in order to be accepted by their peers. I have done it. I have seen others do it. I feel like I would be hard pressed to find someone who has honestly never done that. It is not necessarily a bad thing.  So if other people go to great measures trying to be the same, why have I felt awkward in the past about being assumed to be the same, when, in reality, their perception of similarity is inaccurate? Does that matter anyway?  Of course, it matters that I am not actually North African. I would not pretend to be something that I am not. But it does not matter in the way that it matters that a dog is different from a snake because each one’s basic biological needs are vastly dissimilar. It matters because being American has brought me different life experiences than I would have had if I were Moroccan, simply because of geographical and cultural diversity. But it does not make it overly difficult to relate to others.  I have one advantage over the “stereotypical” American, however: I have a connection. I do not mean a connection because of language or the fact that I studied the Middle East and North Africa in college. I had an automatic connection with many people I met in Morocco before they knew any of that. My connection came from a relational conclusion, however inaccurate, that they presumed when they first saw me. Even after finding out that I am American, people were still interested and friendly, perhaps more so than if there were no obvious similarities between us. I lost count of how many times I was told, in English, “You have a Moroccan face,” especially by taxi drivers. I quickly realized the statement was meant as a compliment, and I enjoyed taking it as such! Since I was able to converse in French instead of only English, some great conversations then ensued after the typical exchange in which I told them I was American. I felt like I had an advantage, a privilege even, simply because of how my genes made my face look, genes which have quite the opposite effect in the US. So how can that assumption be a bad thing? It usually is not. I can change it too, if I want. If I responded as if I were offended by the assumption, presumably the conversation would not usually go in a positive direction. Each party has a share in the outcome of that seemingly inevitable assumption. But it works out well. In fact, during my entire 7-week stay in various parts of Morocco, of all the copious times I was greeted with the same surprised look, nothing negative ever occurred. Because of this perceived connection, I felt more relaxed around people I met and felt more included in daily life. I was given the opportunity to engage in the culture on a deeper level, almost as a part of it, instead of only as an outside observer. It was a great feeling. For that, I am proud of and grateful for my “Moroccan face.”

Rabat – The Ministry of Education has announced that schools will start at 9 a.m. and end at 6 p.m. with a lunch break between 1 and 2 p.m.  The ministry has set the new time-table for all public and private schools, vocational training institutes, and universities, the ministry said in a statement Saturday. The new time will be effective beginning Wednesday, November 7. The date marks the end of the first school holiday. The aim of the decision is “to adapt studying time to the new standard time.” The government decided yesterday not to set the clocks back on Sunday, but to maintain Daylight Saving Time (GMT+1) year-round. According to the ministry’s statement, the aim of the time change is “to ensure best conditions for students, including proper academic learning, taking into account the needs of families.” The schedule change will give students only one hour for lunch. Traditionally, students had a two-hour lunch break from noon to 2 p.m. Many students who live far from their schools may no longer have enough time to go home for lunch. Some students in Morocco take public buses to get back home for lunch, which they may no longer have the time for.. The new time-table, according to the ministry, will also enable all students to get to and from school or university safely by ensuring they leave school in the evening before dark.  The time-table change comes after the government council adopted Draft Decree 2.18.855 Friday, to stay on Daylight Saving Time (DST) year-round, changing Morocco’s standard time from GMT to GMT+1. Public schools usually open at 8 a.m., which would have been just 5-30 minutes after sunrise on November 7, if Morocco returned to GMT. The minister delegate in charge of the reform of administration and public service, Mohamed Benabdelkader, said on Friday that the government would take into consideration school time and administration time so that parents can accompany their children before going to work “without pressure.” According to Benabdelkader, the government’s decision to maintain DST year-round was based on “an evaluation study and many indicators.” He continued, “The indicators include health aspects related to time change, energy saving and Morocco’s commercial transactions.”

Rabat – Morocco’s deputy minister in charge of African cooperation has stressed that Morocco views immigration as a gain rather than a threat. Jazouli made the remarks at this year’s Forum of African Women Journalists in Casablanca on Friday, October 26. Titled “African Migrations, an Opportunity for the Continent, a Responsibility for the Media,” the forum discussed images often associated with human flows across and from Africa. At issue was also the responsibility of African media and political leaders to rise to the persisting challenge of African mobility. Meeting the challenges includes countering stereotypes and giving a balanced account of the reality of immigration, panelists concurred. While echoing the sentiment of stereotype-countering, Jazouli emphatically spoke of Morocco’s pan-African outlook in dealing with migration. He said that Morocco does not subscribe to the approach of countries that perceive migrants as threats to social and cultural identity. “Study after study have established that migrants play a vital role in sustaining the economy and society of their host countries,” Jazouli said. In countries that have historically relied on the flow of people, he explained, the importance of migrants “is palpable in all sectors.” But, the Moroccan official maintained, in times of doubt and crisis, “Migrants quickly become scapegoats. They are unjustly and sometimes shockingly, accused of threatening social stability and national identity.” Migration and security go hand in hand in a number of countries. Morocco, however, wishes to “reverse the current trend.” As Morocco goes beyond the “migration as insecurity” trend, its engagement with migration-related matters is to help “deconstruct stereotypes” and actively contribute to the emergence of a prosperous and respected Africa. Committing to an African agenda At the 30th AU summit in January this year, King Mohammed VI presented his “African Agenda on Migration,” a fulfillment of his duties as the chair of the body’s policy framework on migration. The agenda prescribed cohesion and “unity of action.” Referring to the AU agenda on migration, Jazouli said: “The goal of the agenda is to propel Africa into a paradigm that sees migration as an opportunity for economic growth and a chance for the future of our continent. The creation of an African observatory on migration is consistent with that logic.” The mission of the observatory, Jazouli noted, is to define an African framework to “understand, anticipate, and act.” Jazouli’s comments come at a time when Morocco is being accused of racially profiling and discriminating against its growing sub-Saharan population. Gadem, a human rights advocacy group, recently published a report that pointed an accusatory finger at Morocco’s treatment of irregular migrants. According to the report, Moroccan police violently cracked down on migrants in northern Morocco, “gratuitously” expelling them in thousands. “All the testimonies we recorded spoke of violence and mistreatment,” a Gadem representative said at a press conference earlier this month in Rabat. Others have suggested that Morocco’s unprecedented brutalization of irregular sub-Saharans has its origins in the recently-signed Morocco-EU deal on migration. As Brussels has pledged €70 million to Rabat to help secure EU borders, Morocco had to keep its end of the bargain. But Jazouli was insistent on the pan-African foundation of Morocco’s immigration policy.
Dismissing the narrative that Rabat’s migration policy is grounded in agreements with external partners, he said, “Morocco’s strategy with regards to migration sought to break away from any external diktat … Morocco’s national strategy [on migration] falls within the framework of the global compact on migration and the African agenda.”

Rabat- Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has said that cooperation between Africa and Europe on migration cannot solely be a security matter.  “Migration is not a security issue; it is a question of human security,” said Bourita in his address at the opening of the Panafricaines Forum on Friday in Casablanca. The forum attracted 88 representatives of African media. Referring to Europe building migration reception centers in Africa, Bourita asserted that “good bad ideas” are dangerous. “Migrant landing centers are unable to respond to circumstances of migration,” he said. He added that they are also against human rights and values. Earlier this month, the government reaffirmed Morocco’s refusal to house reception centers for migrants to the EU. In a recent interview with German news outlet Die Welt, Bourita repeated Morocco’s position against reception centers. “Morocco is generally against all kinds of centers. It is part of our migration policy and it’s a position in the name of national sovereignty,” he said. Bourita said that of the 3 percent of the world’s population that have migrated, 80 percent have done so legally. “We are talking about only 20 percent of this 3 percent.” In his Friday address, Bourita reviewed Morocco’s policy on immigration and asylum. “This migration policy promotes the sustainable integration of migrants.” The policy, according to Bourita, has regularized more than 50,000 irregular migrants through two campaigns. Ninety-five percent of those regularized were nationals of other African countries and 18,819 were women.

Rabat- Family and friends of the Bouknadel train driver, El Arbi Errich, are asking King Mohammed VI to relieve him from charges of accidental murder and injury of passengers. Errich, who has worked as a train driver for 30 years, is being prosecuted for the October 16 Bouknadel train accident following the decision of the public prosecutor on October 23. Errich’s daughter told Moroccan news outlet Alyaoum24 that the accident has turned the life of her family, including her mother and four brothers, upside down, especially after the public prosecutor charged Errich. The prosecutor noted that the speed limit on the stretch of track where the train No. 9 linking Rabat and Kenitra on the Casablanca-Kenitra line derailed was 60 kilometers per hour. The train, however, was allegedly running at 158 Kilometers per hour, causing it to derail, killing 7 and injuring 125 on October 16. Errich’s pained wife told the press that the police took Errich to court even though he had just been released from the hospital, still suffering from a head injury and devastated by the accident. “There is no way that [Errich] would drive at 160 Kilometers if he was told to drive at 60. What if he had died? Who would take the blame for the accident then?” Errich’s neighbors reasoned.   “We have known the man for years, he’s a responsible, level-headed person. He himself is a victim of the accident,” another stated.  He is “innocent” they all insisted, calling on King Mohammed VI to intervene in Errich’s case and spare him from imprisonment. Errich risks a prison sentence ranging from three months to five years and a fine of MAD 250 to 1,000, according to Acts 432 and 433 of the criminal code. Many Moroccans put the blame on the National Office of Railways (ONCF) after a recording of a conversation between ONCF employees went viral. The recording said that faulty tracks and a lack of speed-limit signs caused the accident.

Rabat – Morocco received 8.7 million tourists from January to August, according to statistics released Thursday by the Ministry of Tourism. Tourist arrivals in Morocco rose 8 percent for the eight month period from the same period last year. Foreign tourist numbers were up 14 percent while returning Moroccans increased by 2 percent, Chinese outlet Xinhua reported. Tourist arrivals from Italy made the most considerable increase between the first eight months of 2017 and 2018, rising 14 percent. German tourist numbers increased 10 percent, French 7 percent, and Dutch 6 percent. Morocco earned $4.88 billion in tourism revenue in the period, compared to $4.82 billion during the same period in 2017. Counting overnight stays at hotels and guest houses, Marrakech, Casablanca, and Agadir were tourists’ top destinations. Along with the traditional European market, the number of Asian visitors, mainly from China, hiked significantly. The increase follows Morocco’s exemption of Chinese travelers from needing to apply for visas in 2016.  Morocco’s 2020 vision, presented by King Mohammed VI in 2010, aims to double the tourism sector and set the country among the top tourist destinations in the world.

Rabat – Following Morocco’s decision to stay on GMT+1, Royal Air Maroc announced that its flights will be delayed one hour at departures and arrivals starting Sunday. The flag carrier issued a statement today to inform its customers of the change, brought about by the government’s decision not to go off Daylight Saving Time (GMT+1) on Sunday, October 28. The company invited their passengers to ask about their flights by calling their Moroccan line (089000 0800) or their international number: +212522489797. Although the Ministry of Administration Reform announced the upcoming change back to Standard Time (GMT) earlier this week, the government council shocked Moroccan citizens today with an about-face decision to stay on GMT+1. The first notice of the potential decision was only published Thursday night. Secretary General to the Government Mohamed Hajoui called the government council for an exceptional meeting Friday morning to approve a draft decree relating to DST. Decree 2.18.855 adds 60 minutes to Standard Time in Morocco, which used to be GMT, under Chapter I of the Royal Decree of June 2, 1967 on Standard Time. To explain its sudden move, the government said that it was following an evaluative study based on several indicators. The minister delegate for reform of administration and civil service, Mohamed Ben Abdelkader, said that the indicators “take into account the aspects relating to health, energy economy of energy and the commercial transactions of the kingdom.” The official made the statement in a joint press conference with Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi following the government’s council on Friday. He added that the results of the study asserted that the “adoption of doubling timing has created a kind of confusion” among the public.   However, the government had at no time announced that it was studying time change to see what would work best for the country. According to Benabdelkader, the study showed that adding 60 minutes to Standard Time in Morocco would save one hour of natural light, which would help Moroccans conduct their daily work in better conditions and reduce electricity consumption, especially during peak periods. Traditionally, Morocco has switched to and from Standard Time four times a year when Ramadan falls in summer. Many Moroccans have complained about the and are worried about school children as they have to wake up when it is still dark. “This decision will be accompanied by a series of measures, particularly with regard to pupils’ school hours,” Benabdelkader. He added the first measure would allow students to leave before sunset. Public schools open at 8 a.m., which will be just 10-30 minutes after sunrise on Monday. However, he did not explain further when students will leave school. Public schools close at 4 or 6 p.m., depending on the class timetable. Sunset on Monday will be between 6:15 and 6:50 p.m. and come earlier each day as winter approaches. He added that the government will “choose flexibility not only in the education system but also in terms of the administrative schedule to allow parents to accompany their children to school before leaving for work without pressure and at a suitable pace.”

Rabat – The General Confederation of Enterprises (CGEM) president, Salaheddine Mezouar, has pleaded for a fundamental reassessment of the tax system. “We ask for a fundamental reflection on taxation that can be a powerful lever for regulation, development, and economic equity,” said Mezouar. He was speaking at a meeting on Wednesday at CGEM headquarters where Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun presented an outline of the 2019 Finance Bill. Mezouar said that he reached an agreement with Benchaaboun to establish a tax limit to exempt lower-income people from paying taxes in the first half of 2019. He noted that the meeting must define the outline of a reform to be included in a tax planning law. Mezouar emphasized that businesses today need a “confidence shock”: neutrality of VAT, legal neutrality in tax treatment, and a taxation that does not impact both the restructuring of companies and the progressivity of corporate income tax (IS), which must be sustainable in order to enable small businesses to escape the precariousness of the informal economy. He considered that the economy needs incentives to refresh investment. He also regretted that Morocco does not have a tax credit system to encourage research.  Mezouar referred to the government’s settlement of MAD 40 billion in VAT debt accumulated in recent years by private sector companies and state-owned enterprises, estimating it will enable “further investments.”Mezouar commended the finance bill’s decreasing the corporate tax rate from 20 percent to 17.5 percent for companies that make a profit between MAD 300,001 and MAD 1,000,000. On the other hand, Benchaaboun insisted on the necessity of giving back confidence to investors and accelerating fiscal reforms. Benchaaboun assured that the government plans to enhance private investment by enacting legislative, organizational, and institutional reforms to improve the business environment. He pointed out that constraints, particularly related to the global rise in oil and gas prices and urgent social projects, will have a direct impact on the financial equilibrium, requiring management to reduce spending and mitigate the burden on the investment budget.

Rabat – The government’s last-minute decision to maintain Daylight Saving Time year-round was based on “an evaluation study and many indicators.” The minister delegate in charge of the reform of administration and public service, Mohamed Benabdelkader, explained, “The indicators include health aspects related to time change, energy saving and Morocco’s commercial transactions.” Benabdelkader was speaking at a joint press meeting alongside Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi on Friday. The government council adopted Draft Decree 2.18.855 today, adding 60 minutes to the standard time in Morocco, moving Morocco to GMT+1 year-round. The government adopted the change overnight, only two days before Morocco was set to turn back the clocks one hour with the end of Daylight Saving Time (DST) October 28. Benabdelkader said that the study’s results confirmed that “adopting double timing creates some confusion” among citizens. The study adopted, according to Benabdelkader, a comparative view on the experiences of many countries and listed many benefits of adopting DST year-round. The main conclusion of the study was a proposal to “enhance a stable official standard time” in Morocco. “The study showed that adding 60 minutes to the Kingdom’s time enables us to gain an hour of light. It will enable citizens to spend their time in better conditions and reduce the peak risk of electricity consumption, which sometimes causes damage,” said Benabdelkader. The minister stressed that the government will review the start time of school. Public schools open at 8 a.m., which will be just 10-30 minutes after sunrise on Monday. The purpose of the measure is to enable students to get to school in the morning and leave in the evening during daylight. The government will take into consideration school time and administration time so that parents can accompany their children before going to work “without pressure,” Benabdelkader added. Decree 2.18.855 adds 60 minutes to Standard Time in Morocco, which used to be GMT, under Chapter I of the Royal Decree of June 2, 1967.The government also indicated that the permanent DST will be adopted as “an experiment.” According to Article 2 of the decree, the head of government can, for a defined period, suspend the new standard time, when necessary.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI inaugurated an indoor semi-Olympic swimming pool and sports fields in Marrakech on Thursday. The Sidi Youssef Ben Ali pool and Askjour sports fields cost MAD 31 million. The project, which is in line with King Mohammed VI’s vision to empower youth, aims to offer a place of entertainment and training for young people. The swimming pool project was built on a surface area of 4,357 square meters near the Sidi Youssef Ben Ali Stadium. The project has a semi-Olympic pool, benches (200 seats), a fitness room, changing rooms, an infirmary, a coffee shop, a reception area, and a management office. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the swimming pool meets international standards for energy efficiency and water saving. The projects are the fruit of a partnership between the Ministry of Youth and Sports and the city of Marrakech. The Askjour sports fields include 10 artificial-turf football fields, race tracks, a children’s playground, green areas, a cafeteria, an infirmary, and changing rooms. The project was constructed on a total surface area of 20,000 square meters. Other national programs for Moroccan youth will be constructed in several regions, owing to a partnership between the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Communal Equipment Fund and the concerned provincial councils. The ministries partnered to construct 832 social and sport community complexes for MAD 600 million. The projects will build and equip “community lands” in rural and semi-urban communes in the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region (70 projects), Souss-Massa (149), Rabat-Sale-Kenitra (45), Marrakech-Safi (171), the Eastern region (41), Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra (13), Guelmim-Oued Noun (42), Fez-Meknes (71), Draa-Tafilalet (72), Dakhla-Oued Eddahab (22), Casablanca-Settat (43), and Beni Mellal-Khenifra (93).

Rabat – “They have trusted us since 2008,” reads the advertising line of this year’s International Marrakech Air show.
 While the message may come across as another catchy slogan that eulogizes more than it delivers, the reality on the ground at the International Marrakech Air Show usually matches the sentiment conveyed in the slogans. The 2018 Marrakech Air Show, which opened its doors on Wednesday, October 24, at the RMAF military base in Marrakech, is set to end on October 27. This year the four-day show expects 300 exhibitors, proof it has grown considerably to become a global sensation in the aviation industry. While Morocco’s aerospace industry has gone through positive bouts between 2010 and 2016, this year’s Marrakech Air Show, as it inaugurates the event’s 10th anniversary, is set to attract more investors and exhibitors. Participants range from military to civil aviation companies, including Boeing, Airbus, Air France, Turkish Aerospace, Gulf Stream, and the US Air Force, among many others.
Taking to Twitter after yesterday’s opening ceremony, the American embassy noted the event’s success and Morocco’s rapidly growing aviation industry. “Aerospace is now the largest sector in Morocco’s economy. That’s why the Marrakech Air Show is growing every year, and why the USA is proud to have been part of this tradition since it began in 2008,” the embassy tweeted. Since its inception in 2008, the International Marrakech Air Show has annually convened the leading names of the aeronautical ecosystem.
Gradually securing the trust of hundreds of exhibitors and investors that have been accompanying the show since its conception a decade ago, Marrakech Air show has taken Morocco’s then embryonic aeronautical industry to a level of maturity. The show has outgrown its modest aspirations at the origin and is now “part of Morocco’s vision to develop an aviation base and strengthen the aviation sector.” The vision is to propel Morocco’s aviation as the best in the African continent and a top performer on the global stage. At the same time, organizers hope to channel Morocco’s geostrategic location and emerging industry-focused policy into branding and marketing Morocco as an invaluable host for investments in aeronautics. Booming industry, African turn, and Global aspirations Earlier this month, Morocco and Canada agreed to cooperate on aeronautics. With Morocco’s profitable market and Canada’s well-proven knowhow in the aviation industry, the Morocco-Canada aeronautical cooperation is expected to increase Morocco’s output in the sector and help establish it among global trailblazers. Morocco bridges Africa and Europe, making it, from the perspective of aircraft manufacturers and investors, “a gateway to the promising African market” for both military and business aviation. The overarching goal is to capitalize on Morocco’s fast-growing industry to strengthen the country’s position as a continental leader while ensuring its gradual emergence as a global go-to destination for aeronautics.

Rabat – The Moroccan Society of Automotive Construction (SOMACA) plant in Casablanca has launched an extension project to increase its car production to 160,000 vehicles per year by 2022. King Mohammed VI received Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy and CEO of Renault Group Carlos Ghosn on Thursday at the Royal Palace in Marrakech.  During the meeting, Ghosn and Elalamy informed the King of the extension project to the Renault plant to double its production capacity by 2022. On Thursday, Ghosn shared a post on his Linkedin, saying that he is currently visiting “our teams and facilities in Tangier and Casablanca. In 2005, we were making 10 000 cars and employed 1600 people in Morocco.” Renault’s CEO added, “In 2018, over 400 000 Renault and Dacia vehicles will come out of our two plants. Groupe Renault counts more than 11 000 employees in the country and over 40 suppliers  and partners chose to follow us, creating 50 000 jobs locally.” Expressing satisfaction over the company’s achievements, Ghosen asserted, “This is the end of the beginning. We’ve built a strong, sustainable presence in North Africa. For the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, the continent is our next frontier.” Morocco has become an auto hub, surpassing South Africa as the African leader in vehicle production numbers. In 2017, Morocco produced 345,000 passenger vehicles to South Africa’s 331,000. Morocco has become a major supplier for European auto plants, “including Ford Motor Co.’s F 0.22% high-tech plant in Valencia, Spain, which imports car seats, interiors, wiring and other components from Morocco,” wrote the Wall Street Journal. SOMACA’s extension project will help the Renault group increase its production capacity in Morocco to 500,000 vehicles per year, including 340,000 produced at the Tangier plant, under the Industrial Acceleration Program. SOMACA exported its first “Made in Morocco” vehicle in 2007. The SOMACA extension is part of Morocco’s automotive sector development to achieve a production capacity of 1 million vehicles by 2025, all manufacturers combined, with a projected turnover of MAD 100 billion yearly, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). SOMACA’s factory began making the first Renault cars in Morocco in 1966.  The Renault factory in Casablanca has manufactures the company’s models since 1966 and Dacia models since 2005, including Logan and Sandero cars.  In July 2015, the Casablanca factory celebrated the production of its 500,000th vehicle. A key operator in Morocco, Renault has more than 40 percent of the market share in the region with two assembly plants, according to the Wall Street Journal. Morocco has ambitions to attract foreign investments into its automotive sector through a five-year corporate tax exemption and a 25-year exemption if most production is exported.

By Mohammed Bella The 39-year-old Ivorian artist will be painting directly on the walls, offering visitors a spectacle of colorful creation. Mederic Turay is an avant-garde artist shaping the landscape of today’s African art. Turay’s canvases are known for their effusion of colors and multicultural faces. His artworks are a language of colorful symbols that transcend conventional forms. Turay, winner of the SIFCOM Group’s Best Young Artist of West Africa award in 1997, has created an unconventional art form known as Artphomanism (Traces). African Digital Art describes the new wave as “the need for absolute sobriety, deprivation, the need to go to the elemental form, the parameters restricted to the essentials; with the building blocks of our African roots. A methodical ritual that invites you to travel mentally to other places, other stories and in history.”  Through his brushstrokes, Turay conveys the evolution of African culture and the diversity and reality of the continent. Critics often compare Turay to his greatest inspirations, neo-expressionist Jean-Michel Basquiat and cubist Pablo Picasso, an analogy he is very proud of. “I am an African with a capital A. I’m a dreamer, and my dreams have no limits. The impossible is just a word. Africa is the mother lode of great talent, but the talent platforms are very rare,” Turay told Medi1 TV. He continued, “It is heartwarming to see Moroccans adopt and appreciate my art. Morocco has always been like a second country to me.” Turay has previously attended art galleries and events in Morocco, such as the African Dreamer gallery in La Galerie 38 in Casablanca. In 2017, he transformed the train that links Casablanca-Rabat-Kenitra into art work during the cultural event Africa in the Capital. The international artist painted the train with colorful graffiti. Turay also produced two frescoes on the facade of the Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Rabat.

Rabat – One migrant, failing to reach Spain twice, explained his determination this way: “Like many fellows, we are just waiting for the fervor of Moroccan coast guards to calm down a bit.”  And what then? “And then we will try again.” The comment illustrates the tough times a well-organized network of traffickers and middle-men are giving to Moroccan and EU authorities, limiting their success in preventing irregular migration to Europe. In a recent report on the flow of migrants crossing to Europe from Morocco, the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) established that the human flow that passes through Morocco has outpaced that of Libya in the past months. Morocco is now the most-used transit route to Europe. In most cases, migrants are from countries like Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, or Senegal among others, whose citizens do not need visas to enter Morocco. Migrants from other sub-Saharan countries pass through Algeria, from where they journey on foot to Morocco, according to BND. Morocco toughens controls Morocco’s attraction to Europe-bound immigrants is caused not only by the ease of paperwork to reach Moroccan territory. It is proximate to Europe, and there are several possible routes to complete the journey. The migrants also consider Morocco more friendly than Algeria. According to German news outlet Bild, migrants have been using three sea routes to cross to Spain from Morocco. They cross via the Alboran Sea, the roughly 170-kilometer-wide body of the Mediterranean between southern Spain and northeast Morocco “in big rubber boats, holding up to 58 migrants each; via the Strait of Gibraltar in small rubber dinghies; and via the Atlantic Ocean in small wooden boats.” Starting in late July this year, however, Morocco tightened control on migrants’ sea convoys. Police in northern Morocco, the region closest to Spain, started patrolling in predominantly sub-Saharan neighborhoods, relocating migrants by the thousand to cities like Agadir, Rabat, and Casablanca. “The police in Tangier were brutal. They entered our homes, cracked down on sub-Saharans, and arrested us regardless of whether you are a [legally resident] student or irregular migrant,” said Alpha, a Guinean migrant now living in Casablanca. Determined to ‘reach final destination’ But regardless of the crackdown and the unprecedentedly tough deterrents that Moroccan authorities have resorted to of late, the majority of migrants are nowhere near relinquishing their “European dream.” The BND’s findings went as far as saying that the large majority of sub-Saharan migrants dreaming of reaching Europe have developed a “naively” romanticized notion of Europe.
Europe, in the imagination of migrants, the report claimed, has become synonymous with instant success. “Their idea of Europe is hopelessly naive. They believe that it will be easy for them to become professional footballers there and drive big cars,” Bild quoted the BND files as saying. Underground organization and migrants’ resolve When asked what his plans are after failing twice to reach Spain, Alpha told Morocco World News he would try again after“the fervor of Moroccan coast guards” calms down. Perhaps sensing a mix of disbelief and empathy, Alpha added: “You know, even right now some are crossing. A friend told me yesterday that more than 60 people from our group that failed in my latest attempt have made it to Spain this month. So I am just waiting a little bit to clear my mind from the latest failure and its negative energy.” But how, despite recent police crackdowns and reports of brutality and heightened discrimination, did Alpha’s friends succeed in crossing? How did they manage to get around all the security apparatuses of both Rabat and Brussels? “Because they had a reliable and well-connected ‘chairman,’” he said.
The chairmen, generally sub-Saharans who have been living in Morocco for 5-15 years, have built a juicy business smuggling migrants to Spain. “Some chairmen take your money and disappear. Others do not disappear, but dealing with them gives you no guarantee of reaching your destination. It is too risky with them. They are not connected enough to get you a pass through all the security hurdles. And when they do succeed, the poor state of the wooden boats they use is another source of worries. It is all about desperation and surrendering until you get to your destination.” “Generation Boza,” as the German files called the sub-Saharan migrants, a reference to the Spanish word for victory they use once they reach Spain, have a well-organized network of traffickers and middlemen through whom all is negotiated. From fees to the type of journey that each migrant requests, all is diligently thought-out in advance and carried out as planned, barring unforeseen occurrences like shipwrecks. According to the German intelligence, 20 “bosses” control the flow of migrants between Morocco and Europe. They often delegate their duties and a share of their revenues to less influential and connected chairmen. Each chairman has on average a dozen helpers who collect sums from “candidates” and can smuggle about 600 migrants per month. Like in a formal market setting, chairmen charge according to the comfort and security of the type of journey. There are, like with air companies, business and economy classes. “The higher the price you pay, the more your chance of getting to your destination,” Alpha explained. “When you pay VIP fees, which cost between €3000 and 4000, you are guaranteed getting to the EU in less than a week. And it is fulfilled or reimbursed.” Ineffective deterrence The German files, which give painstaking details of some of Alpha’s explanations to Morocco World News, clearly show that there is little Morocco and the EU can do to curb the human flow at their borders. They have extremely limited room for maneuver against a well-organized underground network, the files suggested. “With €2000, the chairman guarantees you entry in EU or reimbursement of a substantial amount of the fee you paid.” In this case, however, the smuggling is not VIP. But could there be another force behind the unrelenting flow of irregular migrants who, for all the alarms sounding in Rabat and Brussels, seem unperturbed in their resolve to live their European dream? And what about the alarming figures of migrants who have died at sea? “Those of us who pay between €800 and 1000 are the ones who face trying times while crossing. And many have died, unfortunately. But we are aware of the risks when we take this road,” Alpha offered. “Besides, do you really think that death and pictures of corpses retrieved from deep seas or dispersed on European beaches can deter a whole bunch of people who knew what they were getting themselves into when they decided that living conditions in their respective home countries are unbearable?”

Rabat – While arresting an individual in Marrakech, seven policemen got injured and one was left in critical condition on Wednesday night. The police wanted the individual, who had a national warrant out for his arrest, for theft with violence, says a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) on Thursday. While police attempted to arrest the suspect, a group of 200 people threw stones at the police. The group were trying to let the suspect go and obstruct the arrest. Seven policemen suffered various degrees of injury, including one who went unconscious and remains in a coma. To repel the attack, a police chief fired three times before a stone hit him in the head. The chief then fired a fourth bullet, fatally wounding another person who died later at the hospital. The police officer entered a deep coma and was admitted to the intensive care unit. The judicial police of Marrakech opened an investigation to determine the circumstances of the incident and to arrest all those involved in the assault of the police officers.

Rabat – The German thyssenkrupp Aerospace company has announced the commissioning of a materials processing and logistics center in Casablanca by the end of 2018. The aim of the center is to supply the company’s “local customers with the required materials and services,” said  Patrick Marous, thyssenkrupp Aerospace CEO. ThyssenKrupp Aerospace is a branch of thyssenkrupp’s materials services. The aerospace company made a prior announcement in February that it would open a new sales and production site near Casablanca in the summer of 2018. “Morocco’s aerospace industry is booming. With an annual growth rate of over 15 percent, it is a significant driving force behind the nation’s economy. This encouraging development is also fueling demand for local material suppliers and service providers.” wrote the company. Morocco boasts of several economic free zones which provide an important platform for Morocco’s growing aeronautics sector. These include Casablanca’s Aeropole Nouaceur and Midparc free zones in addition to zones with aerospace facilities in Tangier; Kenitra, north of Rabat; Oujda, in northeast Morocco; and Sale, near Rabat. Thyssenkrupp’s center is situated in Ouled Salah, near Casablanca’s Mohamed V Airport, and covers an area of 3,500 square meters including a warehouse, production hall, and offices. It is expected to generate 20 job positions. The new location will process and store materials such as aluminum, steel, and copper. Eric Cornilleau, managing director of thyssenkrupp Aerospace France, said, “It is not only the French aviation industry that is investing in Morocco and we are pleased to be able to show our presence there for our customers from France and to further expand our global partnerships there as well.” Joachim Limberg, Materials Services CEO, said that thyssenkrupp has closely examined the region and believes the new center is “an important step in [their] strategic development.” He continued, “Seeking customer proximity, determining individual requirements and developing tailored supply-chain solutions, these are among our core capabilities, making us the ideal partner for the sector.” Thyssenkrupp Aerospace is an international “provider of materials, supply-chain solutions and metal processing services” for the aerospace industry. The company has over 1,800 employees with a network of 44 locations in more than 20 countries.

Rabat – Ethiopia’s Parliament approved the appointment of Sahle-Work Zewde on Thursday, making her the nation’s first female president in modern history. Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who was elected in April, appointed Sahle-Work, who will now become Africa’s only current female head of state. Although the position of president in Ethiopia is largely a ceremonial one, it is deeply symbolic and represents just part of a larger package of reforms pushed by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, which also include the release of political prisoners and peace-making efforts with Eritrea. Sahle-Work’s previous positions include ambassador for Ethiopia to Senegal and Djibouti and representative of the African Union to the UN. Speaking to the Ethiopian Parliament just after taking the oath of office, Sahle-Work stressed the importance of building a “society that rejects the oppression of woman.” Last week Abiy Ahmed announced that half the positions in his newly formed cabinet would be led by women, among them Muferiat Kamil, who takes control of the influential Ministry of Peace.

In yet another shift of Riyadh’s official account, Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor said early Thursday that Jamal Khashoggi was killed in a planned operation, reversing the narrative that Khashoggi had died accidently following a fight inside the consulate.  The announcement was made following reports that Turkish President Erdogan and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS) had a phone conversation on Wednesday, marking the first time the two have spoken since Jamal Khashoggi’s killing on October 2.  News of the conversation came as Turkish investigators once again returned to the grounds of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, continuing their search for the remains of the slain journalist.  Turkish officials did not give an immediate read-out of the conversation, only saying the two leaders discussed “joint efforts” to further investigate the matter. The talks come as both countries send sharply contrasting signals about who is at fault for Khashoggi’s murder.  On Wednesday, before Erdogan spoke with MBS he stated that anyone found responsible for ordering Khashoggi’s death will not be able to “avoid justice.” Speaking to attendees at Saudi Arabia’s highly-publicized Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, MBS called the murder a “heinous crime.” He added, though, that he hoped Khashoggi’s death would not leave a “wedge” in relations between the Saudis and other countries.  Reports also surfaced that American CIA Director Gina Haspel heard an alleged recording of Khashoggi’s murder on a trip to Istanbul. She has been in the city since Monday in an effort to gather more information from Turkish authorities.  Although the audio may be useful in dispelling the fistfight narrative, it likely does not answer the key question at the heart of the case: Did MBS have direct knowledge of Khashoggi’s premeditated murder?  European officials had expressed skepticism of Saudi’s fistfight claims. British Prime Minister Theresa May told Britain’s Parliament that the fistfight account “does not amount to a credible explanation.”  French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to Saudi King Salman on Wednesday, expressing his disapproval of the dissident’s murder and demanding a credible investigation.  The French government last week announced they will suspend all political visits to Saudi Arabia, saying they are also prepared to join any international effort to sanction those found guilty of Khashoggi’s murder.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Navy has intercepted four boats carrying 143 migrants off the coasts of Tangier and Nador, in the northeast. A statement by the Royal Navy’s general staff said the navy intercepted the migrants as they attempted to board boats believed to be bound for Europe.  Authorities transported 113 of the migrants to the port of Nador. The remaining 40 were transferred to another nearby port. The navy also stated that shortly after they picked up the migrants, three of the four boats sank.  Two weeks ago Moroccan authorities announced they had arrested six individuals in connection with an irregular migration network in Nador.  The latest arrests come as Morocco’s authorities face increasing pressure to stop irregular immigration attempts to Europe.  EU officials announced earlier in October they would seek to extend economic and logistic support to help Morocco curb irregular immigration attempts. Authorities also stated that current irregular migration attempts had surged 150 percent along the Western Mediterranean route from the levels recorded between 2003 and 2015.

Morocco’s secretary of state to the minister of foreign affairs, Mounia Boucetta, and Chilean under-secretary for external relations, Carolina Valdivia, held the consultation Monday in Santiago. The officials examined bilateral relations and discussed future developments in politics, economy and culture, Maghreb Arab Press reported Tuesday, October 23. The two sides also talked about clean energy cooperation, parliamentary cooperation, and triangular cooperation between Morocco, Africa, and Chile. Boucetta said that Morocco has concluded more than 1,500 agreements with African countries in various fields “thanks to” King Mohammed VI’s policy. Valdivia said bilateral relations between Chile and Morocco “will be further deepened through this meeting of political consultations, in all areas where we could identify complementarities.” The Chilean official said her country is willing to develop cooperation with Morocco in solar and wind energy, namely between Chile’s Corporation for the Promotion of Production (CORFO) and the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN). CORFO, a Chilean governmental organization, aims to promote economic growth in Chile. MASEN, also publicly funded, manages renewable energy major projects in Morocco, especially in  solar power. During the meeting, Boucetta commended two resolutions the Chilean congress has adopted on Western Sahara. On January 9, Chile’s Senate adopted a resolution in support of Morocco’s autonomy plan. According to the resolution, Chilean senators called on the government of Chile, as a member of the UN, “to support and commit to the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1754, adopted on April 30, 2007.” The Senate adopted the resolution a week after the Chilean National Congress approved a similar resolution. Chilean MPs affirmed that the Moroccan autonomy initiative is “a serious and credible effort, which will undoubtedly enable the Sahara population to exercise their right to self-determination, by democratically managing their own affairs through legislative, executive and judicial bodies with exclusive powers under the sovereignty of Morocco.” At the meeting, Boucetta and Valdivia signed a cooperation agreement between the Moroccan Academy of Diplomatic Studies and the Andrés Bello Diplomatic Academy of Chile.

Rabat – Growing frustration over continued train delays has prompted Moroccans to  block the tracks at Temara train station, just south of Rabat, on Friday. Travelers say they were waiting for their train for three hours in Temara, beginning at 7 a.m. Angry protesters said that the train line between Casablanca and Kenitra has experienced constant delays, causing travelers to be late for their work. One bystander told Morocco World News at Temara train station near Rabat: “Most people here are commuter train travelers [Kenitra-Casablanca]. People arrive [at work] half an hour to one hour late, it has become a habit.” 
 The man said that instead of explaining the situation to people, the National Office of Railways (ONCF), Morocco’s only rail transport provider, called the police, who showed up with clubs, “intimidating” and pushing people around and even arresting some of the protesters. Police also confiscated one young woman’s phone as she was recording the protest. “This is a big problem, I hope authorities will listen to our requests and make concrete action to solve the problem.”  Train passengers are demanding explanations from higher-ups at the company and asking for immediate solutions.  Another traveler coming from Casablanca to Rabat told MWN that the train stopped in Mohammedia for five minutes, and when people called ONCF’s “2255” customer service line, it was not available. “When we arrived to Temara we found people coming from Rabat and Fez standing at the railway, protesting.” Protesters left the Temara train station at 11 a.m. and trains are now running again for time being. ONCF released a statement on Twitter three hours before the protests ended in Temara, claiming that security forces handled the situation. The company stated that the delays were caused by technical problems at Mohammedia train station. “Passengers descended the train to stand on Skhirat and Bouznika railways which has caused a 30-minute delay.” pic.twitter.com/pSJmL6fMxK — ONCF (@ONCFgroup) October 26, 2018 Protests against ONCF train delays have sprouted occasionally for years. But the Temara protest comes just 10 days after the Bouknadel train accident on October 16.  Last week, Moroccans called for a boycott of ONCF, blaming it for the accident. However, the controversy following the accident has subdued. With today’s protest, will Moroccans consider a serious boycott against the country’s only railway company? At the same time, Morocco’s high speed train, the LGV, is expected to be operational by the end of 2018. The train No. 9 linking Rabat and Kenitra on the Casablanca-Kenitra line derailed near Bouknadel on Tuesday, October 16, at 10:20 a.m., killing 7 and injuring 125. The tragic accident shook the country and made international headlines. The cause of the derailment, according to the investigation, was speeding. The public prosecutor of Sale’s Court of First Instance blamed the driver for going 158 kilometers per hour when the speed limit on the stretch of track where the train derailed was only 60 kilometers per hour. Moroccans put the blame on ONCF after a recording of a conversation between ONCF employees went viral. The recording said that faulty tracks and absence of speed-limit signs caused the accident.

Rabat – Morocco’s national team sits in the 47th spot in the latest FIFA rankings for October 2018, having lost two places. Morocco’s performance against Comoros may have affected the Atlas Lions’ position in the list. Morocco barely managed to win its first Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) qualifier game against Comoros 1-0.  The second Morocco-Comoros game finished with a 2-2 draw. In FIFA’s September ranking, the team claimed 45th place after having dropped five spots to 46th in August. Morocco remains fifth in Africa. Tunisia is 1st in Africa and 22nd internationally. Senegal is 2nd in Africa and 25th internationally. Nigeria is 3rd in Africa (44th globally) and the Republic of Congo is 4th in Africa (46th globally).  Morocco will play its next CAN qualifier game on November 16 in Casablanca against Cameroon, which comes 6th in Africa and 51st internationally.  The last time Morocco played against Cameroon was in October 2017 in Yaounde, in their first of the two CAN qualifier games for the 2019 competition. Morocco lost the game 1-0. Morocco and Cameroon have played 11 games against each other. They tied four times, and Morocco lost seven times. To earn a better position in the next FIFA ranking, the Atlas Lions will have to prove they can play better than they did two weeks ago against Comoros.

Speaking with the journalists who will attend the second annual Forum of Women Journalists of Africa “Pan Africaines,” Bourita said Thursday that the continent’s media must offer a “lucid” and “authentic” image that reflects the reality of Africa, particularly on migration. Bourita further called on media to “control” Africa’s image.  In recent months, Morocco’s government has been under pressure to control Europe-bound migration, especially with the flow of migrants to the Morocco-Spain borders. The official took advantage of the event to talk about the role and influence of the media in combating stereotypes. The minister said that only 13 percent of migrants to Europe are of African descent, and 88 percent of African migration remains within the continent. Bourita also recalled that the UN Global Compact on Migration will be adopted in December in Marrakech. The compact will establish a debate on migration based on an objective perception free of messages of xenophobia and “exclusion” which must be combated by facts, Bourita said. Bourita also emphasized the importance of a migration policy specific to each country, considering that migration as a transnational phenomenon that cannot be the responsibility of a single country. Subsequently, the minister called for a “shared responsibility” between African countries. Bourita highlighted the efforts made by Morocco on African migration, including the Agenda for Migration and Development, which was launched by King Mohammed VI and adopted by the governments of the African Union (AU). The agenda aimed to coordinate between migration policies of sub-regions of the continent to develop a continental vision on migration. He also recalled that Morocco developed its migration policy in 2013. He said that the initiative is a humanist and solidarity policy, regularizing 50,000 migrants who now have access to basic services. Bourita deemed it “a responsible policy that does not allow criminal networks to use the national territory as a departure point for illegal actions.” With more than 200 media professionals from the continent, the Forum of Women Journalists of Africa “Pan-African Women” will give the floor to women journalists to make proposals on migration.

In 2017, aeronautical exports exceeded $1.2 billion and jobs increased by 50 percent. Morocco’s Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy gave the impressive figures at a press conference on Wednesday. The press conference was held during the kick-off of the 6th International Marrakech Air Show. In just a decade, the show has become a platform for more than 300 exhibitors to feature their aerospace products. Running until October 27, the 2018 Marrakech Air Show will gather experts from more than 80 countries to see 100 featured aircraft. Nearly 50,000 visitors are expected to attend the airshow. Elalamy said that the industry “is fast moving forward,” recalling the plants of renowned international aircraft manufacturers, Boeing, Airbus, and Bombardier, in Morocco. “100 percent of Boeing wiring, for example, was manufactured in Morocco,” the minister said. He added that nearly 135 equipment manufacturers have units in Morocco. Elalamy commented that the air show has also attracted some major companies. “The Marrakech Air Show 2018 is once again an opportunity for global aeronautics players to share their visions and understand the sector’s evolution.” Montreal-based Bombardier, the world’s third-largest aerospace and transportation manufacturer, built a manufacturing facility in Morocco in 2014. Boeing also has a joint venture with France’s Safran in Casablanca to build aerospace parts, such as wire bundles and harnesses, for aircraft makers like Boeing and Airbus. He added that the show is an opportunity to showcase Morocco’s aeronautics development. On Wednesday, the US embassy acknowledged Morocco’s aeronautics achievements.  “Aerospace is now the largest sector in Morocco’s economy. That’s why the Marrakech Air Show is growing every year, and why the USA is proud to have been part of this tradition since it began in 2008,” the embassy tweeted. The show is co-organized by the Ministry of Industry, Royal Air Forces (FAR), the National Office of Airports (ONDA) and the Group of Moroccan Aeronautical and Space Industries.

The European Parliament awarded the prize to Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian film director serving 20 years in a Russian prison, on Thursday. The award ceremony will take place in Strasbourg on December 12. Zefzafi, Sentsov, and 11 NGOs working to save migrants in the Mediterranean Sea were the three finalists voted by members of the European Parliament in the foreign affairs and development committees. The €50,000 prize goes to Sentsov as this year’s recipient of Sakharov prize, for his “exceptional contribution” to human rights around the world, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) in the EU Parliament said Thursday. Moroccans have been anticipating Zefzafi’s win after he was shortlisted as one of the finalists. Some friendly to the Hirak movement hoped that the activist’s nomination would keep international attention on the sentenced Hirak activists. The EU Parliament’s Group of the United Left initially nominated Zefzafi for the second time in hopes that the nomination would “raise the profile” of the Hirak case and “the demands of protesters,” as leftist MP Marie-Christine Vergiat stated. The group previously nominated Zefzafi in 2017. “With this nomination we want to show our solidarity with the Moroccan people demanding social justice, human rights and dignity … Mr Zefzafi is a spokesperson for the Hirak movement in Morocco’s Rif region. We demand the release of [Hirak] prisoners of conscience,” Vergiat said. Established in 1988 in honor of Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov, the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought honors individuals and groups of people who have dedicated their lives to the defense of human rights and freedom of thought. The United Left’s first nomination of Zefzafi in 2017 came after Ahmed Zefzafi, Nasser’s father, toured Europe to raise support for his son’s liberation. Ahmed Zefzafi spoke at the European Parliament to advance the cause of the Hirak Rif and raise awareness of the conditions of his son and others arrested with him. The parliamentary deputy promised Zefzafi’s father then that he would receive his son Nasser immediately after his release.  Moroccan authorities arrested, Zefzafi in May 2017. A court in Casablanca sentenced him, along with three other activists, to 20 years in prison on June 26, a sentence he is appealing. The court handed down sentences varying from 1 to 20 years to 54 Hirak activists, for participating in the “unauthorized” Hirak protests.  The Hirak movement began in October 2016 after the death of Mohcine Fikri, an Al Hoceima fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities. The incident angered many, causing protests across the country, especially in Al Hoceima province, which condemned Fikri’s death and social disparities in Morocco. Police arrested an estimated 400 activists and protesters involved in the protests in 2016 and 2017. Following the court’s sentencing in June, hundreds of Moroccans rallied in protests in cities across the country, including Casablanca, Rabat, and the northern city of Nador, to denounce the “heavy” sentences. International NGOs and politicians, including Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, expressed solidarity with the activists. El Othmani regretted that his government could not intervene in the Hirak Rif case, because the judiciary is an independent authority. On August 21, King Mohammed VI reportedly pardoned 184 Hirak prisoners. Zefzafi was not one of them. Eight days after being sentenced to 20 years, Zefzafi and other Hirak activists refused to appeal their sentences and went on a temporary hunger strike. Hirak activist Rabie El Ablaq reportedly went on a hunger strike for more than 40 days, but suspended it in July. Meanwhile, Zefzafi began another hunger strike that lasted six days to protest “torture” and “harassment” he said he experiences in Casablanca’s Oukacha prison.  Zefzafi’s father announced his son’s hunger strike in a video posted on August 30, stating that Zefzafi “only asks for the rights that other prisoners enjoy: that he be taken out of isolation in a solitary cell and put him in a dignified cell where he can see and talk” with the other jailed activists. In July, all of the detained activists, appealed their sentences, except Rabie El Ablaq. The Hirak activists’ case has made international headlines and captured the attention of world leaders and NGOs who denounced the sentences, saying that the activists were merely demanding their rights.  Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok made remarks about the Hirak case in a press briefing after his April meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. He stated that the Moroccan government “had not been effective in responding to the grievances of the people who took to the streets.” Blok also presented a report earlier this month to the Dutch Parliament, condemning the Hirak sentences and commenting on King Mohammed VI’s royal pardon, which excluded Zefzafi. According to Bourita, the report contains inaccurate facts and is a direct interference in Morocco’s domestic affairs, stemming from a lack of respect for the country’s judicial system. Morocco rejected Blok’s remarks twice. Bourita stressed that the situation in Morocco’s Rif region is not a diplomatic issue but a domestic one.  Oleg Sentsov, the winner of the 2018 Sakharov Prize, bears several similarities to Nasser Zefzafi. Like Zefzafi, Sentsov is serving a 20-year prison sentence, in the far northern Yamalo-Nenets region of Russia. A filmmaker and writer, Sentsov is a native of Crimea who opposed Russia’s takeover of the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014. Russia arrested Sentsov in Crimea and sentenced him on charges of terrorism in 2014. Senstov went on a hunger strike in the same year, protesting Russia’s “political” imprisonment of 65 Ukrainians. Sentsov ended another hunger strike on October 6 this year. His strike lasted for 145 days to avoid being fed forcefully by prison authorities, according to the international press. The president of the EU Parliament, Antonio Tajani, stated, “Through his courage and determination, by putting his life in danger, the filmmaker Oleg Sentsov has become a symbol of the struggle for the release of political prisoners held in Russia and around the world.” The Sakharov Prize awarded the filmmaker to express “its solidarity with him and his cause. We ask that he be released immediately. His struggle reminds us that it is our duty to defend human rights everywhere in the world and in all circumstances,” Tajani said.

Celebrities and Hollywood remain enamored with Morocco’s charm, as illustrated by directors’ penchant for filming in Morocco, primarily in Ouarzazate, “the gateway to the desert.” Movies and television shows like “Lawrence of Arabia” (1962), “Gladiator” (2000), “The Sheltering Sky” (1990), “Game of Thrones” (2013), “Prison Break” (2015), “Sherlock” (2016), and “The Nine” (2017) were all shot in the city. In recent months, American television host Ryan Seacrest and his girlfriend model Shayna Taylor enjoyed their trip to Morocco’s mystical Sahara Desert dunes, and the mother of  football star Cristiano Ronaldo, Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, raved about Moroccan couscous during her mini-vacation in the red city of Marrakech. Pop superstar Madonna also went into raptures over her memorable 60th birthday party in August in Marrakech. The singer, calling herself “BerberQueen” as she donned the Moroccan Amazigh look, shared a plethora of photos and videos of her time in the city on her Instagram with fans. She thanked Morocco for a “magical birthday week.”

The US Department of State confirmed on October 23 that Guterres met Pompeo and US Under Secretary for Political Affairs David Hale.  While the agenda does not say what the officials discussed, the meeting followed a closed meeting between Morocco’s Ambassador to the US Lalla Joumala and Hale on Monday, October 22. A source that asked to speak on condition of anonymity told Morocco World News that Lalla Joumala met with Hale to convince him of Morocco’s position in favor of a one-year extension for the MINURSO mandate. The Security Council will set MINURSO’s mandate at its meeting Monday, October 29. On Tuesday’s meeting, Guterres may have informed Pompeo and Hale why he believes a one-year extension would be beneficial for the UN-led political process. The United States reportedly wants the mandate to be renewed for six months only. However, Guterres has called on the Security Council to include a one-year extension for MINURSO in its resolution. Guterres believes that six months is not enough for him and his personal envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, to create the conditions to allow the UN-led political process to move forward. In order for the US to vote for a one-year extension, Pompeo and Hale have to convince Trump’s favorite: US National Security Adviser John Bolton. The anti-MINURSO official believes that MINURSO is an unnecessary force that has failed to fulfill its purpose despite 27 years in the region. Bolton also plans to convince the Trump administration to cut aid to MINURSO next year. France, a member of Group of Friends for Western Sahara, is in favor of the one year extension. The small group, which includes the US, the UK, Russia, and Spain, prepares the Western Sahara resolutions for the UN Security Council. MWN’s source said that the group started their discussion on the draft resolution, which will be submitted by the US to the Security Council this week. David Hale also met Algeria’s ambassador to the US, Madjid Bouguerra, on October 19 to discuss Western Sahara. The UN’s personal envoy invited Algeria earlier this month to attend a discussion round-table on the conflict in December in Geneva. The roundtable will convene Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania, and the Polisario Front. Algeria, however, will attend the talks only as an observer party and not a main party to the conflict. Political analysts predict that Morocco will not send high-level officials in response to Algeria’s reluctance to be involved. Morocco has been urging Algeria to admit its role as a main party in the conflict and not an observer.

Rabat – The government council adopted Draft Decree 2.18.855 today, adding 60 minutes to the standard time in Morocco, moving Morocco to GMT+1 year-round. The government adopted the change overnight, only two days before Morocco was set to turn back the clocks one hour with the end of Daylight Saving Time (DST) October 28. Only yesterday, Secretary General to the Government Mohamed Hajoui called the government council for an exceptional meeting Friday morning to approve a draft decree relating to DST. Decree 2.18.855 adds 60 minutes to Standard Time in Morocco, which used to be GMT, under Chapter I of the Royal Decree of June 2, 1967 on Standard Time. The decree will enter into force on the date of its publication in the official gazette. It is expected to be published before Sunday. The decree aims to maintain DST permanently “to avoid many changes that occur many times during the year and repercussions at many levels.” Morocco typically changes the clocks four times per year, twice for DST and twice for the weeks of Ramadan. However, the draft decree did not mention any example of the repercussions. It also indicated that the permanent DST will be adopted as “an experiment.” According to Article 2 of the decree, the head of government can, for a defined period, suspend the new standard time, when necessary.

El Khalfi’s statement came in response to a joint statement from the UN Human Rights Council, UN Women, and the World Health Organization (WHO), which called for a ban on virginity testing for women and girls worldwide last week. The agencies called on nine countries where virginity tests are carried out, to ban them, saying they has no scientific basis. “There is no examination that can prove a girl or woman has had sex-and the appearance of girl’s or woman’s hymen cannot prove whether they have had sexual intercourse, or are sexually active or not.” El Khalfi responded in a press conference after the weekly cabinet meeting on Thursday that “Morocco’s family code asks for a medical certificate as a required document before marriage, but it has nothing to do with virginity test.” The law requires the medical certificate to prove the health status of a couple before marriage. He added that Morocco issued a decision in 2004, which stipulates that the certificate has to do with infectious diseases. In their joint statement, WHO and the UN agencies said that the virginity test still exists in Brazil, Jamaica, Malawi, Libya, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, and India. The agencies also argued that the test is a violation of human rights as it might undermine women’s physical, social, and psychological well-being. Virginity has been under debate in Morocco. In February, the Moroccan Association of Sexology called on the Ministry of Health to exempt medical doctors from giving virginity certificates. The association believes that the test violates both doctor’s oath of medical confidentiality and the right to privacy of women and girls.

Rabat – While Moroccans want it to end for good, The Moroccan government is determined to keep daylight saving time all year round. Mohamed Hajoui, Secretary General of the Government, will call Friday 26 for a meeting to discuss a law project aiming to institute daylight saving time throughout the year.  While it was expected to end Sunday 28, Morocco will stay in daylight saving time all year round. This measure purports to end the confusion caused while flipping back and forth between the standard time and daylight saving time, Hespress said. This measure is expected to cause an uproar among Moroccans at a time when the European Parliament has backed a plan to end daylight saving time in a number of countries. Morocco has used daylight saving time since 2008 to increase the country’s national economy competitiveness by lowering energy consumption and easing transactions with partners from Europe in the first place.

Rabat- A Rome metro station escalator went haywire on Tuesday, injuring 20—mostly CSKA Moscow football fans.   The football fans were chanting and cheering before the escalator suddenly was out of control, sending people into shock. A video of the accident shows the escalator, crammed with dozens of people, crumpling and crushing 20 people at the bottom. The incident took place at Repubblica metro station near Rome’s central train station in Italy on the same day that CSKA Moscow was to play AS Roma in the Champions League. One of the wounded people underwent surgery for a serious injury. Rescuers told the Telegraph that “only the last two meters of the escalator were damaged, but the rest of it looked fine. The escalator likely blocked after people started crushing at the bottom of it.”

Rabat – Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has sent condolences to King Mohammed VI following the Bouknadel train accident. In his message, Bouteflika expressed “deep sympathy” and condolences to the King and wished a speedy recovery for the injured, reported state owned agency, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) on Wednesday. The train No. 9 linking Rabat and Kenitra on the Casablanca-Kenitra line derailed near Bouknadel on Tuesday, October 16, at 10:20 a.m., killing 7 and injuring 125. The tragic accident shook the country and made international headlines.  The cause of the derailment, according to the investigation, was speeding.  The public prosecutor of Sale’s Court of First Instance blamed the driver for going 158 kilometers per hour when the speed limit on the stretch of track where the train derailed was only 60 kilometers per hour. On the other hand, many Moroccans blamed the National Railway Office (ONCF) for the accident after a recording of a conversation between ONCF employees went viral. The recording said that faulty tracks and absence of speed-limit signs caused the accident. Only one week ago, Moroccans called for a boycott of ONCF, but the controversy following the accident has since died down. But survivors are still dealing with the aftermath of the accident. Minister of Transport Abdelkader Amara announced Monday that a commission will provide free psychiatric support for the passengers. The move came after a group of young Moroccan psychiatrists and psychologists based in Rabat and Casablanca volunteered to listen to and counsel the passengers recovering from the trauma of the accident. Hashtags #Ajithder (come talk) and videos of the psychologists have circulated social media in recent days, inviting the train passengers to take advantage of the services. Some 210 coaches and employees at ONCF are mobilized to assist travelers at train stations across the country. ONCF also has a customer relations line to answer customers’ questions and requests.

Rabat – Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has once again spoken about Morocco’s important role in controlling migration on the Moroccan-Spanish border. On Wednesday, Sanchez reviewed the Summit of the European Union heads of State and Government, which met October 17-18 in Brussels, before the Spanish Congress of Deputies. The official called Morocco a “strategic actor” for Spain in migration policy, particularly in fighting illegal immigration. Sanchez said that he defended Morocco’s demands for EU funding to assist the country in managing migration, especially with the sharp increase in the undocumented migrants recorded in recent months taking the western Mediterranean route from Morocco to Spain. He added that this is a medium and long-term initiative whose objective is to face the challenge that this phenomenon represents for Morocco, a country with which “Spain has important relations in various areas.” The prime minister also confirmed that Spain will provide aid to help Morocco manage migratory flows. El Pais reported on Monday that the EU will give Morocco and Spain €140 million “in the short term” to control migration at the Moroccan-Spanish border. The funds are to be used “mainly for the purchase of border control equipment,” according to El Pais. Sanchez has been pressuring the EU to meet Morocco’s demands. Several officials from both countries met to discuss migration. The last meeting was between Morocco’s Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit and his Spanish counterpart Fernando Grande-Marlaska on October 19 in Madrid. The Spanish official said that Morocco must remain a privileged partner of Spain. Despite the favorable answer of the EU, El Pais believes that the funds are “still modest and significantly lower than those destined for other countries.”

Rabat – As the Western Sahara conflict shows signs of improvements under newfound UN resolve, Washington should both push for diplomatic breakthrough and vouch for Morocco. That recommendation is the takeaway of a recent analysis by Dr. Sarah Feuer, a Near East and Arab politics specialist at the Washington Institute. Feuer wrote that the Trump administration needs to be cautious on the Western Sahara question and delicate in its foreign policy towards Morocco, a historical ally. At the same time, it cannot look unforgivably one-sided to Algeria and Polisario, two important stakeholders. Washington, Feuer suggested, “should proceed cautiously in encouraging negotiations to avoid undermining essential allies.” Keeping the momentum Since its establishment in 1991 to contain the escalation of hostilities and supervise the yet-to-be-held referendum, MINURSO, the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, has traditionally had its mandate renewed by one year. In April this year, however, the Security Council unprecedentedly gave the body a six-month extension. According to Feuer, the Trump administration’s keenness on upending the status quo to get quick results was a main factor behind the UN’s untraditional move to vouch for six months, rather than one year. “The shortened timeline was intended to nudge the parties back to the negotiating table,” Feuer wrote, citing a US representative at the UN. However, she cautioned, while the move seems to have borne fruits—UN Personal Envoy Horst Kohler has surprisingly succeeded in convincing all parties to talk in early December—there is a lot more left to do to ensure that the momentum is kept and capitalized upon. Instead of focusing on instant gratification by committing parties to the negotiation table by any means, Washington should play more diligently, she wrote. “Delicate diplomacy,” as Feuer called it, requires aiming “for the sweet spot of encouraging diplomatic progress without undermining alliances that are essential to this progress.”
Reassuring Rabat But how does that diligence translate into diplomatic action? Through a policy of “weighing risks and rewards,” Feuer’s piece answered. “Delicate diplomacy” in the Western Sahara question, the article explained, requires keeping in sight the broader picture. The goal is brokering a sustainable political settlement between Morocco and Algeria-backed Polisario, securing American strategic interests in the region, and upholding Moroccan interests (national integrity). Washington needs to reassure Rabat that its alliance is not taken for granted by American policymakers, and that it matters to the US to have Rabat by its side in the muddy landscape of North African politics. In early May this year, Morocco severed diplomatic ties with Iran, citing Tehran-backed Hezbollah’s military involvement with the Polisario Front. Rabat’s move to give Tehran a cold shoulder came with a pile of justifications that put forward the sanctity of Morocco’s national integrity. Feuer, nonetheless, suggested that, minimally at least, the move can be also interpreted as a further proof of Morocco’s commitment to its strategic alliance with Washington, given the ongoing feud between the US and Iran. Washington should return the favor to reassure Rabat that the importance Morocco attaches to its American ally has not gone unnoticed, she proposed. But the US should be more reciprocal in its dealings with Rabat for another reason. Losing Morocco’s support would amount to losing the leverage and diplomatic momentum to nurture the de-escalation necessary for a politically negotiated and mutually acceptable solution in Western Sahara. To reassure Rabat, the US Congress should move to confirm David Fisher, Trump’s nominee for ambassador to Rabat. More crucially, perhaps, following Moroccan foreign affairs minister Nasser Bourita and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s September meeting to discuss Western Sahara, “a more consequential move would be to invite King Mohammed VI to the White House.”

Rabat – The US Secret Service has intercepted “potential explosive devices” addressed to former President Barack Obama and Bill and Hillary Clinton. The US Secret Service on Wednesday reported that they discovered the packages in routine mail screenings, addressed to former President Obama in Washington, DC, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Rochester, New York. The press release added, “The protectees did not receive the packages nor were they at risk of receiving them.” “We condemn the attempted violent attacks recently made against President Obama, President Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and other public figures,” said current White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. The new reports come one day after an explosive device addressed to George Soros, a frequent contributor to the Democratic Party, was found at his home in New York. Early reports by CNN anchors on Twitter are also stating the network’s New York office has been evacuated, and the New York police department’s bomb squad is at the scene.

By Josh Babb Rabat – China has come under fire for the forced internment of the Muslim  population in the Xinjiang province.  An investigation by the BBC documents a massive expansion of Uighur detention centers in China’s Xinjiang province. Officials for the nation’s ruling Communist Party say the mass internment is simply an education effort to bring the Muslim Uighur people into a “modern, civilized” world.  But critics say the detention centers amount to nothing less than re-education camps, complete with guard towers, barbed wire and surveillance systems, and created with the explicit goal of wiping out Uighur identity, language, and religion.  The UN estimates that over one million Uighurs have been detained, often after being arrested under suspect circumstances with no due process. The total Uighur population in China’s western Xinjiang province is estimated to be around 10 million.  Former detainees accuse the Chinese government of housing prisoners in inhumane conditions and forcing them to disavow any Islamic beliefs in order to secure release. Others claim to have been separated from their children with no process for reunification.  The policy appears to coincide with newly imposed legal penalties targeting Muslims in China, among them a ban on both women wearing headscarves and the religious instruction of children.  China says the newly-passed laws aim to curb terrorism, citing previous incidents in which Uighur assailants carried out politically motivated attacks. Knife-wielding Uighurs killed 31 people at a train station in the Chinese city of Kunming in 2014. In an effort to fight this threat, authorities in China have also revoked almost all passports of anyone suspected of having Uighur identity, effectively stranding them inside the country.   State officials say the camps have been effective in stemming terrorism. “In the past 21 months, no violent terrorist attacks have occurred and the number of criminal cases, including those endangering public security, has dropped significantly,” Shohrat Zakir, a politician in Xinjiang said, speaking to state authorities.

Rabat- A school bus accident in Meknes has injured three primary school children. The bus, carrying 43 students of a private primary school, crashed on Wednesday morning near Zahwa neighborhood in Meknes, a city west of Fez, reported Moroccan news outlet Alyaoum24. The injured students are currently receiving treatment at Mohammed V Hospital in Meknes. Photos taken after the accident show two other vehicles caught in the traffic accident, a taxi which hit a streetlamp and another that swerved and hit a wall to avoid the crash. Today’s bus accident follows two fatal accidents last week. On Tuesday, October 16, Train No. 9 linking Rabat and Kenitra on the Casablanca-Kenitra line derailed near Bouknadel at 10:20 a.m., killing 7 and injuring 125. The cause of the derailment was speeding, according to the investigation. The public prosecutor of Sale’s Court of First Instance has blamed the driver for going 158 kilometers per hour when the speed limit on the stretch of track where the train derailed was only 60 kilometers per hour. However, some rail employees claimed the track was known to be faulty and the reduced speed limit was not properly communicated. Another tragic accident took place Friday, October 19, when a part of the bridge undergoing repair on the A3 highway in Casablanca near the Derb Sultan neighborhood collapsed on a car, killing a woman and badly injuring her daughter. Drivers on the A3 highway have expressed their anger and concern over the traffic jam, complaining that there are no signs to inform them of the work in progress.

Rabat- Royal Air Maroc has signed an agreement with the Senegalese city of Touba to make RAM the official carrier for the Grand Magal of Touba pilgrimage. Morocco’s flag carrier signed the agreement with the Senegalese municipality on Tuesday.  The annual Magal of Touba religious pilgrimage, organized by the Mouride community of Senegal, will take place October 26-27. The agreement, which is renewable for one year, was signed by RAM Commercial Director Abdelghani El Aissoug and Touba Mayor Abdelahad Ka. RAM wants to reduce the cost of flights to Dakar for Senegalese residing abroad who wish to participate in the event. The agreement seeks to cover a 40 percent reduction in the cost of repatriating the bodies of Senegalese who have died abroad.  RAM is also expected to offer 40 free tickets to the municipality of Touba. El Aissoug said that RAM is “proud of this convention that allows it to become the official carrier of such a large religious event (Magal de Touba).”, He said that the partnership reflects the exemplary relationship between Morocco and Senegal. He added that the company will “spare no effort to serve the Senegalese community abroad and facilitate its trip to Senegal, especially from Spain, France, the United States and Italy.” Magal of Touba is traditionally celebrated on the 18th of Safar, the second month in the Islamic calendar. Participants gather in the holy Mouride city of Touba to celebrate the teaching of Sheikh Amadou Bamba, the founder of the Senegalese Mouride Brotherhood. In 2011, over 3 million pilgrims gathered in Touba to celebrate the event. The annual pilgrimage dates back to 1928, the year after Bamba’s death. It commemorates his death his exile to Gabon by the French colonial government in 1895.

Rabat – Africa Sounds, a design project conceived to “honor Africa’s artistic wealth,” is being celebrated at the Medinit Expo in Casablanca. According to organizers, Medinit Expo is an annual exhibition that convenes 80-100 brands representing the “excellence of Made in Italy in the Design sector (interior / exterior decoration, decoration, lighting, etc.) which are presented to a selection of qualified operators (architects, engineers, importers, builders), of Morocco and beyond.” This year’s edition started on October 24 and is expected to end on October 26.
The Africa Sounds design project depicts castanets and the Gnaoua culture in a map of Africa engraved on marble. The project was born of a collaborative work between Moroccan designer Hicham Lahlou and Citco, an Italian leader in designing worldwide. Its concept is to render a “poetic depiction” of Africa’s cultural—especially linguistic and musical—diversity, according to Lahlou. Citco, a global household name in the design industry, has previously worked with, and edited, leading designers and architects like Britain’s Norman Foster, France’s  Ito Morabito and Jean Nouvel, and Israel’s Arik Levy. For this year’s celebration of Italian design in Casablanca, the Italian giant chose Morocco’s Hicham Lahlou to give an African feel to the event’s illustrious pedigree. The choice is a further validation of Hicham Lahlou’s standing among Africa’s and the world’s best designers. Speaking to Morocco World News about the importance of such a celebration of African design, Lahlou expressed gratitude and excitement for being the representative of Medinit Expo 2018. “Together with Citco I am ambassador and guest international designer for this year’s Medinet Expo,” the Moroccan artist said. Lahlou’s “Africa sounds” assembles marble, Gnawa music, and a bright Africa map, which is meant to suggest African unity through cultural linkages and musical sounds, despite visible diversity in the way culture is lived and practiced across the continent. The project’s colorful texture is a Hicham Lahlou trademark. Since turning his designer’s gaze towards Africa at his creative peak in recent years, the Moroccan artist has consistently said that he considers Africa as the meeting ground of colors and expressions. Africa, Lahlou has repeatedly maintained in his projects depicting other aspects of “African identity,” as he calls them, is conducive to artistic creativity because its thousands of languages and other cultural expressions allow for coherence and harmony out of striking dissimilarities. “Africa is the future of designing,” the Moroccan designer said in March 2014, speaking at Africa Design Days, an international designing-focused event the Moroccan founded to “help fellow African designers market their skills and creativity to a broader global audience.” Of the Africa Sounds project, both Lahlou and Citco have said that the founding idea was to pay a vibrant tribute to the continent’s artistic potential, especially its music, architecture, and craftwork. The concept is to celebrate Africa through colorful design by throwing a light on the continent’s cultural wealth.

Rabat- Following last week’s “Week of Anger,” 130 doctors in the public sector in the Casablanca-Settat region have submitted a collective resignation. The public sector doctors have expressed their anger over the “catastrophic conditions in the health sector” which do not meet international standards. Moroccan television channel 2M reported today that there were more than 15 protests this year to criticize the unprofessional conditions in Morocco’s hospitals and lack of equipment and infrastructure. Public doctors were protesting for the government to give all employees pay grades the reference number 509, which enables them to advance to higher grades. Doctors also want the government to create two new pay grades above the current highest grade. The doctors also seek more resources, including adequate medical and lab equipment. On October 5, Morocco’s Independent Union of Public Sector Doctors released a statement to condemn the critical situation of the health sector in Morocco. The union said that the statement is the result of a one year struggle with the Ministry of Health, which has failed to act. The statement also said that the doctors will emigrate collectively to find better opportunities. The union also launched a protest under the title “Doctor’s Week of Anger.” The focus ran October 15-21. The statement also condemned corruption in the sector and the irregularities in many hospitals across the country, according to the 2016-2018 annual report from the Court of Auditors. It is the third time doctors have submitted a collective resignation request. Fifty doctors resigned from the same area at the Regional Directorate of Health while 30 other doctors at Ahsan Hospital and Boukafer Hospital in Ouarzazate resigned, according to 2M.

Rabat- Economy minister Benchaaboun has said that government will not privatize ONCF, but may sell stakes in Maroc Telecom. Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun announced on Tuesday that the National Railway Office (ONCF) is not “eligible” for privatization because it is not a “public limited company.”  According to Benchaaboun, ONCF is not a separate legal entity with shares to be purchased and sold on the market, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The government may consider selling stakes in Maroc Telecom, the country’s main telecommunication company, to increase state resources, Reuters quoted Benchaaboun. Rumors have that the Moroccan Airports Authority (ONDA) may also be privatized. Benchaaboun announced Monday, in a parliamentary session to present the 2019 draft budget, that the government seeks to privatize some public companies to improve their governance and help reduce the budget deficit to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2019. The move to increase state resources could generate MAD 8 billion. Increasing taxes on tobacco consumption will generate additional revenue estimated at MAD 1.2 billion in 2019, Benchaaboun asserted. Benchaaboun pointed out that the Moroccan economy requires measures to mobilize resources, control spending, and establish mechanisms to reduce the burden on the investment budget. He also noted the impact which the rising prices of oil and gas, which peaked earlier this month, will have on financial balances. The significant increase of MAD 4.65 billion, 35 percent, in the government’s subsidy fund for cooking gas, flour, and sugar, from the 2018 budget to the 2019 can be explained by the increase of oil prices at the international level.

Rabat – Three months after giving his annual report, President of the Court of Auditor Driss Jettou has once again warned Morocco about the risk of social disparities and debt challenges. On Tuesday, Jettou gave a presentation about Morocco’s financial performance and social disparities in a meeting chaired by the speakers of the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives, Abdelhakim Benchamach and Lahbib El Malki, respectively. Jettou said that despite Morocco’s efforts in the social sphere and its numerous social programs, Morocco has not yet been able to reduce the disparities and poverty across the country. Jettou’s warning speech comes at a time when the government is pledging new reforms to curb social challenges, including employment. It also followed the passing of the 2019 Finance Bill, on which King Mohammed VI emphasized the need to prioritize social programs during a ministerial council. Dealing with the deficit: Raise taxes, cut spending Jettou also urged the government to reduce the treasury’s debt, which reached MAD 692 billion by the end of 2017, according to Jettou’s report on the activities of the financial jurisdictions. He called on the government to broaden the tax base, control spending,  accelerate growth to reduce debt, and ensure the ability to meet the debt burden over the medium and long-term. Jettou said that both internal and external debts increased significantly between 2016 and 2017. According to Trading Economics, Morocco held MAD 492 billion in external date by this summer Jettou added that public sector debt rose from MAD 918.2 billion in 2016 to MAD 970 billion in 2017, representing an increase of MAD 51.8 billion. On Monday, Minister of Finance and Economy Mohamed Benchaaboun proposed measures to increase revenues and to help reduce the budget deficit to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2019. Benchaaboun proposed the privatization of public companies and an increase on tobacco taxes to reduce the budget deficit. The Court of Auditor suggested that investments might also help reduce social disparities and lack of resources. Jettou said that in 2017, the volume of public investment amounted to MAD 188.3 billion. The state had contributed MAD 66.8 billion, public companies MAD 106 billion, and territorial communes MAD 15.5 billion. End arbitrary, ineffectual distribution Jettou called for the end of the arbitrary distribution of resources, saying that budgets should take into consideration the direct impacts of the allocation on the social sphere. Jettou called for a “mobilization and an optimal management of these resources” to meet the demands of citizens and prioritize social plans. He recommended strong measures to support school enrollment, medical assistance, social protection, and purchasing power to fight poverty and inequality in Morocco. Jettou’s 2017 annual report underscored problems in Morocco’s education and health. The report found serious irregularities in Morocco’s health sector. Several hospitals operated without strategic objectives and organizing the supply of care, equipment, and infrastructure, according to the report. For education, the court found that Morocco’s schools do not achieve even basic standards. At the request of King Mohammed VI, who called for reforms in the sector, the government has slightly increased the budget for the two sectors in the 2019 Finance Bill. The budget has allocated MAD 68 billion for education, an increase of MAD 5.4 billion from 2018. For the health sector, the government allocated more than MAD 16.3 billion, up 1.6 billion from the 2018 bill.

Rabat – The murder of Jamal Khashoggi threatens to shift power balances across the region by decreasing Saudi Arabia’s international leverage. On Tuesday, October 23, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan gave much-awaited remarks at a meeting of Turkey’s ruling party, the AKP, on Turkey’s ongoing investigation into the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  Speaking in Ankara, Erdogan called the murder of Khashoggi both “planned” and “brutal” imploring Saudi Arabia to extradite the 18 it arrested in connection with the case to Turkey to face trial. In addition to the arrests, the Saudis also announced they fired five people within the government for their role in the plot, two of which had close connections with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS). Erdogan’s claims directly contradict the latest spin coming from Saudi officials, who have changed their account of what happened numerous times since Khashoggi was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2.  Spokespeople for the Saudis are now claiming Khashoggi’s death was the result of a fight that broke out after Khashoggi entered the consulate, a result of an operation gone wrong, which was planned by “rogue” Saudi agents. President Erdogan’s remarks on Tuesday came after weeks of leaked information about Khashoggi’s murder being dribbled out to both Turkish and the international press. The leaks appear to be carefully formulated in such a way as to keep pressure on Saudi Arabia for answers. The Turkish government closely monitors most press outlets and often uses them as a mouthpiece to express pro-government sentiments.  The pressure Turkey has applied in this case has been extremely effective in discrediting the Saudis’ official recounting of events.   The diplomatic clash over the killing of Khashoggi is just the latest conflict to unfold between the governments of Saudi Arabia and Turkey, both significant regional powers vying to increase their sphere of influence across the Middle East.  One can trace rising tensions between the two countries back to 2013 when a military coup in Egypt forced Mohammed Morsi, the country’s first democratically-elected leader, out of power. Morsi belonged to the Muslim Brotherhood, an organization championing a form of political Islam which had close ties to Erdogan and the Turkish government. Saudi Arabia, for its part, had labeled the Brotherhood a terrorist organization and immediately pledged significant economic support behind Egypt’s newly-forming government in the wake of the coup. General Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, Egypt’s current president, eventually took the reins. Erdogan has also publically sided with Qatar in the ongoing Qatari diplomatic crisis which has seen Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt sever diplomatic ties with Qatar. The Gulf countries justified their move by alleging that Qatar supports terrorist networks, such as the Muslim Brotherhood. Qatar responded to Turkey in kind, pledging economic support as Turkey underwent a financial crisis earlier this year. There are, however, significant economic ties between Saudi Arabia and Turkey, underscoring just how complicated the geo-politics of the Middle East truly are. An analysis by the Middle East Institute explains, “Erdogan saw Riyadh as an important actor in his efforts to reduce Turkey’s dependence on European investment.”  This came amid a high profile spat between Turkey and the EU, as negotiations for the country to join the union stalled in 2016. Saudi citizens are some of the top buyers of real estate in Turkey, and Erdogan’s government has previously expressed interest in cooperating with the Saudis to develop the kingdom’s infrastructure. Erdogan has played his cards very strategically thus far, giving deference to King Salman while also publically refuting the Saudi narrative. It remains to be seen to what extent he is willing to escalate tensions further. If the widely-reported audio recording of Khashoggi’s murder exists, it has not yet leaked publically, and perhaps it is Erdogan’s final trump card.   The murder of Khashoggi and the prolonged fight for the truth about what happened inside the Saudi consulate on October 2 has forced the US to take a new, critical look at its long-standing relationship with Saudi Arabia.  Khashoggi’s death specifically cast a harsh spotlight on MBS, who had been widely praised in the West before October as the type of reformer the kingdom needed as oil revenues dwindle, calling into question Saudi Arabia’s economic future.  President Trump had hailed MBS as a key partner in the Middle East, particularly when it came to countering Iranian influence. A New Yorker profile notes that the president’s son-in-law and close advisor Jared Kushner developed a close working relationship with MBS, following Kushner’s repeated visits to the Middle East.   Western media gave MBS credit for lifting the ban on both women driving and the opening of cinemas. At the same time, Saudi authorities arrested en masse the activists who pushed for these same reforms.  Another unseemly story revealed the crown prince’s authoritarian side in November of 2017, when MBS sent Saudi police to arrest more than 200 of the country’s wealthiest citizens, among them 11 members of the Saudi royal family. The government held all detainees on various corruption charges and ordered them to sign over vast amounts of wealth in order to secure their release. All told, detainees turned over more than $100 billion in assets to the Saudi government. The New Yorker reports that at least one detainee died under duress from interrogation.  MBS is also largely responsible for the Saudi military’s pronounced role in the Yemeni civil war, regularly supporting embattled pro-government forces fighting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in a brutal, drawn-out conflict.  Although all of these stories have been well-reported across the world, none have had quite the same staying power as the murder of Khashoggi, who had contributed columns to the Washington Post for just under a year at the time of his death. In response to the slaying, members of the US Congress have issued a bipartisan call to cease all weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, currently the top importer of American arms in the world.  The world has largely seen President Trump as sympathetic to the Saudi portrayal of events, although Riyadh’s ever-shifting narrative has forced the president to give some ground as international outrage grows.  “They had a very bad original concept, it was carried out poorly and the cover-up was the worst in the history of cover-ups,” said Trump, speaking to reporters on October 23. “They had the worst cover-up ever.” It remains true that many diplomats working in the Trump administration continue to view the Saudis as a lynchpin for US foreign policy in the Middle East. Washington’s relationship with Riyadh goes back long before Trump took control in 2016.  On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced an opening round of US sanctions on Saudi Arabia, including visa restrictions on the 21 suspects Saudi Arabia arrested last week. Critics of the administration saw the move as once again ceding ground to the Saudi account of events which laid blame at the feet of supposed “rogue operators.” The big question going forward is whether the murder of Khashoggi represents a temporary setback between the longstanding US-Saudi alliance or perhaps signals a greater shift, one which could have long lasting and perhaps unexpected impacts felt across the Middle East.

Rabat – The opening ceremony of the Amazigh (Berber) theater world tour took place Monday at the International Mohammed VI Conferences Center in Skhirat, near Rabat. At the ceremony, bands performed a series of Amazigh songs accompanied by dances and also paid tribute to the nationally known Moroccan music icon, Mohammed Rouicha.  Nouamane Lahlou performed four of his most popular songs and amazed guests with a duet with Dounia Boutazout. The minister of Moroccans Living Abroad and Migrant Affairs, Abdelkrim Benatiq, gave a speech describing the Amazigh theater tour as a historical moment. He thanked the Royal Institute of the Amazigh Culture (IRCAM) for ensuring the success of the tour. In addition to Nouamane Lahlou and Dounia Boutazout, several icons from the Moroccan art scene took part in the launching ceremony, including Mohammed El Jem and popular actor Mohammed Miftah. The objective of the Amazigh theater tour, addressed specifically to Moroccans living abroad (MREs), is to promote Amazigh culture. The global theater tour also seeks to preserve the Amazigh identity and consolidate its culture and tradition among MREs. Twelve groups will perform 51 theater performances across the world as part of the ministry’s initiative to strengthen the bond between MREs and their motherland. IRCAM and the Ministry of Moroccans Living Abroad have established the program among other initiatives to promote the Amazigh culture and tradition overseas.  The cultural center in Montreal, Dar Al Maghrib (Morocco House), was the first initiative. The ministry is also building a Moroccan cultural center in Paris. The Amazigh theater group performed more than 180 shows in the 2017-2018 season in 15 countries in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.

Rabat – Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP) plans to acquire banks in Kenya, Rwanda, Ghana, and Tanzania. After acquiring Mauritius’ Banque Des Mascareignes on October 16, BCP has branches in 14 African markets. The Moroccan bank wants to increase Africa’s share of its total income to 30 percent in two years, from its 18 percent share last year, said the co-CEO of BCP, Kamal al-Miqdad, in an interview Wednesday in Mauritius. “We’re looking for opportunities in Kenya, Rwanda, Ghana and Tanzania in the medium-term,” said Mokdad. He added, “We are on the right track to reach 30 percent of income from Africa by 2020.” BCP said that it will use Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation, as a hub linking Asia to Africa to seek more investment from countries like China and India in Africa.  Other Moroccan lenders, like BMCE and Attijariwafa Bank, have expanded in sub-Saharan countries in the past decade. BCP holds overseas offices in Germany, England, Spain, France, Gibraltar, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada.

Rabat – Morocco’s investment committee has approved 68 draft agreements and amendments to investment agreements for MAD 57.65 billion. The investment committee held a meeting chaired by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani on Tuesday, October 23, in Rabat. Morocco’s Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy said in a press briefing after the meeting that the agreements will generate 9,266 direct jobs, Maghreb Arab Press (Map) reported. The committee approved the agreements in two separate meetings, 48 agreements on January 10 and 20 agreements on Tuesday, Elalamy added. Elalamy gave details about the sectors the government will invest in and the forecasted job positions. The industrial sector will receive MAD 21.55 billion, transport and infrastructure MAD 10.91 billion, energy sector MAD 7.79 billion, and tourism MAD 5.98 billion. Elalamy predicts the industrial and tourism projects will create 2,850 jobs each, fishing and agri-food industry 2,038 jobs, and telecommunications 607 jobs. The Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region in Western Sahara took the lion’s share of the investment projects at 30 percent, with a total of MAD 17.18 billion, said Elalamy. The Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region received MAD 8.14 billion (14 percent) while the Casablanca-Settat region received MAD 8.07 billion (14 percent). The remaining MAD 11.95 billion (20 percent) of investment projects will be spread to some or all of the nine other regions. Elalamy believes that the new allocation will allow a “gradual” establishment of investment equity between the 12 administrative regions. Elalamy expects the investment projects will generate 2,815 direct jobs (30 percent) in Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra, 2,178 jobs in Rabat-Sale-Kenitra (23 percent), 2,052 jobs in (22 percent) in Casablanca-Settat, and 920 jobs (9 percent) in Marrakech-Safi. Elalamy explained that the state capital in the approved investment projects totaled MAD 36.29 billion (63 percent) while joint-ventures will fund 29 percent of the investment projects. In 2017 the committee approved a total of 51 draft agreements and amendments to the investment agreements, for a total amount of MAD 67 billion, which the government predicted would generate 6,777 direct jobs. Driss Jettou, head of the Court of Auditors, said Tuesday in Parliament, that public investments in 2017 amounted to MAD 188.3 billion, including an MAD 66.8 billion state contribution, an MAD 106 billion contribution by public companies and institutions, and an MAD 15.5 billion contribution by territorial communes. Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun said Tuesday in a press conference, “The 2019 Finance Bill aims to stimulate a new dynamic in the investment and support business, through a set of measures and initiatives to consolidate ‘confidence’ of business and promote investment.” Benchaaboun indicated that “public investment is intended to be the ‘locomotive’ of the private sector since the 2019 Finance Bill allocated an overall budget of MAD 195 billion for public investment.”

Rabat- An appeals court in Antwerp, Belgium, has decided to strip a detained Moroccan imam, Fouad Belkacem, of his Belgian citizenship. Belgian news outlet L’Echo reported that the Antwerp court’s decision was based on determining that the leader of the Sharia4Belgium group had fallen seriously short of his duties as a Belgian citizen. Belgium imprisoned Belkacem in 2013. In 2016, Belgium prosecuted him for using his group to send dozens of individuals to fight in Syria, most of whom allegedly joined ISIS. Belkacem is facing a 12-year prison sentence for the charge and possible deportation to Morocco. Previously a dual citizen, Belkacem retains his Moroccan nationality. Stripping dual citizens of citizenship is uncommon and remains controversial. In 2015, France said it would introduce the policy for jihadists, but dropped the plans in 2016, according to the BBC. The BBC noted that Belgium also stripped Malika el Aroud, also known as the black widow, of her Belgian citizenship in 2017. El Aroud is the widow of a Taliban fighter Abdessatar Dahmane. She is labeled as “the most dangerous woman in Belgium.” A Belgian court sentenced the “black widow” to eight years in prison for her involvement with terrorists. Belgium recently decided to extradite El Aroud to Morocco. Belgian news outlet Sud Info reported last week that the decision is in line with Belgium’s new migration and asylum legislation which came into force in May 2017.

Rabat – Morocco will return to standard time, GMT, on Sunday, October 28, at 3:00 a.m.. Moroccans will turn clocks back on Sunday, ending the summer’s Daylight Saving Time (DST), or (GMT+1). The Ministry of Administration, Modernization, and Civil Service officially announced the change October 23. Every year, Morocco adopts DST for the summer, returns to standard time for a period when Ramadan falls in summer, re-adopts DST for the remainder of the summer, returns again to Standard Time for winter on the last Sunday in October. The decision is an implementation of Decree 2-13-781 from September 2013, modifying an earlier decree on changing time.  Daylight Saving Time was first widely adopted during the first World War in the German Empire and Austria to reduce the need for lighting after daylight. Many Moroccans have expressed their wish to stop switching to GMT+1 due to the disadvantages of changing times on health. In 2017, a group of activists launched a petition urging the government and the Parliamentary Council to abolish the biannual time change and maintain Standard Time. The signatories wanted the government to issue a law indefinitely suspending Daylight Saving Time in Morocco. They deemed remaining on GMT “appropriate with the country’s geographical location throughout the year.” The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, proposed at the EU Parliament on September 12 that the continental organization end the seasonal clock change in 2019. Juncker said in his statement that member states “should themselves decide whether their citizens live in summer or wintertime.” According to the EU commission, DST represents a threat to health reflected in increased road accidents during time changes and lack of energy. The commission explains: “With an end to this system, the human body will also no longer have to adapt to the change in time.” For a “smooth transition,” the proposal suggests that member states should announce their decisions by April 2019.

Along with the Canadian Red Tail Spirit Singers and the Sacred Wolf Singers, Draa Tribes will feature in “Resonance Culturelle,” a 13-minute documentary. Produced by MDI, the short film is a cultural exchange aiming to solidify the relationship between Canada and Morocco. “We are very happy to be able to support the premiere of the short film Résonance Culturelle in Morocco, which will be screened as part of the Visa for Music festival,” the chargé d’affaires of the Canadian embassy in Morocco, Bill McCrimmon, told Music in Africa. “These successful intercultural meetings between Morocco and Canada reflect the growing dynamism of our exchanges in the cultural field and we will strive to strengthen them even more,” the official added. “Through music and the arts, I develop intercultural exchanges between groups of musicians from different cultures and countries. We establish favorable conditions to help them explore each other’s know-how, customs and cultural heritage,” MDI president and founder Nathalie Levesque told Music in Africa magazine. “Resonance Culturelle” will be screened at the fifth annual Visa For Music festival. Visa For Music is a pioneering event showcasing African and Middle Eastern music. The festival is also an occasion to attend conferences, speed-meetings, and workshops on the theme of African and Middle Eastern music. Visa For Music purports to highlight artistic creation and innovations in Africa and the Middle East. “We are very grateful to have been invited and loved everything about the festival and the great staff, great venues, line up, conferences and participants, besides the wonderful city of Rabat, the Moroccan spirit and delicious food,” stated Carolina Vallejo, multi-awarded Sekou Kouyate manager, during a previous participation in Visa For Morocco.

Rabat – The famous travel guide publisher Lonely Planet has chosen Meknes among the top 10 cities to visit worldwide in 2019. Meknes came in 10th place after Copenhagen, Denmark (1st); Shenzhen, China (2nd); Novi Sad, Serbia (3rd); Miami, the US (4th); and Kathmandu, Nepal (5th). Lonely Planet also listed Mexico City; Dakar, Senegal; Seattle, the US; and Zadar, Croatia as cities to visit in 2019. Meknes is located about 60 kilometers west of Fez and 155 kilometers east of Rabat. “The notorious war-mongering sultan who moved Morocco’s capital to Meknès in 1672 would be turning in his grave if he knew how few visitors the city receives today compared with Fez and Marrakesh,” wrote Lonely Planet. The number of tourists visiting Meknes has increased since last year. Overnight stays rose from 12,871 in January 2017 to 16,172 in January 2018, up by 26 percent. However, Meknes has far fewer visitors compared to other tourist cities in Morocco. Fez recorded 69,357 overnight stays in January 2018 compared to 51,341 in January 2017, up by 35 percent.  Marrakech, the leading Moroccan tourist city, received 542,514 overnight stays in January 2018 compared to 422,850 in the same period last year. Lonely Planet recalled the imperial history of Meknes when “Moulay Ismail plundered Marrakeshi palaces and Roman ruins at nearby Volubilis for stone and marble to build thick-set fortifications that still encase the city.” The travel guide publisher also mentioned the city’s “giant subterranean food stores” and its remnant gate, Bab Mansour, which “outshines even the Blue Gate [Bab Boujloud] in Fez.” Meknes is also famous for the mausoleum of Sultan Moulay Ismail and its old medina. “At the heart of the city, Ismail’s elaborate mausoleum is a national treasure and it’s scheduled to emerge soon from a two-year, top-to-toe restoration, giving travellers more reason than ever to visit this under-appreciated imperial city,” wrote Lonely Planet.

Rabat – Economy minister Benchaaboun has announced that Morocco will privatize some public companies to help reduce the budget deficit to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2019. The move will also generate MAD 8 billion, Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun said on Monday in a parliamentary session. The decision, according to Benchaaboun, comes to improve the governance of public companies and to increase state resources. Benchaaboun estimated that the treasury’s deficit in 2018 would end at 3.8 percent instead of 3 percent of GDP as stipulated in the finance bill. Without revenue from privatization, the budget deficit is expected to stay almost flat at 3.7 percent from a forecasted 3.8 this year, Reuters reported. However, the minister did not reveal which companies the government plans to privatize. According to Al Massae, the National Railway Office (ONCF) and the Moroccan Airports Authority (ONDA) may be privatized.. Benchaaboun also stated that increasing taxes on tobacco consumption will generate additional revenue estimated at MAD 1.2 billion in 2019. The government has also considered other measures to raise revenues. The 2019 Finance Bill will levy an additional 2.5 percent corporate income tax on companies with annual profits equal to or more than MAD 40 million. The government believes it will generate MAD 2 billion in 2019-2020 to be used as a “solidarity contribution” to reduce social disparities. Benchaaboun also noted the impact that rising oil and gas prices will have on financial balances. The economy, he added, requires measures to mobilize resources, control spending and establish mechanisms to reduce the burden on the investment budget. The government allocated MAD 17.67 billion for the subsidy fund to subsidize butane gas, sugar, and flour in 2019. The significant increase of MAD 4.65 billion from the 2018 budget can be explained by the increase of oil prices at the international level. Benchaaboun said that the increase in oil and gas prices “will imply an increase of MAD 5 billion in the expenses of the subsidy fund at the end of 2018.” “These are all indicators that illustrate the soundness of the national economy, but they must be consolidated by restoring the citizen’s confidence through quality social benefits and ensuring decent employment, a stable and reasonable income,” the minister said.

Rabat- Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan has admitted to playing “sex games” with two women in France who accuse him of sexual assault. The 55-year-old Swiss Islamic scholar, Oxford University professor and television pundit confessed on Monday that he had consensual “submissive-dominant” relations with the two women. Ramadan’s lawyer, Emmanuel Marsigny, told the press in Paris that the scholar had “relations akin to sex games of the submissive-dominant kind, but always in a consensual and knowing way.” He added that Ramadan is “relieved” and can “finally speak freely.” For a year, Ramadan has denied having any sexual relations with the women. Marsigny asserted that investigators found text messages on the two women’s phones that prove the sexual relations were consensual. Jonas Haddad, a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs, Henda Ayari, told international news outlet Reuters: “It has been one year now that Mr Ramadan’s defendants have been playing tricks to save his cause.” Ayari claims Ramadan raped her in 2012. Haddad added: “But the truth is that he lied from the beginning of this case by denying he had sexual relations and that it took one year to confess.”  “Will it take him another year to confess the rest?” Haddad questioned. In October 2017, Henda Ayari went public with a rape complaint against the professor. A French court indicted Ramadan in February on charges of rape, including rape of a “vulnerable person.” On September 18, 2018, Ramadan confronted another accuser going by the name “Christelle,” who said that he raped her in 2009 in a hotel room in Lyon, southeastern France. The court meeting lasted 10 hours. Christelle accused Ramadan of having raped and beaten her during their only meeting in in 2009, and Ayari, the first complainant, accused him of having abused her in a hotel in Paris in 2012.  Ayari’s brother contradicted her story in July, showing investigators pictures of her celebrating his wedding on the night she claimed to have been raped. In June, a third woman filed a complaint against the Islamic scholar with a similar story. If the rape charges are proven, the scholar could face up to 15 years in prison.

Rabat- Minister of Transport Abdelkader Amara has announced that a commission will provide free psychiatric support for the injured passengers of the Bouknadel train accident. Under the supervision of the general director of the National Railway Office (ONCF), Mohamed Rabie Khlie, the commission of psychiatrists and lawyers have visited the injured and the families of those who died, said Amara on Monday at the House of Representatives. Some 210 coaches and employees at ONCF are mobilized to assist travelers at train stations across the country. ONCF also has a customer relations line to answer customers’ questions and requests. The move came after a group of young Moroccan psychiatrists and psychologists based in Rabat and Casablanca volunteered to listen to and counsel the passengers recover from the trauma of the accident. Hashtags #Ajithder (come talk) and videos of the psychologists have circulated social media in recent days, inviting the train passengers to take advantage of the services. Train No. 9 linking Rabat and Kenitra on the Casablanca-Kenitra line derailed near Bouknadel one week ago at 10:20 a.m. on October 16, killing 7 and injuring 125. The investigation into the accident determined the cause was speeding. The public prosecutor of Sale’s Court of First Instance has blamed the driver for going 158 kilometers per hour when the speed limit on the stretch of track where the train derailed was only 60 kilometers per hour. In a statement on Tuesday, the prosecutor said that he is charging the train driver with accidental murder and injury of passengers. The driver, who is reportedly suffering from a serious injury, risks a prison sentence ranging from three months to five years and a fine from MAD 250 to 1,000, according to Acts 432 and 433 of the criminal code. Many Moroccans have expressed rage towards ONCF, blaming it for the accident after a recording of a conversation between ONCF employees blaming faulty tracks and speeding went viral. Moroccans have begun an online campaign with hashtags “#Baraka” (enough) and “#Boycott ONCF”  on Twitter and Facebook. ONCF, the only rail transport company in Morocco, is state-run with “financial autonomy,” according to its website. While many are calling for actions, hundreds of people immediately volunteered to donate blood for the victims of the accident at the Regional Center for Blood Transfusion.

Rabat – President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has finally spoken about Jamal Khashoggi’s murder in a speech that signals he is looking beyond the murder towards how the incident can benefit Turkey. President Erdogan spoke at noon today at the Turkish parliament, after announcing yesterday that he would tell the “full naked truth” about the Khashoggi murder case.  Throughout his address, the Turkish strongman confirmed many of the suspicions that the international community has been raising since Jamal Khashoggi, a dissident Saudi journalist, mysteriously disappeared. The US resident and columnist for the Washington Post was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. Erdogan, even if mildly, kept the promise of saying “something different” from the narrative that Riyadh has been pushing forward since admitting on Friday that Khashoggi died “accidentally” in a “fist fight” inside the consulate. “Khashoggi’s death is an international issue—and one that Turkey will pursue,” the Turkish president announced at the outset of his public address. That the “gruesome murder” of Khashoggi took place inside the Saudi consulate, technically Saudi territory, should not keep the world from asking questions, Erdogan said.  “Why was the 15-man Saudi team in Turkey? On whose orders? Why was the consulate not opened to investigators immediately? Why were so many different statements given by the Saudis? Who is the local collaborator who disposed of Khashoggi’s body?” Erdogan asked.  Saudi Arabia, he stressed, “must answer all these questions.” Erdogan’s only demands? That Turkey lead the investigation into the build-up to the murder. He also sought the participation of other countries in the still unexposed larger plot at play to ensure that all “those involved are held accountable.” During the two weeks that Saudi Arabia strenuously denied Khashoggi had been murdered inside the consulate, President Erdogan’s silence was conspicuous. Instead he chose to let the Turkish media pour out leaks that challenged Saudi Arabia’s numerous shaky claims. After Saudi Arabia ditched its narrative and developments led to the de facto diplomatic ostracizing of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS), Erdogan knew he had the world’s ears.  And so Erdogan finally took the stage to finally give ‘presidential’ validation to some of the stories that the Turkish press has clung to in the last two weeks. Why so diplomatic? For all the attention he elicited, however, President Erdogan fell somewhat short on the highest expectation of Middle East observers: Revealing the tape recordings of the murder. When Erdogan said on Monday that he would deliver the “full naked truth” of the premeditated murder, many had hoped that the Turkish leader was referring to the alleged audio and video recordings of the murder that MIT, the Turkish National Intelligence Agency, claims to have. Instead, Erdogan diplomatically withheld the most damning proof against Saudi Arabia’s claims of Crown Prince MBS’s innocence. At the same time, he clearly suggested that Khashoggi’s death was a political murder condoned and ordered by senior leadership in the House of Sauds. Surprisingly—Erdogan’s animus against MBS is no secret—the Turkish leader refrained from naming names. He espoused a slightly brotherly tone when analysts had expected an accusatory and defying rhetoric.  “I do not doubt the sincerity of King Salman. That being said, an independent investigation needs to be carried out. This is a political killing,” he said.  The implication of Erdogan’s not naming MBS, many Middle East observers have said, is that the Turkish leader does have damning evidence against MBS, as consistently claimed by MIT agents. But, they suggest, President Erdogan is waiting for an opportune moment to unleash the tape recordings, or not, based on whether Turkey gets what it wants from Saudi Arabia and the US. In an immediate analysis of the rationale behind President Erdogan’s unexpected diplomatic deference to the Saudi king, Martin Chulov, the Guardian’s Middle East correspondent, said: “Erdogan clearly calculated that it did not suit him, or Turkey, to release the audio of the killing, and apparent video – both of which multiple sources have confirmed that his officials indeed have.” Chulov continued, “His decision to return the onus to Saudi Arabia was interesting, and unexpected. After exerting extreme pressure on the kingdom through more than a fortnight of piecemeal leaks, he opted out of a coup de grace when he had the world’s attention.” Three weeks after Khashoggi’s death, the question is no longer: Did the Saudis kill Khashoggi? Saudi Arabia has admitted it. Instead, as the dissident Saudi journalist’s murder has now turned into Middle Eastern politicking, the real question, some analysts have suggested, should be: What does Turkey hope to get from the Saudi leadership’s successive strategic blunders?

Rabat – The dismembered body parts of the murdered Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, have allegedly been found in the garden of the Saudi consul general’s home. Sky News broke the news just hours after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan gave a speech at the Turkish parliament today on the murder of the journalist. According to Sky News sources, the writer’s body was “cut up” and his face “disfigured.” One of the sources implied Khashoggi’s remains were found in the garden of the Saudi consul general’s home. Erdogan called on Saudi authorities today to provide information on where the body is and who ordered his murder. He said, “Why has the body of someone who was officially said to have been killed not been found yet? Who is the local collaborator who disposed of Khashoggi’s body? Saudi must answer all these questions.“ On October 19, Saudi Arabia announced that the journalist was killed on October 2 during a “fistfight” in his visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The kingdom also said it arrested 18 suspects and fired 5 top officials. The international community, however, questioned the account, pressuring Saudi Arabia to provide more information about the murder. Erdogan described the murder as “very savage” and a political assassination. While Erdogan did not reveal how the journalist was killed, the president confirmed that the journalist’s murder “did not happen at the drop of a dime but was a planned affair.” Erdogan also urged Saudi authorities to provide answers on who ordered the 15-man Saudi team to kill the journalist.  “When the murder was so clear, why were there so many different statements given by Saudis? ” Erdogan said.

Rabat – The EU will give Morocco and Spain €140 million “in the short term” to control migration at the Moroccan-Spanish border. Spanish news outlet El Pais wrote on Monday that the EU’s favorable answer to Morocco’s request followed pressure from Spain to provide “significant support to the Mediterranean neighbor.” Morocco and Spain will receive the aid by the end of the year. The funds are to be used “mainly for the purchase of border control equipment.” The news outlet believes that the funds are “still modest and significantly lower than those destined for other countries.” A source in the Spanish government told El Pais that half of the €140 million will go to Morocco. The source also said that Rabat is satisfied with the budget. Morocco’s Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit met his Spanish counterpart Fernando Grande-Marlaska on Friday, October 19, in Madrid to discuss migration. The Spanish official said that Morocco must remain a privileged partner of Spain. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has been pressuring the EU to meet Morocco’s demands for money. During the Summit of EU Heads of State and Government held in Brussels on October 17-18, Sanchez renewed his call, proposing an EU support plan for Morocco to manage migration flows.

Rabat – Nearly a week before the Security Council’s October 29 meeting on MINURSO, Morocco’s Ambassador to the US Lalla Joumala endeavored to convince the US to extend MINURSO’s mandate by one year. The purpose of the ambassador’s meeting with US Under Secretary for Political Affairs David Hale, a source told Morocco World News on Monday, was to explain why Morocco wants a one-year extension for the MINURSO mandate. Earlier this month, AFP reported that the US is calling for MINURSO to be renewed for only six months. However, several international powers believe that six months is not enough time for the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, and his personal envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, to create the conditions to allow the UN-led political process to move forward. After the Security Council decided to renew MINURSO’s mandate for only six months in April 2018, France said the shorter mandate would be an “exception.” French Ambassador to the UN Francois Delattre said that maintaining an annual extension “guarantees the stability of peacekeeping operations.” On October 11, Delattre reiterated his country’s support for a one-year renewal of the mission’s mandate. He told AFP, “France’s position is to push for a one-year renewal, in accordance with a recommendation of the UN Secretary-General.” However, the US was firm in its position during a closed consultation at the UN Security Council on October 11. Unlike France, the US is pushing for just a six-month extension. An anonymous source told AFP after the closed consultations that Washington said a six-month extension would pressure the parties into resuming talks as they are doing in December. Morocco, Polisario, Mauritania, and Algeria will meet for talks in Geneva at the invitation of Horst Kohler. Political analysts speculate that the US decision might be imposed by Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton, who believes that MINURSO has failed to fulfill its purpose despite its 27-year presence in the region. It is also speculated that Bolton is behind the US plan to cut aid to MINURSO from $16 million to $8 million next year. The UN Security Council will meet on October 29 to decide on the mandate. Prior to the meeting, Guterres addressed his annual report on the situation in Western Sahara to the Security Council, recommending a one-year extension. ‘Group of Friends for Western Sahara’ preparations Starting Monday, the Group of Friends for Western Sahara will discuss the draft resolution on MINURSO to be submitted by the US, MWN’s source said. The group includes the US, the UK, Russia, and Morocco’s key allies: Spain and France. Later in the week, the US is expected to submit the draft resolution to members of the Security Council for processing. Hale also met Algeria’s Ambassador to the US, Madjid Bouguerra, on Friday, October 19, according to the State Department, to discuss Western Sahara.

Rabat – As promised, the Turkish president has given more details today on the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. In his address at a meeting of the ruling party, AKP, Erdogan called on King Salman of Saudi Arabia to extradite the suspects to Turkey. He said that the trial of the suspects should be held in Istanbul, where the crime was committed. Three days ago, Saudi Arabia announced that it fired five top officials and arrested 18 suspects. Erdogan received applause from the members of the Turkish parliament after making his call to King Salman. The president described the murder as “very savage” and a premeditated political assassination. Erdogan said that a group of three Saudi teams arrived in Istanbul on separate flights before the murder. He said that members of the hit-team scouted a forest near Istanbul. On October 18, Turkish officials started searching areas in the Belgrad forest and farmland near the Marmara sea to find Khashoggi’s body. It took Saudi Arabia nearly two weeks to confirm Khashoggi died in the consulate. Up until that time, Saudi Arabia claimed Khashoggi had walked out of the consulate shortly after entering.  While confirming the death of Khashoggi, Saudi Arabia said that the journalist was killed by mistake in a “fistfight.” However, the explanation failed to satisfy the international community, and several countries asked for more details. Erdogan, for his part, questioned the circumstances of the journalist’s murder. He promised that Turkey will investigate the murder thoroughly. He also questioned why Khashoggi’s body has still not been found.  “Why has the body of someone who was officially said to have been killed not been found yet?” In the hours since Erdogan’s speech, Sky News revealed that some of Khashoggi’s body parts were discovered buried in the Saudi consul-general’s garden. He added, “All those from the highest level to the lowest level will be highlighted, and will get the punishment they deserve.” He also called for Saudi Arabia to reveal those who planned to kill the journalist. Erdogan did not mention any audio or video recordings of the killing. Several media have asserted that Turkish authorities have recordings of the murder from espionage activities. The international community has called for Saudi Arabia to provide more clarifications about the murder. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that he is “deeply troubled” by the Saudi confirmation of the death of Khashoggi. He also demanded a transparent investigation into the case.

Rabat – Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi has said that Morocco’s ECOWAS bid is proof of Morocco’s genuine desire to further a South-South agenda. Speaking at the maiden News Directors Forum of the Atlantic Federation of African Press Agencies (FFAPA) on Thursday, October 18, El Khalfi stressed Morocco’s African impetus, especially since the country’s return to the African Union in January 2017. When asked why Morocco, geographically a North African country, would want to join a sub-regional body of West African states, El Khalfi said that Morocco’s ECOWAS bid is an extension of its strong belief in investing in intra-African exchanges and cooperative development projects. According to El Khalfi, the kingdom’s ECOWAS bid “reflects the vision of his majesty, the King, to build a strong South-South partnership and to bring our efforts together to deal with economic and social challenges.’’ Rather than reason in terms of geographical location, ECOWAS member states should consider the sincerity of Morocco’s agenda with the rest of Africa, especially Western Africa, he suggested. The “real reason” Morocco wants to join ECOWAS, El Khalfi continued, is Morocco’s realization that its future belongs in Africa and its eagerness to contribute to the emergence of a strong Africa. He described Morocco’s ECOWAS move as “a still ongoing project.” He explained that the rationale behind the move is to “enhance our capacities to deal with the economic and social challenges of the 21st century.” Morocco’s ECOWAS aspirations came in the immediate aftermath of Morocco’s African turn, when it officially returned to the African Union in January 2017.
Meeting in June 2017 in Monrovia, Liberia, the 15 leaders of ECOWAS agreed in principle to Morocco’s membership request, dubbing it “receivable” in the framework of the sub-regional body’s charter. At the 52nd ECOWAS summit in December 2017 in Abuja, Nigeria, a study on the economic and socio-political impacts of Morocco’s prospective membership was submitted to the 15 West African leaders. They failed, however, to reach a general consensus on Morocco’s request. Since then, Morocco’s ECOWAS aspirations have gone through highs and lows, spoken about in both good and bad terms. In the latest development, the sub-regional body’s leadership has appointed an independent three-member committee to legally review Morocco’s request.
The legal review phase is the final step in ECOWAS admission procedures. Should things proceed as planned, the independent committee will deliver its verdict in the following weeks.

Rabat – After investigating the October 16 Bouknadel train accident, the public prosecutor of Sale’s Court of First Instance has blamed the driver for going 158 kilometers per hour. The public prosecutor said today in a statement that he is charging the driver with accidental murder and injury of passengers. The public prosecutor noted that the speed limit on the stretch of track where the train derailed was only 60 kilometers per hour. The driver risks a prison sentence ranging from three months to five years and a fine from MAD 250 to 1,000. After the accident, news outlets reported that the driver was seriously injured. The prosecutor’s statement added that the misdemeanor and punishment of the charge is in accordance with Acts 432 and 433 of the criminal code. The prosecutor referred the driver to the Court of First Instance in Sale.  Seven passengers died and 125 were injured when a train heading to Kenitra from Casablanca derailed near Bouknadel, north of Sale. Two days after the accident, leaked audio recordings of a phone conversation between Morocco’s railway operator (ONCF) employees blamed the Bouknadel train accident on the train’s speed. One of the employees stated that a problem on the track was noticed four days before the accident, October 12, but ONCF did not properly communicate the reduced speed limit to drivers or take it into consideration.

Rabat – As tomato season has entered full swing, some farmers in Morocco have turned towards other crops. Moroccan farmers have increasingly begun cultivating other crops, such as bell peppers and blueberries. Spain has also begun planting fewer “snack tomatoes.”  The shift comes as farmers try to recover from last season in which both a drought and a colder winter than expected proved disastrous for the agriculture sector, particularly hindering the country’s seasonal cereal production.  Approximately 40 percent of Morocco’s workforce is employed in the agriculture industry, and the 2017-18 drought left thousands under- or unemployed. Tomatoes represent a significant portion of the agriculture industry. Morocco was the fourth largest tomato exporter in the world in 2017 behind Mexico, the Netherlands, and Spain. Much of the crop is shipped to the EU with France being the largest importer of the fruit.

Rabat – Paraguay’s deputy minister of foreign affairs, Hugo Caballero, has reaffirmed his country’s firm support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. The official made the remarks on Friday, October 19, during the first session of the Morocco-Paraguay consultations in Asuncion, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). “Regarding Morocco’s territorial integrity, Paraguay reiterates its unconditional support for Morocco’s position on this conflict and for all initiatives in support of the kingdom” to reach an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. He added that Morocco can always count on Paraguay’s support to find a peaceful solution to the conflict that has lasted for more than 42 years. Paraguay’s foreign affairs minister Luis Alberto Castiglioni reiterated his country’s support for Morocco at the 73rd United Nations General Assembly in September. “We are very pleased that relations between Paraguay and Morocco are at their best and we are working to make them even better,” said the Paraguayan minister. Recently, Morocco has received the support of several countries backing Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as a just solution to the conflict, including the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, and Guinea Bissau.The support is positive for Morocco, especially as the Security Council will meet on October 29 to adopt a new resolution on the Western Sahara conflict. The Security Council will also decide on the mandate of MINURSO, the UN mission in Western Sahara. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, called on the Security Council to extend the mandate of the mission to one year. In April, the Security Council renewed MINURSO’s mandate for only six months.

Rabat – While 300 Sub-Saharans stormed the Melilla border fence, 12 Moroccan soldiers received injuries. Morocco arrested 141 migrants and will repatriate them. One of the 12 was seriously injured in the exercise. All the wounded were immediately transported to the Nador hospital for treatment, according to a military source who spoke to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). One migrant died after falling from the fence and 22 others were injured by the barbed wire. They were also transferred to Nador’s hospital. The Moroccan Ministry of the Interior said that public forces arrested 141 undocumented immigrants during the operation. Spanish authorities gave quite different figures, saying that only 200 migrants reached Spain, while 100 failed to cross. Morocco has decided to repatriate all 141 sub-Saharan migrants who attempted to cross the borders on Sunday, according to the ministry’s statement. On October 20, Melilla also announced it would repatriate 30 Moroccan migrants. According to El Faro de Melilla, the repatriated migrants had been rescued from the sea by Spanish authorities on October 19 and transported to Melilla. In July, at least 600 migrants crossed the border from Morocco to the Spanish enclave Ceuta. By July 30, more than 24,000 migrants entered Europe through the western Mediterranean route from Morocco in 2018. Spain’s Ministry of Interior said earlier this year 38,000 migrants are believed to have entered Spain in 2018. According to the Moroccan director of immigration and border surveillance, Khalid Zerouali, Morocco has aborted nearly 65,000 migration attempts annually since 2016. Morocco’s Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit met with his Spanish counterpart Fernando Grande-Marlaska on Saturday to discuss migration issues in Madrid.

Rabat – Truck drivers who transport fruits and vegetables to wholesale markets have been on strike, causing prices to skyrocket, since Friday.  The supply of fruits and vegetables has decreased by 33 percent, according to Moroccan media outlet Assabah.  Casablanca, which typically receives 1,400 truckloads of produce daily, only received 540 on Friday, driven in by vans or trailers.  Prices have risen across all fruits and vegetables. Potatoes’ wholesale price, for example, increased from MAD 2.5 per kilogram to 4, while the price of onions rose from MAD 0.8 per kilogram to 3. The price of fruit increased even more: Grapes increased from MAD 5 per kilogram to 12.  Truck drivers and owners have said they will continue striking until their demands are met. The strike is protesting the reduction of allowable tonnage trucks can legally transport, according to a firm specialized in the transport and supply of fruits and vegetable in an interview with Moroccan media outlet Yabiladi. The strike is also caused by rising oil prices, which peaked globally in early October.

Rabat- Morocco’s current account deficit will narrow over the next quarters, owing to the “booming autos and phosphates exports.” In a report by Fitch Solutions Macro Research, Morocco’s account deficit is set to shrink to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2018 and 2.2 percent in 2019, down from 3.6 percent in 2017. The lowered deficit is thanks to rising export growth, expected to continue in 2019. The main drivers behind booming exports are vehicles, phosphates, aeronautics, and agricultural products.  The report also anticipates rapidly increasing growth in Morocco’s vehicle production. Production will grow by 18.2 percent in  2019, up from 16.8 percent in 2018, in line with the government’s 2014-2020 Industrial Acceleration Plan. The plan has two major goals. The first goal is to create 500,000 jobs, half of which are to be generated by Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and half from the restored industry.  Second, the plan aims to increase industrial production’s share in GDP from 14 percent in 2018 to 23 percent in 2020. “FDI has performed poorly over 2018, with liabilities (investments by foreign residents) contracting by 1.9% quarter-on-quarter in Q218. That said, this still represents a 3.9% increase on a year-on-year basis.” The report keeps an optimistic tone over Morocco’s ability to attract more FDI over the coming years. The US and Brazilian markets’ demand for fertilisers, “the primary end-product of Moroccan phosphates,” is also expected to increase, the report states. Moreover, the projected slower rise of global energy prices compared to the rapid rise in 2018, will support Morocco’s current account by moderating imports. The rapid rise in oil price “has put immense upward pressure on Moroccan imports,” states the report, explaining that Brent crude oil prices rose to $86.3 per barrel in early October 2018 from $57.2 per barrel a year earlier. Fitch expects Brent crude to remain $82 per barrel on average in 2019, calling the trend “more tepid oil price gains ahead.” As Morocco’s energy imports are expected to remain more steady, the current account deficit will gradually narrow.  In its previous report, Fitch group argued that the Moroccan government is no longer considering capping fuel prices, taking back its earlier argument which stated that the “political pressure brought about by rising inflation on the back of higher oil prices, would push the government to cap fuel prices.” For now, Morocco’s fuel prices cap scheme has “fizzled out,” since inflation is on the back foot again. “Given that we expected subsidies to account for nearly a third of new spending in 2018, the avoidance of this measure will be positive for consolidation efforts,” it states. The government had reportedly finalized a plan to cap fuel prices in July and was awaiting approval by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. The fuel price cap plan came amid growing anger and demonstrations against rising living costs that have fueled a boycott against three companies: Sidi Ali, Afriquia gas, and Centrale Danone. Morocco lifted fuel subsidies in 2015, deregulating the fuel distribution market. Now prices have reached a five year high as oil prices worldwide have increased. The public became angrier when a parliamentary report was leaked revealing fuel distributors had increased their profits. As prices increased, distributors’ profit margins widened, but they did not expand Morocco’s storage capacity to the extent they pledged.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has chaired a ceremony focused on the sustainable restoration of Morocco’s medinas (walled cities). King Mohammed VI chaired a signing ceremony of four conventions on restoration programs at Riad El Aarous Palace in Marrakech on Monday. The projects aim to promote some of Morocco’s more popular tourism destinations: Sale near Rabat, Meknes near Fez, Tetouan near Tangier, Marrakech, and the coastal city of Essaouira. Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit opened the ceremony by presenting the MAD 2.35 billion budget for the programs.  The restoration programs aim to preserve Morocco’s architectural heritage and to honor cultural wealth. Each city will receive a portion of the budget: Sale MAD 900 million, Meknes MAD 800 million, Tetouan MAD 350 million, Essaouira MAD 300 million, and Marrakech MAD 484 million. Although the official budget is MAD 2.35 billion, the totaled budgets of each city’s projects add up to MAD 2.83 billion. The Hassan II Fund for Economic and Social Development will contribute approximately 40 percent of the budget. The financing agreement of the Marrakech 2018-2022 restoration programs was signed on May 14 in Rabat, in a ceremony King Mohammed VI chaired. Ministers, including Minister of Education Said Amzazi and Minister of Islamic Affairs Ahmed Taoufiq, as well as governors signed the four agreements. Women’s empowerment in the agenda After the signing, the King launched a restoration project for the “Sidi Abdelaziz” school to include a center for women artisans. The MAD 10.9 million project will offer young girls and women professional training in handicraft skills. The launch of the project follows King Mohammed VI’s repeated calls for government to promote vocational training to empower youth and integrate them into the labour market. The center aims also to reinforce the handicraft sector as a source of job creation and to integrate the trained women into the labor market. It seeks also to promote local handicraft products. The Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity, the National Initiative for Human Development, the Ministry of Housing, the Ministry of Tourism, the Marrakech Urban Agency, the State Secretariat for Vocational Training, and Al Omrane Holding partnered to launch the project.

Rabat – Moroccan and Tunisian business representatives have agreed to reinforce their economic ties, especially in the automotive industry. Both parties held a meeting Friday, October 19, in Tunis to strengthen their economic relationship and to examine the causes of its weakness. The Moroccan embassy in Tunis organized the meeting, themed “Economic Exchanges Between Morocco and Tunisia: Obstacles and Prospects.” The meeting is being held in the context of cultural days October 13-30, Maghreb Arab Press reported October 20. Representatives from both sides have expressed their interest in reinforcing economic relations “especially with the development of the exporting vehicles sector in Morocco and the Tunisian expertise in manufacturing vehicles’ components,” Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper reported October 20. Morocco is a leader in Africa in car production and export. The North African country produced 345,000 passenger vehicles in 2017, surpassing South Africa’s 331,000 cars. In April, Morocco’s Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy announced Morocco’s determination to exceed MAD 100 billion in vehicle export sales by 2020. The minister, who made his announcement during the 2018 Automotive Subcontracting Fair, said that Morocco wants to raise the bar to MAD 200 billion in exports with a production capacity of 1 million vehicles by 2025. Through the bilateral cooperation, Morocco could benefit from Tunisia’s expertise in car manufacturing. According to Asharq Al-Awsat, “The industry of vehicles’ components is one of the oldest in Tunisia and the most developed in the region — around 90,000 engineers and laborers work in this sector.” ‘Weak’ trade between Morocco and Tunisia Bilateral trade between Tunisia and Morocco has been very modest for many years.  In the meeting Friday in Tunis, Moroccan and Tunisian officials expressed their regret over low trade levels between the two countries. Morocco’s Ambassador to Tunisia Latifa Akharbach said that Morocco and Tunisia are struggling to increase their trade despite the advantages of their respective economies. She added that in 2017, trade between Morocco and Tunisia barely reached TND 854 million (MAD 2.8 billion). The Moroccan-Tunisian High Joint Commission set a target of $500 million in trade in 2020. The number, a 68 percent increase in trade in just three years, according to Akharbach, is “out of our reach.” Tunisian officials shared the same negative views, who quoted a lower figure for trade in 2017. According to the Tunisian secretary of state to the minister of commerce, Hichem Ben Ahmed, bilateral trade did not exceed TND 740 million (MAD 2.4 billion) in 2017 and TND 611 (MAD 2.03 billion) in 2016. Ben Ahmed explained that, despite the Arab free trade zone, increasing trade levels is stymied by the countries not having mutually recognized conformity certificates for product standards and the absence of a direct maritime line. Bilateral trade does not exceed 3 percent of all foreign trade between the two countries, said Akharbach. Tunisia’s Minister of Development, Investment, and International Cooperation Zied Ladhari also confirmed that trade between the two countries is minimal. He urged leaders to boost bilateral cooperation, especially in promising areas such as the automotive, food, and processing industries. The minister also called on the operators from both countries to focus on dynamic industries, particularly pharmaceutics, aeronautics, tourism, and information technology.  Akharbach also noted that Morocco ranks as the 35th biggest importer of Tunisian goods while Tunisia ranks the 36th biggest importer of Moroccan goods.

Rabat – While the Saudi royal family tries to convince the international community that Crown Prince MBS was unaware of Khashoggi’s murder, the uncovering of a reported network of online crusaders has revealed “the darker side” of the Saudi prince. “Each morning, Jamal Khashoggi would check his phone to discover what hell had been unleashed while he was sleeping,” said a New York Times report on October 20. Documenting an online army set up and commanded Saud-al-Qahtani, a senior media advisor to Crown Prince, the Times reported that the MBS-affiliated online “crusaders” received direct orders and a “black list” to harass, intimidate, and humiliate all critics to the Riyadh regime. Jamal Khashoggi, the dissident journalist who is believed to have been killed by a 15-pperson Saudi hit team at the country’s consulate in Istanbul on October 2, was among the top targets of the Saudi crown prince’s twitter brigade, the Times found. “The mornings were worst for him because he would wake up to the equivalent of sustained gunfire,” Mitchet Salem, a friend of Khashoggi’s 15 years, told the Times. So toxic and destructive was the twitter warfare impact on Khashoggi that his inner circle would check on him every early morning to know how he was doing mentally, and whether the repeated harassment bullying and sustained twitter harassment had not have any major effects on his mental state. The troll farm, as the crown prince’s twitter army called themselves, were daily given names of dissidents and influential Saudis—both residing in the kingdom and abroad—to routinely harass and attack. The central aim was to feed and nurture “intimidation campaigns against influential voices raising questions about the darker side of the crown prince. Image-management and perception-manufacturing In addition to twitter bullying and attacks of all sorts to discredit and humiliate MBS critics, the farm’s goals include an “image-revamping” campaign and an “image-management crusaded.” This was done heavy-handed censorship and manipulation to “create reality” that showed the crown prince in a positive light. Since MBS’s ascent to prominence, the Gulf country has been obsessed with managing its image, seven people interviewed by the Times, including former farm operatives, university researchers, and activists who have been trying to uncover the Saudi online army said. They explained how MBS’s inner circle heavily invested online platforms to drive the conversations and shape perceptions and attitude towards the kingdom and its then emerging charismatic and progressive-portrayed prince. The goal, according to interviewees, was to charm the international community, especially the global business world and investors by presenting the Saudi kingdom as “a vibrant and more socially progressive country than it was once.” Khashoggi’s counteroffensive But how does the uncovering of a Twitter army undermine the narrative recently put out by the Saudi family on the circumstances that led to Khasshoggi’s murder? The report answered: “Before his death, Mr. Khashoggi was launching projects to combat online abuse and try to reveal that Crown Prince Mohammed was mismanaging the country.” With his project of launching a counteroffensive at the Saudi government’s troll farm, Khashoggi contacted Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident residing in Canada. In September, Khashoggi wired $5,000 to Abdulaziz, whom he had put in charge of assembling a group of other Saudi dissidents who had volunteered to strike back at the government’s online attacks and expose the myth that lurked beneath the flamboyant and progressive MBS. “The volunteers called themselves the ‘Electronic Bees’,” the report explained. It added, perhaps most critically, “Eleven days before Mr. Khashoggi died in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, he wrote on twitter that the bees were coming.” Saudi Arabia accepted on Friday that Khashoggi had been killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, after two weeks of unapologetically firmly the kill-and-dispose narrative and unapologetically telling the world that the dissident journalist had left the consulate. On Saturday, a host of senior Saudi officials, including Saud-al-Qahtani, MBS’ media advisor who masterminded and led prince’s the online crusade against dissidents, were dismissed from their posts as the kingdom’s tries to clear to wash the crown prince’s hands of Khashoggi’s murder. The Saudi minister called the murder “a rogue operation,” adding that MBS had “not been aware,” and that those who killed the dissident journalist “made a mistake and tried to cover up for it.” Turkey has however made it abundantly clear that it has “a totally different version of the facts” that appear to criminalize the crown prince. Turkish president Recep Tayyip President Erdogan, who has been atypically silent since the Khashoggi murder incident erupted, preferring to watch from the sidelines as Turkish media outlets leaked news that belied successive Saudi claims, said he would speak on the Khashoggi case at weekly party meeting on Tuesday this week.

Rabat – Sexual harassment and assaults in Morocco adds pressures and fear to the lives of Moroccan women and girls. On Sunday, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) shared a statement with news outlets on the opening of an investigation regarding a video of a rape attempt in Casablanca. The video, which was filmed by a person from a building close to the crime scene, has gone viral on social media. In the video, the perpetrator tries to force himself on a girl from behind while she was trying to escape. At one point in the video, the man behind the camera called his friends to see what happened. “Look what is happening right there.”  A few seconds later, a man responded, “Maybe if you scream from here he will hear us and let her go.” However, nothing in the recording indicates that any of the observers took action. Don’t film, take action Bouchra Abdou, president of the Association Tahadi for Equality and Citizenship, talked to Morocco World News about the incident. In her interview with Morocco World News, the activist expressed anger over how people share videos of a sexual nature as if it is something normal. She said that instead of helping victims, some people film and share videos on social media as a way to present evidence and talk about sexual harassment. She asked what is the use of publicizing such videos if onlookers take no actions. The president of Hope Center in Fez, Asmae Kabba, had a similar view. Kabba told Morocco World News that it is good to document assaults, but people should not share them on social media, but rather give them to the police as an evidence of what they have witnessed. However, Abdou called on authorities to punish the people who film and share such videos without helping victims. More policing is needed Kabba said that there should be local police stations everywhere: districts, forests, and parks. The activist said that using a security approach would help curb sexual crimes across the country as perpetrators would be afraid of police being present. “In order for you to file a complaint, you need to walk miles and miles to reach police centers, which are usually located in the center of each city or a town. And it will be late, as perpetrators might have a chance to flee the scene before the arrival of police.” Kabba also called on the government and security forces to “launch a media campaign and to make perpetrators aware what they risk in case of similar incidents.” Abdou said that NGOs are not enough to raise awareness about sexual assault, calling on the government to increase its efforts to deal with such issues. She called on security forces to create a “green light” or a hotline to receive complaints and intervene immediately. “The police hotline, 19, is not enough. We need another hotline, which is available 24 hours and 7 days a week to receive complaints of sexual assaults.” She said that the Ministry of Communication must cooperate with telecommunication companies, like Maroc Telecom, Orange, and Inwi to make calls for free to the hotline. Last week, another video of a rape attempt caused outrage among social media.  Screenshots from the video showcase a topless perpetrator on top of a naked woman, who tried to hide her face while another person filmed. Some social media users said that the perpetrators were asking her to pay them in order to let her go. A statement from the DGSN said on Monday that the video dates back to 2016 and that the suspects have been brought to justice. Recently, a hashtag called Masakatch or (I won’t be silent) was created against violence, sexual harassment and assaults on women. The movement is similar to the MeToo hashtag, an international movement against sexual assault, rape, and harassment. Last week Social media users were sharing pictures of another suspect in another location which appears to be in a forest.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has called for government to increase public finance for political parties for “reflection, analysis and innovation.” Will increasing public funding bring more political efficiency or change anything at all in the political scene in Morocco? In his speech at the opening of the new parliamentary year on Friday, October 12, King Mohammed VI said he would increase funding for political parties. “I am keen to make sure political parties and organizations are supported and incentivized so they can revisit their work methods. This should contribute to enhancing the performance of political parties and organizations in addition to improving legislation and public policies,”  the King said. “For this reason, I recommend increasing public finance for political parties,” he added. Driss El Ganbouri, a political researcher, explained to Morocco World News the context of the King’s decision. “In 2011 during the Arab spring, the Moroccan state noticed the absence of political parties in the streets. This is because the parties do not have strong representation and do not play its role in mentoring youth and there is no internal innovation.” Increasing public funds for political parties “came as [the result of] a diagnosis the royal palace conducted on the political situation and political parties,” he added. Political parties in Morocco receive annual public funds and extra contributions during elections to fund campaigns. According to the Organic Law 29.11 on political parties, the state allocates annual funds, currently MAD 60 million, to each political party, provided that it participates in general legislative elections and puts forward candidates in at least 10 percent of the local constituencies in elections of members of the House of Representatives. Parties which meet the conditions also receive MAD 17 million every four years to organize their regular national conferences. In addition, the parties which receive at least 5 percent of the vote are allocated annual , distributed according to the number of seats they won and the number of votes they earned. In election years, the state gives parties a threefold budget to run their campaigns. The total amount of the state’s contribution to fund the 2016 elections was set at MAD 200 million with a maximum of MAD 750,000 for each political party, according to the head of government’s decision issued on August 10, 2016. As for a potential increase in public funds to political parties that the King brought up in his latest speech, there is no official information about how much it would be increased. The Moroccan Constitution guarantees opposition parties “the benefit of public finance, conforming to the provisions of the law.” There are 34 political parties in Morocco, including six in the ruling government coalition. Political parties believe that the move is an enhancement of the King’s confidence in parties. Minister of Energy Aziz Rabbah, a member of the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) told Morocco World News that the support “shows the King’s confidence in political parties and a message to perform their duty as it should be. Political parties are basic ingredients in political and democratic life.” Political parties state that they invest public funding to hire qualified people to do political work. The assertion is in line with the King’s call in his latest speech. “Part of that financing should go to qualified people hired to work in fields relating to reflection, analysis and innovation,” the King said. Abdellatif Ouahbi of the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM), a party in the ruling government coalition, told Morocco World News that political parties need financial support “because they lack qualified people in different domains. The idea of volunteerism and financial contributions no longer exists.” Ouahbi added, “We need the financial support to recruit qualified people to discuss the nation’s issues because [at this point] only party members volunteer to do so. This support will enable us to have professionals rather than amateurs.” Rabbah also said that the parties “need considerable logistical and financial support to ensure there is no influence from wealthy people. In this way, parties can be independent to invest in recruiting experts and qualified people to share their ideas and opinions.” Political researcher El Ganbouri believes that some political parties particularly need state support. “Some political parties cannot cover their activities in all regions of Morocco, especially in the southern provinces, due to lacking financial resource,” El Ganbouri said. “The support will be given to invest in competencies and enable them to renovate themselves. In return, the parties should intensify their work and be open to qualified people, especially youth,” he affirmed. “They should also give qualified people the chance to move up within the party and not be limited to promoting opportunists.” On the other hand, El Ganbouri indicated that the financial support “will give political parties no excuse to claim lack of resources.” El Ganbouri recalled the King’s 2017 speech when he criticized the political class and challenged it to reconsider its relationship with citizens and reconcile with society. “Political parties are responsible for the marginalization of youth,” El Ganbouri asserted. In his speech at the opening of the parliamentary year in 2017, the King criticized the political class’s work and asked for more efficiency. “I do not criticize just for the sake of criticizing, nor do I let matters go unattended. What I want is for the situation to be addressed, mistakes corrected, and shortcomings remedied,” the King said. “However, the situation today commands greater firmness in order to put an end to complacency and to disregard for citizens’ interests.” Public funding of political parties could provide parties with resources to enhance citizens’ representation and mobilization in politics, which could increase citizens’ participation in political life.  According to Article 7 of the Moroccan Constitution, “The political parties work for the structuring and for the political instruction of the citizens for the promotion of their participation in the national life and the management of public affairs.”  However, the parties no longer rely on solely the power of ideology, one of the main factors that draws citizens in to become members. Citizens also choose not to join political parties because they lack confidence in the parties. Lack of credibility might be the greatest weakness that parties suffer from when it comes to attracting citizens to become members.  Despite the public finance for political parties, their role in increasing political participation has not been fulfilled in reality. The gap between party elites and people on the street has been widening year by year. As polls show, few people voted in recent legislative elections. Analysts explain low participation rates as a lack of confidence in politicians and dissatisfaction with governmental performance. Ahmed Elaalam, a political analyst, heavily criticized public financing of political parties, deeming it as an opportunity to exhaust taxpayer money to support “weak and shabby” parties. Public funding for political parties is “an opportunity to pump out more public money for ‘nothing’: to buy or rent spider-domed premises, to hold meetings with empty chairs, to produce unread newspapers and unseen websites, to run election campaigns with illusive programs and empty promises to citizens,” Elaalam told Morocco World News. Elaalam imputed the weakness of the parties to lack of public support because of the parties’ disregard for public interest and their disappointing performance. “If the parties are doing their job properly, they will deserve all the support, whether official or popular,” Elaalam said. “If the parties were strong, they would not need support because they would have public support from their popular bases. But when they moved away from the public interests and turned into ‘cartels’ of interests, they bet on their position within state institutions instead of betting on the people’s satisfaction and support.” Public financial support for political parties is subject to accountability according to the law.  In Morocco, the High Court of Auditors controls and audits public funding.  According to Article 147 of the Moroccan Constitution, the Court of Auditors audits the accounts of the political parties and verifies the regularity of electoral spending. El Ganbouri believes the state should follow up and monitor political party spending “because it is public money.” In contrast, some party members assert that they should govern their own spending of state money. In the view of Minister Rabbah of the PJD, “Political parties should have good financial governance and adopt expertise and competence criteria in the recruitment process.” Ouahbi of PAM shared the same opinion, saying, “Political parties should wisely use the money and should not again [hire] members of their families and friends into the party. It will also make parties avoid seeking financial support from foreign sponsors.” El Ganbouri emphasized, “Financial accounting will make political parties more responsible and improve their performance to avoid chaos. It will also rationalize and develop political work,” he said. However, El Ganbouri stressed, “The political parties which misuse the financial support and do not value their responsibility are the same parties which promote corruption and nepotism.” For the political analyst Elaalam, the political parties have not achieved anything with the support they have received for decades. He also questioned how the funding’s use would be assessed and the outcome of the support. “Have the parties achieved their objectives or rather have they already had goals outside of official institutions?” he wondered. With low public satisfaction and confidence in political parties and the continuous failure of the parties to encourage youth to be politically involved, it is unlikely Morocco’s political scene will witness a significant change, regardless of an increase in public funding.

Rabat – Is Herve Renard again in “tactical disagreement” with Moroccan footballing authorities? After weeks of stability that followed post-World Cup rumors about Herve Renard leaving his position as the Atlas Lions head coach, the debate has recently resurfaced as Morocco’s Atlas Lions unimpressive shape has sparked questions about tactics and team morale. Reports have indicated that the Moroccan Federal Football Federation (FRMF) has taken steps to prepare to replace the team’s French head coach.
According to Mercato 365, the football-focused outlet which first reported the story, Fouzi Lekjaa, the FRMF president, has recently made a host of moves which suggest uneasiness with Renard. Lekjaa, who is known for attending the Lions’ matches, “ditched” the national squad for their latest trip to Comoros, where the Lions eventually drew 2-2 with their host. Three days prior to the draw, Morocco hosted Comoros and won unconvincingly, thanks to a late-penalty. That poor performance was the culmination of a post-World Cup crisis of personal issues between some players and staff members, reports have relayed. The quality chasm between the current Atlas Lions and the inspiring squad that played in Russia in June has quickly sounded the alarm bell among Lekjaa and company, who are said to have actively started looking for alternatives for Renard. Moroccan outlet Le 360 reported on October 18 that FRMF is increasingly having qualms about “some of Renard’s latest tactical choices” as well as “the complacency of the squad’s technical staff” towards established players who, given their current shape, should not be the first choices. Carlos Queiroz, the Portuguese coach of the Iranian national team, is the name making the rounds as an eventual first choice replacement for Renard. The veteran Portuguese coach beat Renard in Russia this summer. Some believe that his successful spell with an underdog Iranian team, especially their display against heavyweights at this year’s World Cup, has charmed many in Lekjaa’s inner circles. They have allegedly claimed that the Queiroz’s more experienced handling of in-transition-teams and his more impressive pedigree on the world stage—Queiroz coached teams of Real Madrid’s stature—may be better suited for a talent-laden Moroccan team hungry for trophies and the continental glory that has been eluding it for over a decade. Dealing with post-World Cup euphoria When Morocco returned from its mixed World Cup record, it took FRMF and Herve Renard almost a month to settle rumors of “fundamental disagreement” between Renard and the upper echelons of FRMF about the Atlas Lions management. After dragging each other into the surging debate about extending or not extending Renard’s contract, the Frenchman and Fouzi Lekjaa, the FRMF president, finally decided to comment upon the rumors. They both expressed satisfaction at the quality of play and team spirit that the Moroccan national team gave at the World Cup. Lekjaa said that both the FRMF leadership and Moroccan fans have grown to like the team that the Atlas Lions had become under Renard’s tutelage. The players, he noted, liked their coach even more, having developed a winning team attitude and morale largely made possible by the Frenchman’s success in, and good grasp of, African football. The overwhelming sentiment, Lekjaa suggested, was that Renard maintain his position at least until the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN), a tournament Morocco is keen to win after an early debacle in Russia and nearly two decades of anonymous performances in senior African competitions. All about motivation? Faced with floods of rumors about an imminent or eventual contract breach with Renard, the FRMF issued statements in which it strenuously denied “such a thing.” A number of FRMF sources have since given a host of interviews to “expunge the false allegations” that may be bad for the cohesion and preparedness of a squad that needs to focus on its remaining two CAN qualifier games. FRMF spokesperson Mohamed Makrouf told Arabophone outlet Koora that Moroccan footballing authorities are increasingly annoyed with “such rumors” and “do not have to always answer them.” “Our trust in Hervé Renard is complete, and this decision [sacking Renard] is unthinkable. We are preparing to play an important CAN qualifier against Cameroon, and we regret such distractions targeting Morocco’s national team,” Makrouf said. “We are interested in no other coach, and Renard will continue his mission,” he added.
Renard’s “mission” after the World Cup fiasco has been set in terms of qualifying for the CAN, with the hope of at least reaching the semi finals, a phase that Morocco has not reached since 2004. That year, the Atlas Lions reached the final, where they lost 2-1 to host nation Tunisia. For all of FRFM’s strong denials of the rumors, some Moroccan fans and football observers have been quick to detect an FRMF-set game to let rumors spread in a bid to impact Renard. The message, they argue, is to let Renard know that despite his popularity with Moroccan fans, replacement is an option if the Lions fail to deliver improved and confidence-inspiring performances in the build-up to CAN. Morocco will take on Group B leader Cameroon at the Mohamed V Stadium in Casablanca on November 16. And Renard, who has made no statements regarding the sprawling rumors, may be contemplating the Cameroon match as an opportunity to make a resounding statement regarding his future with the Atlas Lions.

Rabat- France’s Saint Tropez Court has summoned the second French woman who accused Moroccan singer Saad Lamjarred of rape. Following Lamjarred’s last hearing on October 19, the court resolved to let the singer and his accuser meet in court for the first time to listen and compare each party’s statements, according to Moroccan news outlet Hespress. The case will take into account evidence from Lamjarred’s previous rape complaint, the news outlet said. French authorities arrested the 33-year-old pop singer on August 26 in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France after police received a new rape complaint from a young French seasonal worker. Lamjarred was released under judicial supervision but prohibited from leaving France or contacting the complainant. In addition, the singer was required to pay bail of €150,000. On September 18, Lamjarred went back to jail following the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal in southern France decision after the prosecutor’s office in Draguignan appealed his release under judicial supervision. The singer is already facing trial on a charge of rape for the sexual assault of French national Laura Prioul in 2016. French authorities temporarily released the artist on bail under electronic surveillance on April 13, 2017, after he spent nearly six months in detention at the Marriott Champs Elysées in Paris. Lamjarred denies Prioul’s allegations against him.  Dozens of Moroccan and international celebrities expressed sympathy and solidarity with the singer, including Emirati star Ahlam and Moroccan singer Asma El Mnawar, vouching for his “good character.” Lamjarred also faced a rape charge in the United States in 2010. However, Lamjarred left the US on bail, and the prosecutor later dropped the charges when the woman withdrew her complaint due to a settlement.

Rabat – Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he plans to reveal “the naked truth” on the killing of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi.  Speaking on Sunday, Erdogan said more details about the case will be revealed in “full detail” Tuesday when Turkey’s ruling party, the AKP, meets in Ankara. On Saturday, after weeks of denials, Saudi Arabia finally admitted that Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi consulate, claiming it was a result of a fight which broke out after his arrival on October 2.  Erdogan’s remarks signal the first time Turkey’s president has spoken at length publicly about the details surrounding the Khashoggi case. He stated, “We are looking for justice here and this will be revealed in all its naked truth, not through some ordinary steps but in all its naked truth.” Turkish officials have previously stated that they believe Khashoggi was killed by a 15-man group of Saudi hit men who flew into Istanbul the same day that Khashoggi was last seen entering the consulate.  A report by the Middle East Eye claims that after Khashoggi was killed, he was quickly dismembered and at least part of his body was transported out of Istanbul by the same plane which carried the alleged killers back to Riyadh.  Security footage from Ataturk Airport shows Maher Abdulaziz Mutrib, an intelligence officer often seen traveling with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS), quickly bypassing security with a large bag and boarding a plane with the rest of the 15 men on October 2. CNN claims to have security footage of Mustafa Al-Madani, another member of the 15 man group, leaving the consulate in the same clothes that Khashoggi wore when he entered, in an apparent attempt to make it seem as if Khashoggi had left the building alive. More footage later shows Madani, still in Khashoggi’s clothes, walking around the Blue Mosque, one of Istanbul’s largest tourist destinations. Meshal Saad Albostani, a member of the Saudi Royal Air Force, who was positively identified among the the group of 15, was himself killed in a car accident in Riyadh last week. On Saturday, prosecutors in Saudi Arabia stated that they had arrested 18 individuals in connection with the murder of Khashoggi. Speaking to the Financial Times, a Turkish official said the government had successfully “shamed” the Saudis into admitting responsibility for Khashoggi’s death.  In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Saudi foreign minister Adel Ahmed Al-Jubier denied that either MBS or King Salman had ordered the killing of Khashoggi, instead stating the killers were part of a rogue operation.  “The individuals who did this did this outside the scope of their authority,” he told Fox News. “There obviously was a tremendous mistake made, and what compounded the mistake was the attempt to try to cover up. That is unacceptable in any government.” Both MBS and King Salman are said to have called Khashoggi’s eldest son over the weekend to offer their condolences.  Erdogan’s plan to reveal more about the Khashoggi case on Tuesday coincides with the start of the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia. The investment conference has been plagued by high-profile companies, such as Siemens and the New York Times, pulling out amidst the fallout from Khashoggi’s killing. By Josh Babb

Rabat – Morocco’s Prince Moulay Hicham Alaoui has once again commented on Jamal Khashoggi’s case. The prince, a friend of Khashoggi’s, has been following the case closely since the disappearance of the prominent Saudi journalist after he visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. Under massive pressure, Saudi Arabia confirmed on October 19 the death of the journalist during a “fistfight” in the consulate.  A first cousin of King Mohammed VI, Prince Moulay Hicham said in his latest interview with Al Quds Al Araby that the Trump administration is collaborating with Saudi Arabia to save Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) from being implicated in the case.  However, saving MBS would seem to be an impossible mission because the murder took place in a “diplomatic representation and required many logistics that included planes and various teams including the crime team and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” said the prince. According to Moulay Hicham, none of it could have happened without a “green light from the highest power pyramid.” Moulay Hicham believes that Turkey is the main barrier to saving MBS’ reputation because the country refuses to “enter into the Trump-Saudi strategy and cleverly undermines any US-Saudi narrative that disguises what happened through a systematic leak of data about the crime.” Throughout the month, several news outlets have reported that Turkey might have audio recordings and evidence of Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the murder. However, Turkey allegedly refuses to present the evidence in order to avoid espionage accusations from the international community. However, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan promised to give more details on the murder on Tuesday. For the prince, Saudi Arabia cannot shrink from its responsibility in the murder because Khashoggi is a US resident and a “reformist voice defending freedom of expression and was adopted by a large media organization, the Washington Post.” The way he was killed, according to the prince, led many voices from the US and EU political systems to demand “clarifications and sanctions against those responsible for the crime. “We do not forget that this is a crime that took place openly in a consulate that is supposed to be a place of safety and not a secret murder in a secret location,” the prince added. Too many years of silence Moulay Hicham, who is also a cousin of Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, said that there is high tension within the Saudi royal family as the crown prince “violated all written laws and customs and traditions.” He said that besides the Saudi blockade of Qatar and the Ritz Carlton case, Saudi Arabia is facing pressure due to what he called a “heinous crime in which the dismembering of the body of a peaceful citizen is an act against the Islamic religion and traditions in force within the Saudi society. This crime created terror within the country, and everyone became afraid of a similar fate.” The crime, according to Moulay Hicham, is the result of a long internal and international silence on “the terrible mistakes” in Saudi Arabia.  Morocco itself has not yet officially reacted to the death of the Saudi journalist. Moulay Hicham said that the Saudi crown prince is responsible for the war in Yemen, and yet nobody has reacted despite the many killed and displaced in the country. “[Mohammed bin Salman] blockades Qatar [and] Washington has not moved … this has been a serious turning point in international relations.” However, Moulay Hicham is certain that the Saudi King “was not aware of all the details of the [Khashoggi] file.” The prince speculated that the Saudi King was briefed about it after the visit of Prince Khaled Al Faisal to Turkey and his meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The King then knew about the seriousness of the case after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Saudi Arabia and “made him face the fait accompli.” The prince has been sharing tweets on the case since Khashoggi’s disappearance. The prince wrote that if the death of the journalist is confirmed it should be regarded as a “political assassination conducted on Saudi soil. This violates international law, human rights and the very tenets of Islamic law.”

Rabat – Customs officers have dismantled four operations smuggling luxury products into Tangier. Customs officers seized 1,003 perfumes of various brands in a foreign car that was attempting to enter Morocco without a permit or paying import taxes. Officers also seized a €33,000 watch from a Moroccan citizen who they claimed attempted to illegally smuggle the watch into the country.  A Moroccan living abroad also tried to bring in 13 smartphones and two electronic tablets illegally, but Tangier police officers stopped him.  The police also arrested a sub-Saharan migrant residing in Spain who attempted to enter Morocco with a car with falsified papers. An investigation is still underway.  Tangier’s police and customs officers have been recently under a lot of pressure with the increase in undocumented migrations, drug trafficking, and criminal activities.  Just last week, Tangier’s cybercrimes brigade dismantled a criminal network involved in fraud, counterfeit, and hacking. In early September, Tangier customs officers also seized 28 kilograms of cannabis.

Rabat – South Africa’s National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete visited Morocco for the second time to meet her counterpart, Habib El Malki, Friday in Rabat. Mbete and El Malki aimed to reinforce bilateral relations between the two countries. The meeting built on last year’s interaction between King Mohammed VI and former South African President Jacob Zuma in Abidjan.  Mbete declared that Morocco and South Africa both need to work for the strengthening of bilateral relation for the best interests of the countries’ peoples and also for the world. She congratulated Morocco for rejoining the African Union, and also expressed gratitude to Morocco as one of the first countries to support the struggle for the liberation of South African people. Morocco had supported the African Liberation Movement and Nelson Mandela, who lived in Morocco between 1960 and 1962. King Mohammed VI paid homage to the late leader in September, stating that Mandela and the late King Hassan II had a sincere affection for each other. Back in 1995, Mandela thanked Morocco for providing funding, training, and weapons to the liberation movement. El Malki insisted on Morocco’s determination to reinforce relations with South Africa and increase cooperation. He also expressed Morocco’s closeness to South Africa as the two countries have a common heritage and history of struggle.   El Malki also indicated the importance of now having a South African ambassador to Rabat and a Moroccan ambassador to Pretoria. After 12 years of diplomatic tension, Morocco had appointed an ambassador in Pretoria in 2016 upon joining the African Union. In 2004, Morocco cut diplomatic ties between the two countries after South Africa, under Thabo Mbeki’s government, recognized the Polisario Front.   The meeting also touched on Morocco’s autonomy plan for Western Sahara to reach an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict.  South Africa has been a supporter of the Polisario Front in the last decade or more, which soured relations with Morocco. Morocco recently called for the improvement of bilateral relations in the context of its new policy towards Africa. South Africa responded to the call but has not changed its position on the Polisario Front.  Mbete’s visit to Rabat comes only a few days after another South African diplomat visited the Tindouf camps in Algeria.

The suspects were prosecuted as minors. Police said they would also arrest those who shared the videos on social media. The police in Casablanca have opened another investigation into a sexual assault video on Sunday. The video shows a man attempting to rape a woman in Ain Sebaa, Casablanca. An eyewitness filmed the video from an apartment near the crime scene.

Rabat – Authorities in Melilla announced the repatriation of 30 migrants to Morocco on Saturday, October 20. El Faro de Melilla reported that the migrants will be deported in accordance with the treaty signed between Morocco and Spain in 1992 on migrant deportation. The repatriated migrants, who were transferred to Melilla, were rescued from the sea by Spanish authorities on October 19. The list of migrants includes asylum seekers and women. Last week, Spanish news outlet El Pais reported that 40 Moroccan migrants who arrived in the Spanish port of Motril on October 8 applied for asylum. The 40 Moroccans were a group of activists involved in the Al Hoceima protests, which took place in 2016 and 2017 to condemn social disparities in Morocco’s northern Rif region. In September, Melilla’s Minister of Social Welfare Daniel Ventura said that 86 minor migrants bypassed border controls and entered Melilla in August alone. On October 3, Melilla Mayor-President Juan Jose Imbroda announced that the local government in the enclave will send a list of undocumented Moroccan minors to Morocco’s Ministry of Interior for potential repatriation. Spanish Secretary of State for Security Ana Botella announced in a meeting in Essaouira, near Agadir, on September 14 that Moroccan authorities agreed to receive the identified and unaccompanied minors. Morocco’s Minister of Interior  Abdelouafi Laftit met on Saturday with his Spanish counterpart Fernando Grande-Marlaska to discuss migration issues in Madrid.
The Spanish official emphasized that his government is urging the EU to assist Morocco financially to secure the border.

Rabat – Morocco and Spain are promising to step up efforts to stop migrants on their borders. Morocco’s Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit met with his Spanish counterpart Fernando Grande-Marlaska to discuss migration issues on Saturday in Madrid. Laftit described the meeting with Marlaska as “very important,” emphasizing the strong bilateral cooperation in common interest. Laftit told the press after the meeting, “We also talked about other aspects of Moroccan-Spanish relations that are extremely important for both countries.” Marlaska said, “We mainly discussed the issue of migration and how to cope with significant migration flows, the majority of which are motivated by economic reasons.” The Spanish official emphasized that his country is a voice for Morocco at the European Union. “Morocco is and must remain a privileged partner, and it is in this sense that we are moving forward.” He also emphasized that Laftit conveyed King Mohammed VI’s thanks to King Felipe VI of Spain and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez for their efforts to bring Morocco’s migration concerns to the heart of the EU’s priorities. Moroccan Ambassador to Spain Karima Benyaich and Morocco’s Director of Immigration and Border Surveillance Khalid Zerwali also attended the meeting. During the Summit of EU Heads of State and Government held in Brussels on October 17-18, Sanchez proposed an EU support plan for Morocco to manage migration flows. European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker supported the proposal, according to a statement from the Spanish presidency.  On Thursday, October 19, the Spanish foreign minister called on the EU to increase its support for Morocco for border control. Spanish pressure on the EU followed an increasing wave of migrants on its borders in recent months.

Rabat – The Ministry in charge of Moroccans Residing Abroad and Migration is launching an Amazigh (Berber) theater tour throughout the world on Monday.  The launching ceremony will take place on Monday at the international conferences center in Skhirat, near Rabat, at 6 p.m. Over 12 Amazigh troupes will give 50 performances on the tour for Moroccans residing abroad (MREs). The tour is an effort to diversify the cultural activities offered to the MRE and to promote the Tamazight languages and cultures as a Moroccan heritage. The event is an initiative of the ministry in collaboration with the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture (IRCAM). A ministry and IRCAM joint committee selected the performers and artists to try to represent the different regions in Morocco. The tour is part of the ministry’s strategy to preserve MRE’s Moroccan identity, protect their rights and interests, and increase their contribution to Morocco’s development. The ministry has launched programs to that purpose in social, economic, cultural, and communication fields. In recent years, the ministry has organized several symposiums inviting Moroccan expats from around the world. The latest event was a forum on the mobilization of skilled Moroccans from Canada in aeronautics, which took place on October 5 in Skhirat. The forum convened 200 participants, including a delegation from Aero Montreal, Moroccan members of the Aero Mac, Canadian experts in the aeronautics field, investors, institutional managers, and technical and financial partners. According to a recent study conducted by the ministry, Moroccan expats “have considerable potential to contribute to the socio-economic development of Morocco.” The study was conducted in collaboration with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). A statement from the ministry said that of the 2.6 million Moroccans residing in OECD countries, 70 percent are under 45, while 500,000 hold higher education degrees. The ministry added that the expats’ contribution to the development of Morocco’s economy is significant: Remittances from Moroccans living abroad exceeded MAD 65 billion in 2017.

Rabat – Saudi Arabia is under heavy international criticism after admitting that Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi died in a “fistfight.” It took Saudi Arabia two weeks to admit that the Saudi journalist was killed after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. Several countries condemned the crime, calling on Saudi Arabia to provide more information on the murder. Germany, according to the Guardian, has called on Saudi Arabia to give “transparency” over the murder of Khashoggi. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Germany’s foreign affairs minister Heiko Maas issued a statement on Saturday, emphasizing that Riyadh’s information about the murder is insufficient. The officials asserted that “those responsible must be held to account.” The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, described the murder as a “shocking violation of the Vienna convention on consular relations.” She also called for a transparent investigation on the murder. Quoted by the Guardian, the official said, “The emerging circumstances of Jamal Khashoggi’s death are deeply troubling.”  The official emphasized the need to hold people involved in the murder accountable. France, Canada, and Australia also denounced the murder of the prominent Saudi journalist. Canada’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland said that Riyadh’s  statements about the murder “lack consistency and credibility.” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that his country “deplores” the killing of the journalist. He expected “the Saudi government to cooperate fully with Turkish authorities regarding the investigation of this matter.” US President Donald Trump was perhaps the first official to find Saudi Arabia’s explanation credible. He described the Saudi confession as an “important first step.” However, Trump said that he is not satisfied “until we find the answer. But it was a big first step, it was a good first step. But I want to get the answer.” Saudi Arabia considers Trump as the kingdom’s “strong ally.” However, the US president pledged punishment if Saudi Arabia is involved in the murder. Several countries, including the UK and Germany, are expected to boycott a Saudi investment summit, which will take place October 23-25. The boycott will protest Saudi Arabia involvement in the murder of Khashoggi. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the murder, saying that he is “deeply troubled” by Saudi confirmation of the death of Khashoggi. He also demanded a transparent investigation into the case.

Rabat – Morocco and the European Union will conduct an institutional twinning to improve the Moroccan penitentiary system.    The General Delegation of the Penitentiary Administration (DGAPR) launched a ceremony for the institutional twinning on Thursday, October 18, in Rabat, according to state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press.  The DGAPR initiative, supported by the EU, aims to improve Moroccan prisons by working in close collaboration with France, Belgium, and Italy on common issues such as overpopulation, rehabilitation, youth delinquency, and women prisoners.  The EU is currently financing the project with a €1.5 million contribution. It will also send, for a period of 30 months, 50 experts to Morocco in partnership with the French Ministry of Justice, the Belgian Public Federal Service, and the Italian Ministry of Justice.  The experts will come from various institutions, such as penitentiary administrations, regional directorates, and penitentiary training institutions, to train Moroccan prison staff.  The general delegate to the penitentiary administration, Salah Tamek, declared the institutional twinning will help DGAPR reinforce its institutional capacity and competencies through a structured and participative quality program.  The chief ambassador of the EU delegation, Claudia Wiedey, indicated that the EU is satisfied with the strategic Moroccan cooperation as both parties face complex issues related to penitentiary management and will be able to work towards its modernization.  Moroccan prisons have, indeed, suffered many issues, especially the overpopulation of jails. According to Tamek in a speech he gave last year at the Justice, Legislation, and Human Rights Commission in the House of Councilors, Moroccan prisons no longer have the capacity to sustain the growing number of inmates. Last year, Morocco had more than 80,000 prisoners.  The penitentiary administration closed 8 prisons in 2015 and 2016 because they did not meet the requirements. The administration built 11 new prisons, which helped ease the overcrowding by 38 percent, and increased the space per prisoner by 0.25 square meters. The prisons remain, however, understaffed.  According to Tamek, hygiene and security are also slowly improving. Last year, the administration prohibited friends and relatives from bringing food baskets in all Moroccan prisons to fight the spread of drugs. Each prisoner gets six check-ups per year. Prisons have one doctor for every 820 inmates, 1 dentist for every 1,381, and one nurse for every 162. Despite the administration’s efforts, the state of Moroccan prisons is still alarming, and Moroccans hope the institutional twinning will alleviate the situation.

Rabat – A part of a bridge has collapsed on a car killing a woman and badly injuring her daughter. The bridge collapsed on the A3 highway in Casablanca near the Derb Sultan neighborhood on the way to Rabat, on Friday, October 19. The daughter, who was driving, was transported, in a state of shock, to Ibn Rochd Hospital while the mother was transported to the morgue. The most recent rain in Casablanca may have detached a large stone section of the bridge.  Police in Casablanca have launched an investigation to determine the responsible persons for the bridge’s failure. Since Friday, drivers on the A3 in Casablanca have expressed their anger over the traffic jam caused by the repair of the bridge. Drivers have complained that there are no signs to inform them of the work in progress.  “We don’t know what’s going on, there are no signs, there is nothing,” stated a motorist to 2M television channel.

Rabat – Police in Casablanca have opened an investigation after a video of a man sexually assaulting a young woman went viral on social media. According to a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), police are investigating the rape attempt of a young woman in Ain Sebaa, Casablanca. The statement added that police in Casablanca had not received a complaint. The incident comes less than two months after Morocco implemented Law 103-13 on gender-based discrimination on September 12. The law criminalizes sexual harassment in public. Several activists believe that the law is full of loopholes. For Stephanie Willman Bordat, an international human rights lawyer, the struggle does not end here.  She told Morocco World News in September that the law should also facilitate a reporting procedure for women wishing to file complaints of gender-based discrimination. The law was enacted on the heel of several widely-publicized sexual assaults which caused outrage in Morocco. The latest case to receive wide attention was that of Khadija. The 17-year-old said she was kidnapped and raped by more than 12 men for two months this summer. Her alleged rapists also tattooed her body against her will, she said, writing their names on her skin. In Casablanca in 2017, a group of teenagers physically harassed a young woman on a bus. In September, a group of Moroccan activists, women and girls, launched a campaign under the hashtag Masaktach (I will not be silenced) to call for the boycott of songs by Saad Lamjarred, a Moroccan popstar who is awaiting trial on two counts of rape in France.  The campaign has become a broader movement to denounce sexual harassment and assault. The movement aims to track women’s struggle and violence against women in Morocco. The movement is similar to the MeToo hashtag, an international movement against sexual assault, rape, and harassment.

New Delhi   –   The Moroccan movie “Ales” by director Faiçal Ben won, Thursday in New Delhi, the prize for best Arab short film at the 7th edition of the Delhi International Film Festival (DIFF). The film tells the story of Ales, a woman in her forties who looks back on her rape, a trauma she has carried with her since she was 5 years old. Back to the place of her childhood, Ales adult leads the spectator from the experience of the tragedy to her own deliverance through ellipses and Moroccan cultural representations. “The idea of the movie came to me when I read an article that had left a deep impression on me, telling the sordid story of the rape and murder of a child. I wanted to deal with this tragic phenomenon that affects far too many children in Morocco and around the world,” the film’s director told MAP. In 2017, two Moroccan films were awarded prizes in the official Arab film competition of the 6th edition of the Festival, namely “A la recherche du pouvoir perdu” (in search of lost power) by Mohammed Ahed Bensouda, and “Laila” by Youssef Benkadour.

Rabat – The UN agencies, UN Human Rights,  UN Women along with the World Health Organization (WHO) have called for a ban on the virginity testing for women and girls worldwide. Virginity test still exists in Morocco. It is generally required of young girls and women about to marry. UN agencies and WHO  said in a joint statement that the virginity examination has no scientific basis. “There is no examination that can prove a girl or woman has had sex-and the appearance of girl’s or woman’s hymen cannot prove whether they have had sexual intercourse, or are sexually active or not.” The agencies and WHO also decided that the test is a violation to human rights as it might undermine women ’s physical, social and psychological well being. The joint statement argued that the test might be harmful and must never be carried out as it is unnecessary. In February, the Moroccan Association of Sexology called on the Ministry of Health to exempt medical doctors from the delivery of virginity certificate. The association believes that the test violates both doctor’s oath of medical confidentiality and the right to privacy of women and girls. The association said in its appeal that the document is generally delivered to family members other than girls, a situation that violates patients” right to privacy and dignity. Moroccan civil law does not prescribe the infamous document as necessary for the validity of a marital union.

Rabat – French engineering and technology consulting group Alten opens an automotive center of excellence in Rabat to train Moroccan engineers.  The center, which was inaugurated on Friday, will develop the ecosystem ESO, or Engineering Services Outsourcing, and reportedly create over new 550 jobs in the automotive sector. The initiative translates an increasing need to train Moroccan engineers to more focused and specialized fields. According to Hajar Bououd, human resources manager at Alten, the training of engineers in Morocco remains too general and not adapted to the needs of the automotive industry, or more specifically to those of the firm. Bououd stressed the need to diversify the training fields in universities.  Alten dedicates 10 percent for training and induction programs and, according to Didier Marchet, Alten’s technical manager, the group aims at employing 1000 trained Moroccan engineers by 2020.  The center for excellence will collaborate with Moroccan universities for third-year students majoring in chemistry, physics, or mathematics. Forty-three students will begin the training next month. Mohamed Yatim, minister of employment, said that this initiative is significantly important for Morocco as quality technological training is necessary to face the changes and new jobs in the automotive sector, and as the country automotive industry is rapidly growing, becoming in only a few years the second largest in Africa.  Alten inaugurated a first Embedded Systems Automotive and Aeronautics branch in Fez in 2016 to initiate the ESO system in Morocco with over 300 positions, and have been present in Morocco since 2013.  It created two programs in the country already, Alten Boost, and Alten Upgrade, to train and help with the integration of young engineers seeking to specialize in computer sciences, automotive, and aeronautics, in the job market. The group is an international leader in the industry with a presence in 20 countries, 30.000 cooperators throughout the world, and a €1.975 billion revenue in 2017. Over 90 percent of Alten’s employees are highly skilled engineers.

Rabat – Two hundred Migrants attempted to jump the border between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla on Sunday. One of the migrants died of a heart attack, local Spanish authorities said in a statement, reported I24. “Unfortunately, one of the migrants died… it seems from a cardiopulmonary arrest,” according to the statement. Spanish authorities said that 300 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa attempted to climb the fence on Sunday. Only 200 migrants managed to reach Spain, while 100 failed their attempt. In July, at least 600 migrants crossed the border from Morocco to the Spanish enclave Ceuta. In order to jump the fence, migrants picked the weakest point of the border, a section with blind spots. The border is double-fenced with a length of 8.4 kilometers and a height of six meters. To break the fence, migrants used shears and threw quicklime at security agents.

Sunday’s incident took place amid a massive flood of migrants toward Europe in recent months. The situation puts Morocco and Spain under unprecedented pressure. Both countries have been calling on the EU to intervene and provide financial assistant to help Morocco face migration challenges. At a press briefing on October 15, European Union’s high representative for foreign affairs Federica Mogherini said: “We have seen a 150% increase in migration flows on the western Mediterranean route this year, and we have decided to strengthen our actions to curb these flows, especially with Morocco.” The announcement came a month after Khalid Zerouali, Morocco’s director of immigration and border surveillance, gave an interview regarding an increase in irregular immigration attempts. The Moroccan official said that Morocco had aborted nearly 65,000 migration attempts annually since 2016.

Rabat – Christopher Shays, a former US Congressman, has shared an analysis about Morocco’s achievement in counterterrorism and security and how the US in missing investment in Morocco. Shays’ article was published in the US magazine International Policy Digest on October 19. Morocco, as one of US allies and long-standing partner in Africa, could be an opportune country for the US to achieve success in the continent. According to Shays, since his election, US President Trump has been seeking partners as main part of his agenda to “achieve wins for Americans.” “As [Trump] administration continues to reconsider each individual relationship, Morocco remains a model ally that holds the keys to America’s future success on the African continent,” Shays wrote. Shays also recalled that Morocco was the first country to recognize American independence in 1777. Shays, who has recently returned from Morocco with a bipartisan delegation of former congressmen, “witnessed the unique position Morocco finds itself in and the opportunity that lies ahead for closer U.S.-Morocco cooperation.” Morocco, significant security partner to US At the security level, Shays described Morocco as a “crucial security partner” and a “leader in religious tolerance” for the MENA region. With the growing terrorism threat in North Africa, Shays recognized Morocco’s successful contribution to global counterterrorism, as well as its effectiveness in providing security against terrorism within its borders. “Morocco is not a security free-rider, hiding beneath the U.S. security umbrella and swallowing U.S. funds, but instead shares its capabilities and experience to professionalize its African neighbors, acting a multiplier effect for the U.S.’ efforts on the continent.” The former US congressman mentioned Morocco’s security cooperation with the EU in the fight against terrorism to identify ISIS terrorists.  In July, Morocco joined an Interpol-Led Counter-Terrorism Operation codenamed ‘Neptune’ As part of the operation, Interpol officials supervised special trainings to help Moroccan officers secure Moroccan seaports against foreign terrorists using Mediterranean maritime routes between North Africa and southern Europe. Read also: Morocco Joins Interpol-Led Counter-Terrorism Operation ‘Neptune’ Shays also mentioned US Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS Brett McGurk who praised Morocco’s “decisive” role it plays in fighting terrorism. In June, McGurk met Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita in a coalition meeting to discuss defeating ISIS. McGurk said: “We are particularly grateful to Morocco’s leadership and its contributions” and that Morocco had achieved “much progress in its efforts to erase the terrorist organization and thwart its influence in many parts of the world, including Africa.” Christopher Shays. In his article, Shays noted that Morocco “has implemented a robust counter-radicalization strategy that should serve as an example for many Muslim majority countries in the MENA region.” The US Department of State also recognized Morocco’s efforts to counter terror threats globally. In its 2018 Country Reports on Terrorism, the department reiterated that the North African country has a “comprehensive counterterrorism strategy that includes vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation.” Read also: US Touts Partnership with Morocco against Terror Threats US missing investment in Morocco Given the increase in investments in Morocco over the last ten years, Shays find it unexplained that the US is missing the opportunity to invest in Morocco. “For all the historic and current cooperation between the U.S. and Morocco, an unexplainable and key piece missing in Morocco’s Africa development strategy is large-scale U.S. buy-in and investment,” Shays wrote. Morocco has a strategic geographic location which makes it a the closest African gateway to Europe. Shays attributed this unthoughtful neglection to the failure of the US grand strategies in the MENA region over the past two decades. The US strategies in the region, according to Shays, are hindered by unforeseen changes and perpetual instability. Shays urged US administration further strengthen its cooperation with Morocco as reliable partner. “Instead of looking for the next genius idea, the current administration would be wise to partner with reliable allies like Morocco that are committed in the long haul to playing an integral and constructive role in the development and stability of the continent.”

Rabat-“No German citizens were involved in the tragic [Bouknadel train accident],” the German embassy in Rabat has asserted. In an interview with “Momo” on the Moroccan radio station Hit Radio, a man claimed to be a Moroccan residing in Germany and a surviving passenger from the derailed train accident. He said that after he declared he was in the accident, representatives from the German embassy visited him at the hospital. He claimed that embassy representatives gave him a new passport on the same day when he told them his was stolen. He claimed that they also gave him a first-class plane ticket to return to Germany. When Moroccan journalist Anass Bendrif contacted the embassy to confirm the man’s allegations, the embassy responded in an email: “No consular support was provided by the German Embassy to date in relation to the accident.”  Moroccans are now blaming Hit Radio and, Momo, the presenter, of taking advantage of the accident. Social media users have shared the embassy’s statement, accusing the radio station of lying and unduly influencing public opinion. Some have even called on the King’s attorney general and Head of Government claimed to prosecute Hit Radio for spreading “lies” and “fake information.”

The alleged survivor also told the station that thieves stole from jackets, pockets, and the luggage of shock-stricken passengers who could not do anything to stop them. “My money, my bag, my passport, my phone, everything was robbed,” he complained. “It was an apocalypse.” He stated, “If it weren’t for the royal gendarmerie showing up only a quarter hour from the accident, everyone would have ended up stark naked” because of looters from nearby shantytowns. The man even compared Moroccan authorities to those of Germany, saying that the Moroccan civil protection forces did an “amazing” job and were very competent. Train No. 9 linking Rabat and Kenitra on the Casablanca-Kenitra line derailed on Tuesday near Bouknadel at 10:20 a.m., killing 7 and injuring 125. According to a claimed recording of a phone conversation between ONCF employees, the train was running at 120 kilometers per hour, when it was supposed to run at 60 kilometers per hour in the area where it derailed. One of the employees stated that problems on that stretch of track were noticed last Friday, however ONCF did not set speed limit signs, properly communicate the speed limit to drivers, or take it into consideration. On the other hand, the Media and Press Department at the Ministry of Equipment told Morocco World News that they had no knowledge about the recording. The department emphasized that there should be “a scientific proof of what happened.”

Rabat – A young man reportedly on hard drugs has decapitated a man in his 50s in Mohammedia, north of Casablanca.  The suspect, who allegedly killed the victim on Thursday around 9 p.m., carried the victim’s head around in a plastic bag. He proceeded to show off the gory crime to his neighbors, horrifying them. According to witnesses, the suspect first approached two people and showed them his gruesome package. At first sight, witnesses thought they were seeing a doll head, but then they saw blood. The suspect then came to a late-night tobacco shop and showed the managing couple the head. The suspect was a frequent customer of the shop, where he bought cigarettes. “He brought out the head and stated that this [head] will pay for it,” said Ahmed, the tobacco shop owner. “He tried to attack me, and I resisted. I could have been physically assaulted before he took the head and left.” According to locals, the suspect is well known in the area for being severly addicted to several substances and was recently released from prison. He is physically strong and frequently terrified residents. The neighbors called police, but the suspect ran into the nearby forest. After a dramatic manhunt with locals’ help, police apprehended the suspect. Police transported the suspect to the police station to be interrogated. Authorities have launched an investigation to identify the victim and retrieve the missing corpse.

Rabat – Three Sahrawi merchants have spoken about alleged injustices in the Tindouf camps in Algeria and called on the United Nations to intervene. The Sahrawis have been carrying out a sit-in since Wednesday, October 17, in front of MINURSO headquarters in Mijek, a town near the Mauritanian border 670 kilometers southwest of Tindouf. The Sahrawis, named Moulay Laafou Aabid El Aarbi, Hamoudi Shari El Saleh, and Khateri Said Hamdi, shared videos on social media, where they spoke on the behalf of Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps. One of the Sahrawis called on the UN to pressure the Polisario Front to lift “heavy restrictions” imposed on merchants. He also asserted that Algeria supports the front. Crackdown on trade Last week, Moroccan newspaper Al Massae reported that dozens of Sahrawis have fled the Tindouf camps to northern Mauritania. The newspaper linked the exodus of Sahrawis to heavy taxes imposed by Algeria on small businesses in the camps. Algeria takes heavy fees from all trucks and light vehicles entering or leaving Tindouf.  The newspaper explained that all trucks with goods leaving Tindouf for Mauritania cannot re-enter Algeria within one month.  The measure aims to slow trade between small Sahrawi traders who operate between the Tindouf camps and northern Mauritania, Al Massae added. Several NGOs and human rights activists have denounced the embezzlement of humanitarian aid from the camps. Pro-Polisario news outlets, including Futuro Sahara, reported that Sahrawis were surprised to find popular aid products on display in Algerian grocery shops. ‘Sahrawis just want dignity’ Former Polisario member Mustapha Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud condemned Polisario’s actions in the Tindouf camps in several Facebook posts. In one of his posts, Salama said that Sahrawis are not interested in “independence” or “integrity” anymore. For him, Sahrawis  now are more interested to live in “dignity and to have a future” for their children in a place “where they will not live [through] what their parents experienced.” Salama, a former police chief in the Tindouf camps, has condemned Polisario’s actions in the Tindouf camps over the years. The Mijek sit-in is the first of its kind held in front of the MINURSO headquarters. The protest comes at a sensitive time as the Security Council will meet on October 29 to adopt a new resolution on Western Sahara and to decide on the mandate of MINURSO in the region. Algeria has been reluctant to admit responsibility in the conflict, claiming that the conflict should be solved between Morocco and Polisario. Algeria also has not allowed UNHCR to conduct a census of the population in the Tindouf camps. )

Rabat- The founder of the Andalusian National Assembly (ANA), Pedro Ignacio Altamirano, has stated an ambition to create a republic including Morocco’s Rif. Altamirano’s statements during the October 13 “Ask Freqüents” show on Spanish television channel TV3 have raised eyebrows. As the founder of ANA, a nationalist, independence, and socialist political party in southern Spain, Altamirano discussed his ambition to reform a republic of the “Andalusian Countries.” He said the republic would include Murcia, the province of Badajoz in western Spain; Portugal’s Algarve; and Morocco’s northern Rif region. Although the Rif is not geographically related to the Iberian Peninsula, Altamirano said they are similar in terms of culture, language, cuisine, poetry, and socio-cultural factors. Altamirano explained that his project does not imply an invasion on Morocco or Portugal: “We are only sharing our project in case Andalusia became independent from Spain,” he stated. Altamirano said that with the situation in the Rif region in line with the Hirak movement, many people in the region expressed their desire to leave Morocco and join Andalusia. Altamirano’s imaginary republic has not only inspired the mockery of Moroccans but also some Spanish media outlets. The Hirak movement began in October 2016 after the death of Mohcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that authorities had confiscated in Al Hoceima.  Fikri’s death angered citizens, causing protests across the country, but especially in Al Hoceima province, which condemned Fikri’s death and social disparities in Morocco. Police arrested an estimated 400 activists and protesters involved in the protests in 2016 and 2017. In June, a court in Casablanca gave sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years for 54 Hirak Rif activists. Protest leader Nasser Zefzafi and three other activists received 20 years in prison for their participation in the “unauthorized” protests. The sentences have resulted in other protests across the country demanding the activists be set free.

Rabat – Spain has proposed an EU support plan for Morocco to manage migration flows, but the EU made no actual declaration on the proposal. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez initiated the proposal at the Summit of EU Heads of State and Government, held October 17-18 in Brussels. European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker supported the proposal, according to a statement from the Spanish presidency. Moroccan media report that the EU will give Morocco €140 million, but Spanish media report there was no “express reference” to the funds in the summit’s conclusions. The initiative would be part of the EU’s objective to strengthen cooperation with countries of origin and transit, especially in North Africa, to combat irregular migration.  On Thursday, Spanish foreign minister Josep Borrell called the EU to increase its support for Morocco for border control. In July, Morocco received €50 million from the EU to combat undocumented migration. After the EU established the fund, Borrel indicated that Morocco would receive an additional €100 million, calling Morocco Spain’s “preferential partner” in migration management. He also said that Europe cannot combat irregular migration by itself and needs Morocco’s help. In recent years, irregular migration attempts have significantly increased. Morocco has aborted approximately 65,000 attempts annually since 2016.

Rabat- Morocco’s Minister of Mining Aziz Rabbah is taking part in China Mining 2018, October 18-20 in Tianjin, China. According to a statement from the Ministry of Energy and Mining, the symposium is an international platform for foreign cooperation in mining. The event, which marks the participation of more than 400 exhibitors and 10,000 delegations, will cover several panels on mineral exploration, trade and marketing of mining products, and investment policies. The meeting will also include a high-level ministerial meeting, bringing together mining ministers and presidents of major mining companies. The ministerial meeting will serve as a platform to emphasize foreign cooperation on mining and expertise sharing. Rabbah gave a presentation on the Moroccan mining model and investment opportunities. During his address, the minister said that Morocco’s reforms enabled the North African country to attract more foreign direct investment of MAD 23.7 billion in 2017. He also discussed the importance of mining in Morocco, contributing to 10 percent of GDP. Morocco’s mining production totalled 35.11 million tons in 2017. Moroccan mining is largely dominated (90 percent) by phosphates, according to the ministry’s statement.  “Morocco has significant phosphate reserves and has a developed phosphate industry which ranks it as the leading exporter and third largest producer of phosphates,” the minister said. The minister also pointed out OCP Group’s strategy to regulate supply and demand to control phosphate prices. OCP’s objective is to increase Morocco’s market share to 40 percent for all mining products, including raw phosphate, phosphoric acid, and fertilizers. It also aims to reinforce Morocco’s position in Africa. Morocco’s exports of fertilizers dramatically increased from 50,000 tons in 2006 to 2,500,000 tons in 2017. Morocco aims to support the green revolution in Africa with products adapted to soil and local African cultures. The minister, however, also noted challenges in the non-phosphate mining sector. The minister said that Morocco must launch a National Mining Sector Development Strategy to modernize mining regulations, restrict artisanal mining activity, and increase the rate of  geoscience mapping.

Rabat – The heavy toll of Jamal Khashoggi’s murder on Saudi Arabia’s global image may have unprecedented repercussions for leadership: the replacement of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. According to a recent report by French outlet Le Figaro, the Saudi royal family is considering replacing MBS, as he is also known, to defuse the deepening crisis that the kingdom’s reputation has suffered since the disappearance and murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “For several days, the ruling Saudi family’s allegiance council has been meeting in the utmost secrecy, a diplomatic source has told Le Figaro,” began the French newspaper’s bombshell report. Le Figaro, citing another “credible Saudi source” who confirmed news of MBS’s possible replacement as crown prince, said that it was highly probable that the 33-year-old crown prince would not survive the Khashoggi crisis. Jamal Khashoggi, a US resident from Saudi Arabia, was a leading journalist and vocal critic of the Saudi regime. The 60-year-old entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2 to do paperwork for a planned wedding with his Turkish fiancée. Khashoggi has not been seen since, and reports have indicated a 15-member hit team flew into Istanbul from Riyadh to murder and dispose of the journalist while he was inside the Saudi consulate. Le Figaro’s diplomatic sources said that the Saudi Allegiance Council, the body in charge of inheritance-related matters, is set to name Prince Khalid bin Salman, MBS’s younger and “more predictable” brother, as a replacement for the now unpopular crown prince. Khalid, who at 28 is the Saudi ambassador to the US, is said to be cut from the same cloth as his brother MBS in the latter’s early days: elegant, charismatic, dynamic, and appealing to the West. Saudi Arabia hopes that Prince Khalid’s popularity at home and in the West will help defuse the sprawling reputation crisis that the House of Sauds has found itself in since Khashoggi disappeared. Saudi Arabia recalled the young ambassador last week to attend, alongside his father King Salman and brother MBS, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s impromptu high-profile visit to discuss Khashoggi’s disappearance. The recalling of Prince Khalid to Riyadh was not a simple diplomatic reassessment of the Saudi approach to the US. And the fact that Saudi Arabia is set to replace Ambassador Khalid, who they said would not be returning to Washington, has further crystallized the belief among Saudi Arabia observers that Riyadh is “actively seeking” replacement for MBS. Taking back control MBS, whom the Allegiance Council uncustomarily appointed as crown prince over his cousin and the most senior candidate Mohammed bin Nayef, has benefited from his father’s stamp to take the reins of the kingdom’s most crucial matters.
At 82, King Salman left crucial decisions to his 33-year-old son, green-lighting almost all of his moves and only briefly interfering when necessary. When Saudi Arabia’s Western partners threatened the kingdom with economic sanctions and a boycott over allegations MBS ordered Khashoggi’s murder, MBS and his aides initially answered with swift and even more pronounced threats. They promised “greater action” in response to any hostile move towards Saudi Arabia. But the tone has changed of late, and sources at the Saudi royal palace have said that King Salman wants to grab the headlines and assert himself as the kingdom’s chief decision maker. Although MBS remains King Salman’s favorite son, the Saudi monarch felt mounting pressure to intervene and limit the damage that his increasingly criticized and now ostracized son has caused the kingdom’s reputation, well-connected Saudi businessmen and officials told Reuters. “The king is now holding the file personally … and the tone is very different,” a Saudi businessman said. Another source in the inner circle of the Saudi royal dealings, explained that the monarch’s advisors have “grown frustrated” over MBS’ use of unchecked power. “The people around [King Salman] are starting to tell him to wake up to what’s happening,” the source said. Meanwhile, Turkish media outlets keep leaking materials that appear to criminalize MBS, holding the crown prince personally responsible for ordering the murder of the dissident journalist.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has received Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch to discuss agricultural employment in rural areas especially for youth. The King received Akhannouch Friday at the Royal Palace in Marrakech. “During the reception, His Majesty renewed his hopes and ambitions for rural areas by creating new activities that generate employment and income opportunities, especially for young people,” the Royal Cabinet said in a statement. “This can be done through broadening the scope of agricultural investment to all categories, while promoting the emergence of an agricultural middle class and making agricultural land more accessible to productive investment by gradually providing an additional one million hectares of collective land to the beneficiaries,” added the statement. In his speech at the opening of Parliament for the new legislative year, the King emphasized the importance of using communal agricultural land (sulaliyat) for investment projects. It would “serve as a powerful lever for improved economic and social conditions, especially for rights holders.” “This should make it possible to secure at least one million additional hectares of this land,” the King said. King Mohammed VI stressed the need to boost agricultural employment to improve living conditions and consolidate stability in rural areas. King Mohammed VI believes that providing employment for youth in rural areas, especially the rural middle class, could serve “as a lever” for the country’s economic and social development, in the same way as the middle class does in the city. Following the King’s instructions, Minister Akhannouch announced on October 15 the government will distribute 1 million hectares of land to small farmers to develop Morocco’s rural areas. Akhannouch described the initiative as a “takeoff for the rural world” in Morocco. According to the Royal Cabinet’s statement Friday, the monarch reaffirmed the importance of integrating labor issues, reducing disparities, fighting poverty, and rural emigration into the priorities of the agricultural development strategy. King Mohammed VI instructed the minister of agriculture to submit a strategic and comprehensive reflection on the development of the agricultural sector.

Rabat – Saudi authorities have just admitted that prominent Saudi Journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. The Saudi news channel Al Akhbariya made the announcement. Saudi authorities are claiming that Khashoggi was killed in a fight that erupted after he entered the consulate. According to the same source, Khashoggi died from a choke hold during a physical altercation. The announcement contradicts a previous official statement by Saudi authorities. Originally, Saudi Arabia denied any involvement in the Saudi journalist’s death and stressed that he left the consulate shortly after he arrived. It also contradicts statements by Turkish officials to the New York Times in which they asserted that a hit squad that flew in from Saudi Arabia to eliminate the journalist tortured, killed, and dismembered Khashoggi. Saudi authorities announced the arrest of 18 individuals after an investigation established their link to Khashoggi’s murder. Saud Al Qahtani, an adviser to Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman, was dismissed from his post. Al Qahtani is notorious for having spearheaded a ferocious media campaign against Qatar since the start of the Saudi-led blockade against its neighbor in June 2017. In late 2016, Qahtani told Khashoggi that he was banned from writing or posting tweets after he made “unfriendly” comments about Trump. ???: ?????? ????? ?? ?????? “???? ????? ????? ????? ?????”? ?????? ???? ???? ???? ??????? ?? ????? ??? ????? ???? ???? ? #???????_??????? — ???? ???????? (@saudq1978) August 17, 2017  In August 2017, Al Qahtani took advantage of his large base of followers and launched a blacklist. He called on all Saudis to report any account showing sympathy towards Qatar or questioning the Saudi decision to impose a blockade on its neighbor. US Senator Lindsay Graham has questioned the narrative of Saudi Arabia. The senator, known for being a close ally to President Donald Trump, said in his Twitter account that he is more than “skeptical about the new Saudi narrative.” To say that I am skeptical of the new Saudi narrative about Mr. Khashoggi is an understatement. https://t.co/am4fraUL6H — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 19, 2018 
Representative Adam Schiff, a ranking member of the US House Intelligence Committee, expressed the same skepticism and called on Congress to hold Saudi Arabia accountable if the Trump administration fails to do so. The claim that Khashoggi was killed while brawling with 15 men dispatched from Saudi Arabia is not at all credible. If he was fighting with those sent to capture or kill him, it was for his life. The Kingdom must be held to account. If Administration doesn’t lead, Congress must. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) October 19, 2018

Rabat – The government is preparing to privatize public companies to increase the state’s financial resources and relieve the “burden” of some public sectors. The government has achieved a consensus on the launch of a new phase of privatization, the Al Massae newspaper reported today. The former economy minister, Mohamed Boussaid, defended the approach to ensure the withdrawal of the state from activities that private companies can manage, the newspaper added. The aim is to make public institutions focus on its major functions and give the private sector a chance to take over certain sectors. According to Al Massae, the National Railway Office (ONCF) and the Moroccan Airports Authority (ONDA) may be privatized. The government has implicitly pointed out its intention to privatize some public institutions. Boussaid explicitly referred to it when he said, “ONCF and ONDA could be converted into a joint-venture company to achieve greater transparency and governance, and this conversion will develop their services and business activity.” The government has not yet revealed which companies it will privatize and turn into joint-venture companies. Morocco has 210 public institutions: 20 commercial, 183 non-commercial, 3 financial, and 4 for social reserve. Since the beginning of this year, rumors have circulated in Moroccan media, such as Infomediare, Lerporter, and Economie Entreprises, about Morocco’s intention to privatize some public institutions. The weekly newspaper Al Ousboue reported on July 5 that many Moroccan public economic institutions, particularly strategic companies, such as ONCF, ONDA, the Moroccan motorway operator (ADM) and the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE), are going bankrupt because they accumulated debt while earning low profits. The decline in profits can be explained by the companies’ major structural projects: new train stations, airport expansions, and the construction of major water channels. They suffer from poor liquidity and accumulate debt they cannot afford, wrote Al Ousboue. The story is similar to what happened to Maroc Telecom, the main telecommunication company in Morocco, 17 years ago. On February 20, 2001, the Moroccan government sold 35 percent of Maroc Telecom’s shares to French mass media company Vivendi.

Rabat – South Sudan voiced support for Morocco’s autonomy plan for Western Sahara on Friday. Speaking at a joint conference in Rabat with his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita, Nhial Deng Nhial, South Sudan’s foreign affairs minister, reiterated his country’s “total support” for Morocco’s territorial integrity. The South Sudanese official praised Morocco’s autonomy plan for Western Sahara, saying that his country appreciates Morocco’s efforts in the disputed region. The way forward in the African continent’s longest territorial dispute is to resort to a political settlement, he said. He added that his country subscribes to the UN-led initiative for a mutually acceptable and lasting political settlement. More importantly perhaps, Nhial strongly denied reports that linked the South Sudanese regime to the Polisario Front, the separatist movement claiming independence in Western Africa. He said that South Sudan “has never had, and does not have” diplomatic ties with the Arab Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), the self-styled republic claiming legitimacy over Western Sahara. Morocco has “made considerable investments” in the southern provinces, according to the UN Secretary-General’s latest report on Western Sahara. The investments mostly took the form of infrastructure and economic development projects to improve living standards. Morocco’s 2007 autonomy proposal calls for local autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. South Sudan’s support is one of the many that Morocco’s “successful” diplomatic moves have yielded in recent years. Earlier this year, the African Union made the unprecedented move to refrain from pushing for a “parallel agenda” in the continent’s oldest dispute. The “AU’s role will be that of supporting and accompanying UN efforts,” the organization said. A wave of African countries, among them, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, and Gabon, have since made known their support for Morocco’s position. They have called Morocco’s autonomy plan “practical,” “serious,” “ideal,” and “respectful of international standards.”

Rabat- The mandatory military service will significantly increase Morocco’s spending over the medium term, according to the latest Fitch Group report. The report by Fitch Solutions Macro Research, a unit of Fitch Group, forecasts that Morocco’s budget deficit is expected to be 3.4 percent of GDP for 2018, compared to 3.6 percent in 2017. However, the report anticipates that “the recent re-imposition of mandatory military service poses the greatest upside risk to spending over the medium term,” which will disrupt the country’s fiscal consolidation. Article 6 of Bill 44.18 on mandatory military service says that conscripts will receive MAD 2,000 each month. Individuals in the military would also be prevented from obtaining work during their service and thus contributing to the economy. The bill, which has not yet been passed in Parliament, emphasizes that citizens—both men and women (aged 19 to 25)—should contribute to the defense of the country and its territorial integrity. Morocco reduced the length of mandatory service to 12 months in 1999 and abolished the military service completely in 2006. The cost of the program has not yet been estimated. However, Fitch noted a drop in government wage spending in 2006, coinciding with the abolition of mandatory service. Fitch explains that the drop “offers clues” that government wage spending would significantly increase with reimplementation, negatively affecting the medium-term fiscal deficit. A previous BMI research report warned that increased spending will hinder fiscal consolidation and offset wage spending gains. Government spending on wages increased from 18.7 percent of its total spending in 2013 to 24.5 percent in 2017 and will continue at that rate in future years. Morocco’s spending is expected to increase rapidly with the 2019 Finance Bill which budgeted for increased hiring and boosts to capital expenditures. Morocco’s fiscal deficit, however, may gradually slim to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2019, owing to external financing, new taxes, and the strong growth of real GDP. The report no longer expects the government to cap fuel prices, as mentioned in its previous report, in which it argued that the “political pressure brought about by rising inflation on the back of higher oil prices, would push the government to cap fuel prices.” The study believes that in the last three months, pressure has “fizzled out,” since inflation is on the back foot again. “Given that we expected subsidies to account for nearly a third of new spending in 2018, the avoidance of this measure will be positive for consolidation efforts,” it states. The Moroccan government had reportedly finalized a plan to cap fuel prices in July and was awaiting approval by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. The fuel price cap plan came amid growing anger and demonstrations against rising living costs that have fueled a boycott against three companies: Sidi Ali, Afriquia gas, and Centrale Danone. Morocco lifted fuel subsidies in 2015, deregulating the fuel distribution market. Now prices have reached a five year high as oil prices worldwide have increased. The public became angrier when a parliamentary report was leaked revealing fuel distributors had increased their profits. As prices increased, distributors’ profit margins widened, but they did not expand Morocco’s storage capacity to the extent they pledged. Increased calls for employment and Morocco’s major regional infrastructure and energy projects, such as the LNG terminal in Jorf Lasfar to import up to 7 billion cubic metres of gas by 2025, will enlarge capital expenditure (CapEx). CapEX is expected to continue growing rapidly over the next several years. For the report, the 2019 Finance Bill is “strongly expansionary” with some 15,000 contract positions in education to be hired for 2019 and some 4,000 additional hires to take place in the military.  Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun asserted that he hopes to spend the 2019 budget on education, health, employment, and social dialogue.

By Josh Babb Rabat – Turkish officials have begun searching areas in the Belgrad forest and farmland near the Marmara sea, for evidence of Jamal Khashoggi’s suspected killing.  News of the search broke after two Turkish officials spoke anonymously to Reuters on Thursday.  “The officials told Reuters that Khashoggi’s body may have been dumped in Belgrad Forest, adjacent to Istanbul, and at a rural location near the city of Yalova, about 90km south of Istanbul.” Khashoggi was a prominent Saudi critic and journalist. It is suspected that Khashoggi’s body was dismembered after he was killed in the Saudi consulate on October 2. On Wednesday and Thursday, Turkish police searched both the residence of the Saudi consul-general and the consulate itself, looking for clues about Khashoggi’s fate. Sources with inside knowledge of the probe told Al Jazeera that they have located the exact location within the consulate where Khashoggi was killed.  Saudi Arabia, for its part, has continued to claim reports of their involvement are “completely false and baseless.” However, the claim is undercut by the fact that King Salman himself has begun to take control of the nation’s response as international outcry grows.  Last week the King sent his closest advisor, Prince Khaled Al-Faisal, to meet Turkish President Erdogan. As a result, Saudi Arabia and Turkey announced they would collaborate on a joint investigation.  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who met with both Turkish and Saudi Arabian officials this week, briefed President Trump on the situation early on Thursday. Speaking to the press later in that day, Trump acknowledged for the first time that Khashoggi had likely been killed.  “It certainly looks that way to me. It’s very sad,” Trump told reporters. He added, however, “It’s a little bit early” to come to any conclusions about who is responsible.  US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced yesterday that he would not be attending Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative, an economic conference scheduled to take place October 23-25 in Riyadh.  More than a dozen diplomats and companies, including the New York Times and Goldman Sachs, have announced their boycott of the event, underscoring the potential economic threat to Saudi Arabia.

Rabat – The Sakia El Hamra Youth Athletics Club will host its 20th half marathon on November 4 in Laayoune, a coastal city in Western Sahara.  The event, organized in collaboration with the Laayoune-Sakia-El Hamra regional league and the Ministry of Youth and Sports, will celebrate the Green March Day on November 6, according to state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press.  As in the previous races, athletes from many countries will come to run the half marathon. This year, most of the athletes are coming from Algeria, Mauritania, Tunisia, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Rwanda, South Africa, France, Spain, and Russia.   This year, the event will include a 4-kilometer race for runners under 16 and for female runners.  The organizers also planned a 7 kilometer race for the benefit of vocational and agricultural training institutes and university students. The top ten male and female athletes will win prizes.  This year’s half-marathon is themed “Sport, an Engine of a New Development Model” and is supported by various public and private institutions, such as the Ministry of the Interior, the Moroccan national Olympic committee, the elected council, and the Agency for the Promotion and Social and Economic Development of the Southern Provinces.

Rabat – Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi has said that a proposed increase of taxes on vehicles was not included in the 2019 Finance Bill. El Khalfi confirmed the news at a press conference held on Thursday after the weekly cabinet meeting. “There will be no increase,” El Khalfi said. The 2019 Finance Bill “adopted in the Council of Government, has no measure relating to the increase of taxes on vehicles.” Last week, local news outlets reported that the finance bill would include an increase of vehicle taxes between MAD 50 to 500. The increase was speculated to depend on the tax horsepower of the vehicle. Vehicles with tax horsepower between 8 and 10 would be taxed MAD 700 instead of 650 for gas engines, and MAD 1,550 instead of 1,500 for diesel. The government released a statement about the 2019 Finance Bill after the weekly cabinet meeting on Thursday. El Othmani’s cabinet has approved the MAD 443.206 billion 2019 Finance Bill after a ministerial council King Mohammed VI chaired on it last week. The King called on the government to prioritize social sectors to reduce racial disparities and to boost investment. The statement from the government shows the budgets allocated for each sector. The bill allocated MAD 27 billion to fund social and economic programs, and MAD 68 billion for education.

By Josh Babb Rabat – Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS) faces new internal pressure to step down amid global concern over Khashoggi’s suspected killing. The Saudi Scholar Association, a group claiming to represent scholars and academics within the country, released a statement on Twitter Thursday calling for MBS to be dethroned. The statement is seen in part as a response to the deepening diplomatic crisis engulfing Saudi Arabia over the apparent murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a dissident journalist who often wrote critically of his country.  ???? ???? ????? ???????? ??? ???? ??? ??? ????? ???? ?? ?????#????_?????? #???? @SaudiOlamaa #???????_??????? #???????? pic.twitter.com/xHC4vria9c — ???? ????? ???????? (@SaudiOlamaa) October 17, 2018 
The statement can also be seen as a response to a wave of arrests that have included journalists, academics, and religious figures inside Saudi Arabia beginning in September of last year, perhaps signifying a deeper power struggle for the future of the country. MBS had widely been seen as a reforming figure by Western media, who cited him as responsible for lifting a ban on women driving as well as the showing of films inside Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi’s death has cast a dark shadow over such claims.  The statement, originally published in Arabic, also accuses MBS of “spreading social and administrative corruption with incompetence, and wasting public money on what is not useful.” The Saudi Scholar Association’s Twitter account, not a verified account, first began posting statements online in September.  Usamma al-Azami, a lecturer on Islamic Studies based in the UK, spoke to the press regarding the authenticity of the account. “It is difficult to say how much this reflects the religious establishment because all the major figures who could have been remotely oppositional appear to be imprisoned.” Just last month three prominent clerics within Saudi Arabia were sentenced to death by state prosecutors for publicly disagreeing with MBS’ new policy towards Qatar.

Rabat – The World Economic Forum (WEF) has ranked Morocco 75th out of 140 countries in its Global Competitiveness Index. In the 2018 edition of its annual report on global competitiveness published Wednesday, October 17, WEF gave Morocco a score of 58.5 on a scale from 0 to 100. Morocco has gained two places in the ranking since 2017. The Global Competitiveness Index evaluates factors that determine a country’s productivity. The factors are organized into 12 pillars and grouped into four categories: enabling environment, human capital, markets, and the innovation ecosystem.  In the pillars of institutions, infrastructure, financial system, macroeconomic stability, and market size, the north African country scored well with an average score in those pillars of 68.88 out of 100. Morocco’s workforce skills and education in addition to its “labour market” scored poorly, ranking 114th and 119th globally with a score of 45.2 and 50, respectively. In health and business dynamism, Morocco also scored poorly, receiving a score of 74.9 (88th globally) and 53.9 (99th globally), respectively. Morocco scored modestly in product market and innovation capability, ranking 75th and 78th globally with scores of 55.2 and 34, respectively.  Morocco lost 10 points in information and communication technology (ICT) adoption compared to the 2017 report, coming in 93rd place with a score of 44.2. Morocco comes fourth in Africa, behind Mauritius leads the African continent with a score of 63.7 (49th globally), followed by South Africa (67th globally) and, Seychelles (74th globally), and Morocco (75th globally). Globally, the United States leads the overall rankings with a score of 85.6. Singapore (83.5) came second, ahead of Germany (82.8) and Switzerland (82.6). Angola (37.1), Haiti (36.5), Yemen (36.4), and Chad (35.5) bottomed out the list.

Rabat – Morocco has summoned the Iraqi ambassador in Rabat to protest an Iraqi festival screening a documentary against Morocco’s position on Western Sahara. Morocco summoned the Iraqi ambassador because the Sulimani Film Festival in Iraq screened “3 Stolen Cameras,” which defends Polisario’s separatist ideology. The artistic director of the festival, Danar Omer, said that the Iraqi ambassador called him personally to inform him about Morocco’s position. Quoted by Rudaw, Omer said, “The Iraqi ambassador contacted me about this, saying that the movie was banned and asked why we had showcased it.” He added that the festival was “unaware of that issue, but it is a documentary film and its showcasing is normal.” In 2017, Morocco protested the screening of the “3 Stolen Cameras” in Lebanon at Beirut’s International Cinema festival. The documentary is a joint Sweden-Polisario project. The 17-minute documentary shows alleged Moroccan “violations of human rights” in Western Sahara. Morocco has closed its embassy in Iraq for security reasons. In 2005, Al Qaeda kidnapped two Moroccans in Iraq. Earlier this year, Akhbar Al Yaoum reported that the Moroccan embassy has plans to reopen. In recent years, both the Iraqi foreign affairs minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari and the Iraqi ambassador have called for Morocco to reopen its embassy in Baghdad and reinforce Iraq-Morocco cooperation.

Rabat – The Moroccan government council has approved the MAD 443.206 billion 2019 finance bill, increasing spending across the board with particular increases in the subsidy fund and education. The finance bill, Law 18.80, aims to achieve a growth rate of 3.2 percent in GDP, based on an assumption of a 70-million-hectare cereal crop and an estimated average price of $560 per ton of butane gas, according to a statement the government council released after its meeting Thursday. The MAD 443.206 billion bill allocates MAD 204.929 billion for “management costs” and MAD 195 billion for “investment costs.” The bill includes MAD 10 billion for tax expenses, tax reductions, and tax rebates. The bill increases the budget allocated for public employees’ salaries to MAD 112 billion, up by MAD 3.3 billion from 2018. The government also plans to spend MAD 73 billion on public investment projects, up by MAD 5 billion from 2018. An additional MAD 27 billion will be allocated to fund social and economic measures. The government allocated MAD 17.67 billion for the subsidy fund to subsidize butane gas, sugar, and flour. The figure is a significant increase of MAD 4.65 billion from the 2018 budget. In other social spending, the government allocated MAD 600 million to support 90,000 widows and more than 155,000 orphans. The bill gives MAD 150 million to support projects for peoples with disabilities. The bill also gives the launch of the third National Initiative for Human Development a budget of MAD 1.8 billion. The government allocated MAD 68 billion for education, an increase of MAD 5.4 billion from 2018.  According to the bill, the Tayssir school subsidy system will offer scholarships to as many as 2.1 million students, up from 706,000 in 2018. Within the education budget, the bill gives Tayssir MAD 2.17 billion, up by MAD 1.54 billion. Preschools will receive MAD 1.35 billion for “100,000 new students.” The bill gives MAD 1.47 billion for boarding schools and cafeterias, up by MAD 570 million. University scholarships will receive MAD 1.8 billion. For the health sector, the government allocated more than MAD 16.3 billion, up 1.6 billion from the 2018 bill. The increase includes the hiring of 4,000 new employees. The budget for the medical assistance program “Ramed” will increase to MAD 1.6 billion, up by MAD 300 million. The government has planned to add 40,248 public sector job positions in 2019 including 25,248 contracted jobs and 15,000 jobs for regional academies of education and training. On corporate taxes, the government has decided to reduce taxes by 2.5 percent on companies which have profits between MAD 300 million and MAD 1 billion to support businesses.  The government will also levy an additional 2.5 percent corporate income tax on companies with annual profits equal to or more than MAD 40 million to be used as a “solidarity contribution” to reduce social disparities. The government also plans to adopt procedures for companies to cut accumulated Value Added Tax (VAT) and to facilitate access to financing. The bill provides for a new mechanism to finance investment projects based on public-private partnership. The national government will continue supporting regions by increasing their share in corporate tax and income tax to 5 percent, with an additional contribution of MAD 8.4 billion from the general state budget. The government council also approved a number of bills and decrees associated with the 2019 Finance Bill relating to the insurance code, authority delegation, and VAT. The council also approved many proposals of appointments to senior positions, in accordance with Chapter 92 of the Moroccan Constitution.

Rabat – Jordan’s foreign minister Ayman Safadi has reaffirmed his country’s stance in favor of Moroccan territorial integrity. The Jordanian official met his Moroccan counterpart on Thursday in Rabat. After the meeting, Safadi emphasized the need to reach an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara conflict on the basis of Morocco’s autonomy initiative. Safadi also recalled the “permanent coordination between Morocco and Jordan on all regional issues.” He said that both countries share the same positions on peace and stability in the Arab region. Safadi also met Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. In the meeting, the Jordanian minister discussed his desire to step up efforts to increase bilateral trade. In 2016, Jordan Times reported that Jordan imports $25 million worth of goods from Morocco, while Jordan exports $20 million worth of goods to Morocco. Both officials also commended the bilateral ties between the two countries, which “draw their strength from the fraternal relations” between the Moroccan and Jordanian kings. Morocco has received support from several countries for its autonomy initiative as the basis for a solution to the Western Sahara conflict from African and Gulf countries. Qatar, Kuwait, and the UAE all reiterated support for Morocco’s territorial integrity at the 4th Committee of the UN General Assembly.

Rabat – Despite efforts to increase national production and boost economic competitiveness, Morocco’s trade deficit continues to expand. With Moroccan imports (MAD 358.8 billion) markedly higher than its exports (MAD 201.5 billion), an assessment by Bank Al Maghrib, the central bank, shows figures of an economy severely hit in almost all major income-generating activities. Although regularly applauded by international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, Morocco’s economic performance has stagnated in the last two to three years. By October 12, Morocco’s foreign exchange reserves had dropped by 0.4 percent year to date, a continuation of the country’s already negative import-export balance. Morocco’s trade deficit in the first nine months of this year was 8.2 percent. “Preliminary results for the first nine months of the year indicate a sharp increase in imports,” a report by the foreign exchange regulator said on Wednesday. It added that Morocco’s increasing imports and shrinking exports “translate into a deepening of the trade deficit by MAD11,485.” Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), an important contributor to Morocco’s industrial aspirations, registered a 3.2 percent decrease in the first nine months of 2018, severely affecting economic output. Meanwhile, tourism and remittances from Moroccans residing abroad, two income sources that traditionally appease global financial market shocks on Morocco’s unsteadily-performing economy, dropped by 0.2 and 1.1 percent, respectively. Despite the deepening trade deficit, the automobile and phosphates industries have stood out with positive developments. Powered by French giants Renault and PSA Group, the country’s bourgeoning automobile sector registered a 14.6 percent increase in production between January and September this year. In the same period, sales of phosphates jumped 16.6 percent.

Rabat – A court has sentenced a Moroccan activist to two years in prison for condemning the Navy shooting of Hayat Belkacem, a migrant. The Royal Moroccan Navy opened fire on a migrant boat off the coast of M’diq and Fnideq in the Mediterranean September 25, killing Hayat Belkacem, a 20-year-old native of Tetouan in northern Morocco. On September 30, police arrested Soufiane Al-Nguad for protesting Hayat’s death at a football game in Tetouan between the Maghreb of Tetouan and the Kawkab of Marrakech. Through Facebook posts, Al-Nguad had called on other football fans to mourn the death of the migrant by wearing black, his lawyer told French outlet Le monde. Radical Tetouani football fans, known as the ultra matadores, broke planters and knocked down garbage cans while shouting slogans condemning the killing of the Tetouani student. According to Al-Nguad’s lawyer, Jabir Baba, the Tetouan court charged the young activist with “insulting the national flag,” “spreading hatred,” and “calling for civil insurrection.” The court charged other football fans, aged 14 to 23, with the destruction of public property, unauthorized protests, and insulting the national flag. Increasing numbers of Moroccans are attempting to enter Spain illegally by crossing the Mediterranean. The Spanish Ministry of Interior stated that 10,104 undocumented Moroccan migrants arrived in Spain between 2016 and 2018.

Rabat – On Thursday, Algeria passed a law banning the wearing of full face-veils, called burqas or niqabs, for women at work.  The bill asserts that the garment obstructs authorities from properly identifying women. The Algerian government released a statement saying that women “are obliged to respect the rules and requirements of security and communication which is at the level of their interests, and requires the recognition of their identity in an automatic and permanent manner, especially in the workplace.” The majority of women in Algeria do not wear the niqab, although the decision is expected to upset those in the country who adhere to the Salafi branch of Islam. Algeria joins countries such as Spain, Denmark, and Niger, which have all passed full or partial bans on women wearing the garment. The stricter Wahhabi school of Islam, which has its roots in Saudi Arabia, has traditionally promoted the wearing of the niqab. Saudi Arabia has been influential in spreading the niqab’s use throughout the wider Islamic world, including parts of West Africa.  In Morocco, women are allowed to wear full-face veils, but it is illegal to produce, sell, or buy them.

Rabat – Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi has interpreted Polisario’s recent provocation east of Morocco’s defense wall in Western Sahara as admitting failure. In a press conference after the weekly government council, El Khalfi said that Polisario’s provocations in Western Sahara “are a desperate attempt that is doomed to fail like those that preceded it.” The spokesperson said that Morocco’s accumulated diplomatic achievements in the last few years caused Polisario to act out. El Khalfi listed some of Morocco’s achievements, including the support several countries expressed for Morocco’s territorial integrity at the 4th Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. The official also recalled the European Union’s stance on the inclusion of the waters off Western Sahara in its fisheries agreement with Morocco El Khalfi said that the EU’s position is moving in the “right direction and is developing significantly.” In July, Morocco and the EU agreed to sign a new fisheries agreement after their previous deal expired. Yesterday, local media reported that Polisario members assaulted a MINURSO-controlled area in Mijek in Western Sahara. Polisario’s move comes at a sensitive time. The Security Council will meet on October 29 to decide whether to extend the mandate of the UN mission in Western Sahara. The action also followed invitations from the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, to Morocco, Polisario, Mauritania, and Algeria to take part in roundtable talks in Geneva in December. Algeria has announced that it will join the roundtable as an observer and not a main party to the conflict, a response that Morocco will not accept. In the press conference, El Khalfi said that Kohler sent Algeria the same invitation he sent to Morocco. He recalled that “any violation of [the ceasefire] puts the Polisario, and behind it Algeria, in confrontation not only with Morocco, but also with the UN.”

Rabat – Iconic singers Raymonde El Bidaouia and Hajja El Hamdaouia will perform a duet at the 15th Atlantic Andalusia Festival of Essaouira October 25-28. Morocco’s coastal town of Essaouira, south of Casablanca, has long been a symbol of tolerance, with Jews and Muslims coexisting peacefully. The city will uphold its heritage with the Atlantic Andalusia Festival celebrating Judeo-Arabic music.

The women will sing chaabi music, a folk genre in North Africa that is widely associated with weddings and festivals. Maestro Ahmed Cherkani will lead an orchestra to accompany the two divas. The duet will be the two singers’ first act together, although Raymonde El Bidaouia will be a familiar artist at the Atlantic Andalusia festival. The Atlantic Andalusia festival is an opportunity to discover up close the Andalusian heritage linking Spanish and Moroccan cultures. On the menu will be various musical genres, including chaabi, al ala (instrumental Andalusian music), gharnati, (Arabo-Andalusian music from Algeria) and haouzi (Arabo-Andalusian music also from Algeria). However, the main highlight will be the hapiyout (Jewish religious chants) and Andalucious (a Jewish music genre). In addition to music concerts, there will be workshops, seminars, and discussions on music. Last year’s festival, held October 26-29, hosted Moroccan and Jewish musicians, namely Abderrahim Essouiri and Rabbi Haim Louk, accompanied by the Mohamed Larbi Temsmani orchestra and maestro Mohamed Amine Al Akrami.

Among the seven who died are the train’s engineer and driver’s assistant. A foreign tourist of unknown nationality also died. In addition, the names of the following four individuals have been listed among the train’s victims. Abdeljalil Benzaza, 54 Abdeljalil Benzaza was a 54-year-old police officer in the L’Ocean police department in Rabat, known for his efficiency in performing his duty. According to his family and neighbors, Benzaza was a peaceful person who loved to give to humanity. Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) gave Benzaza appreciation certificates in recognition of his professional conscience and distinguished courage. Even in his last moments, Benzaza was a hero. According to his wife, after the accident, the police officer returned to the train, climbing through a window to save a girl. He was killed by a falling panel. Ichrak Naaoum, 21   Ichrak was in her 5th year at the National School of Trade and Management (ENCG) in Kenitra.

Khalil, 21  Khalil, a young nurse from Sidi Slimane, had just obtained his diploma two days before the train accident. He was one of the most brilliant students in his area, classified third in his specialty nationally according to some media.  On Monday, the young man had just learned that he was assigned to work in Rabat. Anass Anass, another young man, was reportedly a Moroccan residing in England. He had just landed in Morocco on Monday and taken the train directly to meet his family in Kenitra. The government and ONCF have communicated no further information on the latest number of injured and deaths since the morning of October 18.

Rabat- Belgium will extradite a Moroccan jihadist known as “the most dangerous woman in Belgium” to Morocco. Also known as “the black widow,” Malika El Aroud is the widow of a Taliban jihadist, Abdessatar Dahmane. Dahmane had posed as a television journalist in Belgium to assassinate the Afghan political and military leader Ahmad Shah Massoud. Following Massoud’s assassination on September 9, 2001, Belgian police captured and shot Dahmane dead while he was attempting to escape. In 2010, a Belgian court sentenced El Aroud, an al-Qaeda member, to eight years in prison for her involvement with terrorists. The Belgian court’s decision to deport El Aroud is in line with Belgium’s new migration and asylum legislation which went into force in May 2017, stated Belgian news outlet Sud Info. The law dictates the repatriation of criminals whose behaviors threaten Belgium’s national security. To Belgians, El Aroud is too dangerous to stay in Europe. Born in 1960, El Aroud is also known for her Islamist writings which she used to post on the internet in French under the name “Oum Obeyda.” Her posts tried to rally women to adopt her radical ideology. According to Morocco’s 2015 law regarding jihadists or ISIS returnees, repatriated Moroccan fighters typically receive sentences of 10 to 15 years in prison. The head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, noted that there are approximately 1,660 Moroccan fighters affiliated with ISIS and other transnational terrorist networks who are still abroad. Some of the most recent jihadist repatriations to Morocco were from Iraq in July. The Iraqi government decided to repatriate the wives and children (under the age of 15) of Moroccan ISIS fighters after the terrorist group was largely eradicated from Iraq at the end of 2017.

Rabat – David Parnham has pleaded guilty to soliciting murder among 13 other offenses.   In March, citizens of the UK and around the world were horrified by hundreds of letters sent anonymously encouraging people to carry out violence against Muslims. Fingerprint evidence linked the letters to David Parnham, a UK national, whom police arrested in June. The letters were part of a larger campaign carried out over two years in which Parham also orchestrated a bomb threat and mailed white powder, which was treated as a poisonous substance, to public figures such as Queen Elizabeth II and Theresa May. Parnham pleaded guilty to a total of 14 charges, including five counts of sending hoax noxious substances, one charge of staging a bomb hoax, and soliciting to murder. The final charge can carry a penalty of up to life in prison.  Parnham’s fingerprints were also found on a letter sent to Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who is currently serving a prison sentence for murdering nine African-Americans in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Parnham cited Roof’s actions as inspiration for his own campaign. Parnham is currently in custody and will be sentenced on November 23.

Rabat – Two days after giving condolences on Twitter for the Bouknadel train accident, El Othmani has officially commented on the accident. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani commented on the October 16 accident during the weekly government council on Thursday in Rabat. El Othmani said that a judicial investigation is underway to determine the real causes of the “tragic derailment of a train on Tuesday in Bouknadel, and to establish responsibilities.” However, El Othmani’s announcement tells the public nothing new. The public prosecutor of Rabat’s Court of Appeal and the Ministry of Interior had already opened an investigation at the request of King Mohammed VI on Tuesday. Talking about the investigation, El Othmani said that it should “establish responsibilities and draw lessons.” He added that “he was in direct contact with the ministers of interior and equipment, transport, logistics, and water.” Describing the accident as “tragic,” El Othmani finally expressed official condolences to the families of the victims and wished a speedy recovery for the injured passengers. The accident claimed the lives of 7 people and injured at least 125 people on Tuesday.  ONCF Director Rabie Khlie told journalists that the cause of the accident might have been a technical issue. However, the public is still waiting for the result of investigations to be revealed, especially after the leaking of an audio recording of a phone conversation between ONCF workers. In the recording, some workers implied that train drivers accelerated far above the speed limit for the area where the train derailed. Workers also said that they have complained since Friday, October 12, to ONCF about a problem on that stretch of track, but the company did not properly communicate the lowered speed limit. Tuesday’s accident was the third train accident in 2018. On January 13, a train coming from Settat, a town near Casablanca, crashed into a light pole at the Casablanca Port train station. On February 17, a deadly crash involving a freight train and a personnel transport vehicle killed at least 6 people and injured 14.

Rabat – Armed Polisario elements have besieged a MINURSO-controlled site in Mijek in Western Sahara, local news outlets have reported. The separatist front’s controversial move comes as thousands gathered in the vicinity of a zone under the control of the UN mission to protest human rights abuses and repression of political dissent in the Polisario-controlled Lahmada-Tindouf Camps. Mijak is located east of the Moroccan defense wall in Western Sahara, which makes it a part of the Military Agreement 1 and a no-go area for Polisario.
The move risks an escalation of hostilities that may jeopardize the already-announced UN-led roundtable expected to convene Morocco, Polisario, Algeria, and Mauritania December 5-6. Eyewitnesses in the besieged area have said that “MINURSO head officials are currently negotiating with the Polisario assaulters” to avoid an unnecessary return to hostilities. The front’s forceful response to the ongoing sit-in near the Tindouf camps is far from a new occurrence. In a press release earlier this week, protestors at the besieged rally point expressed concern over Polisario’s resort to violence to crack down on dissent and anti-front demonstrations. “We want to draw the UN’s attention to the misery and ordeal we experience daily in Tindouf,” the press release said. Moulay Laafo Aabid, Khatri Said Hamdi, and Hammoudi Bechari Saleh, leaders of the anti-Polisario protests who signed the press release, have said that Polisario’s brutal response will not deter them from denouncing the “atrocious living conditions” in the Tindouf camps.

Rabat – While Morocco pays local imams MAD 1,500-2,000 monthly, it pays imams in Ceuta and Melilla double. In a press report aired on Spanish channel Telecinco, the president of the Bezu mosque in Ceuta, Mohammed Ali, said that Morocco pays about €500 monthly for each imam in Ceuta. He said that there are 42 official mosques, and there are up to three imams in each of the mosques around the Spanish enclave. Morocco pays €756,000 per year for imams in Ceuta. Another report from local media outlet Red Ceuta said Morocco’s Ministry of Islamic Affairs decided to help Moroccan imams in the two enclaves because they do not receive aid from the Spanish government. The report, which dates back to 2017, notes Ceuta “has 15 mosques and 16 prayer rooms for a population of 42,200 Muslims.” The report complained about the management of mosques, which require financial aid. Morocco’s Ministry Islamic Affairs intervened to fund the mosques.  According to the report, the ministry “is very organized and respected throughout the world, as it was a pioneer in establishing guidelines for imam training and is currently an imam factory for everyone, so much so that in many countries, Westerners entrust to Morocco the administration and appointment of the imams in the mosques in their territories.” The report added that the Ministry of Islamic Affairs manages “deals with all the expenses generated by the 31 prayer points in Ceuta.” The funds that the ministry must allocate for imams’ salaries exceed €700,000 per year, in addition to other expenses like electricity and water. What about imams in Morocco? In Morocco, imams receive around MAD 1,500-2,000. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs also offers housing and health coverage for imams. However, imams do not receive retirement pensions. An imam speaking anonymously told Morocco World News today that housing and health coverage is not enough. “Once they don’t need you, you will not have the right to a retirement pension.” He explained imams do not have permanent work contracts. “If an imam undergoes a surgery, the health coverage compensates him. However, if that person is 60-year-old, he receives no retirement pension.” The imam, who works in a mosque in Temara, near Rabat, told MWN that the government needs to meet the demands of imams. “Imams in Morocco should be independent; they cannot join any NGOs or a union that can defend their rights,” he said. According to MWN’s source, the Ministry of Finance does not allocate a certain budget for imams. In his interview with MWN, the imam also said that his colleagues across the country do not receive additional income when they have children, like others in the public sector receive. The government, according to MWN’s interviewee, have excuses. “They said that since they are providing us with housing and that they have a monthly salary of MAD 1,500 and 2,000, that is enough and that they don’t have to increase our salaries.” The source said that some imams choose to read the Qur’an at ceremonies and funerals for a small fee to help themselves financially. They receive MAD 100 or 200 for such events. However, he said, this remains insufficient. We are not allowed to protest Imams should say yes to everything from the government. Imams are not allowed to protest, the imam told MWN. “Imams should not have any links with politics, unions or NGOs.” He added that the government does not consider the imams’ mission a job. “They believe that the imam is doing religious rituals, and that is it.” In contrast, the imam said that imams have important tasks. They should be mobilized; they do not have weekends. “We wake up before dawn to be ready for morning prayers. After morning prayers, we get ready for afternoon prayers (her and al asr), sunset (maghrib) and evening prayers.” The anonymous imam called on the government to meet their demands and consider imams as employees in the Ministry of Islamic Affairs. He said everyone, including the lowest paid people in the ministry, have more rights than imams, whose job is to convey religious values.

Rabat- Passengers who survived the Bouknadel train accident still suffered theft by individuals who pretended to help, only to loot from the train. Many eyewitnesses recounted how some individuals took advantage of the accident to loot from the luggage of passengers.  The act has shocked and disgusted Moroccans. Others claimed that some taxi drivers raised prices to transport the stranded passengers. One survivor told Moroccan radio station Hit Radio that thieves stole from jackets, pockets, and luggage of shock-stricken passengers who could not do anything to stop them. “My money, my bag, my passport, my phone, everything was robbed,” the Moroccan man residing in Germany complained. “It was an apocalypse.” He stated, “If it weren’t for the royal gendarmerie showing up only a quarter hour from the accident, everyone would have ended up stark naked” because of looters from nearby shantytowns. However, the man was sympathetic, saying poverty was the real culprit because the looters were victims of poverty. The survivor described how some of the people who genuinely wanted to help had no knowledge of first aid and pulled passengers out by their limbs, which may have exacerbated injuries. The man wished that they had waited for the arrival of ambulances and civil protection forces to retrieve the injured. “Half of the injured people were paralyzed because of the [inexperienced humanitarians].”  Comparing Moroccan authorities to those of Germany, the speaker said that the Moroccan civil protection forces did an “amazing” job and were very competent. Train No. 9 linking Rabat and Kenitra on the Casablanca-Kenitra line derailed on Tuesday near Bouknadel at 10:20 a.m., killing 7 and injuring 125, according to the most recent statistics. Neither the National Office of Railways (ONCF) nor the Moroccan government has yet given an official statement on the cause of the accidents. According to a leaked recording of a phone conversation between ONCF employees, the train was running at 120 kilometers per hour, when it was supposed to run at 60 kilometers per hour in the area where it derailed. One of the employees stated that problems on that stretch of track were noticed last Friday, however ONCF did not set speed limit signs, properly communicate the speed limit to drivers, or take it into consideration. On the other hand, the Media and Press Department at the Ministry of Equipment told Morocco World News that they had no knowledge about the recording. The department emphasized that there should be “a scientific proof of what happened.”  Many Moroccans have expressed rage towards ONCF, blaming it for the accident after the recording blaming faulty tracks and speeding went viral. Moroccans have begun an online campaign with hashtags “#Baraka” (enough) and “#Boycott ONCF”  on Twitter and Facebook. ONCF, the only rail transport company in Morocco, is state-run with “financial autonomy” according to its website. While many are calling for actions, hundreds of people have donated blood for the victims of the accident at the Regional Center for Blood Transfusion. Many people in Rabat, including royal gendarmes volunteered to donate blood for the victims. The center had taken 549 sacks of blood in the first 24 hours after the accident. The center only had to use 16 by mid-Wednesday, according to the head of the center, Mohammed Benajiba.

Rabat – Spanish foreign minister Josep Borrell has called the EU to increase its support for Morocco to help it fight undocumented immigration. “Morocco is not well treated in terms of the aid granted by the European Union—for the fight against illegal immigration,” Josep Borrell said Wednesday.  The Spanish minister addressed his statements to Spain’s joint parliamentary committee for the EU, Maghreb Arab Press reported today. Borrell contrasted the support the EU has given Turkey, €6 billion, with Morocco, which has received only about €50 million. In July, the EU approved a €55 million fund to assist Morocco and Tunisia to combat migration to Europe. The fund falls within the EU’s border management program and will provide resources for border guards in Morocco. The Spanish minister indicated that Spain and the EU have committed an additional €100 million to assist Morocco, which he called Spain’s “preferential partner” in migration management. For Borell, “Immigration is a challenge but also an opportunity.” He said immigration is a “European problem that [Europe] will not be able to solve if we do not count on Morocco’s help.”  Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said in August that the government aborted 65,000 undocumented migration attempts in 2017. According to Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, law enforcement thwarted 2,000 networks and rescued 20,000 migrants from the sea before they reached Europe. By July 30, more than 24,000 migrants entered Europe through the western Mediterranean route from Morocco in 2018. Since January, 6,000 undocumented Moroccan migrants have arrived in Spain. Spain’s Ministry of Interior said earlier this year 38,000 migrants are believed to have entered Spain in 2018. Borell stressed that the EU must save the immigration situation from going out of control because migratory pressure is increasing. In July, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez supported Morocco by sending a letter to the European Union Commission, asking the body to provide Morocco with the resources it requested. EU President Jean-Claude Juncker responded that “Spain and Morocco can be assured of the full support of the EU Commission.” Sanchez’s letter followed Morocco’s request of €60 million in resources for border management and migration control.

Rabat – Yemen’s foreign minister met Moroccan officials Monday to discuss what Yemen can learn from Morocco’s democracy-building and economic development.  Foreign minister Khaled Mohamed Hussein Al-Yamani met Head of Government democracy-building in Rabat. The conference took place as the nations celebrated the 40th anniversary of their establishment of diplomatic relations.  During the meeting, Al-Yamani thanked King Mohammed VI for Morocco’s support for restoring proper constitutional legitimacy in Yemen which has been in the midst of a brutal civil war since 2015. Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, expressed the need to increase humanitarian efforts for the Yemeni people.  Education was another key area of cooperation that both countries were sure to highlight. Morocco has increased the number of scholarships it offers to Yemeni students to 40 per year. Beyond the 40 scholarships, Morocco gives Yemenis priority access to Moroccan universities.

Rabat – Both the Central American Parliament (Parlacen) and the Southern Common Market Parliament (Parlasur) have shown interest in signing trade agreements with Morocco.  Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita met Parlacen Speaker Tony Raful Tejada to discuss joint projects and new trade agreements, on Wednesday, according to state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Tejada expressed Parlacen’s interest in creating an African-Latin American parliamentary assembly and in signing a free trade agreement between Morocco and Parlacen’s member states.  Tejada also suggested an institutional partnership between Parlacen, the European Parliament, and the Moroccan parliament. Bourita welcomed the suggestion to diversify Morocco’s collaboration and improve cooperation with Central America.  Earlier this week, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani met the speaker of Parlasur, Tomas Bittar Navarro, in Rabat to enhance cooperation with the South American bloc.  Navarro and El Othmani both expressed interest in boosting economic ties. As Morocco sits in a strategic position between Africa and Europe and South American countries link Latin America to the Caribbean, the partnership could open the door to a more developed trade network.  The two sides plan to sign a trade agreement in the near future.  Morocco is attracting new investments and more potential international partners due to its trade agreements with Europe, the US, Arab countries, Turkey, and sub-Saharan African countries.   The Moroccan strategy in diversifying its partners comes very likely as an effort to decrease its dependency on the European Union and strengthen diplomatic ties through economic partnership to push the Moroccan agenda on the international sphere. According to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, Morocco’s top export and import destinations are, indeed, mostly EU countries with Spain, France, and Germany in the top five.  Morocco has recently enhanced cooperation with many countries in sectors such as mining and energy, aviation, technology, and education. In the last eight months, Morocco boosted its economic cooperation through various agreements and partnerships with countries such as China, Malaysia, India, Argentina, Tunisia, Russia, Cote d’Ivoire, Japan, and the Czech Republic.

Rabat – Morocco’s railway witnessed a tragedy on Tuesday, October 16, after ONCF’s No. 9 train between Casablanca and Kenitra derailed near Bouknadel. The train killed 7 passengers and injured 125. The tragedy Tuesday is the sixth major train accident on Moroccan railways in just over 25 years. The following is a timeline of major train accidents in Morocco. September 28, 1993 At least 15 people died when a passenger train between Marrakech and Tangier collided with a cargo train in Temara, near Rabat. The train was carrying 400 passengers. It remains one of the deadliest train accidents in the history of Morocco. August 2, 2012 At least 50 people were injured when three cars of a passenger train between Fez and Oujda, a city on the Algerian border, derailed near Fez on August 2 at about 6:40 p.m.   August 27, 2014 A train linking Casablanca with Fez derailed at the Zenara train station between Casablanca and Rabat. More than 30 people were injured while one person died.  January 13, 2018 On January 13, a train coming from Settat, a town near Casablanca, crashed into a light pole at the Casablanca Port train station. February 17, 2018 A deadly crash involving a freight train and a personnel transport vehicle killed at least six people and injured 14 others early on a Saturday morning. The freight train, which connected between Tangier and Tanger-Med, crashed with the personnel transport carrier in a manned railway crossing in the Beni Makada neighborhood. October 16, 2018 The accident Tuesday was the third train accident sparking public fear this year. The public prosecutor has opened an investigation to determine the cause of the accident. ONCF Director Rabie Khlie speculated that the issue might be technical. A leaked audio recording of ONCF workers implied that train drivers accelerated far above the speed limit for the area where the train derailed. Workers also said that they have complained since Friday, October 12, to ONCF about a problem on that stretch of track, but the company did not properly communicate a lowered speed limit.

By Josh Babb Rabat – A Turkish newspaper has reportedly obtained audio of journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s torture and murder in the Saudi consulate.  As US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Turkey’s capital of Ankara on Wednesday, Turkish newspapers reported on graphic audio recorded from dissident Saudi journalist Khashoggi’s killing and subsequent dismemberment. A senior Turkish intelligence official described the audio to reporters. The alleged recording further escalates pressure on both Saudi Arabia and the US for answers about what happened to Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Saudi Arabia, after he entered the country’s consulate in Istanbul on October 2. Turkish newspapers closely aligned with the Turkish government revealed details about the recordings, coming only a day after Pompeo met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS) in a bid to de-escalate the ongoing diplomatic crisis. President Trump, for his part, has demanded any audio recording be turned over to US officials.  Trump spoke to the press earlier this week after a call with Saudi King Salman. He offered the theory that Khashoggi’s death had perhaps come at the hands of “rouge killers,” although US intelligence assessments undercut the theory.   Experts on Saudi Arabia have claimed it is very unlikely that such an operation would occur without the knowledge of high-ranking officials, such as MBS or King Salman.   Both Turkish intelligence and reporting by the Washington Post claims to have identified 11 of the 15 men who flew into Turkey from Saudi Arabia the same day as Khashoggi’s disappearance as having ties to Saudi security services.  Even more intriguing are reports surfacing on October 18 that Meshal Saad M. Albostani, one of the men suspected of playing a role in Khashoggi’s murder, has himself been killed in a car accident in Riyadh.  Experts on Saudi Arabia have claimed it is very unlikely that such an operation would occur without the knowledge of high-ranking officials, such as MBS or King Salman.  Rudolph Giuliani, a close advisor to Trump, appears to have already concluded the Saudis were involved in Khashoggi’s death. “The only question is, was it directed from the crown prince or the king — or was it a group that was trying to please him?” Saudi Arabia and the US have long been close partners, cooperating both economically and on counterterrorism efforts across the Middle East. It remains to be seen whether Khashoggi’s killing will permanently alter the relationship.

Rabat – During discussion on Western Sahara at the 4th Committee of the UN General Assembly, Gulf states lent their “uncompromising and brotherly support” to Morocco. At the conclusion of the UN fourth committee earlier yesterday, Casablanca-based Akhbar Al Yaoum reported that “Morocco’s principled neutrality” in the latest Gulf crisis played a vital role in the region’s concerted nod towards Morocco’s 2007 autonomy plan. “Morocco Uniting the Gulf,” the newspaper headlined, explaining that Rabat’s repeated calls for constructive regional dialogue and negotiations have won the united support of Gulf monarchies in spite of the ideological divergences their regimes show on many other regional issues. According to on-the-ground reports at the UN headquarters in New York, representatives from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar all said that Morocco’s 2007 autonomy plan for the Sahara dossier is “serious, legal, and realistic.” Along with “uncompromising and united Gulf support for Morocco’s position,” many delegates from other regions saluted Morocco’s documented willingness to have a real dialogue to end the Western Sahara territorial dispute. Taking into account the North African country’s continued development projects in the southern territories and its reputation as a regional example of political stability, a settlement under Moroccan sovereignty is the most viable and enduring alternative, some representatives were quoted as saying.
While the united Gulf front on Morocco’s autonomy plan is a one-off in a region prone to conflicting interests, it is not the first time officials in the region and in the broader Arab World have raised their voice in support of Rabat. On Tuesday, Khaled Mohamed Hussein Al-Yamani, the Yemeni foreign affairs minister, “praised King Mohammed VI’s efforts to promote peace and stability” in Yemen, state-owned outlet MAP reported. Speaking to the speaker of Morocco’s House of Representatives, Habib El Malki, the Yemeni official underlined historical ties with Morocco and Rabat’s sustained support during his country’s worst moments. He accordingly promised that his country would return the favor as far as Morocco’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is concerned.

Rabat – Several countries have shown solidarity by sending condolence cables to the families of victims in the Bouknadel train accident. The Spanish government expressed solidarity with Morocco in a statement from the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Spanish government “wishes to express, on behalf of the Spanish people and in these sad moments, its solidarity with the authorities and the people of Morocco, a friendly country, neighbor and strategic partner.” Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani also sent a sympathy message to King Mohammed VI and the victims of the train accident. He also wished the injured passengers “speedy recovery.” Kuwait and Jordan also sent condolences to Morocco. King Abdullah of Jordan offered his condolences over the victims of the train derailment in Bouknadel. While international governments were quick to send condolences to the victims, the Moroccan government has not issued any joint statement to show solidarity with the families. However, some Moroccan officials have preferred using social media to express regret and condolences, including Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. A train derailed in Bouknadel, between Rabat and Kenitra, on Tuesday, October 16, killing 7 and injuring at least 125. Rabat’s public prosecutor at the Court of Appeal has opened an investigation to determine the cause of the accident. The accident might be a discussion point in today’s weekly government council. ONCF Director Rabie Khlie told journalists on the scene that the accident might be due to a technical problem. Fully two days after the accident, ONCF has still released no information on the cause of the tragedy. By midday Wednesday, ONCF had cleared one track and begun re-running trains on the Casablanca-Kenitra line. On Wednesday, a leaked audio recording between ONCF employees blamed the accident on a faulty track and the train’s speed. The drivers said that they had complained about a problem in the stretch of track where the train derailed. One of the employees stated that the technical issues on the track were noticed last Friday, but ONCF did not properly communicate the speed limit to drivers or take it into consideration. One of the speakers urged: “It’s about time that we speak up about our rights.”

By Mohamed Hikal Rabat – Saudi Arabia has enacted a law preventing Palestinians in Lebanon with refugee documents from obtaining a visa for hajj or umrah. Approximately 175,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon will be denied access to Mecca, the holiest city in Islam, the Middle East Eye reported. The Saudi foreign ministry announced the decision, which went into force on September 12. The Saudi consulate in Lebanon told travel agencies in Lebanon to stop issuing visas for Palestinian refugees with passports bearing no national citizenship number, the newspaper stated. However, according to an official in the Saudi Consulate in Beirut, Palestinian refugees wishing to participate in the hajj or umrah, which is the Islamic pilgrimage performed at any time of the year except hajj, will have to request the documents from the Palestinian Authority. They can get a visa on a Palestinian Authority passport. Conversely, officials at the Palestinian Authority embassy in Beirut stated that they have never issued and never will provide visas for Palestinians holding passports of other Arab countries. Officials said Saudi Arabia did not inform them of the decision officially, and they have no official directions in this regard. Due to Saudi Arabia’s restricting Palestinian refugees’ freedom to move and perform their religious rites, the Palestinian ambassador in Riyadh, Basem Abdullah al-Agha, is working along with the Palestinian embassy in Beirut together with the Saudi embassy in Beirut and the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs to find a solution. Palestinian refugees in Lebanon can apply for a temporary Lebanese passport. However, holders of this temporary document are not entitled to the full rights of Lebanese citizenship. The Saudi decision is expected to add salt to injury. Unlike the few Palestinians who have full Lebanese citizenship, Palestinian refugees in Lebanon will be confirmed as second class citizens with fewer rights. The move may remind Palestinians of a similar crisis when hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees in Jordan and Jerusalem were barred from entering Mecca and Medina. Since 1948, large numbers of Palestinians took refuge in Lebanon to escape the violence in their home country.

Rabat- A mentally disturbed man set himself on fire on Wednesday on Avenue Tarek Ibn Ziad in Rabat, shocking onlookers.  The 31-year-old man used a “highly flammable” liquid to burn himself. Civil protection forces intervened and transported the man to the closest hospital, Ibn Sina, where he is currently receiving treatment. According to authorities in the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region, the man has been admitted several times to the local mental health hospital, reported state-owned outlet Maghreb Arab Press. In June, a 30-year-old would-be shoplifter set himself on fire during Ramadan at the main entrance to the Marjane supermarket in Agadir. A video of the incident shocked the public. The man was transported to Hassan II Hospital in Agadir with second- and third-degree burns. According to the local news site Agadir24.info, the man had a criminal record and had been caught in the act attempting to steal at Marjane. Morocco is striving to broaden mental health care which is a priority for the country according to Minister of Health Anas Doukkali. Doukkali has announced a new action plan that strives to create specialized departments in public hospitals and use therapeutic alternatives outside of hospitals, improve psychiatry and psychology services, enlarge mental healthcare coverage, and offer less costly services. According to a 2017 Ministry of Health report, 50 percent of Moroccans suffer from mental or psychological disorders. Lack of resources also constitutes a problem for the progress of mental healthcare. Morocco has only 197 psychiatrists for a population of over 35.28 million. On average, only 0.63 psychiatrists are available per 100,000 people.

Rabat- Moroccans have begun an online campaign with hashtags “#Baraka” (enough) and “#Boycott ONCF” against ONCF following Tuesday’s Bouknadel train accident. Many Moroccans have expressed rage towards the National Office of Railways (ONCF) after train No. 9 linking Rabat and Kenitra derailed October 16, killing 7 and injuring 125, according to the most recent statistics.  ONCF, a state-run company with “financial autonomy” according to its website, is Morocco’s only rail transport provider. Internet users blamed ONCF for the accident after an audio recording of a phone conversation between some of its employees leaked online, indicating that faulty tracks and speeding caused the accident. According to the ONCF employees in the phone conversation, the train was running at 120 kilometers per hour, double the speed it was supposed to. The train was supposed to run at 60 kilometers per hour on the stretch of track where the train derailed. One of the employees stated that the problems on the track were noticed last Friday, but ONCF did not properly communicate the speed limit to drivers or take it into consideration. Morocco World News has contacted the Media and Press Department at the Ministry of Equipment who said that they do not know of the recordings. “There is an investigation being carried out on the train accident and we should wait for its report. We cannot believe anyone’s claims although they are ONCF’s employees. There should be scientific proof of what happened.” Moroccans are now calling for an immediate boycott of the state-run company on Twitter and Facebook. While many are calling for actions, hundreds of people have donated blood for the victims of the accident at the Regional Center for Blood Transfusion. Many people in Rabat, including royal gendarmes volunteered to donate blood for the victims at the Regional Center for Blood Transfusion. The center had taken 549 sacks of blood in the first 24 hours after the accident. The center only had to use 16 by mid-Wednesday, according to the head of the center, Mohammed Benajiba.

Rabat – The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) has earned the 17025 accreditation for its laboratories from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The National Accreditation Board (ANAB), a US-based non-governmental standards organization known for providing ISO accreditation services worldwide, presented DGSN the award at the DGSN laboratory in Casablanca on Wednesday, October 17.  Achieving ISO 17025 accreditation has many benefits, according to consultant Amadou Tall. First it gives “recognition in the testing and calibration laboratory industry as an ISO 17025 certified facility.” Second, it brings “a competitive edge over competitors who are not certified in a globally accepted quality system.”  To obtain ISO accreditation, laboratories must fulfill certain requirements, according to Actlabs, such as “the operation and effectiveness of the quality management system,” and “the competence of staff, methodology, test/calibration equipment and the test methods.” By receiving certification, DGSN’s scientific police laboratory has become the first accredited Moroccan laboratory in forensic science. It is proof that the police and forensic science have evolved enormously in Morocco. In fact, in recent years, the DGSN laboratory has embarked on an advanced approach to fight murder, organized crime, and terrorism. Thomas Brown, the director of the US Bureau of International Narcotics, said, “We are always ready to collaborate with Morocco, especially the DGSN. This accreditation is nothing but a tangible proof of the cooperation between the two sides, and we hope this continues in the future.” Abdellah El Ouardi, the chief of the Casablanca Police Department, said that he was “very happy” for the DGSN to receive the accreditation, which he described as an exceptional historical achievement.

New York –   The Fourth Committee of the UN General Assembly adopted Wednesday without a vote a resolution reiterating support for the UN-led political process aimed at settling the Western Sahara issue and called upon the countries in the region to cooperate fully with the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy, and with each other, in order to reach a political settlement to this regional dispute. The resolution thus supports the political process based on the Security Council resolutions adopted since 2007, with a view to reaching a “fair, sustainable and mutually acceptable” solution to the territorial dispute. The text praises the efforts made in this regard and calls upon all parties and States in the region to cooperate fully with the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy, and with each other, in order to reach a “political solution that is mutually acceptable “. The Committee also welcomed the commitment of the parties to continue to show political will and to work in an atmosphere conducive to dialogue in order to start, in good faith and without preconditions, a more intensive phase of negotiations, noting the efforts made and the developments since 2006, thus ensuring the implementation of the Security Council resolutions. In this regard, the resolution refers to the Security Council resolutions adopted since 2007, which recognized the pre-eminence of the autonomy initiative presented by Morocco, which was deemed by the Security Council and the international community as a serious and credible initiative for the final settlement of this regional dispute. The text also supports the recommendations of the Security Council Resolution 2414 adopted on 27 April 2018, which emphasizes the need to make progress toward a realistic, practicable and enduring political solution to the Sahara question based on compromise. This resolution also calls upon the neighboring states to make important contributions to the political process and to increase their engagement in the negotiating process.

Rabat – The Polisario Front continues its maneuvers to create tension between Morocco and countries supporting Morocco’s position on Western Sahara. On October 16, Egyptian Ambassador to Morocco Ashraf Ibrahim issued a statement to clarify Egypt’s stance on the Western Sahara conflict after a  Polisario member attended a ceremony organized by the Egyptian embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The Egyptian embassy in Morocco shared Ibrahim’s statement with Morocco World News, in which he reaffirmed Egypt’s firm stance on the conflict. The Egyptian ambassador complained of the “inaccuracy of what some media outlets have been reporting about the invitation” of Egypt in Ethiopia to the representative of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) to attend a reception on October 12. The statement denied that the Egyptian ambassador to Ethiopia invited the Polisario representative in Addis Ababa. Instead, the representative intruded on the ceremony. Because of the crowds at the ceremony, the Egyptian mission did not notice his presence until he left. The Egyptian ambassador to Morocco emphasized his country’s support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. He added that Egypt does not recognize the self-proclaimed SADR, reiterating that the solution to the conflict should take place within the auspices of the United Nations. Commenting on Morocco’s return to the African Union, the ambassador said that Egypt backed Morocco’s return to its “natural place within the AU” because it is a brotherly country and a “strong and influential African power.” “It will give impetus to the course of the union’s work, especially as Africa has a prominent Moroccan interest; the kingdom is one of the founding countries of the Organization of African Unity,” reads the statement. Ibrahim added that Egypt and Morocco have a “comprehensive coordination” within the AU. He asserted that the AU will witness a strong boost with Egypt taking over the presidency of the AU in 2019, “especially in the issues of combating terrorism and the 2026 African Agenda for Sustainable Development and Peacekeeping” and migration challenges because both Morocco and Egypt are countries of transit and reception for migrants. Subsequently, Ibrahim reiterated the strength of the diplomatic ties between Egypt and Morocco. The Moroccan-Egyptian bonds, according to Ibrahim, are “witnessing a continuous development based a common history and strong cultural ties.” It is not the first time Polisario tried to create tension between Morocco and other countries. Recently, Japan slammed Polisario at the 7th ministerial meeting of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) for secretly attending. Japan’s foreign minister Taro Kono stressed that his country does not recognize Polisario as a state. “Even if a group which claims itself as a state which Japan does not recognize was sitting in this room, this fact does not mean that Japan, in any way, implicitly or explicitly recognize it as a state,” Kono said. The Japanese reaction came after Morocco’s withdrawal from the meeting room to protest the presence of a Polisario representative.

By Josh Babb Rabat – The #Masaktach (I won’t be silent) movement in Morocco is bringing out women’s personal experiences of harassment and assault. As Moroccans across the country came together for International Women’s Day on October 10, the #Masaktach campaign, launched in September, has continued to reverberate through the country’s culture. The movement aims to highlight routine discrimination and violence targeting women in Morocco.  The #Masaktach campaign is the culmination of several stories circulating around Morocco press outlets. The most prominent is the case of Khadija, a 17-year-old who claims to have been abducted and repeatedly raped and tortured for almost two months by a gang of 12 men and boys. Police arrested the suspects, ranging from 17 to 28 years old, who now face various charges, including kidnapping, torture, and rape.  As #Masaktach has gained support, activists launched an official Facebook and Twitter, each quickly gaining more than 1,000 likes. “Women are the weakest link in Morocco but Khadija’s case his us very hard and deep. How she was abused, objectified and stripped of her humanity went beyond the imaginable,” said Leila Slassi, a co-founder of the group. But the initial catalyst for the #Masaktach campaign stems from accusations facing Moroccan pop-star Saad Lamjarred, who is facing two separate charges of rape in France. Lamjarred is currently awaiting trial in a French jail. Activists on social media launched the hashtag calling for radio stations to boycott the artist. Popular stations Radio 2M and HitRadio have announced they will no longer play songs by Lamjarred. Still others have resisted: Chada FM stated it would not boycott Lamjarred’s songs until his case went to court, “assuming that the accused is innocent until he has been sentenced.” While the story of Khadija and the accusations against Lamjarred certainly played a role in getting #Masaktach trending, just as important were the stories of ordinary women across Morocco sharing their experience of harassment and assault.  The movement will inevitably draw comparisons to the #MeToo movement which began in the US last year. Morocco World News spoke to Stephanie Willman, a founding partner of Mobilising for Rights Associates (MRA), an organization which fights for women’s equality. She views the #Masaktach movement as a first step of what needs to be a continuing process.  “The #Masaktach movement is important in that for the first time, women have used their voice to speak out about sexual harassment in a way that has gotten national attention.” Willman went on to elaborate that the next step in the process must be a public outing of those who are responsible, and finally an admittance of guilt from the perpetrators themselves.   “The success of the #MeToo movement came in part because some high-profile perpetrators, such as Harvey Weinstein, were actually arrested and charged.” Willman added she does not know if the Moroccan justice system is prepared to face that kind of task.   The criticism comes even after Morocco’s government passed Law 103-13 criminalizing all forms of harassment and violence against women, which went into effect in September. Willman was critical of Law 103-13, titled “Elimination of Violence Against Women,” stating that the law did little to provide a process for police and prosecutors to deal with the sensitive subject of sexual harassment and assault. Although Morocco has made progress towards women’s equality, a recent UN and Promundo report outlined just how entrenched attitudes regarding gender based harassment in Morocco truly are. The study found that 63 percent of women had experienced some type of sexual harassment, while 53 percent of men admitted to perpetrating such acts, including unwanted touching, catcalling, and stalking or following. The study elaborates: “Why do men commit such acts? Almost 60 per cent of those who had ever sexually harassed a woman or girl said they did it for fun or excitement; around a fifth cited a desire to show off to their peers. Nearly three-quarters of male respondents maintained that a woman’s ‘provocative’ dress, and for some, her presence in public places at night, are legitimate reasons for harassment.” The study also notes that 78 percent of women believe other women who dress provocatively deserve to be harassed, finding that 42 percent of women thought other woman liked the attention.   While the #Masaktach movement, much like #MeToo, has certainly had a short-term cultural impact in Morocco, it remains to be seen what, if any, long term impacts the movement may have.

Rabat– A leaked audio recording between ONCF employees has blamed the Bouknadel train derailment on the train’s speed. Employees blamed the Bouknadel train tragedy on Tuesday morning, which killed 7 and injured 125, according to the most recent statistics. on technical issues on the track. Train No. 9 linking Rabat and Kenitra on the Casablanca-Kenitra line derailed on Tuesday at 10:20 a.m. According to a recording of a phone conversation between ONCF employees which is circulating online on Wednesday, the train was running at 120 kilometers per hour, double the speed it was supposed to. The train was supposed to run at 60 kilometers per hour in the area where the train derailed. One of the employees stated that the technical issues on the track were noticed last Friday, however ONCF did not properly communicate the speed limit to drivers or take it into consideration. One of the speakers urged: “It’s about time that we speak up about our rights.” Morocco World News has contacted the Media and Press department at the Ministry of Equipment, who said that they do not know of the recordings.  “There is an investigation being carried out on the train accident and we should wait for its report. We cannot believe anyone’s claims although they are ONCF’s employees. There should be scientific proof of what happened.” The King’s attorney general at the Rabat Court of Appeal is leading an investigation into the accident at the request of King Mohammed VI. The King expressed his deep condolences to the families of victims and said he would personally pay for the burial expenses in a royal message issued on Tuesday at noon. ONCF Director Rabie Khlie Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani; Mohamed Najib Boulif, the secretary general of transport; and other government officials have conveyed their condolences. Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit, Minister of Equipment Abdelkader Amara, and Khlie all came to the scene of the accident within hours.   In addition to delays in arrival of ambulances which prompted passengers and passersby to take initiative and retrieve bodies from the train, government officials were slow to respond or provide information. Many Moroccans have also criticized the government and ONCF for lack of communication on the accident and their inability to clarify the causes of the tragedy. For his part, Khlie told Moroccan media in an impromptu press conference at the scene that 10 ambulances arrived quickly to care for the injured. He said buses were to be provided for travelers to compensate for the suspended trains. ONCF had cleared the first railway track at the scene and begun running trains by Wednesday noon. ONCF has invited passengers in a statement “to inquire at stations or by calling 2255 for information before traveling.”  ONCF stated that it is currently preparing to repair the two other tracks. At the request of the King, rescuers and royal gendarmes transported the victims to the military hospital in Rabat. Khlie also avoided commenting on passengers previous repeated complaints about delayed trains. He said the issue is “out of context” and, “We should respect the victims of the incident.” Concern over ONCF’s safety policy has risen, especially as ONCF plans to launch Morocco’s high speed train (LGV) between Casablanca and Tangier. LGV is expected to start operating by the end of 2018.  The news of the accident shook Moroccans and created a solidarity movement in the capital. Many people in Rabat, including royal gendarmes volunteered to donate blood for the victims at the Regional Center for Blood Transfusion.  The center has taken 549 sacks of blood since the accident. The center only had to use 16 so far, according to the head of the center, Mohammed Benajiba. An employee at the center told Morocco World News late yesterday that it was mobilized to help train accident victims, specifying that many donors are university students, and they continued to arrive in big groups to donate since the accident.

Rabat – Minister of Health Anas Doukkali has introduced an action plan to promote mental health in Morocco.  At the House of Representatives, Doukkali declared that mental health is a priority and presented the ministry’s plan at the House of Representatives, according to state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press. Doukkali revealed to Parliament some alarming statistics about mental health in Morocco. According to his report, 40 percent of Moroccans suffer from mental disorders, 26 percent from depression, and 1 percent from schizophrenia.  The minister also emphasized the lack of structure and human capital as Morocco only has 0.67 beds allocated for mental health per 1,000 inhabitants. According to the minister, Morocco has in total only 290 psychiatrists, 5 pedopsychiatrists, and 1,069 nurses trained in psychiatry. The Ministry of Health, according to Doukkali, seeks to increase and broaden mental health care by creating new specialized departments in public hospitals and using therapeutic alternatives outside of hospitals.  Doukkali’s action plan consists of improving psychiatry and psychology services, enlarging mental healthcare coverage, and offering less costly services.  The ministry has begun building psychiatric hospitals in Agadir; Kenitra, a city near Rabat; and Beni Mellal, a city near Casablanca. The hospitals will each contain specialized departments for children, teenagers, and individuals fighting addictions.  Doukkali also said he would focus on trainings in the mental health sector to train 30 psychiatrists and 10 child mental health psychiatrists per year. The ministry has opened new departments in Marrakech University Hospital specialized in children’s health care.  The minister declared that he would work towards mental illness prevention as well by investigating the causes of violence in schools, workplaces, and in the family.  The need for improvements to Morocco’s mental health facilities hit home last year. In 2017, the Ministry of Health issued a shocking report that 50 percent of Moroccans suffer from mental or psychological disorders. The report led many to question how the country is still standing. Morocco, in 2017, had only 197 psychiatrists for a population of over 35.28 million. On average, only 0.63 psychiatrists are available per 100,000 people. Although the number of psychiatrists increased this year by 100 according to Doukkali, the impact is not significant on the population. Hassan Kisra, director of Errazi Mental Health Hospital in Sale, told Morocco World News in an interview last year that his hospital is not equipped for the high demand. Doctors must waitlist patients who cannot be hospitalized immediately because there are not enough beds. Patients coming to the hospital from other regions are hard hit by the need to wait, due to the lack of mental health hospitals across the country. With 41.3 percent of the population living in rural areas with unstable income and no mental health facilities around, the situation is only expected to worsen if the ministry does not take urgent measures. Indeed, a 2017 report from the World Health Organization, found that cases of depression increased by 18.4 percent and cases of anxiety by 14.9 percent in only 10 years. Psychiatric doctor Mohamed El Baroudi told Morocco World News last year that the increasing pressure of modern life might very well be a factor in rise of mental health issues. He also stated that untreated childhood traumas play a big role. Dr. El Baroudi confessed that he has seen a dramatic increase in instances of pedophilia. Last year, he was receiving approximately five victims of pedophilia per day at the Souissi Children’s Hospital in Rabat. Another reason for the increase might also be the alarming rates of drug addiction in Morocco. In 2017, over 600,000 Moroccans were addicted to substances. As many as 16,000 were addicted to hard drugs, such as heroin and cocaine according to study conducted by the Biochemistry, Nutrition, and Cellular Biology group in affiliation with Casablanca’s Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy. Over 70 percent of those addicted to hard drugs are young people aged 18 to 28. According to Hassan Kisra, the most common cases he treats at the mental health hospital are children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and phobias. Looking at the chaotic state of the Moroccan mental health sector, the Ministry of Health’s measures, if implemented, will be welcomed by the Moroccan public. Doukkali’s action plan and promises are a step in the right direction, but it remains to be seen whether it will significantly impact the sector.

Rabat – To help combat irregular migration, the EU has promised to strengthen cooperation with Morocco but has made no concrete funding promises.  The European Union must develop cooperation with Morocco to curb migratory flows along the western Mediterranean route, stated Federica Mogherini, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs. She was speaking at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting on Monday in Brussels.  At a press briefing after the meeting, Mogherini asserted: “We have seen a 150% increase in migration flows on the western Mediterranean route this year, and we have decided to strengthen our actions to curb these flows, especially with Morocco.”  In addition to Morocco, the EU is also working with Mauritania, citing a possible increase in funding for the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF for Africa) intended to allow the nations to better manage migratory flows.   The announcement came a month after Khalid Zerouali, Morocco’s director of immigration and border surveillance, gave an interview regarding an increase in irregular immigration attempts. He stated that Morocco has aborted approximately 65,000 attempts annually since 2016. He explained it was a notable increase from the annual average of 32,000 recorded between 2003 and 2015.  The declaration of further cooperation came after reports surfaced earlier this month that Spain has lobbied the EU on Morocco’s behalf for more resources to deal with irregular immigration.

By Mohamed Bella Rabat – The Marrakech Directorate of Culture has organized a fado concert to celebrate the Portuguese guitar with Marta Pereira da Costa tonight. Young Portuguese artist Marta Pereira da Costa will play at Marrakech’s Bahia Palace. The Portuguese consulate in Marrakech collaborated in organizing the concert. Da Costa, the winner of the 2014 “Musician of the Year Award” in Portugal, is currently the only female guitarist who plays the fado genre of music. Fado, which dates to the 1820s, is regarded as the soul of Portuguese music.. Marta Pereira da Costa will give a solo performance on the Portuguese guitar, also called the fado guitar. The instrument is a chordophone with 6 pairs of strings and a pear-shaped wooden sound-box. Da Costa has performed across the globe, in New York, Toronto, Madrid,, Paris, and Ljubljana. In 2012, da Costa recorded the Portuguese guitar for artist Rodrigo Costa Felix’s album, the first record in the history of fado where the Portuguese guitar was solely played by a woman. Da Costa’s magical music is a mix of tradition and innovation, delicacy and vigor, beauty and elegance that catch the ears of those that listen with their own souls. “The fact that it is not common to see women playing the Portuguese guitar, made me want to try and play it. So I challenged myself to play the instrument.” Da Costa told Culture for Friends. Fado music still fascinates da Costa everyday, while she works hard to leave a mark on the history of not only Portuguese music, but on the world. She is now a role model for many young Portuguese girls who want to follow her footsteps.

Rabat – Following the train accident in Bouknadel, Morocco’s National Railway Office (ONCF) has announced it removed all the cars of the derailed train from the railway. ONCF has cleared the first railway track, allowing the partial return of train traffic between Rabat and Kenitra starting at 12 noon today, ONCF said in a statement today. “In the meantime, we are working to repair the two other tracks,” ONCF added. ONCF invites passengers “to inquire at stations or by calling 2255 for information before traveling,” concluded the statement. 7 dead, 125 injured  An ONCF train derailed on Tuesday morning in Bouknadel, between Rabat and Kenitra. The accident killed 7 people, including the train’s engineer, and injured more than 125. The train conductor was severely injured and some of the passengers lost limbs, eyewitnesses told Morocco World News. According to eyewitnesses, some individuals took advantage of the accident to loot from the luggage of other passengers. The injured were transferred to Mohamed V Military Hospital in Rabat at the request of King Mohammed VI, who ordered an investigation into the accident. ONCF knew of track problems Friday ONCF has not yet revealed any details about the causes of the accident.  However, a leaked audio recording between ONCF employees has blamed the Bouknadel train derailment on the train’s speed. According to the recording of the employees’ phone conversation which has been circulating online, the train was running at 120 kilometer per hour. The train was supposed to run at 60 kilometers per hour in the area where the accident took place. One of the employees stated that technical issues with the track at Bouknadel were noticed Friday, however ONCF did not thoroughly communicate the speed limit or take it into consideration. Morocco World News has contacted the Media and Press department at the Ministry of Equipment, who said that they do not know of the recordings. “There is an investigation being carried out on the train accident and we should wait for its report. We cannot believe anyone’s claims although they are ONCF’s employees. There should be scientific proof of what happened.” The public prosecutor at Rabat’s court of appeal announced yesterday the royal gendarmerie will open an investigation into the accident. They will call passengers and witnesses also to give their testimonies.

Rabat – Algeria maintains reluctance to admit responsibility in the Western Sahara conflict. President Abdulaziz Bouteflika’s government wants to participate in the United Nations roundtable on Western Sahara only as an observer, not as a main party. Algeria’s decision comes as no surprise. Morocco’s eastern neighbor has for years refused to join talks as a main party to the 42-year-long conflict over Western Sahara. On October 17, Russia’s state-run outlet Sputnik News reported that Algeria will take part in the “first round of direct negotiations between the Polisario Front and Morocco … as an observer country.” Algeria’s permanent ambassador to the UN, Sabri Boukadoum, confirmed its participation in a statement to the 4th Committee of the UN General Assembly on October 16.

“Algeria, as a neighbor country and official observer of the peace process, responded immediately and positively to Kohler’s invitation to a round table in Geneva on December 5-6,” he said. Jeune Afrique reported that the UN spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, said that the four parties invited to the round table are asked to come “in good faith and without preconditions,” as requested by Guterres in his Western Sahara report to the Security Council. Morocco has agreed to take part in the roundtable to remind participants of its firm conditions, which emphasize Morocco’s autonomy plan as a just solution to end the conflict. Throughout the year, Morocco has been calling on Algeria to participate in the UN-led political process as a party to the conflict and not an observer. Morocco World News reached out to Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi for comment on Algeria’s participation as an observer but El Khalfi was unreachable. Morocco’s foreign affairs minister Nasser Bourita said on October 5 that Algeria “is the one which created the problem, and it is Algeria that needs to contribute to finding a solution for it.” Mauritania has also responded favorably to the invitations sent by the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy, Horst Kohler.

The UN Security Council will meet on October 29 to decide on the mandate of the UN mission for Western Sahara, MINURSO. Its current mandate will expire on October 31.

Rabat – As one of Morocco’s biggest date producers, the oasis town of Erfoud is celebrating Guetna, the date harvest, October 15-31.  Just after the date harvest, Erfoud, a desert town in the Draa-Tafilalet region in southeast Morocco, hosts the Guetna festival to promote the city’s agricultural potential and upgrade tourism. The festival is an occasion for locals, tourists, and visitors to visit exhibition tents and taste date samples. Farmers from the region and neighboring areas meet to explore date samples from other date-producing regions.   The festival is also an opportunity to experience the region’s culture thanks to a rich program of street shows, parade processions, and folk music and dances. For those looking for fun at Guetna, there are camel racing and evening fashion shows featuring embroidered silk, silver and gold headdresses, and fancy jewelry.

New York –   Morocco affirms its full support for the national unity and territorial integrity of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the full sovereignty of this “brotherly country over its three islands, the Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa,” said Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Omar Hilale, before the 4th Committee of the UN General Assembly. The Moroccan diplomat also called for the end of the occupation of these islands, while rejecting the policy of imposing a fait accompli. “I would like to reaffirm the firm position expressed by Morocco at the 29th Summit of the Arab League in April 2018 regarding the three Emirati islands – the Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa -,” Hilale said. Read Also: UN 4th Committee: UAE Supports Morocco’s Territorial Integrity The Kingdom, he insisted, stands with the United Arab Emirates and reaffirms its continued support for all the peaceful measures taken by this brotherly country, in order to restore its full sovereignty over its three occupied islands. “Morocco also condemns the continuing occupation of these three islands, which are an integral part of the territory of the United Arab Emirates, in flagrant violation of international law and the UN Charter,” Hilale pointed out, recalling, in this regard, that Morocco is a fervent defender of the territorial integrity of States. The United Arab Emirates also reiterated support for Morocco’s territorial integrity at the 4th Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. Emirati representative Asmae El Hamadi has reaffirmed the UAE’s “steadfast position” in support of Morocco’s territorial integrity. She also expressed support for Morocco’s autonomy plan as a just solution to the Western Sahara conflict.

Rabat- Bassima Hakkaoui has said that blind protesters tried to break into her personal office on Sunday. The Ministry of Family and Solidarity continues to deal with blind protesters conducting a sit-in on the ministry headquarters’ roof in Rabat. Minister of Family Bassima Hakkaoui has provided her version of the story following the death of Saber El Haloui, a blind protester who fell to his death off the ministry’s roof last week. The minister said that the protesters broke into the fourth floor of the ministry and tried to barge into her personal office. During discussions in the House of Representatives at Parliament on Monday, Hakkaoui said that the blind protesters asked to be “immediately” employed and did not respond to the ministry’s readiness to dialogue. Bombarded with questions, Hakkaoui explained that the protesters broke into the headquarters through the main gate and glass door. Hakkaoui said that she met with the protesters on October 3 to “assure” them that someone will employ them by the end of the year. The minister said that the protesters agreed to suspend their sit-in on Friday, October 5. However, Hakkaoui found them still at the ministry in the following days. The blind protesters began the sit-in complaining of Hakkaoui’s not acting on promises that the ministry was processing their files. On Sunday, 25-year-old Saber El Haloui fell off the ministry’s roof during the sit-in which was reportedly organized by the National Coordination for the Disabled, Unemployed Degree-Holders beginning September 26. Many of El Haloui’s fellow protesters told the Akhbar Alyaoum newspaper that El Haloui was speaking on the phone with his family on the rear side of the roof when his foot slipped. Forensics confirmed that the cause of death was not suicide. In the aftermath of El Haloui’s death, the protesters related that Hakkaoui did not care about them or cooperate with them. “You do not scare me; your protests are random … I am a woman of iron,’’ Hakkaoui allegedly stated, according to one protester. The protesters hold Hakkaoui responsible for El Haloui’s death, rejecting her condolences via a Facebook post. She wrote: “We wish to express our deep sorrow at this painful incident.” The blind men are continuing to protest lack of fair opportunities and the death of their comrade.

Rabat – Morocco’s permanent representative to the UN Ambassador Omar Hilale has said the 4th committee must “part with” Western Sahara issue. Ambassador Hilale affirmed that keeping the Western Sahara issue within the 4th committee’s agenda violates the UN Charter. Western Sahara “is indeed the only issue that continues to be discussed and to be subject to a resolution by the 4th Committee, while the Security Council has been engaged with this issue since 1988,” Hilale said  in a statement before the 4th Committee of the UN General Assembly in New York, Tuesday. Hilale considered the double examination of the Western Sahara issue as “anachronistic,” Maghreb Arab Press reported October 16. According to Hilale, this “violates Article 12 of the UN Charter which stipulates that while the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.” Hilale said that the objective of the founding fathers of our organization through this article is threefold: “To prevent a situation where two UN bodies are dealing with the same issue; to avoid the adoption of contradictory decisions, as it is currently the case with the resolution of the 4th Committee on the Moroccan Sahara and that of the Security Council on the political process; to ensure the preponderance and preeminence of the Security Council, which is the source of international law and which remains the main UN body in charge of peacekeeping and international security.” Hilale stressed that Morocco will not stop calling on the 4th Committee to part with Western Sahara to “ensure serenity and the appropriate atmosphere for the relaunch of the political process under the auspices of the Security Council.”

Rabat – British Sound Energy has received Moroccan ministerial approval for its new eight-year petroleum agreement to drill for oil in Morocco’s eastern Tendrara region. Sound Energy announced the news today, October 16. The British company originally signed the new petroleum agreement, named “Greater Tendrara Petroleum Agreement,” with the National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONHYM), Morocco’s regulator for petroleum operations, on August 31. The agreement pended ministerial approval to go into effect. Commenting on the Moroccan finance and energy ministries’ approval, James Parsons, Sound Energy’s CEO said, “The Greater Tendrara petroleum agreement has now become effective – securing Sound Energy’s rights to this potentially transformational acreage up to 2026.” “We look forward to commencement of our exploration drilling programme in the near future,” he added. Read also: Sound Energy Signs New 8-Year Petroleum Agreement with Morocco The agreement united the areas covered by the company’s Tendrara petroleum agreement in April 2013, the Matarka reconnaissance licence granted in July 2017, and the Anoual petroleum agreement, said the British company in statement published August 31. Following the petroleum agreement’s implementation, Sound Energy will hold a 47.5 percent share in the Greater Tendrara licensed area. The Texas-based Schlumberger company, a Sound Energy partner, holds 27.5 percent and ONHYM holds 25 percent. The project covers an area of approximately 14,500 square kilometers extending across eastern Morocco and “surrounding the development concession application area relating to the Tendrara gas discovery.” In September, Morocco’s Ministry of Energy gave Sound Energy a production concession for the company’s Tendrara natural gas discovery in eastern Morocco. Read also: Morocco Grants Production Concession to Sound Energy for Gas Discovery The new agreement will be divided into 3 phases: an initial 4-year phase to dig 2 exploration wells, an “optional first complementary” 2-year phase to dig one exploration well, and an “optional second complementary” 2-year phase to dig another exploration well. All exploration wells will comply with the minimum Triassic objective. In July 2018, Sound Energy said it discovered large oil deposits in Anoual after exploring in the area.  In September 2017, the Advisory &amp; Finance Group Investment Bank (AFG) gave Sound Energy a funding offer worth $60-100 million for its Tendrara gas export pipeline project. AFG is a Moroccan oil and gas investment fund owned by Mohamed Benslimane, who is married to Princess Lalla Zineb. AFG acts as a manager for Sound Energy in the country.  In July 2017, the British company signed two contracts with ONHYM, acquiring two new licenses for the two areas near Tendrara and the Algerian border: Anoual and Matarka.

Rabat – On October 16, 2018, a train derailed between Kenitra and Rabat. However, the derailment has given way to a different story and a more lasting frustration among the Moroccan public—governmental incompetence. The train derailed while heading to Kenitra, near Bouknadel at about 10:30 in the morning, killing at least seven people and wounding 90 others on the train. Despite this pain and suffering, videos and pictures from social media showed no ambulances or auxiliary forces on hand, and response did not improve in the hours afterward. While passengers and bystanders were trying to help each other get out of the derailed train, Morocco World News received no information from Morocco’s National Railway Office (ONCF). Read Also: El Othmani Tweets Condolences for Victims of Bouknadel Train Accident Around 1:30 p.m., government officials and ONCF President Rabie Khlie arrived at the scene. One journalist asked whether three hours were not sufficient to determine the cause of the accident. The ONCF president said it was a technical issue and would take time.  ????? ????? ????? ??? ?????? ?????? ??????? ???? ????????? ????? ???????? ??????? ????? ??? ?????? ????? ?????? ????????? ??????? ??????. ??? ???????? ???? ????? ??? ????? ????????? ???????? ?????? ????????? — ???? ??????? -?????? (@ChefGov_ma) October 16, 2018  Khlie also avoided commenting on repeated complaints about delayed trains, saying, “This issue is not within the context [of the accident], and we should respect the victims of the incident.” Journalists asked dozens of questions at the impromptu press conference, starved for communication from authorities both in government and in ONCF. Government officials in general prefer giving statements to foreign news outlets like AFP instead of speaking to local Moroccan ones. Read Also: Video: Train Derails Between Sale and Kenitra Journalists expressed anger over the reluctance of government officials to provide detailed information on the accident. In the absence of published information, Morocco World News called the spokesperson of the Moroccan government, Mustapha El Khalfi, to provide an official death toll estimate and injuries. However, it seemed El Khalfi had not even heard about the accident. At 12:18 p.m., El Khalfi shared a tweet about the signing of an agreement between representatives of associations participating in a national debate on civil society and drugs. ??? ????? ?????? ?????? ??????? ??? ???? ??????? ??????? ????????? ?? ???????? ???????? ??????? ?????? ?????? ???? ???????? ???? ????? ???????? 16 ?????? 2018 ???? ??????? ???????? ??????? ????? ??????… https://t.co/vXUOrPaEsn — Mustapha Khalfi (@mustapha_khalfi) October 16, 2018  Read Also: ONCF’s Train Accident Kills 6 Near Morocco’s Bouknadel The state-owned news agency, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), also had not published an official estimate by early afternoon. It took Mohamed Najib Boulif, secretary general of transport, and Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani more than three hours to comment on the accident, sending condolences to the families of the victims. All talk, no action At the request of King Mohammed VI, the government previously pledged measures to enhance confidence with the public and ensure social dialogue. This accident—and more accurately the government and ONCF’s response to it—does little to reinforce that public trust. The spokesperson of the government seemingly being unaware of a train derailment killing seven and injuring 90 demonstrates that.  The 2011 constitution guarantees citizens the right of access to information, and in June, El Othmani called on the ministers to communicate with the public. ????? ?????? ???? ???? ????? ????? ?????? ??? ?????? ???? ??? ???? ???? ??????
????? ???? ?????? ?????? ???????? — Mohamed Najib Boulif (@BOULIFNajib) October 16, 2018  “Listening and acting remain insufficient, if this is not followed by communication and informing the public.” He said that ministers should communicate to “show their achievements” to allow the public to evaluate government work positively or negatively. However, this incident shows that we have a long way to go before those words translate into action.

Rabat – The Moroccan agricultural company Red Farm will serve its wine during the first China International Import Exposition (CIIE) in early November. The general director of the company, Mamoun Sayah, has high expectations and appeared to be confident in Moroccan wine. According to Xinhua, two other Moroccan companies will participate with their products at the event in Shanghai, a financial hub of China. Sayah said that his winery “is expanding its production capacity.” He added that the winery used to produce 2.5 million bottles of wine annually. Red Farm has 300 hectares of grapes, 50 hectares of which will harvested for the first time this year. Sayah said that the harvest is expected to increase the production capacity to 3 million bottles in 2018. Speaking about the Chinese market, Sayah said, “It is very attractive for us to participate in this event. At present, our wines are mainly sold domestically, and we hope to further open the export market.” According to Wine Enthusiast, Morocco was one of the largest wine-exporting countries in the world as far back as 1950. In 2017, the magazine wrote that Morocco produces about 40 million bottles of wine annually. “Chinese consumers know very little about Moroccan wines. Therefore, Red Farm will adopt more modern and fashionable outer packaging and focus on marketing,” Sayah said. He believes that Moroccan wine can become popular in the Chinese market, which imports many foreign wines, especially from France. “I believe they can break through the encirclement of French wines and have a place in the Chinese market,” he said. Moroccan Secretary of State for Foreign Trade Rakiya Eddarhem commented on Morocco’s participation in the first China International Import Expo, saying that “the participation will contribute to the diversification of the country’s business partners.” Quoted by Xinhua, the chairman of the Moroccan Association of Exporters, Hassan Sentissi Idrissi, said Morocco’s presence an the “major event is strategic for promoting Moroccan exports.” More than 2,800 businesses from more than 130 countries will take part in the event.

Rabat – In their second Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) 2019 qualifier, Morocco and Comoros drew 2-2. Watching Morocco’s Atlas Lions come from behind only to lose composure and allow Comoros to score a goal, it is perhaps legitimate to question the post-World Cup squad. In many regards, today’s head-to-head between Morocco and the Comoros was a replica of the game they played three days ago in Casablanca, although the game today had a slight twist added by the hot and sunny afternoon in Romoni, Comoros’s capital city. The match had comparatively little show, class, or technical outbursts from both teams. They played, it seemed, to finish the game and get out of the burning sun. In fact, at the 75th minute, the referee stopped the game for players to freshen up. Morocco’s Lions were anonymous for most of the first half as they unsuccessfully, perhaps dispiritedly, tried to organize a game that kept eluding them. In 45 minutes of intense battle, the Lions seemed to be taken over. Comoros’s intention seemed to be to make the point they had been making since Saturday in Casablanca when the referee “gifted” Morocco a late-penalty delivering the game’s only goal: That Morocco’s victory was undeserved. Perhaps better used to playing in that burning sun, but also more tactically and physically equipped in the first half, Comoros drove the game. They made Morocco’s passing and team organization look utterly out-of-place.
With 52 percent of ball possession, the hosts pushed forward but also wasted the few crucial opportunities that came their way. Outclassing Morocco on the flanks, Comoros started playing short balls by their wingers. Comoros eventually made its first goal there: A one-to- one between the midfield and the left wing before El Fardou, Comoros’s leading striker, lodged a powerfully-shot negotiated short-range missile into Muni’s goal. There was nothing the Morocco keeper could do but resort to giving a wide, uncomforting smile to Hamza Mendyl. As the last Moroccan to be outrun in the buildup to the Comoros goal, Mendyl appeared apologetic for failing to interfere.
The second half was more urgent, but Morocco seemed better prepared for the challenge. As they became comfortable, Herve Renard’s boys started resembling the Moroccan team that Moroccan fans are starting to miss. But there was still an obvious lack of magisterial playmaking on the Moroccan side. Some will say that the creative genius of Hakim Ziyech has been greatly missing in the Moroccan squad. Morocco scored an equalizer after a trademark Renard-style-inspired team effort. At 54 minutes, Morocco, apparently revived from its burden of disappointing passes, started asserting its dominance in the game. Morocco’s growing assertiveness sparked mishaps and panic in the Comoros defense. Morocco’s second goal came barely 10 minutes after the first. It is a goal that Amrabat will surely remember as one of his easiest with the national team. The Comoros goalkeeper failed to pass the ball to a defender, instead gifting the Moroccan a much-needed goal. At 2-1 though, as if drained, Morocco’s Lions progressively lost the tempo to a now confident home side. Morocco’s joy was outlived. At minute 90, when the Lions should have given everything, they went on losing duels. So Comoros second goal came as no surprise, sending the home crowd into raptures. Morocco’s qualifying chances for the Africa Cup of Nations, although still very much alive, have taken a very serious blow. With group leader Cameroon as their next fixture, Morocco’s Lions have for challenge to outplay the lackadaisical level they are showing of late.

By Mohammed Bella Rabat – The 2018 Marrakech International Film Festival (FIFM), November 30-December 8, will honor the two eminent women. The festival will honor American actress Robin Wright and French director Agnes Varda, along with the iconic Godfather of cinema, Robert De Niro. The three will join a star-studded list of recipients including Martin Scorsese, Jeremy Irons, Isabelle Huppert, Ben Kingsley, Harvey Keitel, Amitabh Bachchan, and Alain Delon. The Golden Globe Award winner Robin Wright has a substantial career in both film and television. The actress starred in such films as “The Princess Bride,” “Forrest Gump,” “Nine Lives,” “She’s So Lovely,” and “Justice League.” She also played distinguished television roles, like Claire Underwood in “House of Cards” and Kelly Capwell in “Santa Barbara.” “I’m honored to be receiving the l’Etoile d’Or award at this year’s Marrakech International Film Festival. I’m thrilled to be visiting the country of Morocco and grateful to be given this opportunity to experience the Moroccan culture and enjoy such a beautiful location,” Wright commented as FIFM’s honorary award recipient. Agnes Varda, winner of the Palme d’Or d’Honneur and Academy Honor Award, is a prominent photographer, scriptwriter, actress, director, and artist. The endlessly curious and rebellious pioneer is considered the grandmother of the Nouvelle Vague, the French new wave. On her work, she said, “I love filming real people; I love to connect with the kind of people we don’t know so well.” Her latest film, “Visages, Village” (Faces, Places), was nominated for a best documentary Oscar earlier this year which made her, at 90, the oldest nominee in academy history. Varda is known for her “Vagabond,” “Cléo de 5 à 7,” “The Beaches of Agnès,” “Le Bonheur,” and “Jacquot de Nantes.” The 90-year-old visionary spoke of her honory award at the FIFM, “I loved Marrakech before the festival existed, but the addition of cinema makes me even more happy to come back and meet the community of Moroccan and worldwide filmmakers and film buffs.” The 17th Marrakech International Film Festival will aim to encourage diversity and build bridges between cultures and nations.

Rabat – Citizen Lab Canada suspects a Saudi operator of using Pegasus spyware on phones in 11 countries, including Morocco.

According to a new report, the Israel-based cyber warfare vendor NSO Group produces and markets “Pegasus mobile phone spyware suits.” Customers can buy Pegasus to target victims using mobile software on Androids and Iphones, sending “specially crafted exploit links.” The software customers can access data from infected mobiles, including chats, emails, and photos. Pegasus can also give customers access to microphones and cameras. The report identified 120 ISPs in 45 countries “with likely infections and 10 Pegasus systems whose operators were engaging  in suspected cross-border monitoring.” Citizen Lab Canada investigated Pegasus “infection” cases across the world and honed in on one especially active operator who “appeared to be operating in the interests of Saudi Arabia.” The group inferred the operator’s affiliation because infections targeted Saudi Amnesty International researcher Yahya Assiri and dissident Omar Abdulaziz. The suspected Saudi operator was also “actively monitoring targets in Bahrain, Canada, Egypt, France, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Qatar, Turkey and the UK.

Rabat – Agriculture minister Aziz Akhannouch has announced the government will distribute 1 million hectares of land to small farmers to develop Morocco’s rural areas. The government will call on the farmers to optimize the use of the land, Akhannouch said in a statement on the sidelines of the 11th horse show (Salon du Cheval) in El Jadida, a coastal city 100 kilometers southwest of Casablanca, on October 15. Akhannouch described the initiative as a “takeoff for the rural world” in Morocco. Akhannouch stated that all agricultural stakeholders are committed to achieving the “expected takeoff,” Maghreb Arab Press reported today. In his speech on Friday at the opening of a new session of Parliament, King Mohammed VI stressed the need to boost agricultural employment to improve living conditions and consolidate stability in rural areas. King Mohammed VI believes that providing employment for youth in rural areas, especially the rural middle class, could serve “as a lever” for the country’s economic and social development. It is the only way to encourage young people “to remain on their land,” according to the King. The King also affirmed that small farmers should be given ways to market their products to bypass speculators and mediators. He also indicated the importance of using communal agricultural land (sulaliyat) for investment projects. It would “serve as a powerful lever for improved economic and social conditions, especially for rights holders.” “This should make it possible to secure at least one million additional hectares of this land,” the King said.

Rabat- King Mohammed has decided to personally pay for the burial expenses of the victims of today’s ONCF train accident. In a royal message issued on Tuesday at noon, King Mohammed VI expressed his deep condolences to the families and loved ones of the deceased victims, praying for the recovery of the injured. The King instructed the interior minister to transfer wounded passengers to the military hospital in Rabat and gave strict instructions to determine the causes of the accident. The minister of the interior, Abdelouafi Laftit; the minister of equipment, Abdelkader Amara; and Rabii Lakhli, the director of ONCF all came to the scene of the accident within hours. So far, no reports on the causes of the accident have been published. The train derailed on Tuesday around 10:30 a.m. near Bouknadel, between Rabat and Kenitra, killing as many as six people, including the train’s engineer. All trains from Kenitra to Casablanca are currently on hold.  The train conductor is severely injured and some of the passengers have lost limbs, eyewitnesses told Morocco World News. Eighty-six people have been wounded and seven have life-threatening injuries, according to ONCF Director Rabii Lakhlii. Lakhlii has also conveyed his condolences to the families of the victims. However, he refrained from answering any further questions from Moroccan journalists which he considered controversial. When asked by a Moroccan journalist at the scene how the accident happened following recent protests from Moroccans on ONCF delays, Lakhlii refused to comment, saying that it was “out of context.” Three hours after the accident, Mohamed Najib Boulif, the secretary general of transport and Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani commented, sending condolences to the families of the victims. The incident comes amid the final phase of ONCF’s plan to launch Morocco’s high speed train (LGV) between Casablanca and Tangier.

Rabat – While Morocco prides itself on its “humane and responsible” migration policy, a recent Gadem report has dealt a serious blow to Morocco’s immigration record. In a damning report titled “Gratuitous Expulsions,” Gadem, a Moroccan human rights advocacy group focused on migration, accused Morocco of mistreatment and discrimination toward its growing number of sub-Saharan migrants. The report especially focuses on Morocco’s recent “delocalization operations,” part of Morocco’s deal with EU partners to curb immigration to Europe. Gadem reveals, “In the Tangier region alone at least 7,720 migrants, including 174 women and 147 minors, have been forcibly displaced.” Although Morocco has announced major institutional reforms to ease the socio-professional integration of sub-Saharan migrants, “These legal norms were totally sidelined” during displacement patrols, said Gadem President Abderrahman Tlemcani. Tlemcani said that his group’s paper is based on field-work in northern Morocco and intensive interviews with sub-Saharans. “At least 89 people, among them six minors, have been expelled from Moroccan territory between September and October.” The activist group added, “These expulsions often happened in unlawful and very unjust circumstances without any respect [for immigration law].” From “violent arrests” to discrimination and continuous police patrols in northern cities, there is a striking discrepancy between the “dire” reality of migrants and Morocco’s official discourse on migration, the report explained. “All the testimonies we recorded spoke of violence and inhumane treatment,” Camille Denis, a Gadem representative, said at a press conference in Rabat on October 11. According to Gadem’s interviews, police in Tangier and Nador even entered homes to arrest migrants, often subjecting them to “humiliating, inhumane and discriminating” detention conditions. But the Moroccan government has vehemently denied Gadem’s narrative. A government official who spoke to Moroccan outlet H24 said that the expulsions and arrests were needed to curb the migration flow to Europe, but “also to protect migrants.” In their dream to reach Europe by any means, the official explained, migrants “fall prey to human trafficking networks.”

Rabat – What do young Moroccan graduates expect from the labor country’s market? What are their dreams and long-term goals? A recent study conducted by the Casablanca-based EMYLON Business School has interviewed 400 new university graduates and 200 business leaders to find answers. Titled “Professions of Tomorrow,” the study drew from a sample the authors deemed representative of the new forces driving Morocco’s prospective labor market. The study asked participants about their salary expectations, preferred workplace settings in Morocco and aboard, and long-term career plans.
For long-term career plans, most graduates declared they were interested in private businesses and entrepreneurship in high-tech and marketing industries. According to the study, 90 percent plan to have their own businesses at some point. However, graduates hoped to start their careers with a stable employer.
While personal preferences and the wide range of skill sets among the participants resulted in diverging answers, the study found a general inclination among Moroccan graduates to work in multinational companies with branch offices in Morocco (41 percent) or in the big national industries (38 percent). Among the 38 percent hoping to land a position with a national giant, the marketing and service sectors topped young graduates’ preferences.
OCP, the national and global market leader of phosphates, won the majority of the 38 percent (44 percent), followed by Royal Air Maroc (26 percent), and ONCF, the country’s national railway operator (21 percent).
Workplace environment, salary levels, and graduates’ area of study also played a major role in participants’ choices. However, for all those who wanted to work for leading national companies, the study revealed many wish to leave Morocco and look for better opportunities elsewhere. Twenty-five percent of young Moroccans dream of working abroad. And while Europe and North America remain the favorite destinations, there is a growing trend towards Asia.

Ottawa – The political role of the Algerian army continues to be factored into the country’s policy-making decisions since 1962, in accordance with the vision of the juntas. This long process of power consolidation with weak institutions is known as the “mummification completion.” Miriam Lowi  argues that the pre-existing structure of society presents political elites with a variety of choices in which their decision is the most important factor to the reproduction of an authoritarian regime in Algeria, which is “largely unchanged in its makeup and strategy.” By studying the process of state-formation throughout Algeria’s history, stretching from  French colonial rule until the protracted civil war in the early 1990s, and then comparing the Algerian case with five similar oil-exporting states, Lowi showed how oil is not proven to have a causal effect on the robustness of authoritarianism or the weakness of state institutions prevalent in Algeria. Instead, Lowi attributes it to the strategies employed by the political elites to weaken any opposition to the state, including strategies of repression, co-option and manipulation. The goal of the reshuffling of military officers of second order, that is to say medium ranking militaries, is to remove all those who had a connection with the former head of the intelligence service, General Mohamed Madin, known as General Tawfiq. Adding that the recent changes precede the comprehensive structure of the military, as it is in preparation for legislative and local elections next year, before reaching the presidential election in 2019.  These changes are related to the new law that prevents retired soldiers from declaring and engaging in public affairs, referring to the incident of retired general Hussein Ben Hadid, who launched harsh statements against President Bouteflika The Aesthetic Mummification In the late 1980s, dissent against the military regime of President Chadli Bendjedid was threatening the hegemony of the military-politico oligarchy, forcing Bendjedid to call for multi-party elections in 1991. When it became clear that the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) party—who proposed a platform of open markets and privatization rather than having the military dominate in the economy—was going to win the elections, the security forces of Algeria staged a coup d’état against Chadli and violently repressed the FIS in order to maintain power. Both the presidency and the army leadership are keen to safeguard the two sides to ensure a safe passage to the post-President Bouteflika. The influence of Deputy Defense Minister and Army Chief of Staff Ahmed Kayed Saleh can be clearly seen in the reshuffling of military officers. To fulfill the mummification completion, old guards must be kept around. The changes did not affect senior commanders, except the chief of staff of the ground forces; he was compensated by Major General Omar Telmessani, a descendent from the province of Telmessan (the hometown of President Bouteflika).The military has also employed the strategy of co-option to divide and fragment the Islamist and Kabilists movements by exploiting the groups’ fractionalization, weak leadership, and a cult of personality, characteristic of parties such as HAMAS and Ennahda. Since gaining independence from French colonial rule in 1962, political leaders have manipulated rents to uphold the “mythology of the state” and the rhetoric of popular incorporation, while simultaneously maintaining a political and economic oligarchy. The Legal Mummification Lowi puts forth a compelling argument regarding the process of state-formation and political stability in “high growth, development-oriented, oil-exporting countries”  in Oil Wealth and the Poverty of Politics. Lowi contends the more mainstream theoretical framework of the rentier state model, as well as structural functionalism with a qualitative study focusing on the agency of political leaders and the decisions they make at “critical junctures” in history. Lowi dismisses the resources trap argument and the rentier state model which posits that the presence of abundant resources and “rent” is what determines political outcomes. The reshuffling process of military personnel is a result of article 24 of the new amendment. The amendment details punitive provisions, and stipulates that an army officer must comply with “duty of reservation.” This law prosecutes retired military officers before the judiciary in cases of violation of “duty of reservation”, along with the penalty of lowering the rank. The law states that militaries must “comply with the duty of a reservation in every place and in all circumstances and shall refrain from any act or conduct that would prejudice the honour or dignity of the military or violate the authority and reputation of the military.” The rentier state framework is also interested in the political implications of oil and rent. Having vast amounts of rent from oil, leaders “become less accountable to the societies they govern, and more autonomous in their decision-making and behavior.” Lowi rejects the rentier state model, as it fails to “trace casual relationships” and to account for “contradictory trajectories and outcomes.” Instead, oil rents are instrumental to political elites as they repress, co-opt, and manipulate society with these resources to ensure they maintain their hegemony in power. Poverty of Elites Focusing on “critical junctures,” Lowi attributes the instability of Algeria in the last two decades to the oil bust of 1986. This loss of rent led to the coup d’état in 1992, after which the military leaders fiercely repressed former FIS members and new Islamic fighters, even funding anti-Islamist civilian militias. The violent repression only increased the ranks of Islamist fighters from 2,000 to 4,000 in 1993, and to 27,000 by 1995 . Changing tactics, the political elites attempted to co-opt the already fragmented and polarized factions within society. They funded and incorporated Islamist parties, as well as granting amnesty to former guerilla through a Peace and Reconciliation process, encouraging Algerians to “forgive and forget.” Through co-option, the opposition was divided and prevented from mass mobilization. With a $20 billion loan from the IMF in 1994, the state was able to keep clientele networks greased and maintain the façade of a functioning, redistributive state. As oil prices steadily increased in the 2000s, political leaders had more rent with which to manipulate public opinion with and mitigate opposition. Lowi concludes that the decisions made by Presidents Zeroual and, subsequently, Bouteflika in the critical juncture of the Algerian civil war were integral to the re-emergence of the Algerian state. Pre-Existing Structural Contexts The agency of powerful political actors is a constant qualitative variable which is often neglected, and Lowi’s argument is a necessary but insufficient analysis of the reemergence of the Algerian state. More than anything, exogenous structural forces well beyond the agency of Algerian elites have produced fertile conditions for the reproduction of a military regime. Deep social cleavages in Algerian society have their roots in a French colonial past, which lasted over 130 years. The French institutionalized a system of legal discrimination in civil, fiscal, juridical, and political domains, favoring the Jews and Kabilists over the Arab population. This led to the polarization and atomization of power centers among the people. “The reliance on force, the denial and diversity, and the silencing of debate” were part of political life even before the independence in 1962 and nurtured the future militarism of the state . More recently, during the instability incurred from the oil bust of 1986, the Algerian leadership has benefited immensely from favorable international conditions, which has allowed the reconsolidation of power and the re-emergence of Algeria’s authoritarian state. Without the $20 billion loan from the IMF in 1994, the state would have been unable to maintain clientele networks and repress opposition and could have easily lost control to Islamist guerillas . However, pre-existing structural forces outside of the elites’ agency, such as a history of colonial rule with well established institutions, increasing prices for oil, and financial and political support from international actors, has all contributed to the mummification of the a military regime. To stay in power, to divert the attention and to remain mummified, the military invented the Polisario. The Invention of Polisario Employing a discourse analysis as a method of studying how and why former President Boumadyane invented the idea of Polisario helps us decipher the first order denotation and second order connotation. By a clear decoding of Boumadyane speeches that are now easily to access, we discover that false propaganda on self-determination is a pretext to envision an expansion into the Moroccan Sahara.  The militia of the so-called Polisario is nothing but a manufactured product of the military regime in Algiers. The analysis of Ferdinand de Saussure, the Swiss linguist, suggests here that president Boumadyane’s speeches contained signifier of a war over the land, the signified reveals here that this war is between two entities. This is at the level of denotation. At the level of connotation, we observe that Boumadyane presents the discourse of “war is evil between brothers.” Rolland Barthes unveiled the MYTH that Boumadyane was trying to instate Jamal Abdennacer’s plan to overthrow all the monarchies in the MENA region. Unable to fulfill his ambitions to create chaos in Morocco since the 60s, the only remaining alternative was to then create Polisario Through Lowi’s qualitative approach to explaining the state-building process and authoritarianism in Algeria is contrary to the popular framework of the resource and rentier state models, she dismisses oil as a determining factor in political outcomes and regimes types. Instead, it is the way in which leaders employ these rents which ensures the survival of the regime. By focusing her research on “critical junctures” in Algeria’s history, Lowi was able to isolate the agency and behaviour of political elites and found that they were crucially important to the re-emergence of an authoritarian regime after years of civil war in the 1990s. The process of maintenance of the military regime has now reached its final stage of mummification.

Rabat – Russian UFC champion Khabib Nurmagomedov has called out the undefeated American boxer Floyd Mayweather to a boxing fight.    Nurmagomedov, an MMA fighter, is not a boxer. With both undefeated, however, Nurmagomedov wants to achieve what Conor McGregor failed to achieve. Nurmagomedov, with 27 wins and 0 defeats, beat McGregor in the UFC 229 in Las Vegas on October 7, forcing him to tap out.  McGregor fought the 12-time world champion, Mayweather, in a match with one of biggest prizes in history. Mayweather won the battle in the 10th round. “Let’s go Floyd. We have to fight now,” said Nurmagomedov, smiling, in an Instagram video posted by the CEO of Mayweather Promotions, Leonard Ellerbe. “50-0 versus 27-0, two guys never never like lose. Let’s go, why not? Because, in the jungle only one king. Of course, I’m the king. Because, he cannot drop McGregor but I drop him easily. That’s why, let’s go.” Mayweather, 41, retired from boxing after beating McGregor in August 2017. However, he announced he will come out of retirement to fight Manny Pacquiao in a rematch later this year.

Rabat – Morocco has agreed to hand over French national  Thomas Gallay, whom Morocco sentenced in 2016 for his involvement in terrorism-related crimes. A statement from the Moroccan Ministry of Justice said on Monday that Morocco has responded favorably to a direct request made by French President Emmanuel Macron to transfer Georges to his country to complete his prison sentence. Morocco approved the request after fulfilling all legal conditions, in accordance with Morocco’s law governing judicial cooperation with foreign countries. Read Also: Mother Calls for Macron to Repatriate Imprisoned French Son from Morocco The agreement also falls within a judicial convention concluded between the two countries. Morocco’s security forces arrested the French national for his suspected ties with a terror group of nine suspects, who were planning to commit crimes to undermine public safety. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) a Rabat court had sentenced the French national to six years in prison. The criminal division of the Court of Appeal later reduced the sentence to four years. Police arrested the 37-year-old in the Moroccan coastal city of Essaouira. Gallay’s mother, Beatrice Gallay, called on Macron to bring her son home to France. In response, Macron promised to intervene and try to repatriate him. Gallay’s mother stood daily in front of Macron’s presidential residence, holding a banner reading “Help Thomas” until she caught the president’s attention. The court convicted Gallay of financing terrorism. But his mother accused Moroccan police of forcing her son to sign a false confession written in Arabic which he did not understand. She claimed that he only gave “€70 to an acquaintance” rather than to a terrorist cell.

By Mohamed Hikal Rabat – Situated near Taroudant, 80 kilometers east of Agadir, Claudio Bravo Palace stands gloriously as another must-see wonder in Morocco. Born November 8, 1936, in Chile, Claudio Bravo lived in Spain, Tangier, and Marrakech, for some time before he finally settled in Taroudant in 1972. Claudio Bravo had a special love for Morocco and Taroudant in particular. He loved the city’s colors and people. They provided all the inspiration he needed as an artist fond of painting sceneries and portraits.  Bravo’s paintings have travelled the world to be exhibited in the US, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Philippines, Japan, and so many others. Both Bravo’s sense of art and Moroccan craftsmen’s talent combined to bring his mansion into existence. The impressive mansion was Bravo’s home and studio where he spent his most enjoyable moments side by side with the nature he loved and cherished.  The palace has become a fabulous museum that attracts hundreds of tourists and visitors. The museum has added to Taroudant’s tourism potential. It is especially a popular destination for art and museum lovers.  The architecture, furniture, paintings, colors, and spirit of the unique artist all add an exceptional flavor to the city. Bravo’s visit to Marrakech was behind his decision to make a copy of the breathtaking Menara gardens as part of his property. In addition to the palace’s amazing gardens, silverware, and crystal objects, the palace boasts original Egyptian statues and Roman emperors’ busts. Bravo died June 4, 2011, and was laid to rest in the mausoleum he had prepared beforehand. Just as he had lived surrounded by his works, his body rests among a collection of some of his loveliest paintings in his mausoleum.

Rabat- Morocco’s transcendental Gnawa music will find an echo at a 2019 festival in Alexandria, Virginia, which will showcase Morocco’s cultural heritage. Sponsored by the Moroccan American Network with the support of Audio Visual Actions, Inc, the Moroccan exhibit will be on display March 30-31, 2019. The festival will be held in Old Town Alexandria,  just minutes across the Potomac from Washington, D.C.  The festival will show many features of Moroccan culture, from food, arts and crafts, to music, particularly the spiritual Gnaoua genre of music, combining ritual poetry and dance. With roots in the Arab slave trade of sub-Saharan Africans who were trafficked throughout what is modern-day Morocco and Algeria during the 11th century, Gnawa music was believed to exorcise people possessed by demons. Gnaoua has thrived in the modern day, becoming the most popular North African music genre, fusing with the genres of jazz and blues and playing across Europe and the Americas. Renowned Moroccan Gnaoua musician Hassan Hakmoun will perform a live Gnaoua show at the closing of the festival. A caftan fashion show is also expected during the event. Caftans were originally worn by Ottoman sultans, but due to the Ottoman Empire’s strong global influence, many cultures adopted them, especially in North and West Africa. Caftans reached Morocco after they spread through Andalusia in Spain, which first adopted them in the 9th century. Morocco later refashioned and added its unique touch to the caftan, which is now known as the “Moroccan caftan.” Today, caftans are embraced in the Arabic world of fashion and are primarily worn by women at special events, like weddings. Several panel discussions related to business opportunities will also take center stage. On March 29, 2019, in Washington, D.C., the Moroccan American Network, in collaboration with AV actions, will host Morocco Day’s fourth CEO summit to enhance small business opportunities from the US to Africa with a focus on the southern regions of Morocco. Marrakech will be the “guest of honor” at the symposium, entitled: “Small Business Matters – US Small Business Leadership,” which aims to help small business companies and facilitate the exchange of “ideas focusing on growing small business and investment opportunities on the continent of Africa.” Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, the U.S. Black Chamber of Commerce, think tank experts, academics, and business leaders will all take part in the summit. The CEO of AV Actions and president of the Moroccan American Network, Mohamed El Hajjam, stated: “We want to highlight opportunities for greater collaboration and exchange of ideas, promoting foreign investment and economic growth.”  He promised that the event “will be engaging in dialogue and exchange of ideas for macro-opportunities, such as investments, as well as micro-opportunities, in areas such as infrastructure and health.”   Additionally, on March 31, 2019, in Washington, D.C., the Moroccan American Network’s first “Friendship Golf Tournament” will bring Moroccan and American leaders, entrepreneurs, and business owners together. The Moroccan American Network serves as a platform for “strengthening economic ties between Morocco and the U.S., and promoting small business,” according to El Hajjam. The network strives to educate the American public, US media, and US government officials about business and investment opportunities in Morocco through dialogue, forums, and events.  Beyond education, the network connects American and African small business and media communities to facilitate mutual growth and collaboration.

Rabat – The Atlas Lions failed to deliver in their game against Comoros Saturday after several ecstatic months. Lionized as the golden generation of Moroccan football and hailed for their technical genius and defensive discipline, the Moroccan national team was among the few teams whose early exit at the World Cup was thought of as a misfortune and poor refereeing. “Eliminated but proud,” fans said after the Russia 2018 fiasco. “They deserved better than the one point that they collected in three matches,” specialists concurred. Morocco came out of its World Cup adventure as one of the most promising African sides, with huge potential to shine on the continental level for years to come. On Saturday night, however, as Morocco’s Atlas Lions took on Comoros’s Coelacanths, Herve Renard’s once brilliant and technically-gifted squad was unrecognizable at best, wasteful and shambolic at worst.
Morocco won 1-0 in the end, after Ali Lemghaifry, the Mauritanian referee, “gifted” the Lions a late-minute penalty. Overconfidence and mediocre performance “As you said, this is not one of the best African footballing nations,” Herve Renard said in a pre-match press conference, referring to the Comoros team. The tone and mild words indicated a relaxed attitude before a slight challenge, an encounter with an opponent that does not seem to matter much. The Frenchman’s words were dismissive throughout. He went on to speak not of the two immediate against Comoros, but of hosting Cameroon, the group B leader, whom Morocco will play on November 16. But after 90 minutes of tense challenges from a team everyone seemed to have overlooked, Renard was the first to see the error of his ways. He conceded that his side was amateurish, lacking drive and looking like a C level team that bore no resemblance to the reborn and joy-inspiring squad the Moroccan football team has become under his two-year tenure. “We were very bad, and we only won by a lucky twist of fate. My thanks go to the public that kept on supporting us despite the boys’ mediocre performance. Tonight, our playing style was more of kick and run than of football.” ‘Unfair refereeing’ and brave ‘Comoros’ It took an entire 90 minutes of suffering for the Atlas Lions to beat “this small nation in the Indian Ocean,” Moroccan outlet le 360 wrote. It explained that had luck and the gods of the game not been more complacent toward Morocco, Comoros’s organization and better performance could have easily gotten the better of the North African Lions. Putting in a dose of self-flagellation, Al Akhbar, another Moroccan outlet, headlined that the Moon Island—a translation of Comoros—totally eclipsed the Moroccan sun in the course of a 90-minute hard-fought battle. Seemingly more disappointed, others rejected the general mood of self-flagellation, unfilled expectations, and misused potential. For them, the Morocco squad was neither more technical nor lucky at the end: It won because of bad refereeing that on many occasions favored Morocco.
Taking to Twitter yesterday, former Atlas Lion Abdeslam Ouaddou fumed at the “distressing” level of refereeing in African football. Although the challenge on Achraf Hakimi inside the Comoros penalty box was “a logical penalty,” he said, the refereeing was one-sided and “partial.” “I hate injustice,” the ex-Lion concluded. The second head-to-head between the two teams is to be played tomorrow in Comoros at 1 p.m. Moroccan time, as Morocco looks to secure its qualifying chances before hosting leader Cameroon in a month’s time. But judging from both squads’ performances on Saturday night, the Atlas Lions will need a major technical reshuffling to hope to convincingly beat their hosts.

By Josh Babb Rabat – Further pressure on Saudi Arabia to explain the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi has left the kingdom feeling increasingly isolated.  Saudi Arabia, in response to increasing international and financial pressure to explain the disappearance of missing dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, is threatening severe retaliation to any possible sanctions.  Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Saudi Arabia’s direction under Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, was last seen entering the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul on October 2, while his fiancee waited outside. He has not been seen or heard from since. On October 6, reports emerged that the Turkish authorities suspected Saudi Arabia killed Khashoggi inside the consulate. Some even speculated that Khashoggi had recorded part of the murder on his Apple Watch. Khashoggi’s fiancee Hatice Cengiz wrote An article in the Washington Post on October 9 pleading with President Trump to fully investigate the case. Jamal Khashoggi was a regular contributor to the Post.

The Washington Post reported last week that US senators are calling on President Trump to impose sanctions if Saudi Arabia is found responsible for Khashoggi’s suspected murder.  Saudi Arabia to lower oil production?  A press release issued by the government-owned Saudi Press Agency states, “The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether by threatening to impose economic sanctions, using political pressures or repeating false accusations.” This statement came as the Saudi stock exchange opened on Sunday with stocks plunging as much as 7 percent throughout the day’s trading. In an opinion piece published on Saudi Arabia’s state-run Al Arabiya English, Turki Aldakhil elaborated further on what Saudi Arabia’s response could look like: “If the price of oil reaching $80 angered President Trump, no one should rule out the price jumping to $100, or $200, or even double that figure.” The foreign ministers of France, Germany and the UK released a joint statement on Sunday, October 14,calling for a credible investigation into Khashoggi’s disappearance to identify those bearing responsibility and ensure they are held to account.

Rabat – Morocco is changing its energy strategy by focusing on liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a cleaner and more cost-efficient source of energy.  The most recent development in Morocco’s energy sector is an LNG project near Casablanca. The National Office for Electricity and Water (ONEE) launched a tender for the $4.5 billion LNG import terminal project on October 1, according to Minister of Energy Aziz Rebbah. The project, according to an analyst firm Fitch Solutions, will be set in the Jorf Lafsar port in El Jadida province, near Casablanca, and will supply the industries based in the region. Read Also: Natural Gas Discovered in Morocco’s Ksar El Kebir The jetty, regasification terminal, and 400-kilometer pipeline are expected to be complete by 2025. Morocco intends to use the facility to import up to 7 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the context of the national gas-to-power initiative.  The main goal of the port will be to sustain the rapid growth of electricity use and demand in Morocco. According to Fitch Solutions’ estimations, the annual growth in electricity generation will be 5.5 percent over 2017-2027. Morocco also aims to use cleaner energy with natural gas. Coal generate 58 percent Of Morocco’s total electricity and oil generates 5.5 percent.  In parallel to the import facility, the gas-to-power plan involves the construction of two power plants in Jorf Lafsar and two others in the coastal city of Kenitra, near Rabat, with a total capacity of 2,400 megawatts. Read Also: Gas Exploration Company May Have Found Natural Gas in Morocco Morocco is aiming to switching to a cleaner power mix and to significantly increase its renewable energy use. The country intends to make renewables a 52 percent share of power supply by 2030 and gas a 23 percent share.  New source of natural gas The gas-to-power plan will not only allow Morocco to efficiently adapt to the increasing needs of its population and growing economy, but it will also allow it to decrease the costs of power. It will also reduce Morocco’s dependence on Algerian oil.  Morocco remains the largest importer of oil in North Africa and is bounded by a 10-year contract with Sonatrach in Algeria. The contract is soon to be renewed following a joint declaration on October 2 about talks on the deal.  Morocco has decreased its imports of Algerian oil over recent years. Morocco anticipates being more energy independent, especially after the UK exploration company Sound Energy discovered natural gas in Tendrara, eastern Morocco.  The discovery, according to Sound Energy, contains up to 31 trillion cubic feet of gas. When production begins, it could turn the country into a net gas exporter. The UK company expects that production will begin in 2020 at an average production rate of 60 million cubic feet per day over a 10 year period. There is also a plan to construct a pipeline connecting the Tendrara field and the Gas-Maghreb-Europe pipeline from northern Morocco to Spain.  The discovery of natural gas in Morocco and the gas-to-power projects could bring more stability to Morocco as Algerian oil exports have recently deteriorated and are uncertain. Morocco also now has more leverage in negotiating the Sonatrach deal.

Rabat – Morocco’s security forces have aborted approximately 65,000 irregular migration attempts annually since 2016. The number has more than doubled from an average of 32,000 annually between 2003 and 2015 to nearly 65,000 since 2016. The new statistics were shared by Khalid Zerouali, governor and director of immigration and border surveillance, in an interview with Jeune Afrique. Zerouali’s interview comes at a sensitive time as irregular migration has put pressure on the government to find a concrete solution to fight trafficking networks. Zerouali also spoke about Moroccan-Spanish security cooperation, saying that the regular meetings of their migration group have enabled the two countries to harmonize their analysis matrices and coordinate their actions to fight irregular migration and promote legal channels of migration. Read Also: EU Commission Wants More Security Cooperation with Morocco Against Undocumented Immigration Morocco and Spain created the migration group in 2003. Zerouali also recalled recent meetings with Morocco’s Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit and European Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos.  He said that the meetings ushered in a new era of renewed cooperation between Morocco and the EU in border control and fighting migration networks. He also said that the “contours of this cooperation” are “being finalized by the experts of both parties.” Zerouali recalled a statement from Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, who expressed Morocco’s refusal to host migrant centers for Europe. Zerouali said, “This refusal is also consistent with our acceptance of the notion of shared responsibility.” In recent months, Morocco has made its position clear on migration centers. Several officials explained that migrant centers would only be a temporary solution that would fail to solve the overall issue. Read Also: Morocco Asks Spain for €60 Million to Fight Undocumented Migration On October 4, Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said that creating reception centers for migrants is only Europe’s attempt to externalize its migration challenges. “We need a long-term solution and not an immediate economic solution.” El Khalfi asserted that reception centers would run counter to human rights, and Morocco could not agree to be involved.

He said they are becoming modern and are “not dry lands inhabited by Touaregs, with dunes as the only natural landscape.”  The exhibit exposed cultural aspects like “tbourida” (traditional horse riding scenes) and festivals like the Tan Tan festival. The pictures also display the region’s flora and fauna and the Sahrawi people and their traditions. The exhibit also emphasized the role of women in the development of the region. Doulfikar visited the region many times to take his pictures. He intends to publish a book compiling all his work on the region to fight stereotypes.

Rabat- Morocco signed a triangular memorandum with South Korea and other African countries on automotive vocational training Friday in Rabat.  Saaid Amzazi, Moroccan minister of education and vocational training, and the South Korean ambassador to Morocco, Seong-Deok Yun, presided over the signing of the memorandum on Friday, in Rabat, according to state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press. The meeting focused on developing the African automotive sector by training managers in Morocco, Senegal, Cameroon, Tunisia, and Côte d’Ivoire.  The agreement will allow 53 Moroccan and other African managers and trainers in the automotive industry to receive a four years vocational training by South Korean experts in both Morocco and South Korea. The cooperation, in addition to enhancing the African automotive industry, will strengthen the ties between Morocco, South Korea, and other African countries.  Amzazi noted that partnership with South Korea gave birth to the public-private project of the Automobile Professions Training Institute of Casablanca (IFMIAC) which serves as a model for the African automobile industry.  Yun also pointed out South Korean interest in cooperating with Morocco as a gateway to Africa and the unique experience that IFMIAC represents for the two countries.  Morocco and South Korea have recently sought to further enhance their bilateral relations and economic cooperation during a meeting in late August between Habib El Malki, Morocco’s speaker of the House of Representatives, and Lee Ju-Young, deputy speaker of South Korea’s National Assembly.  The meeting sought to create new bilateral opportunities in the automotive, renewable energies, and tourism sectors.  In an effort to diversify its trade, Morocco is expected to increase cooperation with South Korea, which now represents only 0.9 percent of all Moroccan trade according to Mohammed Tawfik Mouline, director general of the Royal Institute for Strategic Studies (IRES).  The memorandum comes as Morocco is shifting its educational approach to increase and improve its vocational trainings at the direction of King Mohammed VI.  On October 2, the King presided over a session with the education committee, urging it to develop more vocational training centers and diversify the training programs to include sectors with high economic potential.  Morocco has recently signed an agreement with Bulgaria on training in diplomacy and international relations, and held talks with Malaysia on the expansion of an academic and vocational training partnership.

Rabat – The number of Moroccan migrants who sought asylum in Spain has increased from 531 in 2017 to 765 in 2018. Spanish news outlet El Pais reported that 40 Moroccan migrants, who arrived in the Spanish port of Motril on Monday, applied for asylum. Spanish police told El Pais that the 40 Moroccans are a group of activists who were involved in Rif protests, which took place in 2016 and 2017 after the death of Mouhcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was killed in a garbage truck. Spain, according to El Pais, cannot deport the activists who were given the right to stay in Spain for one month until they complete the primary procedures of their asylum requests. Traditionally, undocumented migrants from Morocco and Algeria are returned home in accordance with bilateral agreements signed between Spain and the two Maghreb countries. Moroccan immigrants stand no chance to qualify for asylum status in Spain. On October 3, Consuelo Rumi, Secretary of State for Migration in the Ministry of Labor, Migration and Social Security, Morocco for a working visit. After her meetings with Moroccan officials, Rumi explained that Moroccans are not eligible for political asylum. She said that Moroccan nationals’ applications for political asylum are generally rejected because Spain does not view Moroccans migrants as refugees. Addressing a message to would-be immigrants, the Spanish official said that the European dream is a lie. “Emigration is not the solution because the journey of irregular migrants often ends badly,” she said. An anonymous source from the Spanish ministry of interior was quoted by El Pais as saying that the number of Moroccans who sought asylum increased by 44 percent this year (765 requests). Spain’s Ministry of Interior said earlier this year that Moroccan nationals make up the highest number of the 38,000 migrants believed to have entered Spain in 2018. El Pais’ article about Moroccan asylum seekers come at a time when Morocco and Spain are redoubling their efforts to stem the arrival of undocumented immigrants to Spanish costs.

Rabat – The disappearance Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is still making international headlines. Turkish newspaper Sabah reported that Jamal Khashoggi, who went missing for more than a week now, recorded his murder and torture through an Apple Watch. Quoting the newspaper, the Independent reported that the watch had synced with the journalist’s phone, which he left with his fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, outside Saudi consulate in Istanbul. A footage taken by camera surveillance outside the consulate shows the journalist entering the consulate on October 2, but no video showed him leaving. In an interview with CBS, US President Donald Trump promised “severe punishment” if Saudi Arabia is involved in the alleged murder of the journalist. Turkish officials believe that the journalist was killed by a “hit squad.” Saudi Arabia denied its involvement in the disappearance of the journalist. Saudi Arabia is under international pressure with many foreign officials and businssemen expected to boycott an international business summit scheduled to take place in the coming days in Saudi Arabia. BBC said that the US and UK are considering to boycott the conference as well amid the disappearance of the journalist. BBC also quoted diplomatic sources who said that “the US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox might not attend the event, which is being hosted by the kingdom’s Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman to promote his reform agenda.” Khashoggi was known for his vocal criticism of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s foreign policy decisions towards Qatar, Canada, and the war in Yemen, as well as his crackdown against dissenting voices in Saudi Arabia. In March, the Saudi journalist questioned the freedom of the press in Saudi Arabia and criticized the Saudi Crown Prince for his crackdown on dissent. The self-exiled Saudi journalist said, “Now nobody will dare to speak and criticize the reform … It would be much better for him to allow a breathing space for critics, for Saudi intellectuals, Saudi writers, Saudi media to debate.”

Rabat – Spanish police arrested the four leaders of a criminal network helping undocumented Algerians to cross to Spain using go-fasts, on Saturday.    The network was selecting potential migrants from the Algerian people of the Temporary Living Centre for Migrants (CETI) in the Spanish enclave of Ceuta in northern Morocco, according to state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).  The Spanish police also seized over € 10,000 along with mobile phones, cameras, documents, and weapons.  The criminal network with one of the most dangerous criminal in Ceuta, ‘El Rubio’, at its head, charged 2,000 euros per person and made over € 26,000 of benefits for each trip.   The investigation started five months ago after the police found crafts used to transport Algerians to Algeciras, south of Spain. The network was involved in human trafficking because it brought more benefits.  This arrest comes on the heels of the unprecedented increase of undocumented immigrants in the Mediterranean, which puts pressure on both Spain and Morocco.  Both countries have increased their efforts in stopping the undocumented migration these past months. Morocco’s General Directorate of National Safety (DGSN) dismantled a criminal network of the same kind on Wednesday in Tangier, North of Morocco.  On Saturday, the DGSN also arrested six individuals involved in organizing undocumented migration operations targeting Sub-Saharan Africans and seized equipment in Nador, in the Rif region northern Morocco.

Rabat – A Soulless and goalless first half, to say the least. For some measure of fairness though, it is true that the first 45 minutes of the Morocco vs. Comoros game did have exciting moments to it. But in football, as in “real life,” excitement amounts to little if the end product is lacking in efficiency and urge. Morocco had the double advantage of playing at home and—at least on paper and according to FIFA rankings—being the better team of the evening. And so, in that complacent mindset of favorites, as they often tend to think that victory is already acquired, the Atlas Lions’ performance for the 45th minutes was in stark contrast with the quality and drive that Moroccans have come to expect of a squad that has evinced first rate footballing prowess in the past months. Perhaps it is that the revolt of underdogs that we witnessed in this year’s World Cup in Russia is now having repercussions in African football. Major betting websites and commentators predicted an easy, if not comfortable, win for Morocco. But Comoros, as their coach had warned in the pre-match interview, had their own agenda. They had not come to have a view of Casablancan nightlife. They came to keep their qualifying chances alive. And so Morocco’s on-paper superiority was nowhere to be seen as Comoros showed an outstanding morale and an almost jarring level of composure and passing accuracy. Of the few sparkling moments of the first half, there was Achraf Hakimi’s flying cross inside the Comoros box at the sixth minute. Despite the goalkeeping blunder from Ali Amhada, the Comoros shot keeper, there was no Moroccan shirt to collect the ball. At which point, the underdog visitors, realizing that their superior-looking hosts were not in their good day, started showing some signs of threats. They tested Morocco’s defense and midfield, relentlessly exposing the Atlas Lions’ weak defensive line through the unending runs and spectacular—if somewhat ineffective—balls from Selemani, the Comoros’ starring figure for the evening. Perhaps in an interlude to a better display, to a show of more offensive and world-class-looking in the second half, Moroccans looked more radiant as the game progressed. And, for both teams, the next 45 minutes did see the footballing level raised to a higher caliber, with signs of maturity and exquisite team-play on both sides. But, again, it was the visiting side that had a sharper tone in the first minutes of that outrageously good second half. Unstoppable in his runs, clever in his moves, and endowed with immense technical prowess, Selemani, him again, put Hervé’s side in danger whenever he touched the ball. Having outrun Morocco’s defense just five minutes into the second half, the Comoros number 7’s ball was magisterially saved by Munir, Morocco’s goalkeeper, who had not been seriously tested in the match. Morocco’s reply came 3 minutes later at the 54th minute, sharper and more rousing than the opportunity that the visitors had just missed. Served inside the opposing box, Nordin Amrabat—who else could it have possibly been?— in a moment of godly inspiration, controlled the ball and launched a wonderful turning-strike, forcing the Comoros keeper to produce an equally divine save. The keeper would have the opportunity, just a minute later, to put in another spectacular goalkeeping display. Nabil Dirar’s long-range shot, compact and projectile-like, found Ali Ahamada in its way, postponing Moroccan’s elation. By minute 65, as Comoros recollected some bits of energy to outclass Morocco in the midfield and on the flanks, the crowd at Mohammed V stadium erupted, urging a complacent and slightly uninspired Moroccan squad to put in more efforts. These shouts, it would seem moments later into the game, reminded Renard’s boys of the importance of collecting the three points needed to keep qualification hopes alive the 2019 African Cup of Nations. And so, as if direct response to the public’s urging and shouting, as if in a bid to keep the trust and admiration of the now rapturous home crowd, Hervé’s boys answered in kind. Animating the flanks, reviving the previously placid midfield-flanks-attacking line connection, a trademark of Morocco’s display at this year’s World Cup, the Atlas Lions started giving their visitors a tough time. But the ten minutes of regained urgency proved insufficient to disarm a confident and well-organized opposition. As Morocco pushed forward, buoyed up by an indefatigable Amrabat and a seemingly resurrected Achraf Hakimi, Comoros—especially its shot keeper—defended with impeccable assurance. Beleaguered and constantly threatened, Comoros shifted its system, now choosing to defend and stun Morocco on counterattacks with Selemani’s irresistible runs. There followed an outpouring of Moroccan crosses, an abundance of Amrabat heroics, but to no avail to give the now rousing public at Mohammed V stadium the goal they so badly needed. By minute 89, the game looked like it was going to end in a goalless draw. Comoros resisted well, attacked brilliantly, hitting Morocco with a class that few could have expected from a side of their standing. When the referee pointed to the Comoros penalty area at the 95th minute after a challenge on Achraf Hakimi, the visitor’s disappointment was palpable, as was Morocco’s elation. Some can be forgiven for thinking that Comoros deserved more than the result they got. That Morocco did not deserve to win. But, would that really matter now? Because in the end, the gods of football, in a dramatic turn of events, came to Morocco’s rescue, handing them a late-minute goal to end a match in which they had been uncharacteristically mediocre.

New York  –  Qatar on Thursday called before the 4th Committee of the United Nations General Assembly to reach a final settlement of the Western Sahara issue in the framework of dialogue and negotiation, so as to guarantee the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco. Speaking at the Committee’s general debate, Qatar’s representative commended the efforts made to reach consensus in the political process initiated in 2007 under the auspices of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy for the implementation of the resolutions of the Security Council in order to ensure the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco. In this regard, he recalled the declaration of the Summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council and Morocco, which noted that Morocco’s autonomy plan is the basis for any solution to this regional conflict. He underlined the need for the General Assembly to support efforts to complete the political process and to preserve the consensual nature of the resolution to be considered by the 4th Committee in this regard. He said that a political solution to this long-standing conflict “will have positive repercussions on the strengthening of cooperation between the countries of the region and will strengthen stability and security in general”.

Rabat – Coach Herve Renard has said Morocco’s team players need to be committed in their match against Comoros Saturday in Casablanca. Morocco’s team players should not underestimate Comoros’ players and “take the game from the right angle,” Morocco’s team coach Renard said Friday at a pre-match press conference at Mohammed V Stadium in Casablanca. Morocco will play against Comoros Saturday, October 13,at 7 p.m. local time at Mohammed V Stadium in Casablanca. The match will be played on the sidelines of the third round of the qualifiers of the CAN 2019.  The return match will take place on October 16 at Said Mohamed Sheikh International Stadium in Mitsamiouli, Comoros at 3 p.m. local time. “We must work as best as possible to gain the six points against Comoros” before November to take the revenge” for the 1-0 defeat against Cameroon and the  return match against Malawi in March. Morocco won 3-0 over Malawi on September 8. Renard also asked the Moroccan team’s fans to support their players in today’s match. Few thousands fans attended the match against Malawi on September 6.  “I ask the public to come and cheer for the Atlas Lions against Comoros. I want the atmosphere to be like the one we had in Russia,” Renard said.

Rabat- Morocco’s BNPJ has arrested six individuals linked to a migration network in Nador, the capital of the northern Rif region. The National Brigade of the Judicial Police (BNPJ) and security forces in Nador arrested five Moroccans and one Senegalese national. The six are suspected of organizing undocumented migration, reported the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) on Saturday. Following the arrest, security forces seized equipment used for irregular emigration: safety jackets, 5 zodiacs, 3 cars, a GPS, electronic devices for communication,  104 passports of various nationalities, bank receipts, and cash. The arrest led to the interception of 19 irregular migrants from sub-Saharan countries, including seven women. According to DGSN, members of the criminal network lured sub-Saharans into crossing the sea only to abandon them in makeshift and inflatable boats. The network would then urge Spain to help the migrants. Earlier this week, DGSN dismantled a similar migration network, arresting 19 migrants, 1 intermediary, and 3 alleged organizers. The police also seized their equipment: a seven-meter zodiac, two paddles, one engine, and five safety jackets. The arrests have come at a time of increasing irregular migration attempts which have pressured the navy into using controversially aggressive measures to fight the phenomenon. On Wednesday, the royal navy fired on a “hostile” migrant boat, injuring 16-year-old Ilyas Amrani. On September 25, the navy, in another attempt to intercept a “hostile” migrant boat, shot and killed 20-year-old Hayat Belkacem, and injured Lahbib (26), Hamza (25), and Mouad (23).

Rabat- Every day, we are bombarded with vast amounts of information from countless sources. But how do we know whether that information is the truth? The glut of information we daily get from television, the radio, internet ads, cell phone pop-up notifications, and street billboards seems to dominate our society. It cultivates stress and creates confusion on what is wrong and what is right. To find truth, we need to conduct research while the stream of information, both real and “fake,” rushes on 24/7. Receiving masses of information daily does not guarantee our ability to determine accuracy or validity. Indeed, people are increasingly vulnerable to misinformation despite our growing ability to access information. The availability, age, and frequency of information does not imply its accuracy and usefulness. Information is only useful if it is accurate. If you trace a social network timeline you will be confronted by numerous stories shared and re-shared. The stories feature people and events grabbing the attention of the masses. Information keeps circulating on the internet and gets older even as it gets more shares. We usually gravitate toward shocking headlines and stories—the basic ingredients for news agencies. And no wonder, the news industry revolves around gaining followers and clicks. No matter how old the information becomes, its accuracy remains questionable. This is what we have learned from history.  A few days ago, someone—probably a news agent—posted a Facebook ad about a missing girl. She had left home and disappeared, the story went. The reporter wrote a story full of assumptions and rumors about why the girl left home. Readers ate it up, and kept sharing the ad to help her family find her. A few hours later, the girl was found and returned home, yet the ad kept circulating. Though she was no longer missing, it was re-shared for several days. Another historical example is that of Hiroo Onoda, a Japanese intelligence officer in the Philippines. He fought for 29 years after the end of World War II, hiding, fighting, and killing in the jungles. He either was not informed or did not believe the war was over. When people operate on outdated information, they can make terrible mistakes, playing on the stage of history. Our knowledge usually comes from our life experiences with four sources of authority: History or common knowledge, “credentialed” authority, common sense and intuition, and science. Many beliefs that have circulated for awhile become common knowledge simply because they were long-standing, enduring, and popular. (You know common knowledge said the earth was flat, right?) The masses tend to take such ready-made assertions for granted without investigation or questioning. When we hear the same thing over and over, we eventually believe there is some truth in it. Local myths and legends, Tshering Cigay Dorji argues “give us insights into local history and beliefs. People get a sense of where they come from and where they belong from the local legends. The legends behind place names help people understand the history of their place even though the legends may not be totally true.” In a nutshell, a legend, that mythical or semi-mythical socio-historical construct, establishes itself as a popular “fact.” It grows in age and gains sympathy and consensus for its socio-cultural, ideological, economic, or political income. We also tend to believe certain experts. We have a predisposition and willingness to trust experts when looking for assertions about our daily questions. The credentialled authority of an expert in society exercises a decisive power over individuals’ beliefs, choices, and decisions. Such authorities play a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and its perceptions of reality. We uncritically accept doctors’ prescriptions, views, and advice, despite their vulnerability to mistakes and medical errors. We feel secure in food quality if it has been approved by food and health authorities. Very few of us would question the accuracy of a story if broadcast by the dominant governmental news channel. In short, the formal authoritative knowledge of experts leaves no space for the layman to scrutinize its accuracy. Indeed, we feel comfortable and content when we defer to our formal sources of authoritative knowledge. Third, we trust common sense and intuition. Common sense is the “sound” practical judgement based on our own personal experiences and what “most” people think is true. When confronted by compelling real-life situations in which we have no real knowledge or expertise, we naturally resort to the alleged certainty that common sense makes good sense. Owing to such “direct knowledge,” we fall prey to the limits of our insufficient, factually inaccurate, or problematic personal experiences. Likewise, the so-called intuition guides some of us to make immediate conclusions. We have prejudices about truth without any conscious reasoning, practical process, or factual clear-cut evidence. Such a belief in the ability to acquire instant knowledge based on gut feelings and unexplained hunches is risky. It is as risky and possesses us as much as authoritative knowledge.  But intuition as a human feeling and innate cognitive experience raises unanswered reasonable questions about the nature of human knowledge and the limits of human perception, emotions, and intelligence. Finally, the most trustworthy source of knowledge is science. Research using the scientific method is a formal, systematic, and methodical process of collecting, analyzing, and assessing empirical evidence.  Such research is conducted to develop a valid understanding of reality and find the regularities and laws of nature. It helps us understand concrete phenomena and solve practical problems in our lives. We feel comfortable when deferring to scientific knowledge because of its rigorous methodical rules. The scientific method assesses the accuracy of how we construct knowledge and minimizes the likelihood of error and prejudices. True scientists insist on the replication of their studies, experiments, and findings before their assertions are deemed to true. Be it for exploration, description, explanation, or evaluation, scientific research quenches our thirst for accurate and trustworthy information. Our perception of the nature of knowledge and the limits of the human mind and awareness should keep us open to healthy skepticism. None of the previously listed sources of knowledge has the absolute perception of truth. The notion of accuracy is an approximate and partial comprehension of truth. There is still much more to be revealed and understood. In fact, “knowing” is the process of discovering our own ignorance. Whether we are aware of our ignorance or not, it is already there. We cannot deny it simply because we cannot prove it. Still, we are content with the scientific way of knowing because of the “more accurate” information it leads to. If we are to feel safe and comfortable, we must abide by the scientific and methodical rules of the knowledge industry. But we should not be misled by notions of “accuracy” and “certainty” since our knowledge is bounded and relative.

Rabat – Morocco’s justice ministry has denied media allegations that Morocco helped “disappear” Saudi Prince Turki bin Mohammed Bandar Al Saud in 2015. The Ministry of Justice issued a statement describing the information as unfounded and misleading. The Rabat Court of Cassation, the only court which handles extradition decisions, rendered Judgement 2209/3 in 2015, approving Morocco’s extradition of the Saudi national to Saudi Arabia. Moroccan authorities arrested Prince Turki at Casablanca’s Mohammed V Airport on November 11, 2015, “under an international arrest warrant.” The Saudi prince, a former high-ranking Saudi police officer, was heading to Paris. “This wasn’t a disappearance, as some in the media have described it, but a normal procedure,” Morocco’s justice minister Mohamed Aujjar told AFP. “The two phases, administrative and judicial were respected after his arrest made on the basis of an international arrest warrant,” he added. On October 11, French newspaper Le Monde reported that Prince Turki had been in conflict with the Saudi royal family over a land dispute and had “posted videos on YouTube calling for reforms.” Le Monde claimed that Prince Turki was “discreetly arrested in Morocco by local authorities, then transferred to Saudi Arabia.” The media allegation came in the midst of international uproar over the sudden disappearance of a Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, known for his staunch criticism of Saudi foreign policy decisions. Turkish authorities declared on October 6 that Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, four days after his disappearance. British newspaper the Guardian reported on October 8,  “Prince Turki bin Bandar al-Saud, who applied for asylum in France, disappeared in 2015.” The Guardian also published an article on March 29, 2016, about the “disappearance” of Prince Turki. The British newspaper cited a member of the Saudi opposition who was in touch with Prince Turki shortly after he was arrested. “Someone gave Turki bin Bandar the impression Morocco was safe so he went there to do some business and the Moroccan government took him and gave him to the Saudis,” he said. The Moroccan Ministry of Justice stated that Morocco was “surprised at the unverified and misleading publications” by international media. “Morocco wishes to recall that all acts of extradition are always based on a court decision, in accordance with international procedures and in full respect of national legislation guaranteeing the fundamental rights and freedoms of all individuals.”

Rabat – Ratifications are moving ahead, if slowly, on the newly signed African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA)—the world’s largest free trade agreement (with the most member countries) since the founding of the World Trade Organization. The African Union and its member countries hope that, among other benefits, a free trade area will improve Africa’s economy. For the 49 African leaders who have signed AfCFTA’s framework agreement (by end of July), a free trade area offers hope for improving socioeconomic conditions on the continent. Africa’s current economic indicators are not exactly stellar—low economic productivity, estimated to be 2000% lower than that of developed regions, is compounded by a lack of value addition to commodities in which the region holds a comparative advantage.  For example, because of low value addition, Africa earns a mere 10% of the total value of its agro-value chains. In the cocoa value chain (Africa produces 70% of the world’s cocoa), only a dismal $2 billion out of the more than $100 billion in chocolate revenues annually returns to the continent.  Similarly, up to 90% of income from coffee goes to rich consuming countries, according to the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA). And the domino effect of job loss worsens the situation.  Low productivity exacerbates unemployment. About 12 million African youths join the labour market every year to compete for just three million new jobs. A huge population of jobless youth is a ticking time bomb, warns Alexander Chikwanda, Zambia’s former finance minister, alluding to its potential to fuel unrest and political violence. With few prospects for economic security, many young Africans have been risking their lives crossing a dangerous Mediterranean Sea in search of better opportunities overseas. Many have died on the way, some are detained, and recent reports claim others are sold in modern-day slave markets.  Still, the huge and obvious problem is climate change, which is projected to shrink average income in the poorest 40% of countries (most of them in Africa)by a whopping 75% by 2030, according to a 2015 study by the University of California, Beckley, USA. The study focused on the relationship between temperature and economic activities in countries, and found that climate change will exacerbate global inequality, which will be harmful to particularly poor countries.  “The path does not close for a man with a machete,” says an African proverb, suggesting the AfCFTA could be the machete that catalyzes Africa’s economy. If all 55 countries join, the free trade area will consolidate a market of 1.2 billion people with a combined GDP of $2.5 trillion, according to ECA. The US business publication Bloomberg estimates the combined GDP at over $3 trillion.  A free trade area could boost intra-Africa trade to 52%. That percentage could rise to 70% by 2022, a figure higher than trade within the European Union, currently at 65%.  The AfCFTA also includes a protocol for the free movement of people that will consolidate labour opportunities across the continent and put a brake on brain drain. Currently about 33% of Africa’s skilled workforce is seeking greener pastures overseas. At a glance, AfCFTA looks likely to create unprecedented demand that will drive local manufacturing and industrialization, particularly in the agricultural sector. An industrialized agricultural sector could become Africa’s strategic growth engine and a tool to rapidly expand its middle class, currently estimated at 300 million.  Africa could rake in $150 billion annually of value-added agro-produce, expand its economy, create thousands of jobs for the youth, mitigate carbon emissions and enhance its ecosystems’ resilience to climate change, states the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, the implementing arm of the African Union. Overall consumer spending amounted to $1.4 trillion in 2015, according to McKinsey &amp; Company, a global management consulting firm, and business-to-business spending, including in agriculture and its ancillary sectors, would be $3.5 trillion by 2025.  In a 2013 World Bank report titled Growing Africa: Unlocking the Potential of Agribusiness, the bank projects Africa’s agribusiness could be worth $1 trillion by 2030 if it expands Africans’ access to capital, electricity, better technology and irrigated land to grow high-value nutritious foods.   But how do CFTA and its market opportunities ensure food-secure homes and increase economic productivity, wealth and the income of the ordinary citizen? How does it address climate vulnerabilities? To achieve AfCFTA’s goal of opening market opportunities, Africa needs to adopt compliance standards, experts say. Africa’s disproportionate vulnerability to climate change underscores the need to ensure that the process of producing, marketing and supplying products meets certain standards and that it does not damage the ecosystems.  A compliance standard could ensure, for example, that attiéké, processed cassava from Côte d’Ivoire, is marketed to Kenyan shoppers as pure, natural and grown without GMOs, chemicals or pesticides. A compliance standard could also ensure that ecosystems are not damaged during production and that processing and marketing create no harmful emissions.  At the 16th African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) in Libreville, Gabon, in June 2017, African ministers and policy makers called for increased investment in innovative environmental solutions and urged countries to adopt compliance standards on economic activities in environmental, energy and health sectors. In response, the UN Environment, through its Ecosystems Based Adaptation for Food Security Assembly (EBAFOSA) policy implementation framework, established and adopted by AMCEN, is providing technical assistance to countries adopting its compliance standards.  The EBAFOSA compliance standards are adapted from the International Organization for Standardization, a body that promotes worldwide proprietary, industrial and commercial standards to ensure that certified products are exported to other countries. Under EBFOSA’s compliance standards, experts evaluate agro-products along the entire supply chain—from on-farm production, processing and distribution to marketing—based on three criteria. The first is “climate and environment compliance,” a measure of the extent to which production relies on nature-based approaches that enhance ecosystems. The goal is to protect and enhance ecosystems. “Climate and environment compliance” also involves powering processing with clean energy and using ICT-enabled marketing and supply chain activities to reduce high carbon emissions.  The second criterion is “health compliance,” meaning nature-based approaches are used in production.  The third criterion is “quality and safety compliance” along the production process and value chain.  Several African countries, including Benin, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Gambia, Ghana, Uganda and Zambia, are at various stages of adopting the EBAFOSA compliance standards, which will be a step toward creating an open market for healthy, high-quality and environmentally friendly agro-produce across the continent.  As Africa moves toward full ratification of AfCFTA, the EBAFOSA-promoted compliance standards represent a key item in the agreement’s implementation toolbox. Socioeconomic transformation need not come at the expense of people or planet.   Dr. Richard Munang is UN Environment’s Africa regional climate change programme coordinator and Mr. Robert Mgendi is UN Environment’s adaptation policy expert. These are the authors’ views, not those of their institution.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has stressed the need to boost employment in the agricultural sector to improve living conditions in rural areas. King Mohammed VI gave a speech before the members of both houses of Parliament on the opening of the first session of the third legislative year of the tenth legislature on Friday. This parliamentary year has the motto “the spirit of responsibility and hard work.” King Mohammed VI believes that providing employment for youth in rural areas, especially the rural middle class, could serve “as a lever” for the country’s economic and social development, in the same way as it does for the urban middle class. David Cowan, managing director economist for Africa at Citibank, shares the same perspective on investing in agriculture. He believes that Morocco should focus on developing agriculture across the country, especially in rural areas. “Go back to investing in agriculture. You can’t have industrial growth everywhere. You create industrial corridors,” he told Morocco World News during the fifth annual Citigroup Media and Community Summit in Dubai. Creating more employment and income-generating opportunities will improve living conditions and consolidate stability in rural areas, especially for youth.  This is the only way to encourage young people “to remain on their land,” according to the King. According to a report by Morocco’s Economic, Social, and Environmental Council (CECE), young people suffer the highest unemployment rates, which exceeded 40 percent in urban areas in 2017. The overall unemployment rate reached 26.5 percent in the same year. The King urged the government “to come up with innovative mechanisms” to motivate farmers “to become more actively involved in productive agricultural cooperatives and groupings, and to seek training in the agricultural field.” In Morocco, those who live in rural regions are the most susceptible to poverty. In 2014, the poverty line in rural areas was set at an annual income per capita of MAD 4,312, compared to MAD 4,667 in urban areas. According to the CECE report, upward social mobility is attained by more men than women (43.7 percent compared to 17.9 percent), and by more city-dwellers than people who live in the country (51.1 percent to 14.8 percent). On the other hand, downward mobility affects more women (61 percent) than men (24.1 percent) and more rural women (44 percent) than urban women (19.3 percent). In his speech, the monarch also affirmed that small farmers should be given ways to market their products to fight speculators and mediators. Mediators’ intrusion in the marketing process of agricultural products reduces farmers’ financial benefits. The King also asked for providing investors with easy access to land to ramp up agricultural productivity and increase job opportunities. King Mohammed VI expressed his opposition to the phenomenon of excessive fragmentation of agricultural land, which has a negative impact on productivity. For this reason, the monarch emphasized the need to curb fragmentation and to provide technical and financial support to help farmers invest in their lands. He also indicated the importance of using communal agricultural land (sulaliyat) for investment projects. This would “serve as a powerful lever for improved economic and social conditions, especially for rights holders.” “This should make it possible to secure at least one million additional hectares of this land,” the King said. King Mohammed VI affirmed, “Everyone should carry out his or her mission in full, making sure convictions and differences are respected.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has reiterated his unwavering support for the Moroccan government’s decision to introduce mandatory military service. On Friday, the military service bill was part of the King’s agenda at the opening of Parliament’s fall session. The King chaired the opening of the first session of the third legislative year, marking the gathering of the tenth legislature. Representatives of both Parliament houses, the House of Councilors and the House of Representatives, were in attendance. Responding to one of the main concerns voiced by some youth, the King said that no one will be exempt from military service irrespective of social status or level of education. “With regard to performing military service, it must be emphasized that all the Moroccan citizens concerned–without exception–are equal, regardless of social background, diploma or education,” said the King. Read Also: Mandatory Military Service: To Some It’s Patriotic, To Others It’s Punishment The draft’s approval in August sparked confusion among the public, as the only indication that mandatory service would be reintroduced came just two days prior.  Bill 44.18 on mandatory military service says that all Moroccan youth between the ages of 19 and 25 will spend 12 months participating in military service unless they are exempted for extenuating circumstances, such as physical or mental illnesses and those who support their families financially. After the bill was approved, the King issued a statement in support of military service; the statement emphasized that the obligatory service would aim to promote patriotism in youth. In today’s speech, the King reiterated elements of the royal statement, saying that mandatory service will enhance “the sense of belonging to the homeland.” Amid the increasing rate of unemployment, the King believes that military service will help curb the crisis, as it gives access to training “which opens up opportunities for the professional and social integration of qualified conscripts who demonstrate a sense of responsibility and commitment.” Read Also: Mandatory Military Service Might Not Include Moroccan Binationals Article 6 of Bill 44.18 on mandatory military service says that conscripts will be awarded grades according to the Royal Armed Forces’ current hierarchy standards. Conscripts will also receive MAD 2,000 each month, but they will not be able to collect the reward until the conclusion of the 12-month period. Glimpse into Moroccan mandatory military service history Morocco first introduced an 18-month military service on June 9, 1966, in accordance with Royal Decree 137-66. According to the decree, the national military training aimed to enable youth to “contribute effectively and in all circumstances to the defense of their homeland.” At the time, every 18-year-old Moroccan man had to visit the qaid (governor) of his region, who evaluated whether he was qualified for the military. Men with physical illnesses were exempted from participating in the national military training. The measure aimed to increase conscripts’ skills and aid in their contributions “to the development of their country.” Morocco reduced the length of service to 12 months in 1999 and abolished military service completely in 2006. One out of many Reinstating mandatory military service is part of a long list of reforms the King has implemented in search of a solution to the ongoing unemployment crisis in the country. Other reforms focus on education and vocational training, which are “meant to benefit citizens, especially young people, and to enable them to help serve their country.” Vocational training and education have been the main priorities in most recent speeches of King Mohammed VI. He has said that vocational training aims to integrate youth into a new technical sector,  and practical applications of the skills they learn will enable them to find employment. “Vocational training is a powerful lever for employment, provided it receives the attention it deserves and so long as it is given a new status as well as a broader scope,” said the King. Read Also: Unemployment: King Urges Government to Create New Vocational Training Programs Since it was established in 1974, the Office of Vocational Training and Employment Promotion (OFPPT) has welcomed hundreds of students annually for training in several fields. There are several specializations available through OFPPT, including communications, business, IT, administration, and automotive mechanics. There are public training institutions that offer vocational training throughout the year across the country.  According to the King, there should be a balance between theoretical training and practical and workplace training: “It is necessary to work on creating more bridges and links between vocational training programs and general education courses within a unified, integrated system.”

Rabat- Moroccan tightrope walker, Mustafa Danguir, nicknamed “Danger,” has thrilled onlookers walking between two skyscrapers 75 meters above the ground in Chile. Walking  65 meters on a narrow wire with nothing to hold onto but a pole to help maintain his balance, “Danger” emerged victorious on Wednesday in Santiago, Chile, in front of the La Moneda presidential palace. Crowds of people surrounded the area to watch and cheer for “Danger.” Danguir, 41, is considered one of the most adventurous professional tightrope walkers in Chile. In a statement to Maghreb Arab Press, Danguir, who is from Tangier, said that his achievement allowed him to raise the Moroccan flag in Chile and honor his home country. Danguir’s two months of practice have paid off with the successful performance that both shocked and thrilled viewers from around the world. In 2010, Danguir broke a Guinness world record when he drove a motorcycle on a 130-meter-high steel cable in Benidorm, Spain. Danguir has performed in several countries, beginning his career with a Spanish circus, “Los Muchachos,” and Los Hermanos Ringling Circus.

Rabat- King Mohammed VI has said that foreigners wishing to invest in the Moroccan health sector must share their expertise with Moroccan youth to help them benefit their country. On Friday, during a speech at Parliament for the opening of the new legislative year, King Mohammed VI proposed a win-win solution to create more job opportunities for Moroccan youth. The King addressed the possibility of “opening some sectors and jobs which are currently unlicensed for foreigners in the health sector,” with the condition that they share their professional expertise to benefit the country’s youth and increase employment opportunities in all sectors. The King noted that some international healthcare experts have expressed a growing interest in investing in Morocco. Regarding Morocco’s brain drain, the monarch stated that “there are tempting incentives which induce some students to remain abroad after completing their studies.”  The new initiative aims to improve the quality of services and make Morocco  more competitive to highly qualified Moroccan youth who might not return to the country otherwise. This initiative is another example of the government’s efforts to ensure equal job opportunities, increase youth integration and lower the unemployment rate. The King stated that the “employment of youth is at the heart” of the country’s interests.  The monarch stressed the importance of “establishing a link between vocational training programs and general education courses within a unified, integrated system,” and providing a balanced ground between theoretical and practical training. “Vocational training is a powerful lever for employment, provided it receives the attention it deserves and so long as it is given a new status as well as a broader scope,” the King said. Morocco’s ailing healthcare system has driven many qualified doctors and physicians to emigrate to foreign countries. Many Moroccan doctors point to poor working conditions, inadequate pay, and under-equipped hospitals as reasons that they would rather leave. Instead of facing such prospects, Moroccan medical professionals are increasingly choosing to remain abroad, even though the nation is in dire need of medical services. On October 1, Morocco’s Independent Union of Public Sector Doctors published a statement condemning the “critical” situation of the health sector in the country, including the lack of appropriate infrastructure. The union also denounced health center closures, which deprives the public of services, as well as the minimal amount that the government’s budget allots to the health sector, “which falls within 5 percent.” The statement emphasized that at least 10 percent of the government budget should be spent on health in accordance with the World Health Organization’s recommendations.

Rabat – South Africa-based Sanlam has concluded its acquisition of Morocco’s insurance provider Saham Finances, making it a leading pan-African financial services group. Sanlam announced it had fulfilled all the conditions to acquire the remaining 53.4 percent of Saham Finances for $1.1 billion, in a statement Thursday, October 11. In 2016, Sanlam Emerging Markets acquired a 30 percent stake in Saham Finances and increased its stake to 46.6 percent in 2017. With this acquisition, which took effect on October 11, Sanlam now holds 90 percent of Saham Finances. Santam, a subsidiary of Sanlam, holds 10 percent. Sanlam will now have a presence in 33 African countries, enabling it “to expand its multinational client base, strengthen its position in specialist insurance and employee benefits,” reads Sanlam’s statement. Ian Kirk, the Group CEO of Sanlam said, “The conclusion of this transaction is an important milestone in achieving our vision of becoming a leading financial services group on the continent. “The confluence of the combined footprint and respective expertise of Sanlam, Santam, and SAHAM Finances provides the Sanlam Group with an opportunity to grow its Life Insurance businesses in Francophone markets as well as leveraging the Group’s expertise to grow the general insurance portfolio.” Nadia Fettah, who will remain the CEO of Saham Finances, asserted, “The businesses are complementary. SAHAM Finances developed into a leading insurance group in Africa outside of South Africa, with leading businesses in most of the 26 countries in which it operates.” Fettah and Emmanuel Brule, deputy CEO of Saham Finances, will join the Sanlam Emerging Markets executive committee, said Junior Ngulube, Sanlam Emerging Markets CEO. Saham Finances was established in Morocco in 1995 as a subsidiary of Saham Group and recorded a turnover of $1.2 billion USD in 2017. At the end of 2017, Saham Finances consolidated net assets worth $850 million and earnings of $77.4 million. Sanlam will take over Saham Finance’s 65 subsidiaries, 700 branches, and more than 3,000 employees.

Rabat- King Mohammed VI delivered a speech on Friday before the members of both Houses of Parliament on the opening of the first session of the 3rd legislative year of the 10th legislature. Here follows the full text of the royal message: “Praise be to God, May peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, His Kith and Kin Ladies and Gentlemen, Distinguished Members of Parliament, It is always a pleasure for me to meet with the representatives of the nation for this annual event provided for by the Constitution. This parliamentary year is special in that it coincides with a period for which the motto is ‘the spirit of responsibility and hard work’. The instructions I have given and the measures I have advocated, particularly through the State of the Nation Address and the 20 August Address, require comprehensive mobilization and collective action. Everyone should carry out his or her mission in full, making sure convictions and differences are respected. As parliamentarians – whether you belong to a party in power or are a member of the opposition – you have the noble, yet crucial, responsibility of contributing to the current reform dynamic in the country. Within this respected institution, you form a single, integrated family. There is no difference between you, as is symbolized by your identical Moroccan attire, regardless of your social background or political affiliation. The national interest is the same, and so are the challenges. What counts most is the outcome of your collective work. I am keen to make sure political parties and organizations are supported and incentivized so they can revisit their work methods. This should contribute to enhancing the performance of political parties and organizations in addition to improving legislation and public policies. For this reason, I recommend increasing public finance for political parties. Part of that financing should go to qualified people hired to work in fields relating to reflection, analysis and innovation. Distinguished Members of Parliament, National mobilization and teamwork require a healthy environment as well as greater solidarity between the various social strata. This is what I am seeking to achieve through reforms and the economic and social measures taken to improve the living conditions of all Moroccans and reduce social and spatial disparities. Morocco – by the Grace of God – has been and will continue to be the land of solidarity and social cohesion, be it in families, neighborhoods or society in general. In old towns, for instance, the facades and doors of houses were and still are identical. It is only once inside that one can tell the material status of families. That is because the cohesion and unity of Moroccans goes beyond mere appearance. They stem from the values of brotherhood and concord which are deeply ingrained in our hearts as well as from solidarity, in good times and bad. Consolidating these bonds, which have always brought Moroccans together, means a great deal to me. This is something I seek to achieve through the implementation of effective social policies and by facilitating and encouraging solidarity-based initiatives at various levels. To this end, I call for regulations to be simplified in order to encourage various forms of donation, volunteer work and charity, and to support social initiatives and socially responsible businesses. New mechanisms should also be put in place to engage the private sector in tackling social issues and contributing to better services to citizens, be it through social responsibility or public-private partnerships in this area. Honorable Members of Parliament, The important instructions I have given in connection with employment, education, vocational training and military service are meant to benefit citizens, especially young people, and to enable them to help serve their country. As for military service, it enhances the sense of belonging to the homeland. It also gives access to training which opens up opportunities for the professional and social integration of qualified conscripts who demonstrate a sense of responsibility and commitment. With regard to performing military service, it must be emphasized that all the Moroccan citizens concerned – without exception – are equal, regardless of social background, diploma or education. Distinguished Members of Parliament, Youth employment is one of my foremost concerns. I believe there are a number of sectors which can contribute to creating more job opportunities. Vocational training is a powerful lever for employment, provided it receives the attention it deserves and so long as it is given a new status as well as a broader scope. It is necessary to work on creating more bridges and links between vocational training programs and general education courses within a unified, integrated system. There should also be a balance between theoretical training, on the one hand, and practical, workplace training, on the other. In addition to the role played by vocational training in preparing people for the job market, the agricultural sector can constitute a more dynamic source of employment opportunities and be instrumental in improving living conditions and consolidating stability in rural areas. I therefore recommend that we build on what has been accomplished in the agricultural sector and create more employment and income-generating opportunities, especially for youths in rural areas. The aim is to establish and consolidate a rural middle class and to make sure it plays a balancing role and serves as a lever for the achievement of economic and social development, just like the middle class does in cities. I am aware of the increasing fragmentation of agricultural lands and of the adverse impact this phenomenon has on productivity. However, for young people to remain on their land, they need to be able to find jobs. I therefore urge the government to come up with innovative mechanisms in order to continue incentivizing farmers to become more actively involved in productive agricultural cooperatives and groupings, and to seek training in the agricultural field. In parallel, I call for improved access to land, making it more easily available to investors, whether they are individuals or businesses. This should increase production, boost productivity and stimulate employment. Efforts should also be made to preserve the agricultural character of the plots concerned. Thought should also been given to the best ways to do justice to smallholders, particularly with regard to the marketing of their produce, and to address rigorously the issue of speculation and the multiplicity of intermediaries. Moreover, using communal agricultural land (sulaliyat) for investment projects in farming should serve as a powerful lever for improved economic and social conditions, especially for rights holders. This should make it possible to secure at least one million additional hectares of this land. As is the case with the ownership system applied to communal land in irrigated areas, it is necessary to find appropriate legal and administrative mechanisms to facilitate rights holders’ ownership of some of the fallow land. This must be done according to specific conditions that take into account the actual implementation of projects, the need to curb the excessive fragmentation of agricultural land and the provision of the technical and financial support needed. In the same vein, to stimulate employment, we should consider the possibility of having quality initiatives and global leaders involved in some sectors and professions – such as the health care sector – which are not currently accessible to foreigners, provided the said projects contribute to the transfer of know-how and create employment opportunities for young Moroccans with the right qualifications. Indeed, growing interest is being shown by many of the world’s leading clinics and hospitals that wish to invest in our country. There are tempting incentives which induce some students to remain abroad after completing their studies. I believe, however, that the initiative we are launching will help provide the right conditions for Moroccans with skills to come back to work in their country and create healthy competition, which will ultimately improve service provision. Distinguished Members of Parliament, Last year, I called from this rostrum for our national development model to be reconsidered and for a new approach to be devised to help address the needs of citizens – a model that would enable us to reduce gaps and disparities, achieve social and spatial justice and keep up with changes at home and abroad. Accordingly, some of the institutions and agencies concerned, as well as a number of stakeholders and bodies have kindly prepared proposals and carried out studies to this effect. Through initiatives and reforms launched this year, I have sought to pave the way for future action, provide certain guidelines and create fresh momentum. Special emphasis has been laid on urgent issues on which there is a national consensus and about which we cannot afford to procrastinate, such as education and training, employment and youth issues, public support and social protection. It is quite natural for there to be ample reflection and extensive dialogue on such an issue, which is crucially important for Morocco’s future. I believe, however, that this major project is now ready and that we need to move on to making concrete proposals. This should be done within the next three months. In this respect, I have decided to set up a special committee whose mission will be to collect and sort out proposals and to draw conclusions therefrom, using a comprehensive strategic and instructive format. I expect the said committee to report to me on the proposed new development model, specifying the objectives targeted, the proposed options for change and the means for actual implementation. Honorable Members of Parliament, The stakes involved and the challenges facing our country are as diverse as they are intertwined. There can be no wait-and-see attitudes or narrow calculations about them. Morocco must be a country of opportunity, not of opportunists. All citizens, without exception, should be given the same chance to serve their country, and all citizens must benefit, on an equal footing, from the country’s resources and from opportunities for growth and advancement. More than ever, Morocco needs true patriots who have the homeland’s interests at heart, who care about the citizens and who seek to bring Moroccans together rather than divide them; it needs honest officials who shoulder their responsibility with dedication and selflessness. I therefore want you to rise to the occasion. This requires a genuine sense of patriotism, collective mobilization and a clear will to put the homeland and the citizens above all else. Almighty God says: “Our Lord, truly you know what we conceal and what we reveal: for nothing whatever is hidden from Allah, whether on earth or in heaven”. True is the Word of God. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.”

Rabat – Marrakech is expected to host a high-profile security symposium on new challenges facing African countries. The meeting is organized by the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces (FAR) in collaboration with the US Air Force and European partners of AFRICOM, the US army command in Africa. Organizers say that the convention will gather chiefs of staff from 40 African countries and is part of Morocco’s intra-African or Pan-African agenda. Since its return to the African Union in early 2017, Morocco has regularly brought up the need to promote intra-African exchanges and continental collaboration on strategic topics, ranging from continental security to commercial mobility across Africa. During the three-day-long summit, expected between October 21 and 23, participants will discuss “national and regional security challenges in relation with developing bilateral and multilateral military cooperation.” Along with the wide range of topics to be discussed, participants will emphasize devising a coordinated African response mechanism to extremist terrorism and ideology-based violence on the African continent.

Rabat – Morocco’s annual Air Show in Marrakech (MAS) will convene 200 exhibitors and 100 foreign delegations October 24-27. Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy said on Friday that participants will come from 80 countries to see the 100 aircraft the event will feature. The 2018 air show will attract 50,000 visitors, Elalamy said at a press conference. The fair will feature airplanes from international giants, including Boeing, Airbus, Gulf Streak, Lockheed Martin, Dassault, and Embraer. Speaking on the Moroccan aeronautics industry, Elalamy said that the air show will celebrate Morocco’s achievements and its ability to develop highly technological items, from aircraft wiring to the construction of engine parts. The fair will also showcase the progress of the aviation industry in Morocco. Elalamy said that Morocco has achieved eminent results since the launch of aeronautical ecosystems as part of Morocco’s industrial plan. He added that the sector’s revenue increased by 22 percent this year, while job opportunities in the sector increased by 55 percent. The official said that the aeronautics sector recorded a turnover of $1 billion in 2017, and created 15,500 jobs. Elalamy is expecting Morocco’s aeronautics to grow by 20 percent per year over the next five years. Morocco now has more than 130 aeronautics companies. Montreal-based Bombardier, the world’s third-largest aerospace and transportation manufacturer, built an aerospace-manufacturing facility in Morocco in 2014. Boeing also has a joint venture with France’s Safran in Casablanca to build aerospace parts, such as wire bundles and harnesses, for aircraft makers like Boeing and Airbus. On October 5, Morocco hosted a forum on Morocco-Canada aeronautics expertise to emphasize the need to bolster the country’s productivity in the sector. The event was organized by a group of Moroccan experts residing in Canada. Both Elalamy and the minister in charge of Moroccans residing abroad, Abdelkarim Benatiq, attended the summit. “There has been a true revolution in Morocco’s industrial sector,” Elalamy said during the event. Elalamy also expressed hopes to benefit from Canadian expertise  as Canada is the third in aeronautical performance worldwide.

Rabat – The speaker of the Moroccan House of Representatives, Habib El Malki, has welcomed Germany’s position on the ongoing Western Sahara conflict. El Malki visited Germany last week and met his German counterpart, Wolfgang Schaeuble. In a subsequent interview with Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), El Malki said that his conversation with Schaeuble leads him to think that Rabat can count on Berlin’s principled position when the time comes for negotiations in the Western Sahara territorial dispute. Germany-Morocco ‘Strategic’ Alliance During their meeting on Monday, the German parliamentarian highlighted the strategic relationship between Rabat and Berlin. Schaeuble called Morocco a vital partner in the EU’s foreign policy in Africa and the Mediterranean. He particularly stressed the “prominent role” that Rabat has historically played in Europe’s security and immigration agenda. Morocco, a strategic EU partner, has recently struck new deals with the European body. The agreements include the renewal of agricultural and fisheries agreements that include the southern territories. And despite widespread condemnation of the EU-Morocco agreements in pro-Polisario circles, Schaeuble reiterated his country’s commitment to sustain and protect the Euro-Moroccan deals. According to El Malki, Germany was among the pro-Morocco forces within the continental organization during negotiations that led to the renewal of the Morocco-EU agreements. The newly extended agreements are “irreversible,” El Malki quoted Schaeuble as saying. On Western Sahara, Schaeuble reaffirmed Germany’s commitment to supporting the UN Security Council’s agenda. Germany, he told his Moroccan counterpart, is ready to collaborate to commit all involved parties to the negotiating table. “My country is determined to work, during its term as head of the United Nations Security Council, to give impetus to the dialogue process, by involving all parties directly concerned, in order to support the efforts of the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy, Horst Köhler, to find a consensual solution to this issue and to turn towards development and regional integration issues,” El Malki quoted Schaeuble. Support for Morocco’s position is increasing The Moroccan official expressed satisfaction with Germany’s position on Berlin-Rabat ties. He particularly applauded Germany’s commitment to furthering the UN-led peace negotiations in Western Sahara. Morocco’s extensive investments in the southern provinces, El Malki explained, are gradually convincing many in the international community that Morocco’s autonomy plan is sincere. He added that Morocco’s development projects in the southern territories have exposed the pro-Polisario circles’ propaganda campaigns about Sahrawis’ hostility towards Morocco. Since 1999, when King Mohammed VI ascended to the throne, Morocco has increased investments in historically marginalized and lagging regions in the north and south. In the southern provinces, Morocco has pledged a $7.7 billion plan to develop infrastructure, improve living standards, and enhance the region’s appeal to both Moroccan and foreign investors. The strategy has borne fruits. Locals’ grievances have been relatively addressed through employment opportunities, while Morocco has seized the opportunity to showcase its genuine commitment to developing southern territories. For all Morocco’s development investments, however, the Polisario Front and its supporters have been inflexible. Sidelining on-the-ground proof of local support for Morocco, they have claimed that locals do not benefit from Moroccan investments. Local support for Morocco’s projects El Malki’s point about Morocco’s improved PR scores was echoed in the UN Secretary-General’s latest report on the international community’s peacekeeping efforts in Western Sahara. While the report strove to keep a neutral position in the decades-long conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front, it pointed to locals’ satisfaction with Morocco’s development efforts, despite some general concerns. “In Laayoune, Dakhla and Smara, my Personal Envoy met with a large number of locally elected officials. They highlighted developments in the education, health and economic sectors and stated that the people west of the berm were grateful for the support received from Morocco, particularly the US$ 7.7 billion development plan,” the report said. Morocco and the Polisario Front have accepted the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy’s call for a meeting. As the international community pushes for an end to the decades-long diplomatic stalemate in the Sahara dossier, Malki suggested optimism. He hoped that further proof of Morocco’s genuine development efforts in the southern provinces as well as external support for the country’s 2007 autonomy plan will eventually prevail.

Rabat – US megastar Johnny Depp will land in Morocco by the end of October to shoot “Waiting for the Barbarians.”  Colombian film director Ciro Guerra will lead his staff to Ouarzazate, “Morocco’s Hollywood,” and Marrakech to shoot his movie, starring Depp and Robert Pattinson, Mark Rylance, and Joe Alwyn. Depp has expressed his excitement to shoot his new masterpiece in Morocco. He told Playlist magazine he was “super excited, we’re going to shoot that in Morocco towards the end of October.” The movie is an adaptation of South African-born writer J.M. Coetzee’s novel. The story tells of the relationship between a member of the military and a civil official in a colonial empire. Marrakech recently hosted Australian actor Chris Hemsworth for his “Men in Black” movie, alongside American actress Tessa Thompson. Ouarzazate has been the scene for several movies and series, including “The Mummy,” “Gladiator,” and “Lawrence of Arabia.” The award-winning hit series “Game of Thrones” also includes scenes shot in the desert surrounding Ouarzazate. In July, the Hollywood Reporter named Ouarzazate and Marrakech as some of the best destinations in Morocco. Quoted by the Hollywood Reporter, Morocco-based producer James H E Cutting was quoted as saying Ouarzazate’s “only luxury hotel is le Berbere Palace.” “When we were filming Babel, Brad Pitt stayed in one of the private villas normally used for dignitaries and royalty, and used the rear service entrance so as not to be seen by paparazzi,” said the producer.

Rabat – BESIX, SIXCO, and TGCC have signed a contract to design and build the tallest building in Africa, the “Bank of Africa Tower” in Rabat. Construction will start November 1 and the tower is expected be delivered on May 30, 2022, the Moroccan BMCE Bank of Africa announced in a statement published October 11 by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). BMCE Bank of Africa is sponsoring the project, which will cost an estimated MAD 3 billion. The Bank of Africa Tower will have 55 floors with a luxury hotel, offices, and apartments. An observatory will crown the tower. The Moroccan construction company TGCC and SIXCO (Six Construct), the Gulf subsidiary of the Belgian BESIX Group, signed the contract on October 4 in Dubai.  The China Railway Construction Corporation International (CRCCI), which was originally contracted to build the tower, will continue to accompany the newly contracted companies. The O Tower company has started developing the 250-meter tower which could be titled the tallest building in Morocco and in Africa. The tower would replace Johannesburg’s Carlton Centre, currently the tallest at 223 meters. The  tower will be certified with the US LEED Gold (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and French HQE (High Quality Environmental standard). King Mohammed VI laid the first stone of the tower project in March 2016 when construction was originally launched. Othmane Benjelloun, CEO of BMCE Bank of Africa said, “I have every confidence in … the expertise and know-how of BESIX to build our tower. Together, we share a common goal so that our tower is a source of pride for the kingdom of Morocco and for the African continent.”  Rik Vandenberghe, BESIX CEO, said, “‘Bank of Africa Tower’ will be an emblematic building of the country. I am proud to see BESIX participate in its construction in Morocco.” The Bank of Africa Tower will be the icon of the new Bouregreg Valley development project, a major part of the program “Rabat Ville Lumiere, Capitale Marocaine de la Culture” (Rabat, the City of Light, the Moroccan Capital of Culture).  Moroccan architect Hakim Benjelloun and Spanish architect Rafael de la Hoz designed the tower.  BESIX Group operates in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Oceania.

Rabat – Morocco is participating in the 13th general Conference of the Islamic Organisation for Education, Science, and Culture (ISESCO) focused on Palestine, held in Rabat. The conference, which opened yesterday, focuses on Jerusalem and adapting to recent events in Palestine.  The conference opened with a speech from Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, delivered by Mohamed Laaraj, minister of culture and communication, according to state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press.  Bourita emphasized King Mohammed VI’s policy and efforts in Palestine as president of the Al Quds Committee. King Mohammed VI cooperates with heads of major powers, the UN Secretary-General, and the Palestinian president. At the same time, he establishes on-the-ground social, economic, and humanitarian operations with the cooperation of Bayt Mal Al Qods Asharif Agency. In the same speech, Bourita noted how member states have preserved Palestinian cultural heritage and religious monuments. Bourita also spoke of cooperation on contemporary issues, such as extremism, terrorism, social and economic disparities, and technological disparities.  On October 10, Morocco also renewed its commitment to the Palestinian cause in a coordination meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), emphasizing the country’s ambitions to create lasting peace in the region.  The Moroccan strategy is based on continuous diplomatic actions with major powers and international institutions, and on the increase of development programs to achieve sustainable growth in Palestine.  King Mohammed VI sent over 1.8 tons of medical supplies and equipment for the Moroccan field hospital in Gaza earlier this month. The aid operation resulted from cooperation with Egypt.  The recent conferences and meetings on Palestine come at a tense time as the Trump administration is continuing to cut Palestinian aid after the US controversially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  The Trump administration made it clear that Palestine was not a priority as it cut more than half of its financial aid to the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestinian Refugees in January, $200 million in aid at the end of August, and over $10 million in aid for conflict resolution in early September. The Trump administration also ordered the shut-down of the Palestinian Liberation Organization’s offices in Washington, D.C., in what seems to be retribution for Palestine’s boycott of the US peace plan after the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The recognition has sparked outrage among the international community and was firmly condemned by Morocco. King Mohammed VI sent a letter to the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, and Donald Trump warning about the dangers and implications of the action for regional peace.   ISESCO’s member states count development and humanitarian operations a priority and highly needed for Palestine.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) has dismantled 57  terror cells since its creation in 2015. Since the beginning of 2018, BCIJ has dismantled eight terror cells. The BCIJ dismantled 9 cells in 2017, 19 in 2016, and 21 in 2015. Abdelhak Khiame, the head of the BCIJ, shared his statistics in a recent interview with Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The head of BCIJ said that Morocco has dismantled 183 terror cells since 2002. Fifty-one out of the 57 cells dismantled since 2015 were connected with ISIS. “The strength of Morocco in the fight against terrorism is mainly due to the close collaboration between the various services responsible for ensuring security,” said Khiame. According to Khiame, 1,666 Moroccans went to join conflicts in Iraq and Syria, of whom 929 joined ISIS. Nearly 225 other fighters have a criminal record related to terrorism. Khiame added that 642 Moroccan fighters died in Syria and Iraq due to terrorist suicidal operations. BCIJ’s latest terrorist cell arrests took place on September 18. BCIJ arrested 12 suspects for links to terror and criminal networks in Casablanca and Tangier. Morocco introduced the BCIJ in 2015. The bureau has monitored security threats across the country and assisted foreign security agencies in combating terrorism. BCIJ’s role in fighting terrorism is well recognized.  In its latest report on terrorism, the US Department of State asserted that Morocco has a “comprehensive counterterrorism strategy that includes vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation.” BCIJ is the main body in charge of fighting terrorism. However,  Morocco’s General Directorate for National Security (DGSN) and the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST) work together to conduct border inspections in airports. During the same interview with MAP, Khiame said that Morocco’s brigade against organized crimes (BLCCO) has arrested 167 suspects involved in organized crimes since 2015.

Rabat- The Regional Fair of Local Products has kicked off on Friday in Ouarzazate, the gateway to the desert, promoting both the region’s products and culture.  The second local products fair, themed “Local Products at the Service of Solidarity, Tourism, and Self-Employment,” is featuring several workshops to promote local products including honey, argan oil, and dates. The fair began today and ends October 15.   The region of Draa Tafilalet produces multiple date varieties, including majhoul or medjoul, anbara, and deglet noor.  The fair is exclusive to the Draa Tafilalet and Es Smara regions. Draa Tafilalet lies southeast of the High Atlas Mountains in the Sahara desert and Es Smara is in the northern part of Western Sahara. The fair is not only devoted to promoting local products but also energizing tourism and agriculture.  The event features various Moroccan folk performances, with music and dancing native to the region.  During the opening ceremony of the fair on Friday, the president of the Chamber of Agriculture of Draa-Tafilalet, Abdelkarim Ait El Hajj, said the fair will tour all the provinces of the region in the coming years.  “The third fair will be in one of the other remaining provinces, such as Zagoura, Midelt, and Tinghir,” said El Hajj. He added that the “door is open” for all investors, foreigners and Moroccans alike, to help develop the region. According to El Hajj, the first fair of local products has had a positive impact on the Draa Tafilalet region, promoting tourism, culture, and agriculture, which serves the purpose of the Chamber of Agriculture. The first fair took place in Errachidia in eastern Morocco in March 2017. The event’s theme was “The Enhancement of Local Products, a Lever for the Social and Solidarity Economy.” Nearly 100 cooperatives, including 90 agricultural cooperatives, are participating in the event. The fair is also set to hold a conference to promote the local products, self-employment, and solidarity. El Hajj noted the participation of women in the event, saying that 60 percent of the contributions to the fair are from women’s associations. “The Chamber of Agriculture cares about the rural woman who plays a major role in the agricultural sector,” said El Hajj. The fair is organized by the Chamber of Agriculture of the Draa-Tafilalet region in collaboration with the province of Ouarzazate, the Regional Directorate of Agriculture, the National Agency for the Development of Oasis Areas and Argan, and the Regional Office for Agricultural Development, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Culture. One of Morocco’s most impressive monuments, the Kasbah of Taourirt, located in Ouarzazate, will also host several events linked to the fair, including musical shows. Field visits are also included in the event’s agenda.

Rabat – With the Security Council set to decide the MINURSO mandate by October 31, the US wants the mission to be extended for only six months. French news agency AFP reported on Thursday that France backed the request of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called on the Security Council to extend the mandate of the UN mission in Western Sahara for one year. “France’s position is to push for a one-year renewal, in accordance with a recommendation of the UN Secretary General,” French Ambassador to the UN Francois Delattre told AFP. “We believe that the current trend, the current momentum, is positive,” he said during closed consultations at the Security Council. Read Also: Western Sahara: UN Report Asks Polisario to Meet MINURSO in Tindouf A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, from the council meeting told AFP the US is calling for a new renewal of only six months. “The United States has been very firm,” the diplomat told AFP. A six-month extension would pressure the parties into resuming talks, as they are doing in December in Geneva, Washington said, added the source. Earlier this month, the personal envoy of the UN Secretary-General, Horst Kohler, invited Morocco, Mauritania, Polisario, and Algeria for talks in Geneva. Morocco and the front confirmed that they will attend the round-table, while Algeria and Mauritania have not issued any response yet to the invitations. Kohler gave the parties until October 20 to respond to the invitations. Guterres called on the parties to respond to Kohler’s invitations favorably and without preconditions. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said in a closed meeting in Parliament last week that the Moroccan delegation is not going for negotiations. Read Also: Morocco Accepts UN’s Invitation to Western Sahara Talks in Geneva He said that Morocco will attend the UN round-table in Geneva to reaffirm its conditions, which emphasize Morocco’s autonomy plan as a just solution to end the conflict. Bourita also stressed that Algeria needs to contribute to the UN-led political process to find a solution for the conflict. For years, Morocco has been calling for Algeria to contribute to the UN-led political process as a main party and not an observer. Algeria hosts tens of thousands of Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps, where they suffer embezzlement of humanitarian aid and malnutrition, according to the latest UN report on Western Sahara.

Rabat – Footballing megastar Cristiano Ronaldo has been feeling the heat of the #MeToo movement in the past weeks. Late last month, Kathryn Mayorga, a 34-year-old American woman, spoke up against the star’s alleged sexual assault. The woman claims the Portugal and Juventus forward raped her in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009. She says she was coerced into signing a non-disclosure agreement of $375,000 in 2010. However, in late September, her lawyers filed a civil suit against Ronaldo for the rape. Fake news, fabrication, and manipulation Following the new lawsuit, the past few weeks have seen a media war between Ronaldo (and his attorney), the media, and his former club Real Madrid. According to Italian news outlet La Repubblica, the footballer last week said that he was convinced his former employer, the Spanish giant Real Madrid, had a hand in the affair. He believed they manipulated the American woman into filing a lawsuit. Ronaldo, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing, has called the allegations “fake news” fabricated to sabotage his solid reputation. He added that his “conscience is clear” because he has been an example of professionalism and personal integrity during the nine years he spent in the Spanish capital. Der Spiegel vs. Ronaldo attorney In his defense of his client’s conduct, Ronaldo’s lawyer, Peter Christiansen, asserted that the footballer had consensual sex with Mayorga.
Most importantly perhaps, Christiansen cast doubts on the authenticity of the news reports. He said the non-disclosure agreement and other documents used to corroborate the rape allegations were “fabricated” and “pure invention.” Der Spiegel, the German outlet which first broke the Ronaldo story, did not take long to reply. The newspaper stood by its report and said that the non-disclosure document used in their report was authentic and fact-checked multiple times before publication. “We have hundreds of documents from different sources that substantiate our reporting. We stand by our reporting. We have no reason to believe that those documents are not authentic. “Furthermore, as always and before publishing every single article in Der Spiegel, we have meticulously fact-checked our information and had it legally reviewed. The statement that was issued by Peter Christiansen on behalf of Cristiano Ronaldo presents the usual path that Mr Ronaldo and his lawyers have taken in the past when unsuccessfully fighting our investigative work.” Madrid sues Portuguese outlet But the latest episode of the Ronaldo-Real Madrid-Mayorga media circus came from a Portuguese outlet, Correio da Manha. On Wednesday, the outlet published a story closer to Ronaldo’s allegations that Madrid played a part in the newly reopened rape investigation. According to Correio da Manha, Ronaldo had consensual relations with Kathryn Mayorga, his accuser, but he was reluctant to financially settle with her. The newspaper reported that Ronaldo was convinced of his innocence and strongly opposed to any settlement deal. However, Real Madrid at the time forced him to settle the case. Madrid has since fumed at the Portuguese outlet’s allegations, strenuously denying having anything to do with the affair. In fact, Real Madrid did not even know that Ronaldo had a relationship with Mayorga, according to statement released by the Spanish club. Real said it has “absolutely no knowledge of any of the information the newspaper published.” The paper’s story, Real added, is “categorically false” and intended to “seriously damage the image of this club.”
The Guardian reported on Thursday that the Spanish club has taken legal action against the Portuguese newspaper for defamation. Just like Der Spiegel, however, the Portuguese outlet has challenged Madrid. It says it stands by its report because everything in it was verified and diligently fact-checked. While Ronaldo, seemingly unperturbed, continues his recently signed contract with Italian giant Juventus, the dark clouds above the Portuguese star are nowhere near dissipation. The Las Vegas police have reopened an investigation into the case.

Rabat – Morocco’s interior minister Abdelouafi Laftit has met with Saudi interior minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Nayef to promote security cooperation. Laftit and Prince Abdulaziz held the talks along with officials of the interior ministries of Morocco and Saudi Arabia, Thursday, in Rabat, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Both parties concluded “an agreement in the field of security cooperation on the fight against transnational organized crime, terrorism, illegal emigration and drug trafficking, as well as the exchange of data and expertise,” according to a statement by the Moroccan Ministry of the Interior. The two ministers discussed ways to strengthen bilateral cooperation, security developments, and challenges in the Arab region, added the statement. Laftit and Prince Abdulaziz also agreed to develop exchange programs on training and capacity building.  They emphasized the significance of implementing the civil protection cooperation agreement signed in Riyadh in 2013. The meeting, according to both sides, consolidates fruitful relations between the two countries and the brotherly ties between King Mohammed VI and King  Salman, said the statement. The Saudi interior minister arrived in Morocco Tuesday, October 9, for an official visit. Prince Abdulaziz’s visit follows tensions between the two kingdoms. A Saudi sport official criticized Morocco’s request for support in its bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup. In one tweet, Turki al-Sheikh wrote, “If we were asked for support, we would firstly look at what serves Saudi Arabia’s best interest.”

Rabat – Russian President, Vladimir Putin has warmly congratulated Khabib Nurmagomedov in person for his win of the UFC 229 lightweight championship over Conor McGregor. On Sunday early morning, Russian Khabib beat McGregor in the UFC 229 in Las Vegas. He jumped into McGregor’s team’s area over an incident that happened weeks before. He said McGregor had insulted him and his father, attacked a bus, and mocked his religion.  Putin received Nurmagomedov and his father on Wednesday, October 10. He thanked Khabib’s father for raising such a great fighter and asked him to cut Khabib some slack. During the meeting, Nurmagomedov said, “I hope the Athletic Commission will rule in our favour.” He was referring to an investigation by the Nevada State Athletic Commission into his behavior. Putin laughed before saying, “Well what can I say about that?” “We all understand that it was a provocation, and I’m sure your father understands that too,” he added. Putin justified Khabib’s jump into McGregor’s team. Putin argued that Russians are all one family, and if someone attacks them from the outside, then all Russians will charge the accusers. The Russian president finished the visit by wishing continued success for Khabib.

Rabat– The General Direction of National Safety (DGSN) has dismantled a criminal network involved in irregular migration and seized their equipment.  DGSN and judicial police from Tangier and Assilah, an Atlantic coastal town, dismantled the criminal network Wednesday night, according to state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The police arrested 19 migrants, 1 intermediary, and 3 alleged organizers.  Tangier police also uncovered equipment used for irregular emigration, following the arrests. They seized a seven-meter zodiac, two paddles, one engine, and five safety jackets.  The DGSN is still investigating the group in collaboration with Tangier police to find more suspects and any links to other national or international criminal networks.  The arrests come at a tense time as the royal navy fired on a “hostile” migrant boat on Wednesday, injuring 16 year-old Ilyas Amrani. On September 25, the navy, in another attempt to intercept a “hostile” migrant boat, also killed 20-year-old Hayat Belkacem, and injured Lahbib (26), Hamza (25), and Mouad (23).  Increasing migration attempts have put pressure on the navy to use controversially aggressive measures.

Rabat – The “One Million Schoolbag Initiative” launched by King Mohammed VI for the 2018-2019 back-to-school season has benefited 4,365,000 children.   The annual program that started in 2016 at the demand of King Mohammed VI aims to help less fortunate children by distributing schoolbags full of school supplies.  The initiative reflects the Moroccan plan to support the educational sector, promote schooling, and generalize elementary schooling. It also denotes efforts to give equal chances to Moroccan children, regardless of their social backgrounds.  This year’s initiative benefited over 4,365,000 school kids, of whom 63 percent come from rural areas, and 85 percent are enrolled in elementary school, according to state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).  The UAE ambassador to Morocco, Ali Salim Al Kaabi, launched a similar distribution Wednesday.  According to Al Kaabi, the school supplies commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of the late Shaikh Zayed in the context of the “Year of Zayed.” The donation also highlights the brotherly ties between Morocco and the UAE.  In a declaration to WAM Emirates News Agency, Al Kaabi also expressed the interests of the UAE in engaging in humanitarian and development joint projects in Morocco. He said that his initiative is in line with King Mohammed VI’s “One Million Schoolbags Initiative.”

Rabat – On October 2, nearly 30 journalists and NGOs, representing several African and Middle Eastern countries, gathered in Dubai for the fifth annual Citigroup Media and Community Summit.  The summit, which is usually held in London, strayed from solely focusing on the European market. Instead, the meeting highlighted Citibank’s achievements in Africa, the Middle East, China, and Pakistan. Karim Seifeddine, head of public affairs and government relations of the Middle East and Africa at Citigroup said: “[These represent] areas of focus and growth for the bank and that is why Citigroup is present in 25 of 28 countries of the region to fulfil the needs of the different categories of consumers in the region.” On the sidelines of the summit, Morocco World News spoke with Andrew Baird, Global CEO of Education for Employment, and David Cowan, Managing Director Economist for Africa at Citibank, on their views of Morocco’s economy and unemployment. “The government’s role is not necessarily to create jobs. It’s to create an environment where jobs can be created to attract both foreign and local investments,” said Baird. However, Morocco’s recent unemployment experience is primarily a story of government attempts to create jobs. For years, Morocco has struggled to strengthen its economy, but it has had difficulty overcoming high unemployment rates and increasing the quality of its poorly performing educational system. As in most countries in the MENA region, unemployment is a major concern in Morocco, especially among university graduates. Between 2016 and 2018, the national rate of unemployment rose from 9.9 to 10.5 percent, according to Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP).  Morocco’s Economic, Social, and Environmental Council (CESE) stated in its 2017 report that young people suffer the highest unemployment rates. High youth unemployment hinders economic growth through the inefficient use of human capital. Although the economy is growing, it is not growing fast enough to match population growth and the increasing number of university graduates. “The number of degree holders increased from 43,000 in the last five years to 120,000 this year,” Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said in August.  Morocco’s economy is characterized by small and medium-sized enterprises, many of which do not need university graduates. Fifty-two percent of the actively employed population does not hold a university degree. The state has traditionally absorbed university graduates by hiring them into the public sector, but economic austerity measures, coupled with the growing supply of degree-holders, has prevented the state from continuing to play this role. Some university graduates have turned to the private sector; however, employment in the private sector is volatile, offering few social protections and low job security when compared with the public sector.   Those who cannot find work in the public sector and do not wish to brave the uncertainty of the private sector often leave in search of opportunities abroad. Ninety-one percent of Moroccan professionals aged 35 and younger wish to work abroad. Brain drain has further fueled the unemployment problem by eroding talent from the supply of job seekers and contributing to a mismatch between the skills of university graduates and those demanded by the job market. CESE’s report confirmed that employers often prefer to hire experienced workers over university graduates. Young people also graduate with skills ill-suited to the needs of the market. The report also mentioned corruption and nepotism as contributors to a system where merit is less important. Inevitably, young people lack confidence in the labor market. The Moroccan government has sought to address unemployment through an Industrial Acceleration Plan. The plan created 89,884 jobs in 2017, with an increase of 13,657 jobs compared to 2016, according to Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid El Alamy. Morocco’s Secretary General to the Ministry of Industry, Othman El Ferdaous, announced in June 2017 that 300,000 new jobs will be provided in the following three years with the industrial plan. Morocco has attempted to create job opportunities by partially relying on foreign investments in the automotive and aeronautics industries. The country has received, in the first eight months of 2018, approximately MAD 16.5 billion in foreign direct investments (FDI). Although Morocco received a large amount of FDIs, it is still facing the mounting issue of absorbing the growing workforce. Baird was optimistic about Morocco’s economy, predicting it would generate more jobs in the coming years. “It’s hard to predict because it depends on a number of factors that are not in control,” Baird told MWN. “But as long as there is a more or less stable economy, I anticipate that more employment [will be] generated.” He added that “because of demographics, in order to even stay stable you have to increase the rate of job creation, more and more jobs, year after year, just to absorb what’s coming in.” However, the BMI research group forecasted in May 2018 that unemployment would remain high throughout the next decade, due to the expanding workforce, unmet demand for technical positions, and a decline in job creation in traditional professions. Baird believes that the Moroccan government should strategically wed the private sector’s needs with the educational system.  King Mohammed VI chaired a meeting with an education committee on Monday, October 2, to discuss the ways to increase youth employment through vocational training centers.  The sovereign gave the government three weeks to draft a plan to adapt training in the “traditional professions.” These professions are mostly in the fields of service, construction, agriculture, fishing, water, energy, and crafts. In an attempt to balance its economy, Morocco has increasingly focused on developing the automotive industry. Baird recognized Morocco’s efforts to promote to cultivate its image as a hub for the industry. The Moroccan government offers investment incentives for automotive industries, including a five-year corporate tax exemption and a 25-year exemption if most of the products are exported. The government also offers VAT exemptions, land purchase subsidies, and rebates of up to 30 percent on investment costs. As a result, some renowned international automotive companies have built plants for producing car parts in Morocco. Companies such as PSA, Nexteer, Novares, and Fiat’s Magneti Marelli established plants in the free zones of the northern city Tangier and Kenitra, which is  near Rabat. These companies, along with Moroccan government, have set ambitious goals to increase automotive production. PSA Group’s Kenitra plant, which is expected to produce 100,000 cars in 2019, announced in September that it would double its annual production capacity to 200,000 in 2020. “Morocco [has done] a nice job lately in the automotive sector, and that was a very concentrated, deliberate effort that needs to be replicated across other industries,” Baird commented. BMI Research predicted in its latest report that vehicle production in Morocco will reach 468,389 units in 2018. It also predicted an average annual growth of 19.8 percent between 2018 and 2022, with an annual production of 988,477 units. The Wall Street Journal reported that Morocco has become a continental leader in the automotive industry, surpassing South Africa with 345,000 passenger vehicles produced in 2017 above South Africa’s 331,000. Cowan believes that Morocco should focus on developing agriculture across the country, especially in rural areas. “Go back to investing in agriculture. You can’t have industrial growth everywhere. You create industrial corridors,” he said.  While Morocco suffers from some water shortage, agriculture is considered one of the pillars in Morocco’s economy. A piecemeal approach to reforming these sectors and alleviating the crushing weight of unemployment has proved unsuccessful thus far.  Morocco needs to concentrate its efforts on diversifying its focuses–something that both Baird and Cowan advocate for–to allow for across the board growth, sustainable relief for the unemployed, and security for younger generations.

Rabat – The Western Sahara question continues to divide the international community as a UN hearing on Wednesday ended in “mixed reviews” about Morocco’s position. In a marathon of opinionated remarks on the ongoing political stalemate in Western Sahara, some petitioners threw scathing criticism at Morocco’s position, calling the country a “colonizer” and a champion of human rights abuses. They accused Morocco of plundering the region, alleging that locals do not benefit from natural resources in the southern provinces. Others, however, spoke highly of the country’s position, particularly its 2007 autonomy plan. These supporters pointed out the enormous development projects and investment plans under Moroccan watch in the southern territories, according to UN coverage of the meeting. In an equally opinionated rebuttal of critics’ arguments, supportive petitioners welcomed Morocco’s plan as the only viable and reliable peace broker in the decades-long political dispute. They explained that, as far as security, stability, and development projects are concerned, Morocco’s position is the most sustainable path towards a mutually acceptable political settlement. Morocco’s proposal, the UN coverage quoted one supporter as saying, is “flexible, fair, and far-sighted.” As Morocco’s 2007 autonomy plan entails local autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty, supporters pointed out that the proposal is democratic and that it values civic participation and citizens’ rights. In Tindouf, the de facto bastion of the separatists, however, others highlighted, political dissent is silenced and severely punished while freedom of movement and expression is heavily restricted. French Senator François Grosdidier, perhaps the most fervent pro-Moroccan petitioner at the hearing, said that local autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty—the cornerstone of Morocco’s proposal—is the more practical and effective alternative to provide stability and security in a vast and often troubled region. “The Moroccan Autonomy plan responds to democratic aspirations and sustainable development needs, in its economic, social, and environmental dimensions, while respecting the identity of the populations,” Grosdidier was quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) as saying. He added that while Morocco’s proposal “responds to democratic aspirations and sustainable development needs,” a Polisario-ruled and “independent Sahara would be unable to control its vast territory,” ultimately becoming “a lawless area.” The remarks come as the UN strives to break away from decades of fruitless peace negotiations to finally find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable settlement in the decades-long standstill. In his latest report on the UN peacekeeping efforts in Western Sahara, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres upheld the international community and Morocco’s resolve to commit all players to the negotiation table to reach a sustainable political solution.

Rabat – The Qatar Chamber (QC) has received a Moroccan trade delegation to discuss ways to promote trade relations between Qatar and Morocco. QC’s Vice-Chairman Mohamed bin Ahmed Al Kuwari chaired the meeting on Tuesday, October 9, in Doha. QC is the leader of the private sector in Qatar. The Moroccan trade delegation visiting Qatar included members of the Moroccan Association of Exporters (ASMEX) and representatives of Moroccan companies. The Moroccan ambassador to Qatar, Nabil Zniber, headed the visiting delegation. Zniber said that the visit’s objective was to “strengthen cooperation ties with the Qatari private sector.” Speaking at the meeting, Al Kuwari said that Morocco “is an attractive and safe destination for investments,” reported the daily newspaper the Peninsula Qatar. Al Kuwari stated the significance of the many MoUs and agreements signed by the Moroccan-Qatari high joint cooperation committee in March in Rabat. In March, Morocco and Qatar signed 11 agreements, MoUs, and action programs in many sectors including education, media, agriculture, housing, and industry.  Al Kuwari said the agreements will open “new areas of cooperation between Qatari and Moroccan businessmen.” The trade volume between the two countries reached QAR 330 million (MAD 856 million) in 2017. The Qatari private sector has strong cooperation ties with Morocco. Qatari Diar Real Estate announced Tuesday, October 3, the opening of the first phase of the Al Houara project in Tangier in the second quarter of 2019. The infrastructure of the project, which is worth QR 700 million (MAD 1.8 billion), will be completed by the end of 2018. The project’s first phase includes the construction of a Hilton Luxury Hotel and an 18-hole golf course. There are “117 Qatari-Moroccan companies operating in the Qatari market and six companies with 100 percent Moroccan capital in sectors of fashion, construction, building, hospitality, services and decorations,” Al Kuwari asserted. The total capital of Qatari-Moroccan companies is QAR 20 million, he added. During the meeting in Qatar, the Moroccan Agency for Developing Investment and Exports (AMDIE) presented the Moroccan economic profile and investment opportunities in Morocco.

Rabat- “We will miss her,” said Morocco’s permanent representative to the UN, Omar Hilale, of Nikki Haley’s departure from ambassadorship.  Following Nikki Haley’s resignation as US ambassador to the United Nations, accepted by US President Donald Trump on Tuesday, Hilale told Fox News that she will be missed. “I worked with her two years and from the beginning it was a warm, personal relationship and Morocco will never forget her,” he stated. Haley did not present her reasons for leaving the position, but said she believes that government officials must know “when it’s time to step aside.” Trump appointed Haley, who previously served as the governor of South Carolina, in 2017 as ambassador to the UN. Haley also served as a temporary president of the UN Security Council for one month. Haley’s resignation comes just weeks before a Security Council meeting on Western Sahara to decide on the mandate of MINURSO, the UN mission in Western Saha

Rabat – Morocco’s brigade against organized crime (BLCCO) has arrested 167 suspects involved in organized crimes since 2015. The head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, shared statistics of criminals arrested from 2015 until October 2018. In his recent interview with Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Khiame said that 74 people were arrested in 2015, while 61 were arrested in 2016. The number decreased in 2017 as only 32 suspects involved in organized crimes were arrested. In the first nine months of 2018, the Organized Crime Brigade arrested 22 suspects. The arrests are conducted under the supervision of the BCIJ. Khiame added that the number of people who have been the subject of search warrants by the brigade has only been 132 since the creation of BCIJ in 2015. Twenty-nine people out of the 132 were arrested and sentenced. According to the senior security official, the brigade has seized more than 50 tons of cannabis resin, 3,818 kilograms of cocaine, and 35,777 psychotropic tablets. Khiame added that the security forces also seized over MAD 48,204,800 and €858,520 in cash. Authorities also seized five shotguns and 400 cartridges. “The efforts of BLCCO are very commendable. We were able to dismantle several criminal networks that were active in [cannabis] trafficking, psychotropic drugs and cocaine, with record seizures,” said Khiame. Khiame also said that BCIJ has resolved several cases related to murder, irregular immigration, and armed robbery.

Rabat- Casablanca will put in place a digital platform to assess and supervise the work of street cleaning companies.  A development firm, Casa Prestations, in charge of monitoring, managing, and developing public services providers has launched a tender for the development of the platform, which will end on October 31. The platform will include a GPS to track the activities of the cleaning firms as well as a communication tool to allow close monitoring and analysis of the work.  The goal of the platform, in addition to allowing Casa Prestations to efficiently evaluate the cleaning firm, is to sustainably improve the service.  The platform will also contain a “penalty” section. The section will follow in real time the activities of the cleaning vehicles, and allow authorities to potentially sanction employees who do not follow directions properly.  Casablanca is frequently criticized for the trash in its neighbourhoods. The platform would represent a new approach to solving the problem.

By Mohamed Hikal Rabat – An OXFAM report has ranked Morocco 98th among 157 countries in the Commitment to Reducing Inequality (CRI) Index issued this month. Along with Development Finance International (DFI), OXFAM developed the index to measure government commitment to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. The CRI index is based on three indicators: Social spending, tax law, and labor rights. Reducing inequality comes under the 10th sustainable development goal. The report asserts, “Without reducing inequality, meeting SDG 1 to eliminate poverty will be impossible.” Morocco ranked 112th in spending with a score of 0.179, 78th in taxation policies with 0.531, and 101st in labor rights and wages with 0.337. In 2017, the first year OXFAM produced the index, Morocco ranked 103rd. It ranked 99th in social spending, 140th in taxation policies, and 50th in labor market policies. In the 2018 report, Denmark, Germany, and Finland were ranked in the top three while Haiti, Uzbekistan, and Nigeria were the bottom three. In sub-Saharan Africa, where “the gap between rich and poor is greater than in any other region of the world apart from Latin America,” South Africa came first. It ranked second in social spending, first in taxation policies, and seventh in labor rights. Tunisia ranked highest of the 11 Middle East and North Africa countries included. It came first in social spending and second in taxation policies and labor rights. Morocco ranked 6th in MENA. Many countries in the MENA region were not included due to the unavailability of data on government policies. No Arab or African country appeared among the high-income countries that had introduced progressive taxation, strong welfare conditions, and safety for their workers.

Rabat – The Islamic affairs minister has arrived in Astana, Kazakhstan, to represent King Mohammed VI at the Congress of the Leaders of World and Traditional Religions. The two-day event opened on October 10. The Moroccan minister’s participation followed an invitation from Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev to King Mohammed VI. During the event, the Moroccan minister spoke about the role of religious dialogue in promoting peace from a Moroccan perspective. He based his remarks on Morocco’s experience and its moderate Islamic model based on the Maliki doctrine. Maliki is one of the four major doctrines of Islamic jurisprudence within Sunni Islam.  Morocco has taken several steps to fight radicalism by ensuring that the practice of Islam remains unified, moderate, and stable. As part of the strategy, the King instructed the Ministry of Islamic Affairs to open centers to train imams and teach the moderate strain of Moroccan Islam. In a recent message of King Mohammed VI read by Head Of Government Saad El Othmani on the sidelines of the 73rd UN General Assembly, the King also emphasized the importance of education to promote coexistence between religions. Astana’s conference is taking place under the theme “Global Leaders for a Secure World.” The conference will discuss several themes, including “World Peace in the 21st Century as a Concept of Global Security,” and “New Opportunities for the Enhancement of Humanity.” Astana Times reported on October 4 that the conference has played “an important role in the rapprochement of cultures and civilisations, in searching for answers to the key challenges of our time” for 15 years. The news outlet reported that the idea for the event was “put forward in 2003 against the backdrop of emerging crisis of the world order after the cold war, unprecedented 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States and military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.”

Rabat – French Senator Francois Grosdidier has affirmed that Morocco’s autonomy plan in Western Sahara will “promote stability and security” in the region. Grosdidier said that the autonomy plan fulfills the democratic aspirations and sustainable development needs of the Sahrawi population, ”while respecting the identity of the populations,” reported state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The French senator made his statements Wednesday, October 10, before the 4th Committee of the UN General Assembly in New York. Grosdidier brought up security in the region, saying, it is not a “minor issue in the Sahelo-Saharan region.” “The persistence of the jihadist presence shows the difficulty of neighboring states to exercise effective sovereignty over these huge territories,” said the French senator. The Moroccan autonomy plan would settle the Western Sahara conflict and “would allow the entire Maghreb to take a good step forward,” he continued. Grosdidier also indicated that an independent Western Sahara would not be able “to control its vast territory with such a low population density.” He explained that Western Sahara  “would become a lawless area while it is today the most stable and safe in the entire Sahelo-Saharan region.” Grosdidier recognized Morocco’s efforts, led by King Mohammed VI, to promote security against threats by extremists in the region. “Thanks to its Sahara which stretches to the Mauritanian border, Morocco can play a vital role to promote the stability of this vast region, on which also depends the security of the Maghreb, the Sahel, the Middle East and Europe,” the French senator said. France, as one of Morocco’s strongest European allies, has supported Morocco’s territorial integrity over Western Sahara for many years. In January, French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a Paris meeting that Morocco’s autonomy plan is the most viable consensual solution for Western Sahara. Le Drian also said that he would emphasize to the United Nations Secretary-General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is a serious and credible basis for a political solution.

Rabat- The economy and finance minister has announced a new action plan to settle debts for private and public sector companies. During Wednesday’s Council of Ministers, chaired by King Mohammed VI, Minister of Economy and Finance Benchaaboun presented a general outline of the 2019 draft Finance Bill. The bill, according to Benchaaboun, prioritizes social policies, in the fields of health, education, and employment. It aims to accelerate social dialogue, improve socio-economic integration, and sustain Morocco’s ailing health and educational systems. The bill also seeks to improve the business climate and support small and medium-sized enterprises as one of its priorities. On budgetary concerns, the budget will try to reduce the budget deficit and practice vigilant debt management. The government plans to industrialize Morocco by increasing the industrial sector’s contribution to gross domestic product, attracting foreign investment, and reducing the trade deficit. The government will also select projects to improve living conditions, especially for those in remote areas. Saving failing companies
To relieve accumulating debts by public institutions and companies facing financial difficulties, the minister said the government has partnered with the banking sector. Benchaaboun said that the new measure will settle the companies’ debts over the next ten years. He proposed a review of the status of company subsidiaries to rationalize their expenditures. On the sidelines of the meeting, the council of ministers approved six international agreements and a multilateral agreement on the African Union convention on preventing and combating corruption. King Mohammed VI said in a message addressed to the 31st African Union Heads of State Summit in July that corruption may have serious effects on sustainable development goals.

Rabat – More details have emerged of the 16-year-old Moroccan migrant, Ilyas Amrani, shot by the navy on a boat in the Atlantic.  The Royal Moroccan Navy shot Ilyas Amrani as it was trying to intercept the illegal boat off the coast of Larache, a city in northern Morocco. The navy took the young man to the Mohammed V Hospital in Tangier where doctors removed the bullet that had penetrated his shoulder and lodged in his chest.  The surgery went well, according to state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Ilyas Amrani is still under medical care.  The incident occurred as the boat was allegedly performing hostile maneuvers, attempting to collide with the navy ship. The navy fired one time to immobilize the boat.  The 50 migrants on the boat all returned to Ksar Sghir port, in northern Morocco. The craft drowned shortly after the operation.  This event comes less than a month after the navy killed 20-year-old Hayat Belkacem and injured Lahabib (26), Hamza (25), and Mouad (23) on another migrant boat. The boat was trying to cross the Mediterranean when it was stopped off the coast of M’diq and Fnideq near Ceuta.  The migration volume in the Mediterranean has pressured the Moroccan navy to use more aggressive measures which spark national outrage. Hayat Belkacem’s death on September 25 resulted in a wave of protests in northern Morocco.

Rabat – Khadija, the 17-year-old girl who said she was kidnapped and raped for two months, acknowledged that opening up about her tragedy “was difficult.” Khadija’s rape story has made headlines in Morocco and across the world since August. A dozen people, minors and adults, allegedly kidnapped and repeatedly raped her for almost two months in Beni Mellal, central Morocco, about 300 kilometers from Rabat. The suspects also tattooed her body. In a new interview with AFP, Khadija said that speaking about the incident has been difficult since she decided to file a complaint. “But I am ready to endure it.” Read Also: Khadija’s Parents Hire Lawyer to Defend Her Story She called on all girls who have suffered similar ordeals to be brave and speak out. She added that she cannot wait to start treatment to remove the tattoos. “I cannot even look at my hands, because I remember every day what happened to me,” she said. Khadija’s father, Mohamed, told AFP that his daughter was “brave” despite her situation. Police arrested twelve suspects aged between 17 and 28 in Khadija’s case. The suspects are facing charges of human trafficking of a minor, rape, torture and threatening death. Prosecutors have charged some suspects with kidnapping, imprisoning, not assisting a victim in danger, and forming an organized gang. According to AFP,  several suspects confessed in their statements. Read Also: Tattoo Specialist Questions Khadija’s Story of Involuntary Tattoos Khadija’s father said that living in their small village of Oulad Ayad in Beni Mellal has become difficult. The family has received threats and insults by phone. In August, several suspects’ parents questioned  Khadija’s allegations. The parents claimed that Khadija has a bad reputation in the town. They said she used to “drink, smoke and even burn herself with cigarettes.” A mother of two of the suspects said that Khadija asked “for the tattoos and they were not forced on her by anyone.” The suspects’ mother added that she would defend Khadija herself if she were really a victim as she claims. “She wanted this, she was always knocking on my door asking if my son was home,” the mother told Moroccan television channel Soltana. Another parent claimed that if what Khadija charged of his son were true, Khadija’s father would have filed a complaint about his daughter’s absence. Social media users launched a petition in August asking King Mohammed VI and public authorities to restore Khadija’s dignity by giving her justice.

Rabat- It is no secret that the news cycle has a selective memory, and Morocco is doing a great disservice to itself by allowing headlines and the social media sphere to be dominated by its lapses in human rights — especially when it can do better.  The country’s National Women’s Day on October 10 is an opportune time for the government to look beyond superficial celebrations, and make a staunch commitment to a zero-tolerance policy on violence and discrimination against women to elevate women’s legal status.  One of the marking points in 2018 for women is the passage of  Law no. 103-13 on combating violence against women, in September 2018, after more than a decade of advocacy by civil society organizations. Morocco’s violence against women law provides protective measures for violence survivors but gaps persist. While it contains a detailed definition of violence against women that encompasses the broad range of forms of violence, including physical, psychological, sexual, and economic, the law does not provide a definition of domestic violence or criminalize marital rape.  The Law allows for protection orders that prohibit an accused person from contacting, approaching, or communicating with the victim. However, contrary to the recommendations of the United Nations, the Moroccan law predicates protection orders on survivors filing criminal claims, which is not possible for all survivors because of the requirement and the social and familial pressure against bringing criminal cases. Further, the legislation’s provisions permitting the protection orders to be cancelled in case of reconciliation adds undue pressure on survivors to drop the claim. To its credit, protection orders are issued in addition to rather than in lieu of other legal remedies. The law also establishes service and protection measures for survivors, such as medical care and shelters, as well as psychological therapy for the perpetrator. Yet, the available measures can only be issued during a criminal prosecution or after a criminal conviction or after a criminal conviction. The law also increases penalties for existing criminal offenses but does not criminalize marital rape. It does, however, increase penalties for some forms of violence in the penal code when committed within the family and establishes new crimes including forced marriage, squandering money or property to circumvent payment of maintenance or other dues arising from a divorce, expelling or preventing a spouse from returning home. The Law, obligates public authorities to take prevention measures, including programs to raise awareness on violence against women. It also provides for specialized units to serve the needs of women and children in courts, government agencies, and security forces, and local, regional, and national committees to address women’s and children’s issues.  In general terms, Morocco is noted for its progressive stance toward legal reforms on Gender-Based Violence (GBV) relative to other countries in the MENA region.  In recent years Morocco has taken substantial steps and civil society has made great strides in establishing legal reforms. The status of women and the legal context for gender-based violence are addressed primarily in the Moroccan Constitution, the 2018 Law no. 103-13 on combating violence against women, the Penal Code, and the Moudawana. There is no clear prohibition of domestic abuse in the civil, criminal, or family codes. The Constitution establishes the primacy of international law obligations over national law and therefore binds Morocco to CEDAW and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Thus, women must rely on general battery provisions in the penal code. Some argue that the 2011 Constitution’s prohibition of “all violations of physical or moral integrity” extends to domestic violence, though this is not explicitly articulated. Reform of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP) also helped in this regard.   While Law 103.13 is a significant step towards the conscious elevation of women’s legal status in Morocco, the realization of the rights contained therein are subject to several limitations when it comes to implementation.  Notably, the justice system is splintered along geographic lines because of the disparate treatment, remedies, and access afforded to women in urban and rural regions. Conservative rural areas of Morocco have less access to civic education and legal literacy, and thus many women in rural areas are not aware of their legal rights. Consequently, rural women are often unaware of the legal opportunities available to them and remain untrusting of formal justice systems.  While social realities must be considered by legislators, the law has an educational function and sets norms for what society thinks is right and what is wrong.  To harness the transformative power of the law, it is crucial that those responsible for enforcement are also held accountable for following through with their obligations in accord with the letter of the law. * Leila Hanafi is a Moroccan-American international development lawyer, is a Board member of Morocco World News, recipient of doctorate in law from the UK, principal of ARPA International Law firm www.arpainternational.org

Rabat – Morocco and France have signed a partnership agreement on cereals. France showed interest in exporting its wheat to the Moroccan market. Chakib Alj, president of the National Federation of Mills (FNM) and Philippe Heusele, president of France Export Cereales signed the agreement on Tuesday in Casablanca, as part of the 21st conference on “The Franco-Moroccan Meetings of Cereals.”  The three-year agreement will enable the two parties to develop their training for grain milling and boost the cereal trade between France and Morocco. Under the agreement, both parties will provide training in “laboratory management, training technicians as instructors in France, or granting educational materials to students of Casablanca’s Training Institute for the Milling industry (IFIM).” In addition to training for milling, the agreement also focuses on bread making. “There is also a part on laboratory and analysis to develop the Moroccan bakery, confectionery, and milling industry,” Heusele said. “France, the world’s fourth largest exporter of milling wheat, has exemplary relations with Morocco, both politically and economically. French grain farmers want the start of the marketing campaign to be an opportunity to consolidate and further strengthen these commercial exchanges,” explained Heusele in the conference. “France has the quantity and quality to supply the Moroccan market with up to 50 percent of its wheat imports,” Heusele told Reuters. However, on the sidelines of the conference, Alj said priority on imports would be given to Russian and Ukrainian wheat which have “the best quality-price offer,” according to Reuters. In a previous statement to Les Eco, Alj said France no longer has the same presence in Morocco’s imports. “Before, France accounted for 60 to 70 percent of our imports. Today, it is between 30 percent to 40 percent.” Although Morocco is interested in Russian and Ukrainian markets, Thierry de Boussac, of the national union of foreign trade of grains in France, indicated that “France presents itself this year under better conditions.” Alj stated that Morocco will start importing French wheat in February or March “depending on whether there is still Russian or Ukrainian wheat available,” Reuters reported. France Export Cereales expected that Morocco would import 3 million ton of soft wheat between 2018 and 2019. The conference brought together over 300 participants, including 50 experts who were international traders, hardware dealers, technical experts, and institutional experts in the Moroccan and European cereals sectors. The meeting was held under the patronage of French Ambassador to Morocco Jean-François Girault.

Rabat – Morocco’s relationship with its Jewish communities has been the subject of wide interest—both scholarly and journalistic—in recent years. While the world generally views the Arab-Jewish relationship as conflictual and continuously tumultuous, a recent message by King Mohammed VI to a symposium on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, has opted for the contrary. The King said that, at least in the Moroccan context, peaceful coexistence between Jewish and Muslims is real and has been so for generations. Drawing attention to a history of peaceful coexistence between different faiths in Morocco, the King reiterated Morocco’s desire to not only fight anti-semitism, but also to promote religious tolerance and open-mindedness in school. The message was delivered by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani at a roundtable on “The power of education in preventing racism and discrimination: the case of anti-Semitism.” The King underlined Morocco’s historical role as a champion of religious dialogue and peaceful cohabitation. Antisemitism, the King said, “provides a breeding ground for violent extremism and growing insecurity.” He added, “Anti-Semitism is the antithesis of freedom of expression. It implies a denial of the other and is an admission of failure, inadequacy and an inability to coexist. It implies an anachronistic return to a mystified past.” The King called participants at the UN roundtable to “promote education for peace” and invest in education and culture to win the battle against the proliferation of exclusive and racist ideologies. The legacy of exclusion and suspicion, he concluded, should not be passed on to future generations. Following the King’s message, a number of international media outlets have speculated about the implications of the King’s insistence on religious cohabitation and the teaching in Moroccan schools of an inclusive and comprehensive approach to history.  Journalists have raised the possibility that Morocco might include the Holocaust and other episodes of Jewish history in Moroccan history textbooks.  The King’s message, they argued, points to a willingness to integrate historical episodes that were previously sidelined or ignored by Moroccan textbooks. But whether King Mohammed’s insistence on a collective and inclusive Jewish-Muslim history will indeed be taken into account in the country’s history textbooks is bound to remain media speculations.  The Moroccan Ministry of Education did not respond to Morocco World News repeated requests for comment. Fatima Ouahmi, head of the ministry’s communication department, told us that she is “not qualified to answer.” Agence France Press (AFP) also reported earlier today they contacted the communication department of the Ministry of Education for comments. The ministry refrained from commenting, telling AFP to refer to the original message. The King has not ordered the government to include the Holocaust in Moroccan school books, AFP reported. Rachid Aguadou, the director of the cabinet of the Ministry of Education was unreachable. While King Mohammed VI’s much-reported message has taken on a new meaning in media circles, especially given the context of the King’s continued focus on youth-related matters, headlines about the complex history of Moroccan Jews have been around much longer. In October 2017, Israeli outlet Haaretz reported a partnership between Morocco and the US Holocaust Museum to “educate about the Holocaust and counter intolerance.”  Prince Moulay Rachid endorsed the museum’s proposal on Morocco’s behalf. He was reported to have accepted the museum’s suggestion to work on a project “to bring the lessons of the past to address the lessons of the present and to make a better tomorrow.” Haaretz added that museum director Sara Bloomfield invited Prince Moulay Rachid to attend another event in Washington, D.C., to honor his grandfather, King Mohammed V, “who refused to hand over Jewish Moroccans to the Vichy France occupier during the Nazi period.” For all the positive accounts about Morocco’s genuine concern for its Jewish population and government-backed efforts to integrate minorities in the public sphere through various cultural events or participation in international forums on socio-religious tolerance, the numbers and historical records tell a mixed tale.  In a 2016 book on Jewish-Muslim cohabitation in Morocco, the Moroccan historian Mohammed Kenbib retraces the trajectory of Moroccan Jews between 1858 and 1948 to the present, shedding enormous historical light on inter-community relations in Morocco.  The book pointed to Morocco’s dwindling Jewish populations since 1948, between the creation of the State of Israel and mounting fear among Jews around the world about their security and well-being in other parts of the world.  Raising questions about remnants of Morocco’s Jewry and the ties now binding Morocco with its Jewish communities—both living in Morocco and dispersed across the globe, Kenbib speaks of the Jewish presence in Morocco in terms of one of the North African kingdom’s greatest cultural and historical assets.  Kenbib’s book, however, is rueful and nostalgic about the gradual loss of Morocco’s Jewish heritage. Whereas in 1948 Morocco had over 265,000 Jews, the numbers today are just somewhere around 10,000, Kenbib’s various sources concurred.  Other sources say as few as 3,000 Jews live in Morocco today, indicating the general tendency towards emigration to places where they feel relatively more safe. The majority of Jews of Moroccan descent now live in France, Israel, the US, and Canada, while thousands others are disseminated around in the world. Despite the massive emigration of Moroccan Jews, Morocco’s current tiny Jewish community still remains the highest in number among Jewish communities in the Arab world.  And, like King Mohammed VI’s message at the UN symposium, Kenbib’s book is filled with suggestions and historical examples of functional cohabitation between Muslims and Jewish Moroccans.  The thesis stands in stark contrast with the suggestion that the entirety of the Arab world has been historically founded on the marginalization and downright exclusion of Jewish communities.

Rabat- Fez’s Court of Appeals has sentenced the man trying to rape a boy in a hammam (sauna) to five years in prison. The child’s father reportedly dropped the charges, but the court still handed down its ruling on Tuesday, October 9. The 60-year old man was caught trying to rape the child in a public hammam in Bensouda neighborhood in Fez.  A three-minute video which circulated social media last week shows the suspect walking around the hammam, begging the other men, who had caught him in the act, to let him go. Not denying the accusations, the man repeated: “Please let me go; I will never do it again.” The man filming the video interviewed the child. The victim said that the man had told him to come with him to the hammam and that he would pay for him. When they entered, the man asked him to take his underwear off so it would not get wet. The incident was not the first pedophile scandal to hit Fez. In January, Fez police arrested a 58-year-old French pedophile who raped two little girls. The pedophile was drugging and raping the minors. Admitting to his crimes, the Frenchman claimed that he could give the children “what they were deprived of: toys, food, gifts and money.” In March, the Fez appeals court gave an eight-year prison sentence to the pedophile.

Rabat – Spanish multinational oil and gas company CEPSA has chosen Morocco as a preferred destination to expand its presence. The company aims to expand in northern Morocco because it represents for CEPSA a “preferred market for expansion due to its proximity to our refineries on the south coast of Spain.” The company expressed its interest in a prospectus published on October 2. According to the document, CEPSA’s presence in Morocco is limited to one joint venture, Petrosud. CEPSA holds a 35% stake in Petrosud, “which is focused on the marketing of marine oil at the port of Agadir.” CEPSA notes, “The project has a storage facility with a capacity of 10,000 m3, as well as a license for the operation of ten service stations in Morocco, which are managed by our joint venture partner, Afriquia.” The company said that it aims to develop an “integrated downstream business in the north of Morocco.” CEPSA wants to focus on retail, business to business sales, and storage. “In July 2018, we established a 50/50 joint venture with a local partner to commence the development of our business in Morocco, with the objective of opening 30 points of sale by 2020, 100 points of sale by 2023 and a 15% market share in the medium-term (by number of service stations),” the prospectus says. An expert in fuel retail, the company wants to increase fuel volume sales to 4 percent in the medium-term. It also wants to increase the number of service stations to 1,940 stations in Europe, the Canary Islands, and Morocco.

Rabat – Nasser Zefzafi, a jailed Moroccan political activist, is now one of the three finalists for the 2018 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought.  Members of the European Parliament in the foreign affairs and development committees voted yesterday to choose the three finalists of the Sakharov Prize. Nasser Zefzafi, along with Oleg Sentsov, a Ukranian filmmaker, and NGOs working to save migrants in the Mediterranean sea, are now competing for the prize. On October 25, the European Parliament’s Conference of Presidents and the leaders of some political groups will vote again to elect the Sakharov Prize winner. The award ceremony will be held in Strasbourg on December 12.  To spotlight Morocco’s Hirak movement and its demands, the Group of the United Left nominated Zefzafi, according to Marie-Christine Vergiat, a leftist member of the EU Parliament. The same group nominated Zefzafi in 2017 after Ahmed Zefzafi, Nasser’s father, toured Europe to raise support for his son’s liberation.  A Moroccan court sentenced Nasser Zefzafi on June 26 to 20 years in prison for undermining public order and threatening national unity. The sentence, which 2018 Sakharov Prize, is very controversial. It was followed by a wave of protests throughout the country, especially in the northern Rif region, where the Hirak movement originated.  Zefzafi’s case and the Hirak movement resulted in the indignation of a number of international figures. The Dutch foreign minister, Stef Blok, told Morocco’s minister of foreign affairs, Nasser Bourita, that the Moroccan government “had not been effective in responding to the grievances of the people who took to the streets.”  Bourita has criticized the Dutch remarks on Morocco’s domestic affairs.  Leftist MEP Marie-Christine Vergiat declared she wanted to show solidarity with Moroccan people asking for social justice, human rights, and dignity. The Group of the United Left is also demanding the release of all Hirak prisoners. An estimated 400 protestors were rounded up and arrested in 2017. On August 21, King Mohammed VI pardoned 184 Hirak prisoners, but Zefzafi was not one of them.

Rabat – Hatice Cengiz, the fiancée of the missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, has pleaded with the Trump administration to “shed light” on his disappearance. “More than a week has passed since our last meeting outside the consulate of Saudi Arabia, before his disappearance became global news,” began Cengiz’ opinion article in the Washington Post. Khashoggi had been a regular contributor to the newspaper. According to Cengiz, Jamal Khashoggi went into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to complete paperwork for the couple’s wedding plans.
Despite Khashoggi’s opinionated criticism of the Saudi regime, he still believed, “The tension between himself and Saudi Arabia did not amount to hate, grudges or threats,” his fiancée wrote. “At this time, I implore President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump to help shed light on Jamal’s disappearance. I also urge Saudi Arabia, especially King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to show the same level of sensitivity and release CCTV footage from the consulate.”
Following news of the journalist’s disappearance, many—including Turkish government officials—said that the most plausible explanation was a kill-and-dispose operation at the consulate. Last week, in an interview with Bloomberg, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) said that Saudi officials “have nothing to hide.” MBS added that, as far as Saudi Arabia is concerned, Jamal Khashoggi left the consulate building moments after completing paperwork. But the journalist’s fiancée said that she accompanied him to the Saudi consulate building, where she decided to wait outside, and he never came out. “After seeing how relaxed he was, I waited patiently and full of hope. But after three hours I was overcome with fear and concern. I texted a few friends to inform them, and I asked about Jamal at the consular building. I received an answer that further fueled my fears: Jamal had already left, they told me, possibly without my noticing.” She added: “This much is true: He entered the consulate, and there is no proof that he came out.” Amid reports of a possible diplomatic feud between Turkey and Saudi Arabia over the Khashoggi case, Saudi Arabia has agreed for Turkey to search the Saudi consulate. Turkish outlet Hurriyet reported on Tuesday that 7 Saudi suspects have already been identified by Turkish authorities.

Rabat – The statistics-based website Global Firepower (GFP) has ranked Morocco 55th among 136 countries in the 2018 military strength ranking. According to the GFP report, “The Moroccan military uses a mix of old and new equipment while having several hundred thousand active and reserve personnel on call.” Morocco was ranked 57th in the 2017 military strength ranking. GFP is an annually-updated, statistics-based website which “tracks defense-related information of over 135 nations and exists as an independent resource.” The US has the strongest military, followed by Russia (2nd), China (3rd), India (4th), France (5th), the United Kingdom (6th). Spain was ranked 19th. Morocco’s military ranks among the top three in Africa after Egypt (12th) and Algeria (23rd). The Global Firepower index is based on over 50 factors, including manpower, airpower, land strength, naval strength, petroleum, logistics, defense budget, geography, and external debt. According to GFP’s statistics, Morocco has 373,000 military personnel (198,000 active members and 175,000 reserve) and 17 million “available” manpower, including more than 14.4 million people who are fit for military service. Morocco’s government recently introduced a bill on obligatory military service. The government council and the ministerial council approved the bill on August 20, but it has not yet been passed by Parliament. Young people aged 19-25 would be required to serve 12 months in the military. The government said the objective is to “inculcate the spirit of citizenship in young people as part of a correlation between the rights and duties of citizenship.”  The US has over 2 million military personnel; Egypt has 1.3 million; Algeria has 790,000; and Saudi Arabia has 260,000. However, Spain has only 170,000 military personnel. Morocco-Spain-Algeria Arms Race? Military buildup in Algeria and Morocco, which have the strongest African militaries excluding Egypt, has prepared the countries for any possible armed conflict. In October 1963, Morocco and Algeria fought the Sand War over the border near Figuig, eastern Morocco. There is also tension between the countries over the Western Sahara conflict in which Algeria plays a major part supporting Polisario. “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario,” wrote King Mohammed VI in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on April 4. GFP also stated Morocco owns 284 aircraft, including 56 fighters, 56 attack planes, and 130 helicopters. Algeria has 528, including 97 fighters, 107 attack planes, 280 helicopters, and 46 attack helicopters. In August, the Spanish outlet Infodefensa reported that Spanish satellite images showed, “Morocco already has at least 127 of the almost two hundred Abrams M1A1 tanks.” Morocco ordered the tanks from the US in 2015. The order also included associated parts, equipment, logistical support, and training for over $1 billion. Mohammed Chakir, a Moroccan expert on military affairs, told Moroccan news outlet Hespress that Infodefensa’s article “is a reflection of the Spanish concern as an arms race exists between Rabat, Madrid, and Algeria.” Morocco possesses 1,276 combat tanks, 2,348 armored fighting vehicles (AFV) and more than 700 artilleries of three different types: 448 self-propelled artilleries, 192 towed artilleries, and 72 rocket projectors. Spain has only 327 combat tanks and a few more AFVs than: 2,493. Since 2012, the North African country has made significant additions to its military equipment by  acquiring 450 tanks, 600 armored vehicles, and 130 artillery batteries, according to a study conducted by the Spanish think tank International Security Studies Group (GESI). “The many disagreements between Spain and Morocco, mainly the dispute over the occupied cities of Ceuta and Melilla, make decision makers in Spain closely follow any military deal concluded by Morocco, especially with the US, which is known for its most sophisticated industry weapons,” Chakir explained. Morocco has half the number of combat tanks that Algeria has at 2,405. The neighboring country also owns 6,754 AFVs and 666 artilleries, including 220 self-propelled artilleries, 270 towed artilleries, and 176 rocket projectors. Morocco has twice the number of self-propelled artilleries that Algeria has. Spain has even fewer artilleries, just 239 Morocco’s navy has 121 naval assets, 6 frigates, and 22 patrol vessels. Spain has only 46 naval assets, while Algeria has 85. Morocco’s defense budget 1/3 of Algeria’s Morocco spends $3.4 billion annually on its defense budget and ranks 51st in spending globally.  The figure is low compared to militarily-strong countries, such as the US, which has the world’s biggest annual defense budget at $647 billion. It is followed by China ($151 billion) and Saudi Arabia (more than $56.7 billion). Spain spends $11.6 billion annually on its defense budget. An Israeli think tank, the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), estimated Morocco’s annual defense budget at $3.5 billion currently and wrote in May that it would reach $4 billion in 2022. Morocco spends less on its defense than Algeria ($10.57 billion) and Egypt ($4.4 billion). On September 20, the US Department of Defence announced that Morocco concluded a new contract to supply its Royal Armed Forces with M4 carbine rifles and navy systems. Morocco’s military strength serves its objectives of eliminating any external attack, protecting territorial sovereignty, and combating regional terrorism.  Given the continuous tension between Morocco and Algeria?especially over the Western Sahara conflict with the Algerian-funded Polisario, the North African country is determined to develop its military equipment and  strengthen its army.

Rabat – Amid political tension on migration, many Moroccan doctors in the public sector are threatening to go overseas to look for better opportunities. Morocco’s Independent Union of Public Sector Doctors published a statement on October 1 to condemn the “critical” situation of the health sector in Morocco. The union said that the statement is the result of a one year struggle with the Ministry of Health, which has failed to act. Throughout the year, the union has carried out a series of national protests to express their anger over the situation. The statement announced that the union will emphasize their anger next week under the title “Doctor’s Week of Anger.” The focus will be from October 15 to October 21, 2018. Doctors said in the statement that they will give no consultations from October 15 to October 19. They will also not give any kind of medical certificates throughout the period. The union will also organize national strikes tomorrow, October 11, and Friday, October 26, except for emergency rooms. Read Also: Moroccan Doctors Tempted to Emigrate for Better Conditions The union condemns the small percentage of the government’s budget dedicated to the health sector, “which falls within 5 percent. We need at least 10 percent, according to the World Organization for Health.” The Moroccan doctors also denounced the shutting down of many health centers, depriving the public of services. The statement also addressed the lack of appropriate infrastructure in many hospitals and health centers. Echoing a recent report from the Court of Auditors, the union condemned corruption in the sector. In its 2016-2017 annual report, the Court of Auditors identified irregularities in many hospital centers across the country. Read Also: Read Also: Moroccan Doctors Go on Strike Over Working Conditions The annual report, which was made public on August 27, condemned long delays for appointments in Moroccan hospitals, which can exceed 10 months. The court considered that the long delays were primarily due to a lack of scheduling. The union’s statement expressed “surprise” that the government “remains silent” over the complaints and protests of doctors and has not responded or intervened to save the health sector, “which has become a source of social tension.” Printed in a bold red font, the statement addressed a clear message to the government, emphasizing the union’s future intentions. The union threatened to submit a collective resignation for doctors and to conduct research on the desire of all doctors to emigrate. Emigration: solution or problem? The union believes that emigration can solve the problems doctors experience in Morocco. Moroccan author and critic Abderrahim Elalam shared his views on the emigration of highly-qualified people with Morocco World News. “Some recent reports have confirmed that thousands of highly skilled people and owners of important companies have left Morocco,” he said. Read Also: EU Commission Wants More Security Cooperation with Morocco Against Undocumented Immigration Elalam said that economic and social reasons are not the only factors causing emigration, but “there is frustration in several areas, including politics and  freedoms.” According to the scholar, work conditions also contribute to brain drain. He added that in Morocco, there is a lack of freedom to take initiative and employees’ efforts are generally not rewarded. Commenting on the union’s statement, Elalam said collective migration does not exist. He explained that it is a protest tactic to pressure the government. Elalam, however, agreed with the union that the government should respond to their demands because they seek to upgrade the health sector. Oum Kaltoum Harati, a Moroccan doctor in Canada, told MWN, “Doctors travel overseas to undergo a new way of practicing medicine.” She said that this experience “gives them an opportunity to open up to the world and learn more about cultures and beliefs.” She said that she encourages doctors to look for opportunities overseas to grow their medical knowledge. Earlier this month, King Mohammed VI urged the government to accelerate plans to increase youth employment through training centers. Elalam said that these promises from the government have been introduced several times. He said that even Lahcen Daoudi, who served as minister of education in 2012, also emphasized the need for vocational training. But there needs to be action, Elalam said.

She also said it could be a campaign against Lamjarred because of his success. While promoting the Moroccan dialect of Arabic worldwide, Lamjarred has achieved stardom in the Arab world. She added that the Moroccan singer is faithful to his roots and his country, saying Lamjarred is an “exception” because he shared love.

She also denied media rumors that the Lamjarred family had sued the Tunisian channel “Elhiwar Ettounsi’s” director, who had broadcast a comedy show mocking their son. Dressed in orange and chained, the Saad Lamjarred mimic came into the show’s court cursing and intimidating people around him. He stood to face the plaintiff, Laura Prioul, and began an argument in which each tried to defend themselves. In her post, Akroud denied that Lamjarred’s mother and renowned actress Nazha Reguragui sued the program because his family is far from the “culture of hate.” Akroud received both support and condemnation in her post. Some said that she made a good point, while others said that they would unfollow her, expressing surprise about her support for a “rapist.” Saad Lamjarred is facing trials in an October 2016 rape and an August 2018 rape. In early September, a French appeals court issued an order to remand the Moroccan singer to custody, on the prosecutor’s appeal of his prior release on bail.

Rabat- Some 2,500 Moroccan seasonal workers in Spain have declared that they will not return to Morocco. In January, Spain agreed to hire 10,400 Moroccan agricultural workers to pick strawberries and other berries for the April to June harvest season. The agreement was made in a meeting between 18 representatives of agricultural firms and officials from Spain’s General Directorate for Migration. According to the Moroccan-Spanish commission, which had organized the workers’ travel, 2,500 (17 percent) of the workers have declared their wish to stay in Spain, reported news outlet Lakome. The workers were scheduled to return to their home country once the agricultural season ends.  During the application process, the Moroccan government had said that it would prioritize seasonal workers who were married, have experience in the field, and were committed to returning to Morocco after the harvest. Many previous Moroccan seasonal farmers in Spain have not returned after the expiration of their contracts and are either living illegally in Spain or have become regularized. The Spanish countryside is home to workers from a number of European and South American countries. Most workers have migrated to Spain from Bulgaria, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Ukraine and Pakistan, along with others from African countries. Several women working seasonally in Huelva province in Spain filed complaints against their employers for sexual assault in May.  The US-based online media company Buzzfeed was the first to recount their stories. Later, several news outlets, including Spain’s El Mundo and El Pais, reported on the conditions of the Moroccan farmers in Huelva. Morocco’s Ministry of Employment also carried out an investigation on the Spanish farms. After a Moroccan-Spanish delegation visited the farms, the ministry maintained that “no specific case of abuse or violation against Moroccan workers was found.” In June, Moroccan and Spanish women rallied in Huelva in a march of solidarity with the seasonal workers, denouncing the alleged sexual assaults. The minister of employment, Mohamed Yatim, said on October 2 that Moroccan-Spanish cooperation on seasonal employment has “positive results.” According to Yatim, Morocco and Spain should revise the employment agreement to allow for “candidate selection procedures to be adapted to new situations and to open up new social rights for seasonal workers, including retirement.”

Rabat – With more migrants using the western Mediterranean route to reach Europe, the EU Commission has invited Morocco to a meeting on migration. Spanish news outlet EFE reported on October 8 that the date for the meeting on migration has not yet been set.  The news outlet had scant information about the meeting. However, European sources confirmed the news to EFE. The European Council will meet October 18. During the meeting, a report on migration will be presented, according to the EU Council’s agenda. Spain is expected to be the voice of Morocco in that meeting since it has been putting pressure on the EU to fund Morocco’s efforts to control the border. In a two-day working trip earlier this month, the Spanish secretary of state for migration, Maria del Consuelo Rumi Ibanez said, “The European dream does not exist.” Read Also: ‘The European Dream Is a lie:’ Spain Tells Morocco to Curb Migration She added that Europe is no longer what it used to be, and immigration to the continent no longer brings the socio-economic advantages it brought to earlier generations. Migration issues have put pressure on Morocco as a transit country and on Spain, which represents a dreamland for many migrants. Morocco’s royal navy has resorted to gunfire on two migrant boats attempting to reach Europe. On September 25, Morocco’s navy opened fire on a go-fast boat, killing a 20-year-old woman, Hayat Belkacem, off the coast of M’diq and Fnideq, northern Morocco. This morning, the royal navy reportedly opened fire on a boat and shot a 16-year-old boy. The incident occurred between Larache and Asilah off Morocco’s northern Atlantic coast. The boat was carrying 50 irregular Moroccan migrants. Read Also: Spain Pressures EU to Support Morocco on Migration A military source told AFP after the September 25 incident that the migrants were hidden under a tarp, which made it impossible for the navy to see the migrants onboard. Morocco’s Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid also defended the navy, saying that the target was the captain of the boat. He said go-fast boats are often used for trafficking other illegal substances, including drugs. The go-fast boats reportedly offer Moroccans free rides to Europe. Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum reported on October 2 that the boats are “trafficking mafias” employing a new strategy against Morocco’s security forces. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said that such mafias resorted to free rides because of the security pressure on mafias, who are seeking to “confuse citizens and the homeland.”

Rabat – Morocco and the United States were the only two countries invited to take part in a summit of the European Union’s G6 in Lyon. Morocco’s Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit represented Morocco during a summit of the interior ministers of the EU’s six biggest countries on terrorism and migration. The summit, which kicked off Monday, marks the participation of France, Germany, the UK, Spain, Italy, and Poland. Morocco’s participation represents a recognition of its efforts to tackle border and migration issues as well as terrorism. The two-day summit covered several challenges related to security, terrorism, and the management of irregular migration flows. The talks also discussed ways to ensure stability in the Sahel region, which represents a threat to the world. Several security officials, including Morocco’s head of the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) Abdelhak Khiame, have warned the world of the situation in the Sahel, which has become a safe zone for criminal networks. In October 2017, the US pledged financial support to the Group of Five Sahel States (G5 Sahel), Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad, to counter the growing terror threat in West Africa. Morocco’s participation in the G6 aims also to show commitment to its role of handling migration issues in the country and overseas. Read Also: US Touts Partnership with Morocco against Terror Threats A transit country for migrants, Morocco is promising to end the threat posed by migration networks and trafficking of humans from Morocco to Europe.

Rabat- After killing Hayat, the Moroccan navy has shot a 16-year-old boy aboard a migrant boat on Wednesday morning between Larache and Asilah off Morocco’s northern Atlantic coast. The navy fired warning shots at the boat carrying about 50 Moroccan irregular migrants, shooting a minor, according to Moroccan television channel 2M and news outlet Alyaoum24. Authorities have not yet reported any further details on the victim’s situation. It is the second time the navy has shot at a migrant boat.  On September 25, while firing on a migrant boat trying to cross the Mediterranean between M’diq and Fnideq, the Moroccan navy killed one of the migrants, a 20-year-old woman, Hayat Belkacem. Three other Moroccans in the boat were also wounded by the navy’s gunfire, Lahabib (26), Hamza (25), and Mouad (32). They were hospitalized in M’diq-Fnideq prefecture. The boat was controlled by a Spanish national. Hayat’s death has inspired protests in the country from Moroccans who vowed to bring “justice” to Hayat. Some of the protesters cried, “The people want to give up their nationality.” Others called on the government to hold Hayat’s “killer” accountable. The shooting also sparked the anger of Prince Moulay Hicham, a first cousin of King Mohammed VI. He took to his Twitter to convey his concern about the “social crisis.” Lately, Morocco has employed stricter methods of combating irregular migration to Europe, especially in the north. Police also blocked hundreds of Moroccans trying to leave for Europe from a beach in Martil, near Tetouan, on Saturday night, September 22, which led to protests calling for “free immigration.”

Rabat- The Moroccan Coalition Against the Death Penalty has called for a demonstration in front of Parliament to demand the abolition of the death sentence.   To bring awareness to its campaign, the coalition organized a press conference alongside the Moroccan Prisons Observatory (OMP) on Tuesday in Rabat. The coalition seeks to lead a demonstration to ask MPs to vote for the UN resolution for a “moratorium on the use of the death penalty” which the country had abstained from in 2016. The call for the demonstration is in line with the World Day Against the Death Penalty on October 10, Wednesday. The coalition will also call for the government to improve prison conditions for those already sentenced to death. Morocco’s representative to the UN, Omar Hilale, clarified that the country has maintained a de facto moratorium on the death penalty since 1993, when the last government-sanctioned execution occurred. In 2017, at least 95 people were sentenced to death in Morocco. And in contradiction to Hilale, Death Penalty Worldwide recorded more than 15 individuals were executed in 2017. The UN argues that the North African country’s position is incompatible with Articles 20 and 21 of the constitution, which guarantee the right to life to all human beings and the right to “the security of their person and of their kin.” Since the revision of the constitution in 2011 to include the “right to life,” human rights missions and NGOs have repeatedly called on Morocco to abolish the death penalty.  Human rights activists demonstrate annually in October to end the death penalty in Morocco.

Rabat – Morocco’s bid to join ECOWAS has been submitted to an independent committee of experts for legal review. The move is the final step of admissibility within the regional body. It comes a year after heads of governments in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) evaluated the political and economic aspects of Morocco’s prospective membership. The three-member review committee is composed of Ibrahima Fall, former minister of foreign affairs of Senegal; Beninese constitutional law and international expert Joel Aivo; and Ameze Guobadia, Nigerian public law professor at the University of Lagos. Mixed feelings Morocco’s ECOWAS bid, which followed the North African country’s historic return to the African Union in early 2017, has been greeted with an equal amount of reserve and support. The major suspicion of critics—in addition to the widely circulated geographical argument, Morocco not being geographically located in West Africa—is that Morocco will be a threat to the region. The great majority of ECOWAS countries are lagging miles behind in international visibility and national productivity. They argue that Morocco will disrupt the market and power balance of the organization. But Rabat’s ECOWAS aspirations have also been applauded by many, including a number of ECOWAS member states presidents, civil organizations, and internal relations experts. Morocco’s bid is particularly supported in countries like Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, and Senegal, where a bold Moroccan presence has improved public discourse on Morocco. As development is contagious, Morocco’s growing industrial sector, advanced housing sector, and evolving dynamism in many other fields will propel other lagging member states, supporters have claimed. How will the Nigerian factor impact accession? While the geographical argument and the general population’s qualms about a Moroccan accession have been reported to have slowed down the pace of negotiations, Morocco’s sluggish ECOWAS tale also includes the strategic weight that Nigeria carries in the regional body. A study published in August found that Morocco’s ECOWAS dream is still facing “serious obstacles.” The study predicted that Morocco’s accession to the regional body is “far from certain” and may take longer than expected to materialize. “We note that significant obstacles to accession remain, due to both political and economic concerns, particularly from Nigeria. This implies that membership is likely years rather months away, and may be blocked entirely.” Morocco and Nigeria have been on good diplomatic terms since the election of President Muhammadu Buhari, who is also the incumbent ECOWAS chairperson. The two leaders signed earlier this year a historic pipeline project set to promote political and economic integration in West Africa. Francophone magazine Jeune Afrique has reported that the three-member committee’s final verdict will be known in the coming days or weeks. But given the unconventional buildup that led to the final step—prolonged delays, mixed feelings, and an increasingly Africa-oriented Morocco, it remains to be seen whether the verdict will be reached as early as expected.

Rabat- Bassima Hakkaoui has postponed an award ceremony at her ministry’s headquarters following the death of blind protester who fell from its rooftop. Minister of Family and Solidarity Bassima Hakkaoui said Monday in a Facebook post that her ministry will postpone the women’s 4th excellence award ceremony, scheduled for Wednesday, to a later date. The postponement was “taking into consideration the painful incident that took place at the ministry headquarters yesterday,” she wrote. 
 Hakkaoui’s statement added salt to the wounds of angry Moroccan commenters on social media, who deemed it “insensitive.” On Sunday, 25-year-old Saber El Haloui fell off the ministry’s roof during a sit-in. The sit-in was organized by a group of blind protesters calling for jobs and began September 26. Many of El Haloui’s fellow protesters told Akhbar Alyaoum newspaper that he was speaking on the phone with his family on the rear side of the rooftops when his foot slipped. Forensics confirmed that the cause of death was not suicide.  Hakkaoui told the newspaper that the ministry was open to dialogue with protesters throughout the sit-in. She promised them for a second time that the ministry would give them jobs after processing their files. The protesters have been decrying the “injustice,” “lies,” and “false promises” of Hakkaoui, who had already said that their requests were being processed. The minister said that the protesters agreed to suspend their sit-in on Friday, October 5, however the minister was surprised to find them still at the ministry in the following days. The protesters, however, shared a different version of the story, saying that Hakkaoui did not care about them or cooperate with them. “You do not scare me; your protests are random …I am a woman of iron,’’ Hakkaoui allegedly stated, according to one protester. The protesters hold Hakkaoui responsible for El Haloui’s death, rejecting her condolences via a Facebook post. She wrote: “We wish to express our deep sorrow at this painful incident.”  The protesters were not the only ones who expressed their rage at Hakkaoui. Many Moroccans criticized the minister and her Facebook condolences. The blind men, initially calling for fair opportunities and integration into job sectors, broke into the ministry’s headquarters in Agdal, a neighborhood of Rabat, early on September 26.  The National Coordination for the Disabled, Unemployed Degree-Holders allegedly organized the break-in. During their protests, the men threatened to jump off the roof and burn themselves alive if their calls to be employed and for “dignity” and “better living conditions” were not answered. Dozens of blind protesters are currently leading a protest within the protest. They are holding an open sit-in on the ministry’s roof and in front of its doors, calling for both fair opportunities and justice for the “martyred” Saber El Haloui. The incident represents yet another social and political crisis. Hakkaoui’s controversy comes at a time when the Moroccan government is dealing with criticism over the recent death of Hayat Belkacem. The 20-year-old woman was killed by navy gunfire while aboard a Spanish go-fast boat trying to cross the Mediterranean.

Rabat – Drivers of “petit taxis” have launched a campaign to transport patients from Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah Hospital for free.  According to the state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the initiative aims to reconcile the public with taxi drivers in a spirit of solidarity.

Rabat – Algerian police have arrested an imam in the Tindouf camps for his alleged ties with terrorist groups in the Sahel. Quoting “credible sources,” Rwanda News Agency wrote on October 5 that the arrest followed a similar operation targeting two Tindouf residents for their ties with terrorist groups. The news was also reported by Gabon Review. The two suspects, according to Rwanda News Agency, used to attend mosque sermons performed by the arrested imam and later joined Boko Haram in 2010. Read Also:  Polisario Smugglers Again Deprive Tindouf Sahrawis of Humanitarian Aid The RNA warned that the Tindouf camps in southwestern Algeria are “easy prey to the recruitment of leaders affiliated with various terrorist networks, which continue to cause trouble in the region.” In recent years, Morocco has been warning the world of threats in the Sahel and Polisario’s involvement in illegal activities in the region. Morocco also blames Algeria for lack of security cooperation on the threats that undermine security in the region. In an interview on the topic, the head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Investigations (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, told Jeune Afrique that the Sahel has become a safe zone for terror cells, including ISIS and Al Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM). Khiame said that Polisario can also be referred to as a terrorist organization. He said that Morocco’s BCIJ identified more than 100 Polisario Front members operating in AQIM.

Khiame linked Polisario’s involvement in illegal activities, including human and drug trafficking, with poverty in Tindouf. Morocco’s senior security official described the Sahel region as a “fertile ground for terrorism.” He said that terrorist groups are collaborating together with traffickers while terrorists benefit from illegal activities to finance terrorism.

He said that Morocco has an “efficient” policy and security system to counter all dangers and drug trafficking. Polisario members are also allegedly involved in embezzlement of aid directed to Sahrawis living in the Tindouf camps. Pro-Polisario news outlets reported recently that Algerian grocery shops were selling aid products. The UN Secretary-General’s report on Western Sahara, submitted October 3, also discussed the malnutrition and reduction in humanitarian aid at Tindouf.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote in his report that there is frustration and anger among the Sahrawi population in the Tindouf camps “at the lack of progress in the political process,” as well as “persistent difficulties, such as malnutrition, brought about by the steady reductions in humanitarian aid.”

Rabat – Russian companies Gazprom, Novatek, and Stroytransgaz are examining their options to invest in natural gas projects in Morocco. The Russian trio of companies “are studying the possibility of co-investing in the construction of logistics facilities as well as development of gas infrastructure in Morocco’s industrial zones,” Russian Minister of Agriculture Dmitry Patrushev told Russian news agency Sputnik on October 4. Russian companies are also interested in creating joint Russian-Moroccan companies operating in “mechanical engineering, electrical appliances, and lubricants,” Patrushev added. Morocco’s energy minister, Aziz Rebbah, announced on October 1 that 80 companies are currently interested in taking on a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which is worth $4.5 billion and will soon be put to tender. The LNG project will be established in Jorf Lasfar, 120 kilometers south of Casablanca. The Russian minister also indicated that there are “promising areas for economic cooperation between Russia and Morocco,” including  transport, energy, and trade. Morocco and Russia will soon sign a draft agreement on international road transportation, he added. Last year, Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak spoke to Russian news agency TASS about Russian companies’ interest in gasification projects in Morocco. “Russian companies Gazprom and Novatek are ready to participate in big projects in Morocco, such as construction of regasification terminal, gas pipeline, and generating capacities,” Novak told TASS, on September 21, 2017. The two Russian companies “are ready to participate in this large-scale project. Talks are underway on supplies of liquefied natural gas, particularly from Russian projects Yamal-LNG and Arctic LNG,” he added.  “We are ready to supply LNG, construct gas pipeline and terminal.” Growing agriculture trade between Morocco and Russia  Russian and Moroccan officials have met early this month to discuss business cooperation between the two countries, especially increasing Morocco’s export of agricultural products. Speaking at a business breakfast devoted to strengthening trade and economic relations between Morocco and Russia, Morocco’s minister of agriculture said that agricultural products represent 77 percent of Moroccan exports to Russia, estimated at MAD 1.5 billion. During the meeting, Russian Minister Patrushev stated that the volume of bilateral trade in agricultural products and food has increased.  “Since the beginning of this year, it has amounted to more than $ 300 million, which is more than 16 percent from last year,” Patrushev added. He also noted “the agricultural trade between Russia and Morocco will grow to $ 500 million.” The total trade turnover between Morocco and Russia amounted to about $900 million, January to July, up 20 percent compared to the same period last year.  Exports from Russia to Morocco account for more than $550 million, according to Patrushev. The meeting was held as part of a mission to Morocco by the Russian Export Centre (REC) group of companies, carried out on the occasion of the seventh Moroccan-Russian Joint Intergovernmental Commission for Economic, Scientific, and Technical Cooperation.

Washington D.C. – The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, submitted to the Security Council last week his report on the situation in Western Sahara. The report urges “the parties and the neighbors to respond positively to the invitation of my Personal Envoy to come to the negotiating table in good faith and without preconditions.”  With the release of the report and its insistence on the need for the parties to return to the negotiating table, many in Morocco have been wondering whether the United Nations is putting pressure on Morocco Q5 to compel it to resume direct negotiations with the Polisario Front.  There is no doubt that there is a general trend in the Security Council that seeks to revive the stalled negotiations on the Western Sahara conflict to pave the way towards a mutually acceptable political solution. Horst Kohler, the personal envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara, appears determined to avoid the failure of his predecessor. Kohler is trying to gain the Security Council members’ support to get Morocco and Polisario to negotiate. Read Also: Western Sahara: Kohler Invites Morocco, Polisario, Algeria and Mauritania for Talks in Geneva One of the main factors behind the UN Secretariat’s renewed emphasis on the need to relaunch direct negotiations is the presence of John Bolton, a former US ambassador to the UN, in the Trump administration. The current national security adviser to President Donald Trump knows the ins and outs of the conflict and masterminded the US plan to cut its contribution to MINURSO from $16 million to $8 million next year. The Trump Administration has repeatedly called on the UN to be accountable and more effective; earlier this year it hinted at intentions to slash contributions to many peacekeeping missions, including MINURSO.  Needs to avoid the same failed approach At first glance, it appears that the Secretary-General and the Personal Envoy did not make any significant changes in the UN’s approach since the adoption of Resolution 1754 in April 2007. The Secretary-General’s and the Personal Envoy’s invitation for Morocco and Polisario to begin negotiations to define the main framework of future negotiations–without taking into account Morocco’s firm position–risks locking the political process in a prolonged stalemate. Read Also: Bolton Is Unlikely to Change US Position on Western Sahara The Secretary-General and the Personal Envoy have not drawn lessons from the experience of their predecessors. They do not have the courage to break new ground by recognizing that the approach of the past 10 years has proved a failure and ultimately prolonged the conflict. If the UN is unrealistic about Algeria’s central role in the Western Sahara conflict as well as its diplomatic, military, and financial support for Polisario, there will be no progress in the political process. While Algeria claims that it has no role  in the conflict, it continues to pay the Washington-based PR firm Foley Hoag over $400,000 annually to lobby members of US Congress in defense of  Polisario.  According to information available on the website of the US Department of Justice’s Foreign Agent Registration Act, Foley Hoag is listed as a firm carrying out lobbying activities in the US Congress on behalf of Algeria. However, the main focus of the firm’s work has been to defend Polisario and thwart any Moroccan attempt to obtain widespread bicameral and bipartisan support from the US Congress. Paul S. Reichler, the chair of the firm’s international litigation department, signed a lobbying contract with Polisario in February 1992.  Instead of taking these facts into account and readjusting its approach accordingly, the United Nations prefers to overlook them.  Morocco will not be forced to negotiate with Polisario  As I predicted in an article I published last week, Morocco responded favorably to the Personal Envoy’s request to attend the Geneva talks in December. Morocco, however, will respond to the Security Council’s calls only to show its goodwill and determination to reach a mutually acceptable political solution. Morocco is convinced that nothing will result from those talks.  Morocco will use the upcoming Geneva talks to reaffirm its firm position that there will be no solution if Algeria does not attend as a major party to the conflict and that negotiations should be based on the autonomy plan that Morocco submitted to the Security Council in April 2007. Despite pressure from the US to push the political process forward, Morocco will not necessarily be forced to sit at the negotiating table. Morocco has some diplomatic leverage and enjoys the support of many representatives of the US House, as well as a significant number of State Department staff. There are many indications that the US is not prepared to take a hostile attitude towards Morocco on this issue: the 2018 annual budget recommended that part of the US financial support to Morocco be allocated to Morocco in Western Sahara and the latest State Department report on the human rights situation described Polisario as “separatists.” Additionally, Moroccan diplomatic efforts to win the sympathy of Congress towards the Moroccan position resulted in a draft resolution being submitted by three members of the House of Representatives. The draft resolution condemns the alleged complicity between Polisario and Hezbollah to undermine Morocco’s stability and calls on the US State Department to support Moroccan positions in the UN. Although such decisions are not binding for the US State Department, if approved by Congress, it would endorse Morocco’s position on the Western Sahara issue and give Morocco a great boost. Polisario loses allies in the House of Representatives Polisario no longer has strong champions in the US House of Representatives, especially after the former president of the Western Sahara Caucus, Joseph Pitts, retired at the end of 2016. To make things worse, the other co-chair of the caucus, Democrat John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, was forced to resign in December 2017 because of his involvement in a sexual assault scandal. Through Congressional meetings, these two members of the House of Representatives played an instrumental role in bringing the attention of the Obama Administration to the issue of the alleged violations of human rights in Western Sahara. The draft resolution that former US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice submitted to the Security Council in April 2013, which called for the monitoring of human rights in Western Sahara, was the direct result of the campaign the two members of Congress launched in Washington, D.C. Accordingly, even if the upcoming UN Security Council resolution explicitly calls for the parties to the conflict to enter direct negotiations, Morocco will have ample time to mobilize its friends in Washington to obtain support, pursue its agenda, and to ensure that a political solution is contingent on engaging Algeria as a major party to the negotiations. However, Morocco should double down on its efforts more than ever before to gain the sympathy and support of the US Senate. While Morocco has broad support within the House of Representatives, it does not maintain the same favorable position with the Senate. Thanks to the advocacy work performed by the PR firm Foley Hoag, some members of the Senate, such as Lindsay Graham (a Republican representing South Carolina), Patrick Leahy (a Democrat representing Vermont) and James Inhofe (a Republican representing Oklahoma), have consistently supported the positions of Algeria and Polisario and made sure that US budget laws contained no references to Algeria’s major role in the conflict.  The meetings that Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita held with Senators Ted Cruz (Republican from Texas), Lindsay Graham, and Todd Young in September are a step in the right direction and seem aimed at fighting the Polisario on its turf. It remains to be seen to what extent the Moroccan initiative will get the Senate to be friendlier to Morocco’s position on the conflict. For this scenario to happen, Moroccan efforts and advocacy should be sustained and target other influential members of the Senate. Morocco should also emphasize that stability in the region is of paramount importance to US strategic interests. Without clear and unambiguous support from the Senate, Moroccan efforts to get the full backing of Congress will fall short of achieving their goal, no matter how much support Rabat receives from the House of Representatives.   Samir Bennis is the co-founder of Morocco World News.

Rabat – The EU might favorably answer Morocco’s call for support as the Spanish government is pressuring the EU to meet Morocco’s demands. Spanish news outlet El Pais reported today that Spain has repeatedly expressed Morocco’s migration concerns to the EU. The news outlet added that the EU “is preparing an imminent response” as Spain’s sense of urgency has been “sharpened.” The heavy migratory challenges have “exhausted” Morocco and Spain’s patience. Contacted by El Pais, diplomatic sources did not unveil the funds the EU will give to Morocco. “But they estimate that they surpass the almost 30 million” already committed to meet Morocco’s demands for equipment. El Pais quoted a government source saying, “Morocco is asserting its status as a responsible partner, but considers that the response to the migration phenomenon should be based on the principle of shared responsibility.”  In August, the EU commission president responded to Spain’s request to provide Morocco with resources to curb migration. Jean-Claude Juncker said that both “Spain and Morocco can be assured of the full support of the EU commission in effectively responding to the increasing migratory pressure along the Western Mediterranean route.” In July, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, asked the EU to provide Morocco with “emergency assistance to tackle the migration issue.” The president of the EU commission acknowledged that the situation requires additional funding. Migration mafias continue to develop irregular strategies Besides go-fast boats, migration networks are developing strategies for migration and human trafficking. Some traffic migrants through family cars driving from Morocco to the Spanish enclave of Melilla. Akhbar Al Yaoum newspaper reported on October 8 that Spanish authorities unveiled the existence of a human trafficking network that could traffic 200 Moroccans through family cars to allude Spanish and Moroccan security forces. The newspaper added that the network trafficked 44 undocumented migrants by car in the last three months. Moroccan police allegedly arrested three Moroccans involved in the network. Akhbar Al Yaoum reported that the three suspects charge MAD 45,000 for each migrant.  The paper added that most of the “victims” of the migration networks are from sub-Saharan Africa. The network allegedly has 52 members. Moroccan police arrested only 9 members and seized 40 cars.

Rabat – Germany has significantly increased its number of deportations to the Maghreb region since 2015. According to a study published by the German media outlet Bild, the number of deportations from Germany to Morocco rose from 61 in 2015, to 634 in 2017. During the first eight months of this year, 476 Moroccans faced deportation.  Tunisia and Algeria also saw similar rises in figures in the last three years. The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained the rise in deportations by increased cooperation with countries in the Maghreb.  The recent use of biometric identification by North African countries that enhanced the electronic exchange of information also played an important part.  The German government, in an effort to repatriate asylum seekers from the Maghreb, officially defined Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia as “safe countries,” and voted for a law in this regard in July.      The measures came after several assaults on women on New Year’s Eve in 2015 in Cologne by North African men and last December’s terrorist attack in Berlin committed by the Tunisian Anis Amri who had initially sought asylum.  Human rights activists in Germany still oppose the government’s decision to consider the Maghreb as “safe” asserting discrimination targeting homosexuals, lack of freedom of expression, and cases of torture.

Rabat – Spanish media sources have reported that Spain’s maritime rescue service saved around 325 migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean Monday morning. Spain’s Maritime Rescue Service said Saturday, October 6, its coast guard rescued 500 migrants in the Strait of Gibraltar after detecting many African migrants attempting to cross. The migrants were pulled from 15 small boats heading towards the Spanish shores. During the first intervention by the Cadiz services, approximately 86 migrants, including three women, were saved. On Sunday, October 7, around 230 migrants aboard 5 boats were saved and transported to Algeciras for medical care. Most of the immigrants are from sub-Saharan African nations. More sub-Saharan undocumented immigrants resumed their attempts to cross the Mediterranean early this week after what television media have called a decline in the number of migrants in the last few days due to an incident when the Moroccan navy opened fire on a migrant boat in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of M’diq in northern Morocco. Moroccan authorities have tightened pressure on sub-Saharan immigrants, concentrating especially in the Tangier-Assilah-M’diq region.  Some immigrants have been deported to their countries of origin.

Rabat- Toyota Tsusho has obtained the new contract to construct a marine research vessel for Morocco. A member of the Toyota Group, Toyota Tsusho, which is supported by its subsidiary, CFAO, announced the news in a statement published on October 3. The new contract for the oceanographic and fisheries vessel construction project was awarded by the National Institute of Fisheries Research of Morocco, a subsidiary organization of Morocco’s Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The budget for the project is estimated at 5 billion yen ($44 million) “which funds are provided under a Japanese ODA loan agreement executed by the governments of Japan and Morocco.” The project aims to improve and enhance fishery resource research as fishing has “become unstable” since the 2000s, according to the statement. The press release said that Morocco, with its long Atlantic Ocean coastline, has “excellent fishing grounds.” It also mentioned the sea products Morocco exports to Japan and other countries, including octopus, squid and tuna. According to the statement, Mitsu E&amp;S Shipbuilding will work on the project. The completion of the project is scheduled in 2020 and delivery to Morocco planned in 2021. The statement added that the project is the first vessel “purchased by Morocco  using funds from a yen loan agreement under the Special Terms for Economic Partnership (STEP).” The vessel will be used for conventional surveys and for deep-sea marine investigations of organisms and their environments. The statement added that Toyota Tsusho is increasing its presence in Morocco in several sectors, including healthcare and the automotive industry. Headquartered in Japan, the company also emphasized the importance of the fisheries sector in Morocco, saying, “In Morocco, approximately 170,000 persons are directly employed in fishing, and a total of about 500,000 are indirectly employed, and thus fishing plays an important role in local employment.”

Rabat – The High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) predicts a 2.9 percent rise in Morocco’s economic growth in the fourth quarter, down from 4.4 percent in the same period last year. In its quarterly summary of October 2018, the HCP predicted that the national economy will continue to increase during the fourth quarter of 2018, supported by an increase of 3.6 percent in agricultural value-added products. Value-added products, excluding agriculture, is expected to improve by 2.8 percent during the fourth quarter of 2018, almost the same pace in comparison to the same period in 2017. The HCP attributed the improvement in plant production to the increase in the production of autumn crops, which will benefit from the improvement of dam reserves. Livestock production is expected to improve slightly, affected by reduced poultry production. Non-agricultural value-added production is expected to develop under global trends of increased trade and financial pressures as well as social, economic, and political turmoils that some emerging countries are experiencing. Overall, global trade is expected to grow by 4.6 percent and external demand for Morocco will rise by 4.5 percent. Value-added products for industry is expected to grow by 2.8 percent during the last quarter of 2018, while construction is predicted to slightly increase by 0.8 percent. The value-added production in the tertiary sector is expected to grow by 3 percent, contributing about 1.5 points to overall GDP growth. The HCP noted that while pending the results of the forecasted economic budget for January 2019, economic growth is likely to remain within 3 percent in 2018, the same increase announced in the forecasted economic budget in January 2018.

Rabat- Blind men protesting at the Ministry of Family’s headquarters in Rabat are blaming Bassima Hakkaoui for their friend’s fall to his death. Following the death of a protester named Saber El Haloui, who fell off the ministry’s rooftop from a sit-in on Sunday, the group of blind protesters initially calling for jobs are experiencing more pain and frustration. The protesters began a sit-in on the ministry’s rooftop September 26. In a statement to Moroccan news outlet Alyaoum24, one of the protesters agitatedly condemned the treatment he and his fellow protesters have received from Minister of Family and Solidarity Hakkaoui throughout their protest. The man stated: “My brother Saber died because of the neglect of the government. No one cared; no one considered us.” He alleged that Hakkoui told the protesters: “‘You do not scare me; your protests are random,’ and ‘I am a woman of iron.’ It’s about time that this woman gets penalized and bears responsibility for her arrogance. ”  The man and other protesters held Hakkaoui responsible for El Haloui’s death, rejecting her Facebook post in which she expressed condolences. She wrote: “We wish to express our deep sorrow at this painful incident.”  Following her post on Sunday, Hakkaoui received sharp criticism and angry reactions from commenters on social media. El Haloui fell off the rear side of the building, near the ambulance which the ministry had provided throughout the sit-in.  The man died in the ambulance on the way to Ibn Sina Hospital, explained the minister. The public prosecutor has opened an investigation into the protester’s death. Dozens of blind protesters are currently holding the open sit-in on the ministry’s rooftop and in front of its doors, this time not only calling for fair opportunities but also for the government to bring justice to the “martyred” Saber El Haloui. In the early morning of September 26, the group of blind people broke into the headquarters of the ministry and climbed to the rooftop of the building, beginning a sit-in. The National Coordination for the Disabled, Unemployed Degree-Holders allegedly organized the break-in. The blind men, calling to be given jobs, carried signs and chanted slogans decrying the “injustice,” “lies,” and “false promises” of Hakkaoui, who had said that their requests were being processed. The protesters were carrying bottles of fuel and even threatened to burn themselves alive if their calls to be employed and for “dignity” and “better living conditions” were to be ignored again.

Rabat – Dutch Glory Heavyweight Champion Rico Verhoeven has challenged the Moroccan golden kickboxing superstar, Badr Hari. In a Dutch television program, the Dutch kickboxer said that he is “ready” for another confrontation with the Moroccan star. “I am waiting when I will be informed of the date and the location where the combat will take place,” he said.  Verhoeven defeated Hari in 2017 due to a shoulder injury Hari suffered in the second round. Despite the defeat, Hari promised that he would be back in 2018 when he would be fully ready to face off with Rico again.     I don’t like the retrospectives because there is still much work (KOs) to be done but it seems to be a (funny) list day… To be completed: ?Hesdy Gerges ?Ismael Londt – KO ?Stefan Leko – KO ?Alexey Ignashov ?Ruslan Karaev – KO ?Gokhan Saki – TKO ?Alistair Overeem – TKO ?Semmy Schilt – KO ?Peter Aerts – TKO Unreachable Bad Boy. There will be no loophole for my opponents. A post shared by  Badr Hari (@badrhariofficial) on Aug 23, 2018 at 1:05pm PDT  Moroccan television channel Arryadia published a poster of the two stars captioned, “A revenge rematch between Badr Hari and Rico Verhoeven next March. The rematch will be broadcasted live on Arryadia.” Hari has tangled with Verhoeven, calling himself “the best, the number one, the absolute best.” The star has shared several photos of himself on his social networks doing intensive workouts. In August, Hari wrote a post on Instagram, saying “I don’t like retrospectives because there is still much work (KOs) to be done but it seems to be a (funny) list day…. Unreachable Bad Boy. There will be no loophole for my opponents,” citing some of the most challenging games he had won. Receiving the message loud and clear, it did not take long for Verhoeven to respond to his opponent. “Unreachable bad boy that’s exact what you are when they call you for the big fight……get to training and let see how long you last this time.” On the same post, Hari tagged his Dutch rival in a comment and wrote: “Dear Rico, don’t try to feed a false rumor: there was NEVER any discussion regarding a fight in September. How can you imagine that you would have been the 1st fighter on the poster in such a case ?” In his comment, the Moroccan kickboxer wrote, “Don’t forget who’s the boss.”  Now, Badr Hari has another challenger as renowned Moroccan kickboxer Jamal Ben Saddik also wants a fight with Hari. After defeating Dutch kickboxer Angelo Marshall, Ben Saddik challenged Hari, who was in the audience. “Come here; you are always a bad boy,” said Ben Saddik after winning his fight. Hari did not hesitate to enter the ring and has accepted the challenge. “You are not my first choice, but if you want it it is ok for me, I am ready.”

Rabat- Morocco’s Ministry of Education has decided to remove a schoolbook containing images of “sexual nature” from a private school. The Regional Academy of Education and Training of Casablanca region has resolved to ban all copies of a textbook used at a private school in Sidi Bernoussi district in Casablanca, reported the daily Al Massae newspaper on Monday. The academy fired the school’s pedagogical director for not identifying the content and informing them of it.  Since the ministry had not previously approved the use of the controversial school book, it is considered a “violation of article 4 and 8 of law 06.00 on the status of private education,” stated the academy. The move came after displeased parents demanded that the book be removed and replaced with a certified book that is compatible with “Moroccan culture,” wrote the newspaper. The Ministry of Education has taken action on controversial school books before. A school book was removed in September for its “blasphemous” content.  The Regional Academy of Education and Training of the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region removed all copies of the francophone textbook which contained pictures of a controversial text. The content reads: “The little God took a piece of paper, color pencils, and he painted the world,” and “God started by creating the sky and earth. However, the sky was empty, and the earth too.” Images of the school book went viral on social media. People condemned the text for belittling God. The unidentified school also used the book without asking for permission from education authorities, however the ministry did not fire the school’s director.

Recently, Moroccan parents and the public have expressed their concerns about the content and quality of education in Morocco. Including some Darija (Moroccan Arabic) words in school books angered some people, who called on the government to remove all books that contain words in the dialect, describing them as misleading and unhelpful.

Rabat – Turkish authorities have asked for permission to search Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul for Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. NTV reported the request on Monday. The journalist went missing October 2 when he visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials believe that the journalist was murdered in the consulate. The disappearance of the Saudi journalist, who wrote critically of Saudi Arabia’s foreign policies, led to the intervention of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. The president is personally following the case. Turkey also announced that Saudi Arabia’s ambassador was summoned to the foreign affairs minister for a second time on Sunday. Morocco’s Prince Moulay Hicham condemned the alleged murder of Khashoggi. The prince said that the murder should be regarded as a “political assassination conducted on Saudi soil. This violates international law, human rights and the very tenets of Islamic law.” Erdogan condemned the alleged murder as well, regretting that it happened in Turkey. “It is very, very upsetting for us that it happened in our country,” he said. In March, Khashoggi questioned the freedom of the press in his country and criticized Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his crackdown on dissent. Quoted by Al Jazeera, the self-exiled Saudi journalist said, “Now nobody will dare to speak and criticise the reform … It would be much better for him to allow a breathing space for critics, for Saudi intellectuals, Saudi writers, Saudi media to debate.”

Rabat – Morocco may have accepted the UN invitation for talks on Western Sahara, but will use them as a platform to remind participants of its firm conditions. On Friday, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita spoke about the UN’s invitation to Western Sahara talks in Geneva in December. Bourita, who attended a closed meeting at the House of Representatives along with a committee from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation said: “We are not going to the negotiations for negotiations.” He said that Morocco will attend the UN round-table to reaffirm its conditions, which emphasize Morocco’s autonomy plan as a just solution to end the conflict. According to Akhbar Al Yaoum, the Moroccan official also addressed Algeria’s responsibility in the conflict as a main party and not an observer. Algeria “is the one which created the problem, and it is Algeria that needs to contribute to finding a solution for it.” Morocco was the first party to respond to the invitations sent by the UN secretary-general’s personal envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler. Polisario also responded favorably to the invitations. The UN secretary-general said in his recent report on the Western Sahara situation, released on October 3, that he is confident that neighboring countries, Mauritania and Algeria, will also respond favorably to the invitations. During the House of Representatives meeting, Bourita discussed several other issues, including Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran for alleged Polisario-Hezbollah collusion and the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement. The official also commented on his meeting with US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the 73rd UN General Assembly, which took place September 18 to October 5. Bourita said, “There is nothing wrong about Morocco-US relations.” He added that Trump does not interfere in Morocco’s internal affairs. While Iran claimed that Morocco severed ties due to pressure from other powers, Bourita denied that Morocco’s move was a result of US pressure to support its position against Iran. He added that Morocco has evidence of Polisario-Hezbollah collusion.
 “Maybe our decision coincided with the US escalation, but we have pictures and an evidence of Iran’s involvement in supporting Polisario through its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah.” Bourita also discussed Iran’s alleged strategy to spread Shi’ism in Africa, referring to the arrest of the top Hezbollah financier Kassim Tajideen in Casablanca in 2017.

Rabat – The UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, has called on the members of the Polisario Front to refrain from requiring MINURSO to meet east of Morocco’s defence berm. In his recent report on Western Sahara, Guterres said that he asked Polisario leader Ibrahim Ghali that meetings between the separatist group and the UN representative take place as usual in Rabouni near Tindouf, in Algeria. However, Guterres said that Polisario “insists” that members of the Polisario Front and UN Special Representative for Western Sahara Colin Stewart should meet in east of the defense wall that Morocco built in Western Sahara.  According to the UN chief, the situation forms a “significant obstacle to the relationship between MINURSo and Frente Polisario, which is currently limited to telephone and written contracts between my Special Representative and the Frente Polisario Coordinator.” Morocco is firm that any meeting between a MINURSO representative and Polisario in Western Sahara “would constitute a recognition of Frente Polisario’s control over the territory east of the berm.” The UN chief, called on Polisario to meet UN representatives in Rabouni to stick to the long-established practice. “I, therefore, call once again on Frente Polisario to resume of meetings with senior MINURSO leadership in Rabouni, in accordance with the long-established practice,” Guterres said in his report.  The report, which was submitted to the UN Security Council on October 3, gave an overview of the situation in Western Sahara during the six months since the UN mission’s mandate in Western Sahara was renewed. The UN report called on the UN Security Council to extend the mandate of MINURSO to one year, until October 31, 2019. According to Guterres, an extension will give his Personal Envoy Horst Kohler, “the space and time for his efforts to create the conditions necessary for the political process to move ahead.” The UN report also recalled King Mohammed VI’s letter addressed to the UN on March 30 to denounce repeated provocations and violations of the ceasefire by Polisario Earlier this year, Morocco called on the UN to put pressure on Polisario in order to stop its violations of UN resolutions and the ceasefire agreement through maneuvers in the region. The Security Council will hold three meetings  this month to decide on MINURSO’s mandate, which will end on October 31.

Rabat – Japan has awarded the president of the Morocco-Japan Friendship Association, Abdellatif Guerraoui, with the medal of the “Order of the Rising Sun.”  Abdellatif Guerraoui received the medal of the “Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribon” from Japanese Ambassador Takuji Hanatani on behalf of the emperor of Japan, in Rabat on Friday, according to the state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).  The ceremony celebrated Guerraoui’s efforts through the Morocco-Japan Friendship Association to strengthen and preserve relations between Morocco and Japan.  In his speech, Hanatani said he was honored to decorate Guerraoui who has committed himself through relentless efforts to develop friendly ties between the people of Japan and Morocco.  The ambassador also praised the bilateral cooperation between the two countries and the mutual understanding resulting from it.  The association was created in 1977 with the initial goal of fostering economic, technical, scientific, and cultural relations between Morocco and Japan.  Abdellatif Guerraoui started his career in the OCP before becoming minister of energy and mines in 1993. He then took charge of social affairs, health, youth, sports, and national aid in 1997.

Rabat- Morocco and Benin have enhanced their cooperation by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on urban development. On Friday, the Moroccan minister of urban development, housing, and urban policy, Abdelahad Fassi Fihri, signed with his Beninese counterpart, Jose Tonato, a Memorandum of Understanding on land development, urban planning, housing, and urban policy.  The agreement, according to the state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), aims to improve and increase the transfer of expertise in urban planning, architecture, and land use planning.   Morocco intends, through the agreement, to foster the exchange of information on spatial planning and sustainable urban and rural development, specifically in terms of legislation.  Trainings and skills transfer on urban planning are also part of the agreement, representing continuity in Morocco’s strategy in the continent.  Benin and Morocco both have needs in terms of housing, city improvements, and building maintenance, due to rapid and increasing urbanization. Abdelahad Fassi Fihri declared that the agreement will allow the two countries to cooperate more efficiently in these fields of common interest.  Jose Tonato stressed the political will of the two countries to enhance cooperation and exchange and emphasized the good and fraternal relations linking Morocco and Benin.

ARabat – The Spanish enclave of Melilla will send a list of undocumented Moroccan minors to Morocco’s Ministry of Interior for repatriation. Melilla Mayor-President Juan Jose Imbroda announced the decision on Wednesday, October 3. Spanish Secretary of State for Security Ana Botella announced in a meeting in Essaouira, near Agadir, on September 14 that Moroccan authorities agreed to receive the identified and unaccompanied minors. According to Vanguardia, Imbroda expressed surprise that Botella informed the press that Morocco and Spain had agreed to the repatriation without informing Ceuta and Melilla. Read also: Melilla: 86 Unaccompanied Minors Entered Melilla from Morocco in August Satisfied with the Moroccan-Spanish agreement, Imbroda said that he will send a list of names to the Moroccan authorities. The agreement followed pressure due to undocumented migration from Africa to Europe. Recently, the Royal Moroccan Navy rescued dozens of migrants off Tangier and Nador in the Mediterranean. The rescues followed a tragic incident off of M’diq-Fnideq in northern Morocco, when the navy opened fire on a boat of migrants. The gunfire killed one migrant, Hayat, a 20-year old woman from Tetouan in northern Morocco. Morocco, a transit country for sub-Saharan migrants, has reaffirmed its categorical refusal to house reception centers for migrants to the EU. On Thursday, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said that the idea of creating reception centers for migrants is only an attempt to externalize Europe’s migration challenges. “We need a long-term solution and not an immediate economic solution.” In a recent interview with German news outlet Die Welt, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita repeated Morocco’s position. “Morocco is generally against all kinds of centers. It is part of our migration policy and it’s a position in the name of national sovereignty,” he said. Bourita said that 3 percent of the world’s population have migrated, 80 percent of which have done so legally. “We are talking about only 20 percent of this 3 percent.”

Rabat – The UN secretary-general’s report on Western Sahara has addressed challenges the Sahrawi population faces in the Tindouf camps. The UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, submitted his report concerning the situation on Western Sahara to the Security Council on October 3. The report offers the Security Council a summary of the activities of both Morocco and Polisario in Western Sahara, as well as an overview of the MINURSO mission in the region. Read Also: Number of Refuges in Tindouf Camps Doesn’t Exceed 90,000: UNHCR In his report, which comes weeks before the end of the mandate of the UN mission in Western Sahara, also known as MINURSO, Guterres pinpointed human rights concerns in the Tindouf camps. Funding concerns for Sahrawis in Tindouf First, the UN chief recalled the frustration and anger among the Sahrawi population in the Tindouf camps “at the lack of progress in the political process,” as well as “persistent difficulties, such as malnutrition, brought about by the steady reductions in humanitarian aid.”. Throughout the years of the conflict, the Sahrawi population of the Tindouf camps in western Algeria have denounced the embezzlement of humanitarian aid directed to the refugees. Pro-Polisario news outlets, including Futuro Sahara, reported that Sahrawis were surprised to find popular aid products on display in Algerian grocery shops. Read Also: UN: El Othmani Addresses Algeria, ‘Tragic’ Sahrawi Situation in Tindouf In the sixth section of the report, the UN chief spoke further about malnutrition. “Malnutrition and anaemia prevalence remained public health concerns,” he wrote. According to the UN chief, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Programme (WFP), are collaborating to provide humanitarian assistance to the population. “The main challenge for humanitarian actors remained the funding shortfall. In May 2018, the three agencies along with 11 international NGOs launched an appeal,” said the report. The report also recalled that the United Nations Human Rights Committee along with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) have “raised concern about the ‘de facto devolution of authority to the Frente Polisario in Tindouf camps, especially jurisdictional authority.'” The report noted that victims of violations in the Tindouf camps “do not have access to an effective remedy in the State Party’s courts.” Read Also: Polisario Smugglers Again Deprive Tindouf Sahrawis of Humanitarian Aid The report comes just before the Security Council will decide on the mandate of MINURSO in Western Sahara. The Security Council will convene at the end of this month to consider a possible extension of the UN mission in the region. Guterres is in favor of a one-year extension for the mission in Western Sahara. Roundtable talks in Geneva The UN chief also recalled that his personal envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, invited the parties for a roundtable talk in Geneva. The talks will take place in December. Morocco was the first to respond favorably to the invitation. The report also mentioned that the separatist group responded positively to Kohler’s invitation. Kohler also invited Mauritania and Algeria. The two countries have not responded to the UN’s invitation yet. Guterres said in the report that Kohler met Algeria’s foreign affairs minister Abdelkader Messahel, who announced that Algeria “was prepared to step up its role in the political process, as a neighbor, as required by Resolution 2414 (2019).” Morocco has been calling on Algeria to shoulder its responsibility in the conflict. Morocco also urged Algeria to engage in the UN-led political process to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. However, the solution should not undermine Morocco’s firm precondition of any deal respecting its sovereignty over Western Sahara and its  territorial integrity. The UN secretary-general is confident that both Algeria and Mauritania will accept Kohler’s invitations for the Geneva round-table. “I am confident that Algeria and Mauritania will respond favourably,” he wrote.

Rabat- One of the blind protesters who organized a sit-in on the rooftop of the Ministry of Family and Solidarity headquarters in Rabat fell to his death on Sunday, October 7. The PJD minister of family and solidarity, Bassima Hakkaoui, expressed condolences upon the protester’s death in a post on her official Facebook page. “We wish to express our deep sorrow at this painful incident,” she wrote Sunday evening.

Following her post, Hakkaoui received sharp criticism and angry reactions from commentators on social media. The protester fell off the rear side of the building, near the ambulance which the ministry had provided throughout the sit-in.  The man died in the ambulance on the way to Ibn Sina Hospital, explained the minister. The public prosecutor has opened an investigation into the protester’s death. Early on September 26, a group of blind people broke into the headquarters of the ministry and climbed to the rooftop of the building, beginning a sit-in. The National Coordination for the Disabled, Unemployed Degree-Holders allegedly organized the break-in. The blind men, calling to be given jobs, carried signs and chanted slogans decrying the “injustice,” “lies,” and “false promises” of Hakkaoui, who had said that their requests were being processed. The protesters were carrying bottles of fuel and even threatened to burn themselves alive if their calls to be employed and for “dignity” and “better living conditions” were to be ignored again. In an interview with Moroccan news outlet, Hespress, one of the protesters said, “The blind people have reached a point where it’s either ‘to be or not to be.’” “It is especially after the promises of the head of government and the minister of family and solidarity,” he added. He called for an “immediate” and “radical solution” to their problem or they would end their lives. Following the September 27 break-in, bystanders questioned: “How did the blind men break into the ministry’s headquarters?” “Where is Hakkaoui now? Where is Bassima Hakkaoui who is still asleep when many blind people are at the ministry ready to sacrifice their lives?” one of the protesters shouted, as shown in a video of the protest. No administrators or employees at the ministry were in sight. The National Union of Associations working in the field of Mental Disability in Morocco (UNAHM) also reportedly intended to organize sit-ins in front of the Moroccan Parliament in Rabat this month. UNAHM sought to protest the hardships of many special needs individuals in Morocco because of their delayed admission to universities and lack of integration into the job market.

Rabat – Two Moroccans have successfully traveled from France to China on a solar-powered bicycle. The journey of Mohamed Said Al Jabbari and Youssef Al-Hawas began on September 25 when they accepted a challenge by the French Sun Trip association. The travelers enjoyed their journey using hand-made bikes to travel from France to China. Throughout their 13,000-kilometer bike trip, the bikers crossed several countries, including Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Georgia, and Switzerland.  Al-Hawas told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that the trip “was difficult.” “We had to face many difficulties, including bad weather conditions (heavy rains, excessive heat, high winds),” he said. The 50-year old also invented and designed the solar tricycle dubbed “Ibn Battouta.” Speaking about the challenges, Al-Hawas said: “Sometimes we drove close to big trucks.” He said that any wrong movement could lead to a bad accident, “especially in the long tunnels of Turkey and Georgia, which sometimes exceeded four kilometers.” He continued, “The crossing of the desert was very difficult because of the excessive heat, the lack of shelter or places for the supply of water and food over long distances of more than 380 km.”  Forty-two people participated in the initial stages of the competition, which aimed at promoting solar energy. The trip’s organizers provided participants with a GPS to allow them to monitor their activities during the competition. The organizers did not allow participants to ask for help throughout the journey.

Rabat – Prince Moulay Hicham Alaoui has condemned the alleged murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who went missing October 2 after visiting the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. The prince took to his Twitter to express his concern about the disappearance of the Washington Post opinion writer. “A Saudi citizen, journalist, and dear friend of mine, Jamal Khashoggi, has been missing since October 2,” wrote the prince. Read Also: Jamal Khashoggi Was Allegedly Killed Inside Saudi Consulate in Turkey  Moulay Hicham recalled recent news reports, which alleged that the Saudi journalist was tortured and murdered “at the hands of his own countrymen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.” The prince said that the murder should be regarded as a “political assassination conducted on Saudi soil. This violates international law, human rights and the very tenets of Islamic law.” pic.twitter.com/r77HwScOKo — Hicham Alaoui (@HichamAlaouiSW) October 7, 2018  Moulay Hicham urged the Saudi government to clarify the circumstances of the incident and to punish the alleged killers. He added that Saudi Arabia bears full responsibility in “this barbaric and unquantifiable act of savagery” if it refuses to open an investigation into the alleged murder. Turkish authorities have concluded that the Saudi journalist was killed at the consulate of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul. The journalist was known for his vocal criticism of Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman’s foreign policy decisions towards Qatar, Canada, and the war in Yemen, as well as his crackdown against dissenting voices in Saudi Arabia.  The journalist disappeared after he visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Tuesday to secure documentation for a forthcoming marriage with a Turkish national.

Rabat – Relations between Morocco and Russia have developed positively since the last session of the Joint Commission held in Moscow, thanks to high-level visit exchanges and the signing of a deep strategic partnership between the two countries. Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita noted the strong relations Thursday in Rabat. Economic exchanges have reached a “satisfactory” level as well as cooperation in the key sectors of agriculture, energy, tourism and industry, underlined Bourita. Bourita co-chaired with the Russian minister of agriculture, Dmitry Patrushev, the 7th session of the Moroccan-Russian Joint Commission for Economic, Scientific, and Technological Cooperation. In an address on the occasion, the minister stressed that the meeting is of great importance because it coincides with the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Morocco and Russia. The diplomatic relationship has evolved on the basis of sincere friendship, fruitful cooperation, and mutual respect. The meeting is also of paramount importance as both countries will celebrate, in a few months, the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the Morocco-Russia joint commission. The commission is a tool for developing, promoting, and monitoring their bilateral ties, Bourita added. The minister also noted that the 7th session takes place in the context of the positive momentum given to bilateral links since King Mohammed VI’s visit to Russia in March 2016 and the signing of the deep strategic partnership between the two countries. The partnership, he stressed, constituted a commitment at the highest level of both states to develop bilateral relations and extend cooperation to other important fields, notably the military, security, and technology. Today, Morocco is pleased to see Russia as its 20th biggest importer of Moroccan goods and 10th biggest supplier, he said. He stressed the importance for Russia to take into account the many advantages of the Moroccan economy and to support this momentum of economic and commercial exchanges by giving more interest to investments.

Rabat – Agricultural products represent 77 percent of Moroccan exports to Russia, estimated at MAD 1.5 billion. The figure was presented by Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, Rural Development, Water and Forestry, Aziz Akhannouch on Thursday in Rabat. He was speaking at a business breakfast devoted to strengthening trade and economic relations between Morocco and Russia, particularly in priority sectors. Akhannouch said that citrus fruits top agricultural exports, followed by other fruits and vegetables. He noted that since 2014, the growth of trade between the two countries is in the order of 10 percent. However, he went on to say, economic aspiration has not yet matched political aspiration. Hence there is a need for economic operators to move forward in promoting Moroccan-Russian trade, especially after the royal visit to Russia which has paved the way for even stronger and more diversified bilateral cooperation. Akhannouch called on economic operators to develop marketing networks to better understand the Russian market. He also highlighted the importance of creating the “Green Corridor” which will make this market more accessible, especially with the customs facilities offered by the two countries. For his part, the Russian minister of agriculture, Dmitry Patrushev, presented the various aspects of economic cooperation. He referred in particular to the joint ventures in the production of fruits and vegetables, red meat, and water. He also highlighted Morocco’s economic assets with an exceptional openness to the African continent, and expressed the interest shown by Russian investors in partnership with the kingdom. The meeting was held as part of a mission to Morocco by the Russian Export Centre (REC) group of companies, carried out on the occasion of the 7th Moroccan-Russian Joint Intergovernmental Commission for Economic, Scientific, and Technical Cooperation.

Rabat – A Spanish official has slammed Morocco’s compulsory military service law for ringing alarm bells among Morocco’s youth. Adela Nieto, the official in charge of social affairs, minors, and equality in the Spanish enclave of Ceuta, said that Morocco’s proposed bill to introduce compulsory military service has left young Moroccans with no other choice but to cross into neighboring Spain. “The outflow of unaccompanied Moroccan minors has increased following the announcement of a law to establish compulsory military service,” she said. Read Also: Military Source: Moroccan Migrants Shot by Navy Were ‘Hidden Under Tarp’ According to Moroccan outlet Le 360, the Spanish official claimed to have taken her data from “information” in the Spanish government’s records of recent attempts by young irregular Moroccan migrants to reach Spain. While the compulsory service bill has been introduced to the Moroccan parliament, it has not been passed. It may take longer than reported in news outlets, according to Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi. “There is a procedure to follow before the proposal is made into a law,” El Khalfi said. “[The procedure] will take several months…. There is a legislative duration. Technically, this law will most probably enter into force towards the second half of 2019.” Read Also: Law on Mandatory Military Service May Come into Force at the End of 2019 In the meantime, the controversy that the bill created in Morocco coincided with reports of a sharp increase of emigration attempts by Moroccans, especially in the northern cities. The correlation may explain Nieto’s “confidence” about a causal relationship between the two occurrences. Nieto’s statement follows comments from another Spanish official on Moroccan emigration. During a working visit to Rabat earlier this week, Maria del Consuelo Rumi Ibanez, the Spanish state secretary for migration, told her Moroccan counterparts to “dismantle the myth of the European dream.” “Emigration is not the solution,” Ibanez said, adding that the choice to emigrate illegally is perilous and “often ends badly.”

Rabat – Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the most celebrated footballers in history, has not escaped the jaw of the #MeToo movement. The Juventus and Portugal star, 33, who was accused in 2016 of rape by an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, 34, has accused Real Madrid of being behind the allegations. Ronaldo allegedly claimed that the Spanish club has not been able to get over his brisk departure this summer. He said Madrid has resorted to blackmail and “manipulations” to tarnish his image. Read Also: Las Vegas Police to Reopen Cristiano Ronaldo Rape Case According to Italian daily La Repubblica, the five-time world player of the year is convinced that the recent spiral of negative events—the controversial red card against Spanish side Valencia on September 19, the resurgence of news about the rape allegation, and the ensuing concern from his sponsors—are all the work of Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. Since December 2017, even while he still was the top star at Real Madrid, Ronaldo was known to be on bad terms with Perez, La Repubblica noted. Ronaldo left the Spanish side this summer, sparking hordes of speculations about the underlying reasons behind a negative end to nine outstanding seasons with Madrid. Mayorga claims that the Portuguese footballer raped her in June 2009, but Ronaldo has categorically denied the allegations. He said that he has evinced professionalism to everyone who has met him over the years and that his “conscience is clear.” Meanwhile, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has opened an investigation into the matter. Giant sportswear company Nike, one of the Portuguese star’s many sponsors, said that it is “deeply concerned” about the allegation.

New York – A recent U.S. House Resolution acknowledges long-standing ties between the United States and Morocco, criticizes Iran for meddling in North Africa, and expresses support for Morocco’s autonomy plan – but does not propose any action steps. A Bipartisan US Bill Acknowledges Hezbollah-Polisario Links A proposed bipartisan resolution originating in the House and reaffirming the relationship between the United States and Morocco, recognizes that Morocco was the first country which formally recognized the United States.  Congressman Joe Wilson ( R – SC), on his website,  condemned the recent actions by the separatist group Polisario, which threaten the security and stability of Morocco and the region. Additionally, in a first such effort, the proposed resolution criticized Iran for its support, financial or otherwise, of terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah, and their destabilizing actions in North Africa, which challenge national security objectives of the United States. The resolution also reaffirmed US Congress support for Morocco’s autonomy plan.   It is an important first step towards recognizing and addressing the threat of Hezbollah’s joint efforts with the separatist group Polisario, which lead Morocco to break diplomatic relations with Iran in May. Read Also: U.S. Congress: Bipartisan Bill Condemns Collusion Between Hezbollah-Polisario However, by itself, the resolution is not efficient. To have any sort of binding effect, the resolution should be joint (i.e. someone in the Senate should pick it up and propose to that body); a single-house resolution amounts to no more than a “sense of Congress”. In other words, it has no binding legal effect of any kind. The current version of the resolution raises awareness of this issue, which is important to US security and its alliance with African countries affected by Hezbollah’s and Iran’s aggression; however, it does little to address the situation. A more helpful response from Congress would  include provisions for oversight of Iran’s and Hezbollah’s activities in North Africa, appropriate expenditures related to the defense of US national security interests in the region, and joint counter-terrorism and counter extremism operations and activities with Morocco, beyond joint training sessions and weapons sales. The Next Steps: Practical Measures with Wide-Reaching Effects The text of the resolution should make clear that the intent of the bill is not to merely reassure an old ally, but an essential step to protecting US interest in regional stability in Africa and in curbing Iran’s global aggression, particularly where sanctions alone are proving insufficient. Read Also: U.S. Congress: Bipartisan Bill Condemns Collusion Between Hezbollah-Polisario Hezbollah controlled entities in North Africa and elsewhere should be tracked and designated for sanctions. Any group, individual, or organization that continues to do business with Iran or acts as its proxy group should likewise be penalized for financing and/or supporting terrorism, in Africa just as much as in the Middle East or Europe.  For that reason, the US State Department and Treasury should work closely with the Moroccan government to identify such actors in North Africa and place them on the list of designated proxies, in a process similar to what is being done with other Hezbullah and Iran-affiliated proxy groups around the world.  Polisario, which was caught training with Hezbollah and targeting allies, such as Morocco, should be the first candidate for such designation by the United States, and likewise, by any other states concerned with Iran’s support for international terrorism.  Both the administration and Congress should adopt and uphold a zero-tolerance policy towards facilitating any of Iran’s threatening activities.  The inspiration for this proposed resolution was a series of events over the past two years, which included Iranian intelligence officers, under diplomatic cover, utilizing the Iranian embassy in Algiers as a facilitation point for Hezbollah’s smuggling of heavy weaponry to Polisario training camps, as well as arranging training of Polisario fighters by members of Hezbollah forces and visits by Hezbollah officials to Polisario-controlled towns.  Read Also: Iran Support for Polisario-Hezbollah Collusion Unveils its ‘Toxic’ Strategy: Analyst The Moroccan government presented the Iranian Foreign Ministry with documented evidence of specific meetings, dates, names, and other details of collaboration. Hezbollah, Algeria, and Iran all denied involvement in these operations; however, members of Polisario leadership admitted to seeking contact with Hezbollah for possible collaboration. Iran making inroads in North Africa with the help of Hezbollah as Sanctions bite in the Middle East and Europe Since then, the US State Department acknowledged Morocco’s role in opposing Iran’s expansionist aggression in North Africa; however, the Trump Administration took no further steps to respond to Iran’s increased aggression in that region. Furthermore, Morocco was left out of the proposed defense alliance among Middle Eastern and African States, referred to by the administration as the “Arab NATO.”   Morocco’s Foreign Minister reached out to the Trump administration in an effort to draw attention to Morocco’s interest in cooperation on security and defense issues in countering Iran’s aggressive military and ideological outreach in North Africa. However, there is little evidence that the Foreign Minister’s recent meeting with President Trump during the UN Week has led to any substantive change in the administration’s policy towards strengthening defense ties with Morocco.  Congress, too, thus far has not prioritized reinforcing that relationship with more active measures. Securing North Africa from further destabilization is central to preventing proliferation of terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and ISIS, and state-backed terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah, further across the continent and into Europe.  The same organizations are looking to make inroads inside Morocco proper, although they have been unsuccessful so far.  However, Hezbollah has succeeded in extending its presence from West Africa to the North, adopting and coordinating its actions with local separatist groups and other non-state actors. As Iran’s nascent empire appears to be crumbling in the Middle East, thanks, in part,  to the presence of US troops, – with Iran having to pull back hundreds of thousands of its IRGC forces to deal with internal issues –  tougher sanctions, domestic unrest, and greater pushback from the locals, Iran will likely seek to regroup its well-armed proxies in Lebanon, and restructure its organization in Africa, where US has been far less involved.  Evidence of Hezbollah’s Weaponization of Polisario Grows The case of contacts between Hezbollah and Polisario is increasingly strong. Aside from the information presented to Iran by the Moroccan government, there are reportedly photos of a Polisario activist Nana Labbat al-Rasheed posing with Ali Fayyad, member of the Lebanese Parliament and one of the leaders of Hezbollah, as well as accounts by two British papers showing that it was not merely Iranian intelligence running the Hezbollah network through the Algiers embassy to train Polisario, but IRGC, a US-designated terrorist organization. Read Also: Morocco Wants Strong Security Cooperation with US Against Iran Very soon afterwards, a plot by Iranian intelligence officers posing as diplomats to carry out a terrorist attack against the Iranian opposition in Europe was uncovered, implicating Iranian officials and likely IRGC agents in several European countries.   Whether Morocco’s announcement of the break up with Iran was timed to curry favor with the United States or not, it is clear that Morocco takes the threats to its national sovereignty, and likewise has a history of cooperating with US on exposing Hezbollah financing to that region. To that end, though some have drawn conjectures that this development was aimed at bolstering Morocco’s positions at the UN (where 32 member states recognize the self-styled SADR as a “state”, but most of the leading powers, such as the United States do not), that scenario seems unlikely. Although Morocco has strongly criticized Algeria’s role in backing Polisario’s self-proclaimed SADR as unhelpful, its push for the autonomy plan has been consistently backed by the United States, and particularly under the Trump administration there was little reason to believe that position would change radically.  For one thing, Africa, for better or for worse, has simply not been a priority for the White House, which has focused its energies on fighting ISIS, particularly in Iraq and Syria, countering Iranian threats in the Middle East, and diffusing tensions with North Korea. Nevertheless, the White House recognizes that the autonomy plan would help secure Moroccan borders from external threats, and supports a stable and secure Morocco as a vital regional ally. Going to absurd lengths that risked tensions with the United States was never a plausible interpretation of Morocco’s dramatic fallout with Tehran.  Furthermore, the allegations of a relationship between Hezbollah and Polisario go back years. Lebanon-based Hezbollah has set up a “committee of support for the Sahrawi people” in 2016; that same year, Hezbollah officials visited the Tindouf camps in Algeria, an artificial structure that perpetuates the state of refugeedom for the people who have been goaded by Polisario into believing they could get independence and a functioning state. Instead, they are spending generations in slave-like conditions in refugee camps in Algeria. Iranian influence did not begin or end with weaponizing local separatists, however. Iran’s ideological outreach leads to factionalism and threatens to destabilize Morocco Working through its proxy groups, Iran has also reached out to Moroccan Shiites, claiming to offer them protection from religious discrimination and tools of empowerment against the state. Iran has capitalized on the minority status of the Shia in Morocco to spread conspiratorial claims against the government.  To that end, leaders of the Shi’a movement in Morocco demanded further evidence of Iran’s involvement with Polisario. There seems to be further evidence that Iran’s ideological outreach is aimed at bringing together its various would be proxies and destabilizing Morocco from within over various purported causes.  One of the leaders took the Iranian line claiming that Morocco’s move was part of an influence campaign of foreign governments (meaning, first Saudi Arabia, and second, possibly, the United States), a claim that has been vehemently rejected by the Moroccan government, which at the time was already experiencing some tensions with Saudi Arabia over various political issues.  This strategy parallels Iran’s strategy with its proxies elsewhere. It has weaponized the Houthi rebels in Yemen against the legitimate government, providing them with weaponry, training by elite Hezbollah units, as well as radicalizing them ideologically. Iran has also adopted the same approach with various Shi’s groups in West Africa, particularly Nigeria, as well as Shi’a militias in Iraq. Furthermore, Iran, through Hezbollah, has assisted Polisario with building a series of tunnels that would circumvent Morocco’s security wall. That strategy, too, has been a carbon copy of Hezbollah’s and Hamas’ approach towards their wars with Israel.   Hezbollah’s direct experience of operations in Africa and elsewhere relies heavily on tunnels to circumvent direct attacks and to smuggle contraband and fighters.  Because of the popularity of that approach in the Middle East, some skeptics of the effectiveness of air strikes on Iranian and Hezbollah positions in Syria believe that Iran and its proxies continue smuggling more sophisticated weaponry through a tunnel system in that country, while leaving a less important contingent on the surface to get hit as a distraction.  Polisario, although not nearly as prominent as the Hezbollah body, may benefit from the same approach, looking to infiltrate Morocco through underground since the superiority of the Moroccan Royal Forces in direct combat is obvious.  These disturbing developments have brought the administration’s attention to Iran’s destabilizing activities in Africa; even the National Security Adviser John Bolton, who, during his stint as the Ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, supported a referendum on Western Sahara’s independence, has reprioritized Iranian evangelism and weapons smuggling over what supporters of national sovereignty for states see as a false equivalence between competing but unequal claims. Furthermore, it increasingly appears that Algeria’s involvement in those operations has been more than merely providing a meeting place. Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita recently accused Algiers of providing material operational support and backing for Iran’s outreach to Polisario.  While the evidence for these claims is yet to be revealed, if accurate, Algeria’s role in facilitating Iranian operations in North Africa should be of great concern to the United States. Algeria has grown particularly close to Iran in recent years, has openly supported its nuclear research program, and itself has positioned itself for potential research in that direction. It has also housed Palestinian scientists who died under mysterious circumstances and  who may have been affiliated with terrorist organizations or facilitated illicit nuclear research for Iran. US Policy in North Africa Should Be Substantive, Affirmative, and Focused All these developments ultimately point to Iran’s increasing threat to the stability of North Africa, and a need for a more proactive foreign policy towards that region by the United States.  The United States has been vocally supportive of Morocco’s autonomy plan, as well as national sovereignty, both at the UN and in more recent State Department statements. However, these comments have done little to deter Algeria’s backing of Polisario, Polisario’s bellicose activities, or Iran’s and Hezbullah’s ideological and military meddling.   Paying lip service to Morocco’s national sovereignty will do nothing to curb Iran’s underhanded ideological influence, nor stop terrorists from taking advantage of ongoing tensions and radicalized movements to flame factionalism and further social divisions inside the country. There needs to be a comprehensive reorientation towards combating Iran’s infiltration of Africa, particularly North Africa, which holds key to international waterways and access to the Middle East, as well as Europe. Confronting and countering Iranian operations in the region should be a central part of the Iran Group, a focus group created by Secretary Pompeo in the State Department.  A holistic outlook on the regime’s illegal and threatening activities would not ignore entire continents just because they are out of the way and in part underdeveloped.  Rather, the US government should understand that vacuum of power breeds opportunities for malefactors, who use the cover of darkness and disinterest to regroup, finance their other operations, and go after the lower-hanging fruit.  US-imposed sanctions may not work well if Iran finds corruption and lack of oversight and enforcement in African countries a welcome respite from its troubles with Europe. Exacerbating border problems with ISIS and Al Qaeda in the Western Sahara area would create unimaginable havoc, which Tehran would gladly exploit.  Allowing Polisario and the like any claim to legitimacy is tantamount to considering the Houthis or Hamas legitimate representatives of Yemenis or the Palestinian people when these groups both engage in brutally repressive measures against their own populations and take money from Iran to wreak havoc and threaten their adversaries civilians with extreme violence. Whatever the former grievances of its constituencies, it is clear that by accepting “assistance” from a terrorist organization, Polisario lost all claims to legitimate representation.  Allowing that body to represent the Sahrawis and to create any entity, autonomous or independent, at this point, would mean creating a permanent state of tyranny for anyone living under its control and a permanent state of threat and chaos for Morocco. For that reason, the United States should lead the charge to strengthen global cooperation with Morocco to address Iranian and Hezbollah threat, and in terms of the United Nations, lead the movement to follow through with Morocco’s autonomy plan and the delegitimization of Polisario as representatives of the beneficiaries of that plan.  Polisario should be designated a terrorist group, no different from Hezbollah, and dismantled, and its prisoners should be liberated to choose whether to integrate with Morocco or to select a reasonable and functional government that will give them opportunities for a decent life in an economy geared towards development, not destruction. US should also examine the role of its so-called allies such as Algeria in creating a welcoming environment for Iran to proceed with its illicit and hegemonic activities.  Algerian government should no more be able to get away with facilitating terrorism than any other country. Any state that supports and gives comfort to US enemies and helps radicalism cannot be reasonably considered an ally and should be held accountable and forced to choose.

Rabat – Four days after the mysterious disappearance of Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, Turkish authorities have concluded that he was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. “The initial assessment of the Turkish police is that Mr. Khashoggi has been killed at the consulate of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul. We believe that the murder was premeditated and the body was subsequently moved out of the consulate,” a Turkish official was quoted by Reuters as saying. The prominent Saudi journalist, known for his staunch opposition to many of Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman’s domestic and foreign policy decisions, disappeared on Tuesday. He had entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to secure documentation for a forthcoming marriage with a Turkish national. Since Tuesday, Turkish and Saudi authorities have given conflicting accounts about his whereabouts. While Turkish authorities said there was no evidence he left the Saudi consulate, Saudi authorities claimed that he exited the diplomatic mission the same day.

Tokyo  –  The Moroccan delegation, which was attending the ministerial meeting to prepare for the 7th Summit of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD), withdrew from the meeting room to protest the presence of the “Polisario.“ During the preparatory ministerial meeting, scheduled October 5 to 7, members of the Polisario entered Japan with Algerian passports. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), they were accredited using badges of the Commission of African Union. Having noted their arrival and without wishing to disrupt the meeting, the Japanese foreign minister made a statement reaffirming the unchanged position of Japan. He announced, “Even if a group claiming to be a State, which Japan does not recognize, is present in this room, this does not mean in any way that Japan recognizes it, implicitly or explicitly, as being a State.” Despite the separatists’ maneuvers with the help of Algeria and South Africa, Japan has maintained a firm position. Japan has opposed any involvement of an entity that it does not recognize, in accordance with international law and the TICAD format that has existed since 1993. MAP added that the preparatory meeting of senior officials, held on Friday, October 5, 2018, was postponed several times and shortened, because of Japan’s refusal to allow the presence of the self-proclaimed “SADR.” Having noted the presence of Polisario at the ministerial meeting, the Moroccan delegation decided to withdraw from the room in protest.

Rabat – Japan’s foreign minister, Taro Kono, has slammed Polisario at the 7th ministerial meeting of Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD). The Japanese foreign minister stressed that his country does not recognize Polisario as a state. Kono held bilateral meetings with African foreign ministers to further develop relationships with African countries. The meeting is being held October 6-7 in Tokyo. “Even if a group which claims itself as a state which Japan does not recognize was sitting in this room, this fact does not mean that Japan, in any way, implicitly or explicitly recognize it as a state,” Kono said o fthe ministerial meeting. Kano further stressed that any flag “other than that of African Union, co-host organization, or Japan” was not allowed in the meeting room. “Any one who disrupts order may be asked to leave the room,” he concluded his speech. Japan’s government co-organized the TICAD ministerial meeting with the UN, the UN Development Program (UNDP), the World Bank, and the African Union Commission (AUC). The main objectives of the meeting are “to review the progress of measures announced at TICAD V and VI at the ministerial level,” according to a statement by Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During the previous TICAD ministerial meeting, the Japanese foreign minister condemned Mozambique’s attempt to give a seat to Polisario at TICAD’s follow-up meeting, held August 24-25, 2017, in Maputo, Mozambique. Kono expressed “his deep regrets about the incident and the confusion during the opening session of TICAD ministerial meeting” during talks with Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita. Japan’s position is a huge setback to the Polisario, whose leaders have long sought to use the African Union as a cover to gain international recognition.

Rabat – With the arrival of the US Peace Corps’s 100th group of volunteers in Morocco, the organization celebrates “55 years of friendship.” Peace Corps Country Director Sue Dwyer noted, “These milestones are a testament to the strong friendship and partnership between the people and government of the Kingdom of Morocco and the United States Peace Corps.” The Peace Corps is a US organization that promotes peace in the world through a volunteer program. According to a press release from the US embassy in Rabat, Peace Corps volunteers serve Moroccan youth in partnership with the Ministry of Youth and Sports. Volunteers seek to help youth become “productive and civically engaged adults.” Volunteers also learn about Morocco. Sofia Ashooh, serving in the Fes region, told Morocco World News, “Peace Corps has provided me with an outstanding opportunity to learn about Moroccan culture. I discover something new every day as I carry out my daily life with neighbors, friends, and work partners.” The Peace Corps’s newest group of volunteers in Morocco, the 100th to come to the kingdom, arrived September 11. The 110 volunteers will spend 11 weeks studying the culture and Darija (Moroccan Arabic). After training, Peace Corps volunteers will be sent primarily to rural areas in six regions of Morocco. There, they will work in youth and women’s centers “to strengthen youth life skills through participation and leadership in classes, clubs, camps and mentoring.” The volunteers commit to serving two years in their sites assigned by the Ministry of Youth. The experience can be life-changing. “In Morocco I’ve learned how to be truly generous from the selflessness of my neighbors. I’ve become more patient and understanding as well,” Ashooh reflected. “I will always be grateful to the Moroccan people for welcoming me into their lives, and I strive to be a better person every day because of them.”
 Although Peace Corps volunteers serve across the globe, Morocco is “one of the most highly sought after” countries. Morocco received 900 applications from Peace Corps candidates this year. Morocco invited the Peace Corps in 1963, and since then, 5,052 volunteers have served in Morocco.
 For many volunteers, Peace Corps is a springboard to distinguished careers as diplomats. The late US Ambassador Christopher Stevens to Libya, killed by militants in Benghazi in 2012, served in Morocco as a Peace Corps volunteer in the early 1980s. The US Chargé d’Affaires at the US embassy in Rabat, Stephanie Miley, also served as a Peace Corps volunteer, in Ecuador. The Peace Corps mission is to provide social and economic assistance for communities abroad through training. The organization also promotes mutual understanding between Americans and their host countries.   As Sofia Ashooh put it, “I now consider Morocco a second home, and I am lucky to do so.”

Rabat – Morocco’s aeronautic industry is growing exponentially thanks to its proximity to Europe, low labor costs, and political  stability. Since 2001, the Moroccan aeronautics sector has seen a remarkable and considerable growth. From 2001 to 2011, the number of companies active in the aeronautics industry increased from 10 to more than 100. Total employees increased from only 300  to more than 10,000 with a total sales of over $1 billion, according to the Moroccan Agency of Investment and Development (AMDI). In 2016, Morocco’s Minister of Industry, Trade, Investment, and the Digital Economy Moulay Hafid Elalamy said, “The Moroccan aeronautics industry has seen … huge growth these last few years. The sector has multiplied by six in 10 years.” Morocco now has 130 aeronautics companies. Morocco’s strategic location gives it access to Europe, the Middle East, and the rest of Africa. This advantage has made the North African country a favorite destination for big international aircraft manufacturers, such as Bombardier, Boeing, and Safran. In September 2016, the American Boeing company announced plans to create a “Boeing industrial ecosystem” in Morocco to attract 120 suppliers for Morocco’s aeronautics exports, generating $1 billion and creating more than 8,200 jobs. “Through our business in Casablanca, we have already seen with our own eyes the unique opportunities offered by Morocco to aeronautics subcontractors in terms of cost effectiveness, all while producing quality products,” said Boeing Vice Chairman Raymond Conner. The Seattle-based aerospace company has settled in Morocco since 2001. Boeing also has a joint venture with France’s Safran in Casablanca to build aerospace parts such as wire bundles and harnesses for aircraft makers like Boeing and Airbus. According to Safran’s general delegate in Morocco, Hamid Benbrahim El Andaloussi, “Morocco is now regarded as one of the most aeronautical platforms in the region. It is, without question, the most competitive aeronautical base in the natural extension of Europe.” Safran has been operating in Morocco for more than 15 years with more than 2,700 employees in seven companies and joint ventures. Safran’s companies in Morocco involved in activities such as aeronautical cabling, thrust reversers and nacelles, engineering, and engineering maintenance. The company’s employees are primarily young people in their 20s, of which 70 percent are young women. Women make up 40 percent of the managing staff. Bombardier has plans to invest $200 million in Morocco by 2020 and create 850 direct jobs and 4,400 indirect jobs. In July 2014, US-based Alcoa Aerospace also announced that “it would invest €4.6m in a production unit in Midparc specialising in fastening systems for the aerospace industry,” reported Oxford Business Group. “Bombardier’s Moroccan facility today produces wing components, slats, ailerons, winglets, flaps, fuselage parts, fuselages, nose extensions, doors, floors, nacelles, and subassemblies for various programs of regional aircraft and business jets,” a Moroccan Bombardier spokeswoman told the aviation outlet AIN in July. Bombardier is the world’s third-largest aerospace and transportation manufacturer, based in Montreal. In 2014, the company built an aerospace-manufacturing facility in Morocco. Great logistics, stable economic environment Morocco boasts of many economic free zones which provide an important platform for Morocco’s growing aeronautics sector. These include Casablanca’s Aeropole Nouaceur and Midparc free zones, in addition to zones with aerospace facilities in Tangier; Kenitra, north of Rabat; Oujda, in northeast Morocco; and Sale, near Rabat. Midparc’s Director General Aref Hassani told Morocco World News that there are 16 companies such as Hexcel, Stelia (an Airbus company), Arconic (an Alcoa company), Eaton, and Thaler which are operational in the Midparc free zone, in addition to 2 companies “under study before construction.” Hassani added that among the 16 companies, 12 are French, 3 are American, and 1 is Canadian. Foreign direct investment website fDi Intelligence ranked Casablanca among the 15 aerospace cities of the future in 2016, and 6th in the top 10 aerospace cities “in terms of cost-effectiveness.”  Morocco is situated only 14 kilometers south of Europe, across the Mediterranean, with much lower labor costs. According to Midparc, Morocco is a “competitive platform for export” with an average monthly wage of $327, which is “almost ten times lower than in Spain.” In its 2018 Investment Climate Statement, the US Department of State wrote, “Morocco enjoys political stability, robust infrastructure, and a strategic location, which are helping it emerge as a regional manufacturing and export base for international companies.” In the World Bank’s most recent Doing Business report for 2018, Morocco ranked 69th worldwide. Morocco scored 67.91 points with a more favorable business climate than that of neighboring countries in North Africa, such as Tunisia (88th), Egypt (128th), and Algeria (166th). The report also stated that Morocco’s scoring enabled it to rise to the third position in the MENA region behind the UAE (21st) and Bahrain (66th). Among African countries, Morocco also took third place, behind Mauritius (25th) and Rwanda (41st). Training centers to meet needs of aeronautics industry Training centers are part of Morocco’s plan to boost its attractiveness for aeronautical industry investments.  Morocco boasts of an Aeronautics Professions Institute (IMA), which the Group of Moroccan Aviation and Aerospace Industrialists (GIMAS) established in partnership with the Moroccan government. The center, near Casablanca’s international airport, was inaugurated in 2011 and provides Moroccan aeronautical companies with a skilled workforce and human resources. Before 2011, Morocco never had any specialized centers for training technicians and operators , said El Andaloussi, president of IMA. “IMA’s medium-term objective is to train 800 persons per year in aviation and aerospace professions thanks to a tool of international standards in place as a result of a partnership between GIMAS, the UIMM (Union of Metallurgical Profession Industries) and the state of Morocco,” Midparc said. In September, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani inaugurated the Moroccan Private Aviation Academy (MAPA) in Benslimane, near Rabat. El Othmani said that the school will meet the growing needs of the aviation industry and will train pilots and aviation maintenance technicians. MAPA received the national license for airline pilot training and the EASA European Approval for Aircraft Maintenance Technicians.

Rabat – Renowned Moroccan actress Nezha Regragui has reportedly sued the Tunisian channel “Elhiwar Ettounsi’s” director who broadcast a comedy show mocking her son, Saad Lamjarred. The “Omour Jidiya” (“Serious Stuff”) show that satirically tackled Saad Lamjarred’s rape case in France aroused Nezha Regragui’s anger. Lamjarred is awaiting trial in a rape case brought by Laura Prioul in October 2016. Dressed in orange and chained, the Saad Lamjarred mimic comes into the show’s court cursing and intimidating people around him. He stands to face the plaintiff, Laura Prioul, and begins an argument in which each tries to defend themselves. The trial concluded its proceedings with the announcement of a 20-year prison sentence for Lamjarred while the plaintiff repeatedly shouted, “Live long justice!” In late August, the French public prosecutor’s office issued an order to arrest Lamjarred in the French city of Saint Tropez after another woman told police Lamjarred had raped her. After 48 hours, the court released Lamjarred on a bail of €150,000 and seized his passport. In early September, a French appeals court issued an order to remand the Moroccan singer to custody, on the prosecutor’s appeal.  Many of Saad Lamjarred’s fans remain loyal to the singer and believe he has been wrongly accused.  Moroccan actress Sanaa Akroud has said that Lamjarred’s parents have always believed in their son’s fans to stand against the allegations.

Rabat – By the end of August 2018, Morocco’s trade deficit year-to-date had increased to MAD 77.8 billion, up from MAD 69.1 billion in the same period of 2017. The trade deficit growth is due to rises in both exports and imports, up by MAD 29.6 billion, and MAD 20.9 billion, respectively. Imports increased by 9.4 percent to MAD 345 billion, due to imported goods (MAD 27.2 billion), especially equipment goods and energy products. The rise in exports is mainly due to exports of goods (MAD 16.79 billion). Aeronautics grew 26.9 percent, automotive sales grew 17.8 percent, phosphates and their derivatives 17.2 percent, and agriculture and food 5.6 percent. The texture and leather sector saw a 3.3 percent rise. Over the same period, remittances from Moroccans living abroad increased by 1 percent to MAD 44.96 billion. In the first eight months of August 2018, foreign direct investments (FDI) had decreased by 8.6 percent to MAD 16.5 billion, in comparison to 18.1 billion during the same period in 2017. Over the same period, reserves from foreign currency totaled MAD 225.8 billion, down from MAD 240.9 billion a year before.

Rabat – Orlando, Florida, is hosting a “Moroccan Village” for the first time to encourage US tourism to Morocco.  The “Moroccan village,” according to the state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press, displays attractions, shows, culinary stands, crafts, traditional products, art exhibitions, and conferences. The village is open October 4-7, promoting Moroccan culture and heritage.  The village’s purpose is to present Morocco’s highlights to increase understanding and exchanges between the countries. The initiative also aims to attract investors through presentations on Morocco’s advancement and innovation in various sectors, including renewable energies, real estate, agriculture, and sustainable development.    The “Moroccan Village” is open to the public with free access. Orlando is known for being a popular tourist destination in the US and has the highest concentration of Moroccan residents in the US with around 35,000 Moroccans.  The initiative comes from Bahia Benkhar, president of “Musk Strategies,” with the support of the Moroccan community in the US and the Moroccan embassy. Institutional actors such as “La Maison de l’Artisan,” the Moroccan Ministry of Tourism, and the OCP Group also actively participated in the organization of the event. The Royal Air Maroc and Al Akhawayn University of Ifrane in Morocco, as well as the University of Central Florida were also involved in the project.

Rabat – There are still lapses in Morocco’s development model, and there is room for improvement on many issues, “But we are almost there.” The optimistic tone came at the end of a talk on Morocco’s public investment policies by Othman El Ferdaous, secretary of state for investment and assistant to the minister of industry.  El Ferdaous, who was speaking at a policy talk organized by Moroccan think tank OCP Policy Center at the Rabat School of Governance and Economy (EGE), succinctly presented Morocco’s industrial vision of mobilizing 11 percent of its investment capacity. He particularly mentioned the success of the “industrial acceleration policy,” a 2014-2020 vision designed to boost Moroccan entrepreneurship, gap the disconnect between the labor market and higher education curricula, and increase Morocco’s economic output. Despite persisting obstacles, Morocco’s international standing, particularly in terms of knowledge production—the number of PhDs delivered by Moroccan universities—and poverty reduction, has markedly improved in recent years, El Ferdaous told the audience. Morocco’s ‘African dynamic’ As the kingdom’s “institutional family,” Africa is a big part of Morocco’s industrial ambitions.  King Mohammed VI’s Africa Agenda has revitalized Morocco’s presence on the continent, making Morocco the second biggest African investor in Africa.  When asked what Morocco hopes to bring to the continental table and whether Rabat is ready to compete with other regional giants, El Ferdaous said that it is important that African countries start looking at the relentless pace of globalization as full of potential opportunities, rather than only as a threat to the continent. “For Morocco’s Africa-focused vision to materialize, however, African states need to communicate and give more weight to intra-African exchanges. Morocco’s bid to be more assertive in the rest of Africa entails fighting side by side with other African countries, not against them. We will be with Nigeria rather than compete with it,” he said. Referring to the Sous Moussa same region-focused initiative, an investment framework that makes it possible for project bearers to invest beyond the level of their financial means, that investment possibilities have markedly increased for Moroccan entrepreneurs, regardless of their capital level.  As for Morocco’s South-South initiative and its application to join the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), El Ferdaous insisted on living up to the challenges of new regional and political realities. He explained: “It really is time to sideline old ideas of regional integration in order to practice the now prevailing policy of integration through investment.”  The suggestion is a veiled rebuttal to critics of Morocco’s ECOWAS bid. The critics say that Morocco’s eligibility to the regional body is questionable because the North African country is not geographically located in West Africa.  Investing in human capital But how ready is Morocco to face the competition of other players—particularly non-African—who are increasingly investing in the continent? And, with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in other parts of the world, giving them precedence over Africa in the scramble to master and perhaps dominate the tools of the digital world, can Morocco’s “pan-African foreign policy” prevail? “The advent of AI is a human capital issue. So the challenge is to invest in knowledge production and to train experts equipped enough to compete with others in the digital world. [Morocco’s] industrial plan expects to train 500,000 youths in matters related to technology and AI.  “This is a huge target, but we are sure to reach it. And the existing figures are very indicative of the level that has so far been attained. There sure are other things left to do to ensure that Morocco is able to absorb its productive capacities. But we are almost there.”

Rabat – A forum on Morocco-Canada expertise sharing has highlighted the need to bolster Morocco’s productivity and global prestige in aeronautics. Held in Skhirat, a coastal town between Casablanca and Rabat, the forum convened over 200 participants to discuss the recent achievements and the potential of the aeronautical sector in Morocco. The event, which was organized by a group of Moroccan experts residing in Canada under the auspices of the ministry in charge of Moroccans living abroad, sought to “devise the ideal way to facilitate the contribution of the Moroccan diaspora to the socio-economic changes in their country of origin.” Bridging immigration, entrepreneurship, and expertise-sharing As an increasingly profit and job-generating sector, migration is an integral part of Morocco’s new development plan, organizers noted. And despite the range of views presented by officials and experts at the event, there was overwhelming agreement on the economic importance of the Moroccan diaspora. As officials and experts shared their perspectives, the convention took on a serious note, gathering momentum as experts, organizers, and official representatives from Morocco and Canada praised the “strategic partnership” binding the two nations. In addition to bringing the two countries closer through the investment model pioneered by Moroccans residing in Canada, they noted, the Morocco-Canada aeronautical cooperation signaled the beginning of a journey that has the potential to propel Morocco to the forefront of aeronautical breakthroughs. Abdelkarim Benatiq, deputy minister for Moroccans living abroad, and under whose department’s auspices the forum was held, underlined the positive impacts of immigration “in a world of growing suspicion and distrust [about migrants].” “Contrary to general clichés about migrants and migration, the reality of human mobility is globally a positive one,” Benatiq said. He explained that “in a constantly changing world, where physical barriers are gradually disappearing, the imperative of economic and cultural opening has never been more pressing for countries.” Putting the Morocco-Canada cooperation in the general context of globalization, the minister went on to say that socio-economic problems worldwide are increasingly becoming issues which require “collective responses from governments” as well as a mindset of “shared burden.” For his part, Moulay Elalamy, the minister of industry, seized the occasion to spotlight Morocco’s achievements in the industrial sector, particularly since the launching of the 2014-2020 “Industrial Acceleration Plan.” “There has been a true revolution in Morocco’s industrial sector,” the minister said, explaining that over half of the plan’s projected results have been achieved. “When I showed the products of some of our achievements to my Canadian counterparts, they were positively shocked that such aeronautical advances could be made in Morocco,” he noted. But while the achievements have been “incredibly impressive,” Elalamy continued, “There still remain questions to answer and areas to improve.” Among the pressing needs of Morocco’s emerging aeronautical sector, a recurring problem is “the lack of highly qualified technicians to face the immediate and urgent needs of an assertively growing industry.” Elalamy said that Morocco hoped to learn a lot from Canada, which comes third in aeronautical performance worldwide. Canada proud of its Moroccans   In his speech prior to the signing ceremony, the chargé d’affaires of the Canadian embassy heaped praise on Moroccans residing in Canada. He said that their commitment to both their host country and their country of origin, as well as their expertise in their respective fields, set the stage for the success of bilateral ties between the two countries as well as the signing of agreements such as the expertise-sharing agreement in the aeronautical sector. “I am proud to be signing this agreement on my country’s behalf,” he said. “Canadians of Moroccan descent represent one of the biggest successes of Canada’s multiculturalism.” The Canadian official’s remarks come in the wake of two success stories in the Moroccan community in Canada. On October 1, Moncef Derraji and Marwah Rizqy, two Canadians of Moroccan descent, were elected to the parliament in Quebec’s provincial elections. Prior to their election to the parliament, Derraji, a private sector operator who for 15 years worked for Canadian pharmaceuticals, and Rizqy, a tax professor at the Brooke University, had both been praised for their civic engagement and successful careers.

By Oumaïma Fassi Fihri Rabat – Five Moroccan workers have filed a lawsuit against an allegedly abusive Spanish agricultural firm in France.  According to Moroccan media outlet H24 Info, the lawsuit, filed with the labor court in France complains of “abusive and unlawful treatment” by Laboral Terra, a Spanish temporary employment agricultural firm.  The workers declared they were victims of “slavery” and blackmailing. The company allegedly required its employees to work additional hours without compensation and refused give workers paid leave or compensate for job risks. Employees also could not take weekly days off, and the employer failed to declare workplace injuries.  The farms, located in the south of France, specialize in the processing and packaging of fruits and vegetables. One of the workers claimed in a statement to H24 Info that she had to work every day for up to 12 hours per day for a monthly salary ranging from €300-1,500. The firm’s management allegedly threatened the workers with deportation if they complained. Laboral Terra also allegedly regularly ended workers’ contracts without prior notice. The “posted workers,” workers sent by their employer to another EU country, now demand a salary adjustment of €13,800 and indemnities of €37,000, the re-classifying of their contracts to permanent contracts, and €6,500 in damages.  The firm’s lawyer, Charlene Martane, argued that, in this case, the Spanish law should be applied, as the contracts were written and signed in Spain following Spanish standards.  Hundreds of people gathered yesterday in support of the workers, in solidarity with their fellow employees who did not sue out of fear. The protest was organized by the union of posted workers in France (CGT).

Rabat – The US Department of State has announced the opening of the registration period for the diversity visa lottery for US permanent residence in 2020.  The US grants 50,000 immigrant visas through the diversity visa lottery each year to foreign citizens of eligible countries, including Morocco, who have applied and qualified. Eligible countries are those that have sent fewer than 50,000 immigrants to the US in the past five years. The registration period began Wednesday, October 3, and will continue until 5 p.m. (Moroccan time) on November 6, 2018. All registrations should be submitted through dvlottery.state.gov. The US Department of State stressed that the application process is free. The department advised visa applicants to remain vigilant for fraudulent emails, websites, and letters claiming to be part of the diversity visa program.

Rabat – Morocco is expected to extend contracts to continue importing gas from its eastern neighbor, Algeria. Morocco is set also to obtain full ownership of a gas pipeline between Algeria and Europe. Algerian Minister of Energy Mustapha Guitouni confirmed the news to Reuters on Monday. He met with his Moroccan counterpart, Aziz Rabbah, in Marrakech on Monday during the 11th Arab Congress of Energy. The official said that the two countries will hold several meetings to agree on the terms of the contract. The contract between Morocco and Algeria dates to 2011. The agreement covers the delivery of 640 million cubic meters of gas annually for 10 years. The countries were using the gazoduc Pedro Duran Farell (GPDF) pipeline to ensure the flow of gas. The Moroccan minister of energy, Rabbah, has not commented yet, but Guitouni said that Morocco will take ownership over the pipeline between Algeria and Europe in 2021. Moroccan gas resources Morocco has several agreements with international companies exploring for gas in the country. In September, Morocco’s Ministry of Energy gave British Sound Energy a production concession for the company’s Tendrara natural gas discovery in eastern Morocco. The British company anticipated its first gas production to be in two years at an “expected mid case production rate” of about 60 million cubic feet per day over a 10-year period. In April, SDX Energy announced a new gas discovery at the LNB-1 onshore well on its Lalla Mimouna permit near Larache, south of Tangier. The well was drilled to a total depth of 1,861 meters. The new discovery area contains some 10.2 billion cubic feet of conventional natural gas and 55,000 barrels of condensate.

Rabat – Morocco tops the list of African countries with maritime connections. According to its 2018 report, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) lists Morocco ahead of Egypt (2nd), South Africa (3rd), Djibouti (4th), and Togo (5th). Morocco also ranks second in the Arab world with 71.5 out of 188 points, behind the UAE. The kingdom owes its position to the number of conventions it has signed to improve its maritime connectivity. Last year, Morocco consolidated its position with a grade of 67, up from less than 10 in 2007. The 2017 report attributed the sharp increase to Morocco’s Tangier Med Port, which attracts international container vessels. Maritime transport is considered the backbone of international trade. Morocco’s Tangier Med Port has served as a productive North African hub. The port said in July that it has achieved a 7 percent increase in container traffic for the first half of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. With two terminals, the port processed 1,668,566 20-foot equivalent units (TEU) from January to the end of June 2018. The port’s two vehicle terminals handled 252,194 cars during the first six months of 2018, representing an increase of 18 percent compared to the first half of 2017.

Rabat – Morocco’s ambassador to the US, Lalla Joumala Alaoui, has asserted Morocco’s determination to preserve its centuries-old history in Florida. In a debate hosted Thursday at the University of Central Florida, the ambassador spoke about Morocco’s openness to the world at all levels. The debate, under the theme “The Business Climate in Morocco and the Socio-Cultural Environment,” gave the ambassador an opportunity to explain Morocco’s commitment to progress and prosperity, owing to the political stability in the country. “Under the leadership of HM the King, Morocco has striven over the past two decades to implement substantial and bold social, political and economic reforms,” she said. Lalla Joumala also expressed pride in “the richness” of Morocco’s “thousand-year old history and its present commitment, as enshrined in our Constitution, to spiritual and ethnic diversity, which has become the Kingdom’s greatest asset.” The Moroccan diplomat also discussed Moroccan-US cooperation, which has lasted for 240 years. “This historic alliance is stronger today than ever, as the two nations, which have often found themselves on the same side of history, share strategic interests and work together to promote peace, stability and prosperity in the region and beyond,” Lalla Joumala said.  She also discussed trade between the two countries, emphasizing that the US and Morocco have a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), the only partnership of its kind that the US has signed with an African country. Dating back to 2006, the agreement serves as a catalyst for job creation and trade opportunities for private sectors in Morocco and in the US. Morocco and US signed the agreement in 2004, but it did not go into effect until 2006. According to the Office of the US Trade Representatives, “The United States-Morocco FTA is a comprehensive agreement that supports the significant economic and political reforms that are underway in Morocco and provides for improved commercial opportunities for U.S. exports to Morocco by reducing and eliminating trade barriers.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi reaffirmed Morocco’s categorical refusal to house reception centers for migrants to the EU on Thursday. After the government’s weekly council, El Khalfi said that the idea of creating reception centers for migrants is only an attempt to externalize Europe’s migration challenges. He added that it would not be a solution to curb the challenges. “We need a long-term solution and not an immediate economic solution.” Read Also: Morocco Refuses to Host European Reception Centers for Migrants El Khalfi also recalled Morocco’s strategy to integrate some migrants into Moroccan society by regularizing more than 50,000 migrants. El Khalfi asserted that reception centers would run counter to human rights, and Morocco could not agree to be involved. Commenting on immigration networks, El Khalfi said they have developed a new strategy, using for the first time a “go-fast boat.” He said that the government has dismantled more than 80 networks of undocumented immigration and human trafficking. “Therefore, there is no reason to accept the idea of creating reception centers in Moroccan soil,” El Khalfi concluded. Read Also: Migration ‘Mafias’ Challenge Government with Free Rides to Europe Morocco’s foreign affairs minister Nasser Bourita made similar remarks in June. Bourita said that Morocco “rejects and has always rejected these kinds of methods for managing the issue of migration flows,” describing such solutions as easy and “counterproductive.” Bourita repeated Morocco’s position in a recent interview with German news outlet Die Welt. “Morocco is generally against all kinds of centers. It is part of our migration policy and it’s a position in the name of national sovereignty,” he said. Bourita said that 3 percent of the world’s population have migrated, 80 percent of which have done so legally. “We are talking about only 20 percent of this 3 percent.” The number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean from Morocco to Spain more than tripled between 2016 and 1017. Spain to repatriate 210,000 Moroccans Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum reported on Thursday that the Spanish government is expected to repatriate 211,000 undocumented Moroccans from Spain. The newspaper added that 6,000 of the undocumented migrants had arrived in Spain since January 2018. The newspaper also said that Spanish officials are concerned about the number of Moroccans who are seeking asylum in Spain.The majority of people who are seeking asylum say they come from the Rif region in northern Morocco, which was rocked by protests called “Hirak Rif” in 2016 and 2017. The Hirak Rif movement erupted between 2016 and 2017 after the death of a local fishmonger in the northern Al Hoceima province. The fishmonger was killed in a garbage track as he was trying to save his goods that authorities had confiscated. The tragedy caused hundreds of protests and a government crackdown which resulted in the arrest of more than 400 protesters.

Rabat – After visiting a Moroccan prison, the British ambassador, to Morocco, Thomas Reilly, has drawn attention to the importance of reintegration. Reilly recently attended the inauguration ceremony of a university within the walls of the local Ait Melloul prison in Agadir. The purpose of the university is to “give prisoners hope of a different, better life after jail,” Reilly stated. There, Reilly met teachers who offered artistic lessons, such as painting, poetry, and woodwork to help inmates escape from the emotions of “despair” and give them the opportunity “to go back to school.”  The initiative inspired the ambassador to write a LinkedIn post on his experience at the Agadir prison, stating: “It was a sobering, inspiring day. And I was reminded again that a society should not judge its strength by the number of weapons it owns, but by how it treats its weakest and most vulnerable.” The ambassador took the chance to address the psychological impact of incarceration, saying, “For many prisoners, being locked up brings emotions of despair, hopelessness, anger and a sense of helpless, morale-sapping darkness.” Reilly pointed out that “for some inmates those emotions existed before going to prison,” and, “It may even have been that inner turmoil that led to them committing their crimes in the first place.” 
 Reilly believes that prisoners should be able to lead a better life after they come out of prison, and society should not give up on them. “Just because someone had committed a crime, society should not give up on them: doing so invites recidivism (with a higher long-term cost to society) and lost potential for the individual and the country,” Reilly wrote. Modern changes at Moroccan prisons Agadir’s local prison was not Reilly’s first experience at a Moroccan prison. The ambassador visited Oukacha prison in Casablanca in September for the launch of “Idmaj,” the first prison radio project in the Middle East and North Africa region. The radio station is the fruit of collaboration between the General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR), the British embassy, and Penal Reform International (PRI). The project is part of the rehabilitation programs and “efforts to increase prisoners contact with the outside world,” wrote the embassy. In April, Morocco’s Penitentiary and Reintegration Administration organized a workshop for prison officials on the “treatment of prisoners and the prevention of torture.” The recent initiatives are in line with Morocco’s project to improve human rights in the day-to-day management of prisons. According to the general delegate for the penitentiary and reintegration administration, Mohamed Salah Tamek,  23,946 inmates from Moroccan prisons benefited from reintegration programs in 2017. The number represents a 36 percent increase compared to 2016. In the same year, 36,145 prisoners participated in a national competition program, excelling in sports, cultural, and religious fields.

Rabat – A union of public sector doctors plans to launch “Doctors’ Week of Anger” October 15-20, calling for strikes October 11 and 26. The secretary general of the Independent Union for Public Sector Doctors, Almountadar Alalaoui, told a local newspaper,  “The public health sector in Morocco is witnessing a structural crisis … leading to the deterioration of health services.”  Alalaoui said the union will strike Thursday, October 11, and Friday, October 26. Only intensive care units and emergencies will be excluded from the strike. The union will also refuse to do school health campaigns and autopsies. Alalaoui indicated that the “Week of Anger” is a reaction to the ministry’s lack of response to the demands of doctors from a series of protests in the summer.  General physicians are protesting for the government to give employees at all pay grades the reference number 509, which enables them to advance to higher grades. Doctors also want the government to create two new pay grades above the current highest grade. The doctors also seek more resources, asking for more internship and residence posts, for adequate medical and lab equipment. They also complain of two many doctors resigning and the closure of some health services. Doctors plan to refuse to update periodic reports, patients’ records, and statistical data. They will also boycott administrative meetings and trainings. Doctors have agreed, however, to sign birth and death certificates. General physicians, early last September, began rounds of protests calling for a quick response to their demands.

Rabat – The economic and political transformations Morocco has experienced in recent years have not been enough to change the World Bank’s mixed outlook on Morocco’s growth potential. In its latest bi-annual report on Morocco’s economic performance, the Washington-based institution offered a relatively bleak reading about the capacity of Morocco’s economic model to absorb the kingdom’s level of unemployment, poverty, and socio-structural disparities. Moroccan news outlet Aujourd’hui le Maroc wrote in an October 4 editorial that the World Bank is “particularly concerned about the vulnerability of Morocco’s economic model.” With an investment rate surpassing national GDP by more than 30 percent, Morocco’s challenge in the short to medium term will be to boost investments to increase national productivity and stabilize the country’s sporadically-performing economy, the editorial explained. Aujourd’hui le Maroc’s rendering of the World Bank’s report is in many regards in agreement with the institution’s misgivings about Morocco’s improving but fragile, “unsustainable, and vulnerable” economic performance. “In the absence of more decisive structural reforms,” the World Bank wrote in April, Morocco’s GDP is set to decline further while agricultural output—especially cereal production—is “projected to return to its historical average.” Silver lining: Employment-generating businesses Despite cautions about Morocco’s economic model, the report is confident that Morocco can reverse the clock of doom if “appropriate measures are implemented.”  To prevent the fragile economic climate from worsening, generate inclusive growth, and reset to “a sustainable and strong economy,” Morocco needs to “lower corporate tax rates, improve public investment management, and better enforce tax payments by the self-employed and liberal professions.” The mixed view on Morocco’s economy is not a first-off in the body’s assessments of the internal structural and social contradictions holding back the North African country’s potential to be a better performer. During a three-day working visit in Morocco August 27-29, the World Bank’s vice-president for the MENA region, Ferid Belhaj, praised Morocco’s economic performance in recent years. Belhaj called Morocco a “country that is moving,” a “regional exception,” and a “bright spot in a dark environment.” The World Bank official stressed: “Over the years, there have been serious efforts in terms of reforms and infrastructure. That is why I see Morocco full of potential. But there is another Morocco that is facing enormous difficulties, namely of resource redistribution and social cohesion.… There is something a bit upsetting: there are so many possibilities and achievements that make Morocco a regional exception, but there are also some lapses. These need to be tackled at their roots.”

By Oumaïma Fassi Fihri Rabat- A joint Moroccan-Russian committee that met today will foster the export of agricultural products and ease business cooperation between the two countries. The Moroccan-Russian Joint Economic, Scientific, and Technical Cooperation Committee met in Rabat in light of the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations.  According to the state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the committee, chaired by the Moroccan minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, Nasser Bourita, and the Russian minister of agriculture, Dmitry Patrushev, discussed the development of economic ties with an emphasis on mutual investments in agriculture.  The meeting, attended by Aziz Akhannouch, minister of agriculture, and businesspeople from both countries, focused on the Moroccan seed market and the exportation of vegetables and fruits, particularly citrus fruits.   It also revolved around the acceleration of the Green Corridor, a protocol for information exchange regarding goods and vehicle mobility between Russia and Morocco that started during the last royal visit to Russia in 2016.  The meeting comes in a period of great developments in the countries’ strategic partnership. Eleven agreements were signed last year to increase cooperation in agriculture, energy, education, and other sectors.  The recent efforts to boost cooperation come as a result of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, signed in March 2016 by King Mohammed VI and Vladimir Putin.

Rabat – A Turkish company has reportedly expressed interest in rescuing the beleaguered Legler Maroc from collapse. The announcement was made by Moroccan Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy during a consortium on private enterprises and economic growth organized by CGEM, Morocco’s leading conglomerate of businesses in the Casablanca summer university September 28-29. Although Elalamy did not give any details about the “imminent deal with a Turkish giant” or even the name of the Turkish company, he expressed confidence in the prospects of the deal.  Once completed, Elalamy declared, Legler Maroc’s prestige will be restored so that it can live up to the expectations it garnered at its inception in 2004-2006. The national textile giant has been struggling for almost a decade. Hinting at the importance of the expected merger for Morocco’s industrial rehabilitation plan, the industry minister said: “It will be presented before the King once everything is settled.” But for all the hype surrounding the “imminent signing of the important deal,” firm instructions of secrecy seem to have been given to the people working on the project.  The only thing that is known for sure is that the investor is a Turkish group, a “close source” told Moroccan outlet Medias 24. The source said that the deal could be completed any time. The source added, however: “As long as it is not signed, we cannot say anything more.” Why is it so important? Legler SPA, an Italian company and a global household name in the textile industry, engaged in a joint venture with Morocco’s Atlantic Group owned by the Senoussi family, well-known in Moroccan industrial circles.  Legler SPA and Atlantic Group formed Legler Maroc (or LGM Denim), generating an outburst a burst of optimism and quality output for Morocco’s textile industry.  With the experience and prestige of a global brand, the North African kingdom hoped to bring its textile industry to the next level, making it competitive enough to export to other markets. As enthusiasm grew about the merger, many in Morocco started referring to the joint group as “the colossus of Moroccan textile.” In the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008, however, Legler SPA decided to terminate the venture. The move left the Atlantic Group with the difficult task of sustaining a nascent giant in the face of a deeply uncertain and shaky global financial market.  The company has since lurched from decreasing outputs to near bankruptcy, bringing it to the verge of total collapse in 2016 and 2017, when a number of foreign investors expressed interest in rescuing the collapsing giant. But no rescue deals have been struck yet. In December 2017, a Moroccan court ordered the auctioning of LGM Denim’s assets in a bid to temper the effects of the company’s impending collapse on Morocco’s economy. Turkish interest The “imminent deal” is not Legler Maroc’s first experience with Turkish solicitors. In 2011, Bossa Ticaret ve Sanayi Isletmeleri, a Turkish textile giant, was reported to have started merger negotiations with Legler Maroc.  Ahmed Reda Chami—then Morocco’s industry minister—said at the time, “Negotiations with Bossa are on good terms and we expect to complete a deal in [the] coming weeks.” But the merger never happened.  Now that Moulay Elalamy has announced another merger possibility between Legler Maroc and an unnamed Turkish company, many in the industry have started speculating that Bossa is “the unnamed company.”  They suggest that, given the increasing presence of Turkish groups on the Moroccan market—LC Waikiki for example, Bossa may have decided to come back to the negotiating table after all. But when asked whether Bossa is the name behind the “very important” and “imminent deal,” another “close source” said: “No, as far as I know. Bossa was indeed interested a few years ago, but no conclusions were reached.”

Rabat – PJD’s Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid has described RNI’s support for Rachid Talbi Alami’s critical remarks of the PJD as “bad.” In an interview with Medi1 TV, Ramid said that the National Rally of Independents (RNI) “should not support and adopt” Alami’s comments.  “The party should have told him that he went beyond the limits and that he did not respect the majority [coalition]’s charter, but instead chose to stand behind him,” the minister said. On September 21, Talbi Alami, the RNI minister of youth and sports, accused the Justice and Development Party (PJD) of “imitating” Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and of wishing to “destroy the country.” The accusations incensed the PJD, which is in a coalition with RNI, and some members responded harshly to Alami’s remarks. Ramid said that when the former secretary-general of PJD, Abdelilah Benkirane, criticized RNI leader Aziz Akhannouch, the PJD did not “support Benkirane and explained that his statement in no way reflects the PJD’s position.”  Ramid also expressed shock that the minister would criticize the PJD, whose leader, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, is Alami’s superior Tension between the parties has escalated as members of both parties have exchanged blame and accusations. Abdelaziz Aftati, a member of the PJD, called on RNI to withdraw from the government and urged Alami to resign from the cabinet. The deputy of the secretary general of PJD, Slimane El Omrani, also criticized Alami, describing his statement as “dangerous” and “irresponsible.” In response, the head of RNI, Akhannouch, said that he was “surprised by the exaggerated and unintelligible reactions that targeted a member of the political bureau of [RNI].”  For his part, Head of Government and Secretary General of PJD Saad Eddine El Othmani told his party colleagues to ignore Alami’s statements after El Omrani’s response. News outlets reported that El Othmani will convene all secretaries-general of the six coalition parties on Thursday.

Rabat- The Ministry of Economy and Finance has launched an online platform to process complaints of delays in government salary payments. The platform,“ajal finances,” was launched Thursday, October 4, at the instructions of King Mohammed VI. It seeks to improve the business climate in Morocco, identify the causes of salary payment delays and increase transparency. The platform will regularly monitor complaints and act as an intermediary to find solutions. The platform aims to complement the information systems of public institutions rather than replace them, and help build affinity between employees and employers, said the ministry. The launch of ajal finances is in line with King Mohammed VI’s speech on the occasion of the 65th anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the People on August 20. The King stated that government agencies must also pay what they owe businesses: “Any delay in payment can potentially lead to bankruptcy and the subsequent loss of many jobs.” “How can officials claim to lead by example if government agencies and state institutions fail to honor their obligations?” the King questioned. Among other recent government initiatives to develop accountability are e.participation.ma, an electronic platform for citizens to speak on public policies,  the 5757 consumer complaint hotline and the anti-corruption hotline. The anti-corruption hotline is part of the government’s national plan to end all forms of corruption by 2050.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Navy rescued a boat carrying 37 undocumented Moroccan migrants off Tangier on Wednesday morning. “A coastguard of the Royal Navy, operating in Moroccan territorial waters, assisted a semi-rigid inflatable boat in difficulty, the morning of October 3, 2018 off Tangier, following adverse weather,” said a statement by the Royal Armed Forces General Staff. All 37 rescued migrants were male The boat sank after the rescue, the statement added. Earlier this week, authorities rescued 32 sub-Saharan migrants and recovered the bodies of 11 off the coast of Nador in northeast Morocco. The navy has been under criticism after it opened fire on a boat of migrants on September 24, killing a 20-year-old woman. Morocco’s human rights minister, Mustapha Ramid, said that the navy did not target the migrants, but the captain of the boat. A military source told AFP that the migrants were hidden under a trap. Despite the incident, the Spanish secretary of state for migration, Maria del Consuelo Rumi Ibanez, commended Morocco’s efforts against undocumented migration. The official was on a two-day working visit to Morocco where she met Minister of Employment Mohamed Yatim to discuss Spanish-Moroccan cooperation on seasonal employment. The Spanish official also said that Morocco “honors its commitments and respects the agreements it has signed in the fight against illegal migratory flows,” She also added that the North African country deserves “support and financial assistance from the European Union to address this situation.”

Rabat – French police have arrested the treasurer of the Shi’ite “Centre Zahra France” for illegal possession of firearms. According to French media outlets Le Nouvel Observateur and Europe 1 the treasurer, a son of the founder Yahia Gouasmi, was arrested for illegal possession of two firearms and is now in pre-trial detention in Dunkirk.  Over 200 police agents raided the association and detained 11 people. The French forces froze the center’s assets for six months. They also conducted a thorough investigation into members’ individual assets.   The raid followed France’s thwarting of an attempted terrorist attack in Villepin on June 30. France claims the Iranian Direction of Internal Security, connected to the Iranian intelligence ministry, had attempted to attack a  meeting of an Iranian opposition group, “Moudjahidine of the People” (MEK). The operation led to the arrest of an Iranian diplomat, and France froze the assets of the organization.  According to the French Huffington Post, Iran has denied the French accusations.   The “Centre Zahra France” has been under investigation by French anti-terrorist police forces under suspicion of supporting alleged terrorist organizations, primarily Hamas and Hezbollah.  The center is also known as an umbrella group for publicly anti-Zionist associations and for its support of French comedian Dieudonné, controversially convicted of condoning terrorism.

Rabat – With the Security Council meeting on Western Sahara looming, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for the extension of MINURSO’s mandate for one year. Guteress addressed a note to the Security Council on Wednesday, asking for a one-year extension for the UN mission in Western Sahara, also known as MINURSO. The document obtained by AFP reads, “I recommend that the Council extend the mandate of MINURSO by one year, until October 31, 2019, in order to give my emissary the space and time necessary to create conditions that will allow the political process to move forward.” The last time the Security Council met to decide on the MINURSO mandate was on April 27. The council extended the mission’s mandate until October 31, 2018. Read Also: Western Sahara: Kohler Invites Morocco, Polisario, Algeria and Mauritania for Talks in Geneva Traditionally, the council has extended the mandate for one year. The secretary-general’s note followed invitations from the UN secretary-general’s personal envoy, Horst Kohler, to all parties: Morocco, Mauritania, Algeria, and Polisario. Guterres confirmed the requests of his envoy as he also “urged the parties and neighbors to come to the negotiating table in good faith and without preconditions.” AFP reported earlier that the talks would come in the form of a roundtable rather than negotiations. Guterres’ request might pressure Algeria to join the round-table talks in December in Geneva, which aim to decide on a framework for future negotiations. Algeria has been reluctant to shoulder its responsibility in the conflict, claiming that the issue should be solved between Morocco and Polisario. If Algeria refuses to attend as a fully-participating party, some analysts believe Morocco is unlikely to send a senior representative. On Friday, September 28, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita met Guterres on the sidelines of the 73rd UN General Assembly in New York. The two officials discussed the Western Sahara conflict. The Security Council will hold three meetings on Western Sahara this month, including one on October 29, to determine the future of MINURSO.

Rabat- Scientists have discovered a 90,000 year-old bone-knife made from an animal rib in Morocco. The bone tool, recovered in 2012 in the Dar es-Soltan 1 cave south of Rabat, is the oldest tool to have been shaped and used as a knife by the Aterian culture from the Middle Stone Age in North Africa, announced the Ministry of Culture and Communication on October 3. According to Natural History Museum, the bone, 13 centimeters long, came from a large mammal and had been shaped and sharpened for cutting soft material. “This find is significant because it shows how sophisticated bone tool technology was already around about 100, 000 years ago … It also shows the existence of a new type of bone tool, with no other example in the rest of Africa,” said researcher and scientist Silvia Bello from Oxford University. Moroccan scientist Abdeljalil Bouzouggar from the National Institute of Science and Technology (INSAP) suggested that “Aterians made specialised bone tools earlier than originally believed and more than 40,000 years before the Neanderthals.”  According to the scientific journal PLOS One: “This tool and the technology used to create it are distinct from bone tools of similar age in southern Africa but similar to two tools known from the El Mnasra cave site in Morocco which is also of similar age.” One of the latest published scientific discoveries in Morocco came in March. Along with Bello and Bouzouggar, an international team of researchers from Rabat’s INSAP and the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, including Louise Humphrey and Simon Parfitt, found the artefact. An international team of researchers sequenced the DNA from Homo sapiens in Morocco dating to approximately 15,000 years ago in Grotte des Pigeons, in northeast Morocco near Oujda. The Homo sapiens, dating to the Late Stone Age, had a genetic heritage similar to both Near Eastern populations and sub-Saharan African populations. In June 2017, 300,000 year-old fossils of the oldest-known remains of Homo sapiens were also found in Morocco, suggesting that Homo sapiens evolved in various locations across Africa.

Rabat- The UNHCR commissioner, Filippo Grandi, has said that Morocco sets an example in its immigration and asylum policy. At the 69th session of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) executive committee on Tuesday in Geneva, Grandi took the opportunity to review Morocco’s humanitarian initiatives and approach to asylum and immigration policy. Grandi made his remarks in an exchange with the permanent representative of Morocco to the UN in Geneva, drawing attention to the “excellent” cooperation between the North African country and UNHCR. Spain’s State Secretary for Migration Consuelo Rumi Ibanez has also described Morocco’s fight against irregular migration as “responsible engagement” during a two-day working visit to Morocco. Ibanez told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) on Tuesday, October 2, that Morocco “needs support and financial assistance from the European Union” to address undocumented migration, and “Spain will be the voice of Morocco within Europe to ask for more support and financial aid.” The comments have come at the time when Morocco is combating the migration to Europe, not only of sub-Saharan Africans but also of Moroccan young people. The latest incident hitting the headlines, in which the Royal Moroccan Navy shot at a migrant boat in the Mediterranean and killed a 20-year-old woman, has drawn increased attention to migration in Morocco. The dream of reaching their El Dorado leads hundreds of Moroccans, both adults and minors, to northern Morocco in an attempt to find a route to Europe. According to Spain’s Ministry of the Interior, Moroccan nationals make up the highest number of the 38,000 migrants believed to have entered Spain in 2018. The Moroccan government is under pressure to find rapid solutions to confront the challenges of undocumented migration. In terms of asylum policy, Morocco has become a destination for refugees and migrants under its National Policy on Immigration and Asylum (NPIA), which was launched in September 2013 under the instructions of King Mohammed VI.

By Oumaïma Fassi Fihri Rabat – An upcoming China-Morocco aviation agreement is set to open a direct flight between the countries and eliminate restrictions on use of airspace. The Moroccan minister of transport and tourism, Mohamed Sajid, met the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) administrator, Feng Zhenglin, last Thursday, September 27, to discuss a new agreement on air transport.  The agreement will allow Moroccan and Chinese airlines to use the airspace of the other’s country without restrictions.   Representatives from Royal Air Maroc and unnamed Chinese companies were also present during the meeting. The airline companies talked about creating the first direct flight linking the two countries. According to the Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Mr. Sajid reported that the agreement will be officially signed by both parties by the end of this year. With China’s growing interest in Africa, the agreement is set to foster China’s activity and involvement on the continent, using Morocco as a potential bridge.  The meeting comes at a time when Morocco and China have touted strengthening ties in various economic spheres such as agriculture, media, tourism, and technology.  In early September, Saad Eddine El Othmani, head of government, participated in the China-Africa summit in Beijing to reinforce ties with China and seek new investments.  Morocco has also explicitly supported the Chinese “Belt and Road Initiative” to create a trade network linking China with Africa and Europe.  In the last few years, Morocco has successfully boosted Chinese tourism by eliminating visa restrictions in an effort to foster Sino-Moroccan cooperation.  Morocco expects to have welcomed over 200,000 Chinese tourists this year by December 31. Over 100,000 Chinese tourists had arrived in Morocco in the months up to May, according to the Moroccan National Office of Tourism (ONMT).

Rabat – A video is going viral on social media showing a group of men confronting another man for trying to rape a child in a public hammam (sauna) in Fez. The three-minute video shows the accused man walking around the hammam,  begging the other men to let him go. At one point, the man can be heard saying, “Please let me go; I will never do it again.” The man filming asked people not to touch the man and tried to explain why they were conducting a kind of “citizen’s arrest” in the hammam. The man behind the camera then explained to viewers,  “Brothers, we caught this man who brought a kid with him to the hammam to rape him.”  In the video, which was filmed on a phone, the man filming asked the man he accused to show his face. The alleged rapist begged not to, saying he would “never do it again.” The accused man, who appeared to be in his 50s, did not deny the accusations while a group of men tried to show the camera his face. The man filming also interviewed the child. The alleged victim said that the man had told him to come with him to the hammam and that he would pay for him. When they entered, the man asked him to take his underwear off so it would not get wet. It is not the first time a pedophile scandal has caused outrage in Fez. In January, Fez police arrested a 58-year-old French pedophile who raped two little girls. The pedophile was drugging and raping the minors. Admitting to his charges, the Frenchman claimed  that he could give the children “what they were deprived of: toys, food, gifts and money.” In March, the Fez appeals court gave an eight-year prison sentence to the pedophile.

Rabat – Months after Moroccan seasonal workers accused Spanish nationals of sexual assaults, the minister of employment has said Moroccan-Spanish cooperation on seasonal employment has “positive results.” Minister of Employment Mohamed Yatim called on Morocco and Spain to reinforce cooperation on seasonal workers in a statement Tuesday. Yatim spoke about seasonal workers with Spanish secretary of state for migration, Maria del Consuelo Rumi Ibanez, who is on an official visit to Morocco. Yatim said, “Circular migration is now a reference model at the regional and even international level.” According to the minister, the countries should revise the employment agreement to allow for “candidate selection procedures to be adapted to new situations and to open up new social rights for seasonal workers, including retirement.” Read Also: Spain to Hire 10,400 Moroccan Seasonal Workers Ibanez shared Yatim’s point of view that Morocco and Spain should consolidate their partnership for better migration management, calling for more support from the EU. Ibanez also described Morocco as Spain’s strategic partner, reiterating her country’s determination to fight undocumented migration and human trafficking. Throughout the summer, several Moroccan seasonal farmers said they were subjected to sexual harassment and assault by Spanish managers in the strawberry producing region of Huelva. Following the allegations, Morocco and Spain promised to improve protections for female seasonal workers. On October 3, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), published statements from Ibanez commending Morocco’s efforts in the fight against undocumented immigration. In an interview with MAP, the Spanish official said that Morocco’s role cannot be questioned. “Morocco honors its commitments and respects the agreements it has signed in the fight against illegal migratory flows,” she said. She also added that the North African country deserves “support and financial assistance from the European Union to address this situation.” According to the Spanish official, Spain will serve as “the voice of Morocco within Europe to ask for more support and financial aid.” Her statements follow rising tension over undocumented migration and the Moroccan Royal Navy’s firing on a boat of migrants on September 24, killing a 20-year-old woman.

Rabat- Two Canadians of Moroccan descent have been elected to the Canadian Parliament in Canada’s latest provincial elections on October 1.  Both represent the Canadian Liberal Party and won landslide victories in their respective electoral districts. Born in Marrakech, Moncef Derraji grew up in Morocco. Like many Moroccans, he left the country to seek greener pastures abroad.  In Quebec, Canada’s francophone province, Derraji’s civic engagement quickly earned him recognition in his neighborhood and among his colleagues. Derraji, who worked in the private sector for nearly 14 years on the executive board of pharmaceutical companies between Canada and Morocco, made his political debut only in 2015. He was elected as chairman of the Quebec Rally of Young Chambers of Commerce (RJCCQ). Although a new-comer to Canadian politics, Derraji is a well-known figure in Moroccan elite circles, having conducted many economic missions in Morocco under the auspices of CGEM, the leading conglomerate of Moroccan business owners. Born and raised in Canada to Moroccan parents, Marwah Rizqy, the second newly-elected MP, is a more obscure name in Moroccan business circles.  In Quebec, however, the tax law professor is not new to the political scene. She ran twice for office before her triumph on October 1. She spent the bulk of her life in Montreal but has also lived in Florida, in the US, where she earned a master’s degree and a doctorate in fiscal law.  Currently a tax law professor at the Sherbrook University, Rizqy presented herself during her campaign as an “ardent fighter for employment and fiscal equity in Canada.” Over the years, Rizqy has received numerous accolades for her professional, academic, and civil efforts.  Derraji will represent Montreal’s Nelligan electoral district, and Rizqy will represent Montreal’s Saint-Laurent district.

Rabat- A Spanish government official has urged her Moroccan counterparts to “dismantle the myth” of the “European dream.” Maria del Consuelo Rumi Ibanez, the Spanish state secretary on immigration, made her remarks on Tuesday, October 2, while on an official visit to Morocco.  Ibanez, who during her visit spoke with a number of Moroccan ministers, emphasized the “strong and historic” bilateral ties between the two countries. On the hot-button topic of migration, she suggested that Morocco dismantle “all the illusions and lies” of a European paradise.  Europe, she allegedly told her Moroccan counterparts, is no longer what it used to be, and immigration to the continent no longer brings the socio-economic advantages it brought to earlier generations. “The European dream does not exist,” she stressed. “Emigration is not the solution because the journey of irregular migrants often ends badly,” she said.  There are now heightened risks to living in Europe as an irregular migrant, she explained.  According to estimates from Spain’s Ministry of Interior, Moroccan nationals make up the highest number of the 38,000 migrants believed to have entered Spain in 2018.  Claiming to have come from the Rif region in northern Morocco, where they report facing economic hardship and socio-economic marginalization, the majority of Moroccan migrants applied for political asylum status once they reached Spain, Ibanez noted. However, she added, Moroccan nationals’ applications for political asylum are generally rejected because Spain does not consider Moroccans political migrants or refugees. Ibanez’s remarks come at a sensitive moment in Morocco’s bid to limit irregular immigration.  In addition to the thousands of sub-Saharan Africans using the North African kingdom as a transit country to reach Europe, local youth in northern Morocco are reported to be massively opting for the “European dream.”  There is among Moroccan youth “a visceral urge to leave” the country and its persisting cycles of poverty, lack of political accountability, and corruption, renowned Moroccan novelist Tahar Ben Jelloun wrote in a recent column. Last week, news of the Moroccan Royal Navy firing at a migrant boat provoked uproar on social media and waves of anti-government demonstrations in Tetouan, a northern city. The navy gunfire killed Hayat Belkacem, a 20-year-old Moroccan from Tetouan. Although the Moroccan government has said that it regrets the tragedy, its spokerson, Mustapha El Khalfi, said that Morocco is uncompromising in the fight against illegal migration and mafia networks trafficking humans off Moroccan waters.  However, many Moroccans have heavily criticized the Moroccan navy for opening fire. Some have even slammed the Moroccan government as a whole, saying that it kills its own citizens, is unable to create incentives for them to stay at home, and yet is determined to prevent them from looking for opportunities elsewhere.

Rabat – Justin Kluivert has not forgotten his friend, Abdelhak Nouri, who is still recovering from a coma.  AS Roma’s new recruit Justin Kluivert made a beautiful gesture for his former Ajax Amsterdam teammate, Moroccan-Dutch footballer Abdelhak Nouri. During AS Roma’s game against Viktoria Plzen on Tuesday (5-0) in the Champions League, 20-year-old midfielder Kluivert waved Nouri’s number 34 jersey after scoring the fourth goal of the match.  Kluivert has been wearing the number 34 jersey for AS Roma in tribute to the Ajax player who has spent one year in a coma.  Kluivert’s dedication to Nouri was applauded on social media.  Nouri, who is suffering from irremediable brain damage, collapsed on July 8, 2017, during a friendly match between his club Ajax Amsterdam and Werder Bremen in Austria. “Appie,” as he is also called, was suffering from a heart disease. Since his accident, Nouri has received a lot of support from fans, football stars, teammates, and his club.  The 21-year-old promising talent can now communicate with his family, but his condition remains serious.

By Mohamed Hikal Rabat – A new law regulating housemaids in Morocco has left some activists outraged that minors can continue working as domestic workers. The law went into effect Tuesday, October 2. The new law aims to regulate domestic labor and give workers control over their situation. Read Also: Moroccan Domestic Workers Entitled to Contracts Starting October The most controversial point of the law is the section allowing minors, aged 16 to 18, to work as domestic workers. For minors, the law requires the consent of parents or guardians. Minors can work no more than 40 hours per week maximum and can do no work that could be unsafe for their health. Civil rights associations condemned the law for allowing minors to work as domestic workers. They stated that it is a violation of minors’ rights and international conventions. The provision for minors is temporary and will sunset in 2023 when minors will no longer be allowed to work as domestic workers.  There are no exact statistics regarding the number of children working as domestic workers in Morocco, but the National Council for Human Rights revealed in 2014 that there were 174 minors aged 5 to 15 who worked as domestic workers in 2010. Human Rights Watch investigated the domestic labor situation in Morocco between 2005 and 2012. The study concluded, “Girls as young as 8 endure physical abuse and work long hours for little pay as domestic workers.” The new law requires employers to sign a contract with clear employment conditions. The law prevents domestic workers from legally working more than 48 hours per week. The law entitles domestic workers to one day off weekly and a monthly wage of at least MAD 1,548. Domestic workers have the right to take religious and national holidays and a paid vacation. They also have the right to severance pay in case of dismissal. Traditionally, domestic workers in Morocco, often referred to as “servants,” work up to 12 hours per day cleaning, cooking, shopping, and looking after children. They usually come from poor rural areas. Some domestic workers are as young as six, and some are over 60 years old. Typically, domestic workers do not have paid sick leave and vacations. They could be fired at any time without severance pay. Many are subject to verbal and physical abuse and sexual harassment.

Rabat – US President Donald Trump has said publicly that he loves King Salman, but the King might not survive two weeks without US support. “We protect Saudi Arabia. Would you say they’re rich? And I love the King, King Salman. But I said ‘King, we’re protecting you. You might not be there for two weeks without us. You have to pay for your military,” Trump said at a rally in Mississippi Tuesday, October 2. The US president did not clarify when he spoke to the Saudi King. At the UN General Assembly in September, Trump criticized the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for the high price of oil. Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, is considered the leader of the bloc. According to Al Jazeera, the US president talked with King Salman on the phone about efforts to “maintain supplies to ensure oil market stability and global economic growth.” Read Also: Trump Offers ‘Embarrassing’ Welcome to Mohamed Bin Salman The Qatari news outlet also reported that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman flew to Kuwait to discuss “increasing oil production” with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber Al Sabar. In March, Trump met the Saudi crown prince in Washington, D.C. In their press conference, Trump touted deals Saudi Arabia signed with the US on missile defense planes and tanks. Trump said one deal was worth $520 million and told the crown prince, “That is peanuts for you.” He also reaffirmed his determination to benefit from Saudi Arabia’s wealth. “Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy nation, and they’re going to give the United States some of that wealth, hopefully in the form of jobs, in the form of the purchase of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world.”

Rabat- A Dutch court might extradite suspected drug lord Said Chaou, subject to two Moroccan international arrest warrants, to Morocco. The court of Breda in the southern Netherlands has decided that it “cannot maintain” a previous decision to keep Dutch-Moroccan Chaou in the Netherlands, reported Dutch newspaper Bode on Tuesday. The Dutch court ruled against Chaou’s extradition in February 2018, with the justification that he would not receive a “fair” trial in Morocco. However, the Dutch prosecution service appealed the decision to the Dutch Supreme Court. The decision not to extradite was based on an argument that the North African country had “tortured” Chaou’s co-defendants to pressure them into giving false testimony against Chaou. The Dutch police arrested Chaou in June 2017  on charges of “drug trafficking, corruption, and criminal conspiracy.” In addition to his criminal record, the Moroccan justice department suspected that Chaou had provided financial and logistical support for the Hirak Rif protests. The protests rocked Morocco’s northern Rif region in 2016 and 2017, calling out economic and social disparities. After several months of discussions with Dutch authorities, Chaou’s case nearly created a diplomatic crisis between the two countries. In June 2017, Morocco decided to recall its ambassador to the Hague for consultation. Chaou faces charges in Morocco of forming a criminal conspiracy network, intentional homicide, corruption, and international drug trafficking.

Rabat – The Moroccan government has rescued 32 migrants and recovered the bodies of 11 after their boat sank off Nador in northeast Morocco on October 1. The Royal Gendarmerie of Nador arrested a human smuggler from Mali aged 18. The rescued migrants were from sub-Saharan Africa. The gendarmerie opened an investigation to identify who was leading the migration operation. The operation comes while the government is on high alert to prevent undocumented migration and combat migration networks. Read Also: Migration ‘Mafias’ Challenge Government with Free Rides to Europe On September 24, the royal navy opened fire on a boat of migrants, killing a 20-year-old Moroccan woman and injuring three others. The shooting put the government under pressure as Moroccans mourned the tragic death of Hayat. A military source told AFP that the migrants on board the go-fast boat were hidden under a tarp, so the navy could not see them. Morocco’s minister of human rights also explained that authorities were targeting the captain and not the migrants as such boats are suspicious and are thought to smuggle drugs.

Rabat – Horst Kohler has capitalized on the UN General Assembly to discuss Western Sahara, recently meeting AU Chairperson Moussa Faki. The UN secretary-general’s personal envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, met Faki on September 27. A statement from the AU noted that the officials “exchanged views on how best to advance the resolution of the conflict of Western Sahara.” Kohler, however, knows Morocco’s firm position that the conflict should be resolved within the scope of the UN and not the African Union. Read Also: Western Sahara: Kohler Invites Morocco, Polisario, Algeria and Mauritania for Talks in Geneva Morocco’s foreign affairs minister, Nasser Bourita, made this clear during the 31st African Union Summit in Nouakchott, asserting that the “resolution of the Sahara conflict is in New York and not in Addis Ababa.” In January, Kohler held a similar talk with Faki about the Western Sahara conflict, hoping to give the AU an opportunity to propose solutions to the conflict. Faki, who assumed the AU office in July 2017, submitted a report to the Pan-African organization at the 31st AU summit, expressing full support for the UN-led political process to bring the conflict to an end. The document also expressed the AU’s satisfaction with the efforts of the UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, and his envoy Kohler. Read Also: Western Sahara: Kohler Meets Algeria, Mauritania FMs at UN Both Polisario and its main diplomatic and military champion, Algeria, lobbied for members of the AU to have a say in the conflict. On the margins of the UN General Assembly, Kohler has also met representatives of Mauritania and Algeria in regards to the conflict. After his meetings with the foreign ministers of the two countries, Kohler sent invitations to Morocco, Mauritania, Algeria, and the Polisario Front. The invitations aim to convene all of the parties at a round table in December in Geneva to discuss a possible framework that would serve as a basis for future negotiations. All parties should respond to the invitation by October 20.  Analysts says that Morocco is unlikely to send a senior representative unless Algeria attends as a fully-participating party. Morocco’s position is that it will not negotiate with Polisario alone because the separatist group is not free and cannot take a stance without checking with Algeria. Kohler convinced of Morocco’s stance? Moroccan political expert on Western Sahara, Abdel Fattah El Fatihi, told Morocco World News that Kohler might take the Geneva meeting as a preliminary gathering to “agree on negotiation criteria, especially since Morocco cannot trust a non-independent party that periodically threatens war, does not comply with UN resolutions, and has no right to represent” Sahrawis, referring to the Polisario Front. The analyst also gave MWN two hypotheses on why Kohler has not met with Morocco’s foreign minister during UNGA. First, he said, it may be because Kohler already knows Morocco’s position and conditions: Morocco will accept no solution that does not respect Morocco’s sovereignty, and Algeria must be present in negotiations as a main party, not an observer. Second, it may signal a crisis with the UN envoy “because of his positions that deviate from Morocco’s.”

Rabat – The Tangier Prefectural Police Department has arrested three individuals for robbery, fraud, and the organization of an illegal emigration operation. In a statement, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) indicated that the suspects, including a 35-year-old officer at the auxiliary forces, had promised to facilitate illegal migration to Europe for two victims for MAD 60,000 each.

Rabat – Algerian billionaire Rachid Nakkaz wants to save Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s childhood home by transforming it into a museum. After Oujda, a border city on the Moroccan side, decided to demolish the president’s abandoned house, Algerian politician Nekkaz went to Oujda to visit the house.   “I came here to put an end to this humiliation. It is unacceptable to leave the old house of our president in this sorry state,” Nekkaz said in a video posted on his Facebook page. “It is shameful that Algeria, a country rich in gas, cannot afford to renovate the house where its president was born. I cannot allow it to be demolished by the Moroccan authorities. I will buy this house, renovate it, and make it a museum,” he added.  Last week, Oujda Mayor Omar Hajira summoned an Algerian representative in Morocco, to communicate the decision to tear down the house, which is in danger of collapsing on nearby homes. Hajira stated that the region had collectively considered abolishing the house in 2017  but could not proceed due to the absence of the house’s original owners, reported Moroccan news outlet Barlamane. Bouteflika, along with his mother and siblings, lived in the house in the 1930s before they moved to another house in the area. The house sits in the populated neighborhood of Cheqfan in Oujda’s old medina (walled city).

Rabat – CGEM, Morocco’s leading conglomerate of entrepreneurs, has urged Moroccan small business owners to adapt to the growing demands of the digitized global market. The body organized a two-day-long summer university in Casablanca September 28-29 to highlight the role of entrepreneurship in socio-economic change. According to CGEM, the event was part of a wider plan to convince Moroccan enterprises to adjust to the shifting landscape of global business. In its report of CGEM’s principal motives for organizing the Casablanca summer university, Moroccan outlet Aujourd’hui le Maroc explained that CGEM hoped to convince attendees that, in the era of technological advances and the knowledge economy, Moroccan businessmen must understand the importance of entrepreneurship for growth. Facilitating an annual meeting of business leaders, young professionals, emerging entrepreneurs and investors, this year’s summer university sought to drive social and economic change with an emphasis on innovation. Under the title “A Strong Enterprise, a Winning Morocco,” the Casablanca summer university also invited business the opportunity to attract investors.  During the event, a number of panelists, government officials, and business leaders showcased the positive changes in Morocco’s business world despite persisting bureaucratic obstacles.  CGEM’s message of adaptation comes while Morocco’s new development model envisions boosting investments in innovation and the knowledge economy. The plan also hopes to provide administrative and financial incentives to investors and entrepreneurs. Speaking at the event on Saturday, Morocco’s economy minister, Mohamed Benchaaboun, promised government action to help develop Morocco’s business sector. Benchaaboun said that his department is working on a “Small Business Act” which, if implemented, will increase investor confidence and energize Morocco’s emerging startups.

Rabat- The “Michlifen Golf and Country Club” in Ifrane is the first golf course designed by an international golf champion in North Africa. King Mohammed VI’s younger brother, Prince Moulay Rachid, inaugurated the Michlifen Golf and Country Club on Monday in the mountain town of Ifrane, 60 kilometers south of Fez. The club, nestled in the heart of the Middle Atlas at an altitude of 1,650 meters, covers an area of 100 hectares and boasts scenic views of natural landscapes. Jack Nicklaus, an American former professional golfer who has created prestigious golf courses worldwide, designed the 18-hole course “in total harmony” with Ifrane’s nature and landscape, according to the golf club’s website.  The Michlifen golf club course is Nicklaus’ first in North Africa. Nicklaus said that he did not give the site a “signature hole” aesthetically representative of the golf course.  “I am one who does not single out holes, and I certainly don’t believe in a signature hole. When I have been given the mandate to create 18 equally spectacular holes. But when assessing these breathtaking views at Michlifen, they are truly taken into full breadth at Holes 9, 17 and 18.” The club also offers a luxury resort a few minutes away from the golf course which is part of the “Michlifen Resort &amp; Golf.” The resort comprises a hotel with five-star rooms and suites; three restaurants that serve Moroccan, French, Oriental, and Mediterranean cuisine; and a 3,500 square meter spa. Nicklaus described the site as “one of the most scenic, beautiful vistas you will find for a golf experience.” The Michlifen Golf and Country Club is equipped with state-of-the-art learning technology and is managed by professional and international golf specialists within “the strictest international” standards. The club’s inauguration was attended by the minister of youth and sports, Rachid Talbi Alami; Hamou Ouheli, the secretary of state to the minister of agriculture, maritime fisheries, rural development, water, and forests; and the governor of Fez prefecture, Essaid Zniber.

Rabat – Starting October 30, low-cost airline Air Arabia will be subsidized to link Tangier with four other Moroccan cities. On Monday, the Tangier-Tetouan Al Hoceima Regional Council approved four partnership agreements for the establishment of direct flights connecting Tangier to Agadir, Marrakech, Fez, and Nador, a city in northeast Morocco. The members of the council unanimously approved the agreements, which involve the region’s council, Air Arabia Maroc, and the regional councils of Souss-Massa (covering Agadir), Marrakech-Safi, Fez-Meknes and eastern Morocco (covering Nador). The agreement spans a three-year period (2018-2021). The agreements commit an annual expenditure of nearly MAD 25.68 million to offer plane tickets of no more than MAD 300. The agreements aim to reinforce Tangier’s air connections to other regions of Morocco to promote the economic, social, and tourist development of the region. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the agreements also seek to develop the tourism sector and create job opportunities in the region. Tangier and Agadir’s councils provided a budget of MAD 6 million to subsidize Air Arabia’s weekly flights. The Tangier-Marrakech flight required an MAD 9.6 million subsidy. Both regions financed the agreement. The company will offer three flights per week. The Tangier-Fez flight will operate twice a week and received an MAD 4.92 million subidy. The Tangier-Nador flight will also operate twice a week and receive an MAD 5.16 million subsidy. According to MAP, the agreements stipulate that ticket prices, which are set to the benchmark price of Brent oil ($60), may be increased with changing oil prices. Each 5 percent increase in the price of oil will allow a 2 percent increase in the ticket price. Air Arabia Maroc, headquartered in Casablanca, is a member of the Air Arabia group. It was launched in April 2009.  The airline is Morocco’s leading low-cost carrier (LCC). In June, Air Arabia Maroc added a new round-trip domestic service connecting Casablanca and Nador. The airline opened its first Moroccan domestic flight connecting Fez and Marrakech in June 2017.

Rabat – The European Parliament has adopted the scientific and technological cooperation agreement between Morocco and the European Union. The agreement covers the conditions for Morocco to join the new Partnership on Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA). In April, Morocco and the EU signed PRIMA at the headquarters of the Council of European Union. Morocco is now one of 19 member states around the Mediterranean that are working to develop innovative solutions for sustainable water management and food production. The agreement will also enable Moroccan researchers to participate in projects with European and Mediterranean research institutions. A total of 566 members of the European Parliament voted in favor of the agreement. Funding for the project comes from the EU and the 19 PRIMA members, which include Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Cyprus, Turkey, Greece, Croatia, Slovenia, Italy, Malta, Germany, Luxembourg, France, Spain, and Portugal. The agreement is a long-term project spanning 10 years (2018-2028). The object is to “devise new R&amp;I approaches to improve water availability and sustainable agriculture production in a region heavily distressed by climate change, urbanisation and population growth,” according to the EU.

Rabat – The Moroccan government is under pressure to come up with rapid solutions to confront the rising challenges of undocumented migration. The dream of reaching their El Dorado leads hundreds of Moroccans, both adults and minors, to northern Morocco and attempts to find a route to Europe.  Free rides to Europe Recently,  go-fast boats have concerned the navy and government. The boats offer Moroccans free rides to Europe, causing the government to ask why they are offering free transport. Migration networks typically charge irregular migrants fees as high as MAD 50,000 or more. Read Also: Prince Moulay Hicham Condemns Navy Fire on Migrants in Mediterranean Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum reported today that the boats are “trafficking mafias” employing a new strategy against Morocco. The newspaper also reported the government’s views on why “mafias” have resorted to giving free rides. El Khalfi explained that pressure from the success of security measures caused migration networks to give free rides. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said that law enforcement thwarted 2,000 networks and rescued 20,000 migrants from the sea before they reached Europe. Read Also: Moroccan Navy Opens Fire on Migrant Boat El Othmani agreed that the strategy comes from security pressure on mafias, who are seeking to “confuse citizens and the homeland.” Moroccans should direct anger at migrant networks The latest incident hitting the headlines, in which the Royal Moroccan Navy shot at a migrant boat in the Mediterranean and killed a 20-year-old woman, has drawn increased attention to migration in Morocco. Some have criticized the government, saying it should never have authorized gunfire against migrants. Others are more concerned about how the government will stop migration networks from trafficking youth. El Othmani said on Saturday that citizens should direct their anger towards migration networks and not the government. Moroccan human rights activist Bilal Jouhari offered his personal point of view to Morocco World News today on the navy shooting. He said, “We should not be negative about the incident.”  Jouhari added that authorities’ explanations of the navy gunfire should be taken into account. Several officials, including Moroccan Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid, explained that the navy targeted the captain of the boat and not the migrant. The government emphasized that the navy shot the boat at night, and they had not seen migrants on board. A military source told AFP the migrants were hidden under a tarpaulin. Youth take risks for better life Jouhari said that it was a “mistake” which caused a crisis, especially in light of other social issues in Morocco. Jouhari, who did not speak for his organization, also serves as the communication manager for the Anti-Racist Group for the Defense and Assistance of Foreigners and Immigrants (GADEM). Jouhari explained that some media said that resorting to arms is not unprecedented for law enforcement, which fires on boats they suspect of trafficking drugs. Read Also: Military Source: Moroccan Migrants Shot by Navy Were ‘Hidden Under Tarp’ MWN also asked Jouhari if he believes that Moroccan youth are emigrating to avoid mandatory military service, which was introduced by the government in August but has not yet been passed by Parliament. On September 22, El Faro Melilla quoted Minister of Social Welfare Daniel Ventura, who said that some minors came to Melilla expressly to evade military service. In Jouhari’s opinion, compulsory military service has nothing to do with immigration and the Spanish official’s comment was just an opinion about the situation in Morocco. Instead, Jouhari brought up the lack of job opportunities. Jouhari related that Hayat, the 20-year-old woman who died in the navy shooting, was well educated, but she could not find a job. Unemployment caused her to immigrate for better opportunities. “She studied law, but she belongs to the middle class, and this is why she could not find a job for herself in her country.” He added that youth do not hate their motherland, but they do not find good opportunities for themselves. He noted that some young engineers are offered a salary of only MAD 4,000 per month in Morocco, so they prefer to go overseas to find better opportunities. “When uneducated youth see that they have no future here, they don’t mind taking the risk of a new adventure looking for a better life.” He opined that the lack of entertaining zones, including theaters, sports stadiums, and cultural centers could also cause emigration. Especially since young people have access to the internet, they may be attracted to Europe, deeming the situation there better than in Morocco. ‘The people want free irregular migration’ Throughout the year, Morocco has touted its efforts against undocumented migrants, especially sub-Saharans who cross the land border between Morocco and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta. In recent months, videos went viral on social media featuring hundreds of Moroccan migrants demanding to be allowed to attempt irregular immigration. On September 22, a group of Moroccans wishing to emigrate protested, chanting the slogan, “The people want free irregular migration,” while maritime police made a surprise appearance to stop a migrant boat from taking on migrants. The death of Hayat on September 24 also sparked criticism and anger among the public. In recent months, the government has been pledging measures against undocumented migration. Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said in August that the government aborted 65,000 undocumented migration attempts in 2017. El Khalfi also said that Moroccans account for 13 percent of the undocumented migrants who attempted to reach Europe in 2018.

Rabat – Morocco will invest over $40 billion in the energy sector by 2030, including in a liquefied natural gas project, according to Morocco’s energy minister. Minister of Energy, Mines, and Sustainable Development Aziz Rebbah said that $30 billion will be devoted to renewable energy projects, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The investment will create great opportunities for the national, regional, and international private sector, he added. Rebbah was speaking at the opening ceremony of the 11th Arab Energy Conference on Monday, October 1, in Marrakech. The conference, organized by the Arab OPEC, the Ministry of Energy, and other international organizations, discussed energy security in Arab countries.  The minister further indicated that Morocco’s demand for energy is increasing, and the country is almost entirely dependent on imports. Morocco’s overall consumption of primary energy amounted to 20.8 million tons in 2017, including oil (55.9 percent) and coal (25.5 percent). According to Rebbah, renewable energies, including wind, hydroelectric, and solar energy, contributed 5.8 percent in 2017, compared to only 2.6 percent in 2002. Renewable energies have reduced Morocco’s dependence on energy consumption from 98 percent in 2008 to 93 percent in 2017. Rebbah also touted Morocco’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Jorf Lasfar, 120 kilometers south of Casablanca. Jorf Lasfar is the site of OCP Group’s plants. Rebbah said that 80 companies are currently interested in taking on the LNG project, which is worth $4.5 billion and will soon be put to tender. USTDA to fund LNG feasibility study The US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) announced on September 26 it gave Morocco a grant supporting the LNG infrastructure development in Morocco by funding “a feasibility study.” “This project will help meet growing demand for natural gas in Morocco, while creating new business opportunities for U.S. companies,” said Thomas Hardy, USTDA director for congressional and public affairs. According to Reuters, the LNG terminal will import up to 7 billion cubic metres of gas by 2025, and the project includes building “a jetty, terminal, pipelines and gas-fired power plants.” The US Lixia Capsia Gestionis firm will conduct the feasibility study “to evaluate building an LNG import terminal and regasification facility that would link to the Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline.” Matthew Meredith, the Lixia Capsia Gestionis managing principal, said, “We are looking forward to working closely with the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco … to advance the energy goals and support the implementation of the Kingdom’s national energy strategy.” US Chargé d’Affaires in Morocco Stephanie Miley hoped to continue “the excellent cooperation between Morocco and the US “in the energy sector and as in so many other areas.”  “This study will give the Moroccan authorities factual insight on LNG’s future role in the implementation of the Kingdom’s energy strategy,” USTDA quoted the ministry as saying. The project comes as a part of the Moroccan strategy to diversify energy supplies and reduce Morocco’s dependence on oil and gas. “The U.S. Government is proud to support Morocco’s energy diversification and assist Morocco in providing reliable and efficient energy to its citizens,” said Miley.

Rabat – Morocco will turn the clocks back one hour to standard time, GMT, on October 28 at 2 a.m., after the summer’s Daylight Saving Time.  Every year, Morocco adopts Daylight Saving Time for the summer and returns to standard time for the winter on the last Sunday in October. When Ramadan falls in the summer, Morocco makes another switch back to standard time during DST. The clock change comes at a time when the EU has decided to stop switching between DST and standard time.  The Commission suggested EU member states stop changing the clocks because of health issues that follow the change of time and the difficulties managing schedules in the transportation sector.  In Morocco, a number of activists submitted a petition in 2017 for the discontinuation of Daylight Saving Time. However, the request has not been answered.  Mohammed Benabdelkader, the minister of civil service, told Moroccan news outlet Le360 that potential decisions on DST would have to wait for the results of an on-going study on the impact of changing time on Moroccans’ health.  The minister also specified that the EU decision will not necessarily influence Morocco.   Moroccans expect to turn the clocks forward one hour for Daylight Saving Time (GMT+1) on March 31, 2019.

Rabat – The Islamic Republic of Iran is reportedly growing its geostrategic weight in Africa, using Hezbollah to “destabilize North Africa.” According to Spanish newspaper La Provincia, Tehran’s geopolitics in recent months suggest a long-term plan to establish a strategic stronghold in North Africa, a region traditionally allied with Washington on security, especially in the fight against terrorism. “Iran colluding with Polisario to wreak havoc in North Africa,” the newspaper headlined its report, backing Morocco’s claim that Iran is using its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, to train and equip the Polisario Front, the secessionist militia in Western Sahara. On May 1, Morocco made headlines in diplomatic circles with a brisk announcement that it was immediately severing diplomatic ties with Tehran.  In a statement explaining Rabat’s move, Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s foreign affairs minister, said that Moroccan security cameras had garnered “strong evidence” that Tehran-backed Hezbollah was providing guerilla training and heavy weaponry to the Polisario Front.  “We have strong [and indisputable] proof, including names and specific incidents, that indicate that Hezbollah is logistically and strategically supporting the Polisario Front,” Bourita said. He explained that “Hezbollah sent military officials to Tindouf,” the Polisario Front’s de facto capital, “provided the front with weapons, and trained its troops on urban warfare.” American Support for Morocco’s Position in Western Sahara  Following Morocco’s denunciation of Iran’s alleged desire to destabilize Morocco and undermine its interests, the US expressed support for its North African ally.  Rabat, as a bastion of anti-terrorism, sociopolitical stability, and “tolerant Islam,” is Washington’s surest ally in a traditionally unstable North African region, Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon analyst, wrote in the aftermath of Rabat’s move to sever ties with Iran. Citing a more recent case of senior US lawmakers supporting Morocco in its diplomatic and ideological rift with Iran, La Provincia quoted Congressman Joe Wilson as saying that Iran is known for financially backing “terrorist” groups like Hezbollah and providing them with logistical support. The Spanish newspaper added that, like Congressman Wilson, a number of legislators in Washington think Iran-Hezbollah-Polisario collusion in North Africa is hardly surprising. Iran, they reportedly argue, has a vetted interest in undermining not only American strategic interests, but also those of US allies. As the US fears that Tehran may establish a North African security backdoor via the insecure and porous borders under the control of the Polisario Front, La Provincia explained, Washington is increasingly pushing for a politically negotiated peace in the Western Sahara territorial dispute. And while the US’s desire to thwart the Iranian threat in North Africa is primarily grounded in a need to secure America’s strategic interests, the US genuinely believes that Morocco’s autonomy plan for Western Sahara is “credible, serious, and realistic,” La Provincia concluded.

Rabat – Gabon has reasserted its support for Morocco’s autonomy plan, describing it as an “ideal framework” to reach a solution for Western Sahara. “This initiative is in conformity with international law and the United Nations Charter, and falls within the framework of the right to self-determination,” said Gabon’s permanent representative to the UN, Ambassador Michel Xavier Biang. Biang delivered the statement Monday in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York. Biang reaffirmed Gabon’s support for the UN’s efforts to bring peace and security to Africa and welcomed the UN secretary-general’s efforts, along with his special envoy to Western Sahara’s key role in the political process. Biang also stated that “the resolutions of the Security Council that were adopted since 2007 on this issue have clearly underlined this, including resolution 2414 dated 27 April 2018, which emphasizes mainly the need to search for a realistic, pragmatic, and durable political solution that is based on compromise.” African countries back Morocco’s territorial integrity Many African countries also expressed their support for Morocco’s territorial integrity and recognized the North African country’s efforts to reach an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara issue. In February, Ghana’s Senior Minister Yaw Osafo-Maafo reiterated his country’s support for Morocco’s autonomy plan as a consensual and mutually acceptable solution for the Western Sahara conflict in a meeting with the Moroccan head of government. Mali’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Tieman Hubert Coulibaly said that Morocco’s efforts were “serious,” “credible,” and respect the parameters of the UN Security Council’s observation mission in Western Sahara, while speaking in a press conference in April in Morocco. Senegal and Burkina Faso also recognized the effectiveness of the Moroccan autonomy plan. “We believe that this initiative, developed in good faith, is more than ever an appropriate framework for a happy and lasting solution to this dispute on the basis of a dynamic and realistic compromise,” Gorgui Ciss, Senegal’s deputy permanent representative to the UN, said in October 2016, at UN headquarters. Burkina Faso’s minister of territorial administration and internal security, Simon Compaore, affirmed that Western Sahara is part of Morocco. “Our stance has not changed. Everybody knows it. [Western Sahara] is an integral part of Morocco,” Compaore told MAP in April 2016, following talks with Morocco’s minister delegate to the minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation.

Rabat – Football star Cristiano Ronaldo is facing some serious rape accusations.  According to AFP, police in Las Vegas announced on Monday, October 1, that they have reopened an investigation into an allegation of rape brought by a 34-year-old American woman against the world football star. “The case has been reopened and our detectives are following up on information being provided,” Las Vegas police said, refusing to give further details on the “ongoing investigation.” Kathryn Mayorga has opened up for the first time to German outlet Der Spiegel about the accusations she made against the 33-year-old sensation, asserting that he raped her at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009. Mayorga has also revealed that the former Real Madrid star made an agreement with her to sign a confidentiality contract and pay her $375,000. The Juventus striker has already denied the rumors on social media. Ronaldo commented on the charge of rape during a live Instagram. He also decided to sue the German magazine over defamation.  “It’s a lie. She wants to become famous thanks to my name. These situations are part of my job,” said the football player.  The accusation first surfaced 1.5 years ago, but Kathryn Mayorga’s name only appeared recently. Last year, Ronaldo called the revelation “journalistic fiction,” telling the media the sexual relationship had been consensual. However, Kathryn Mayorga’s lawyer claims to have a document challenging Cristiano Ronaldo’s version, detailing that the victim had said “no” and “stop” several times. Mayorga not only hopes to “get justice” by making Ronaldo take responsibility, but also to prevent him from doing it again. She also wanted “to encourage all the victims of sexual assault” to pursue their attackers, “as famous, rich or powerful as they can look. “

Rabat – After members of the US Congress introduced a bipartisan bill condemning collusion between Hezbollah and Polisario, pro-Polisario media have expressed their fears over Morocco’s latest diplomatic campaign. Algerian news outlet TSA wondered if Morocco’s repeated pressure on the US had yielded results. On September 28, three US congressmen, including two Republicans, Joe Wilson and Carlos Curbelo, and one Democrat, Gerry Connolly, submitted a draft bill to consolidate Moroccan ties with the US and to condemn the alleged collusion between the Polisario and Hezbollah. Morocco “remains an important strategic ally and partner for peace in the Middle East and North Africa,” Wilson said. Wilson described Polisario as “a terrorist organization funded by Iran” and accused Iran of supporting Polisario against Morocco. “The terrorist regime in Iran has been funding attacks against Morocco, by the Polisario Front, and it is time for the United Nations to promote a peaceful resolution to this Western Sahara conflict.” The pro-Polisario magazine Futuro Sahara expressed its fears over Morocco’s progress and diplomatic campaigning on the Western Sahara issue. The bipartisan draft bill criticizes the Iranian government for providing “monetary and other forms of material support to terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah.” The draft bill also condemns any action of both Iran and Hezbollah “that promotes instability in North Africa.” It notes that “the efforts of Iran and Hezbollah to maintain influence in North Africa runs counter to the national security objectives of the United States.” A ‘dangerous development’ Futuro Sahara mentioned the US State Department’s 2017 Human Rights report which described the Polisario’s self-styled Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) as “separatists.” The magazine considered the move a “dangerous development in the US government’s handling” of the Western Sahara issue. Futuro Sahara stated that the 2017 Human Rights report cited only a few cases of alleged violations of human rights. On the other hand, the report recognized Morocco’s effort to implement “positive” measures to reinforce its respect for human rights. The report also acknowledged that Morocco respects the right to both authorized and unauthorized peaceful demonstrations in the region. The pro-Polisario magazine implied Polisario’s fears of the success of Moroccan diplomacy, saying that the US State Department’s recognition of Morocco’s effort “highlights the penetration of the Moroccan diplomat in the US government through the influential lobbies in Washington and New York.” According to the magazine, the success “raises many questions about the feasibility of the one-actor policy pursued by” Polisario representatives in some key countries. The pro-Polisario magazine considered the group’s lack of representatives in the US to be the cause of their failure in communicating with the US. “Is it conceivable that a representative of one person and his assistant might be able to control the diplomatic work in the United States while Spain, for example, has dozens of representatives?” Futuro Sahara questioned. “The same applies to [Polisario] representatives in the United Kingdom, where it is impossible for two people to carry out diplomatic work in four countries: England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland,” the magazine added. The bill, which pro-Polisario media say portrays lies about alleged ties between the Polisario Front and Iran, advocates the Moroccan autonomy plan. Morocco’s autonomy plan “is serious, realistic, and credible, and represents a path forward to satisfy the aspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity,” according to the bipartisan bill.

Rabat – Is it right to boycott Saad Lamjarred’s songs? Does boycotting blur the lines between the artist as a person and his art? To what extent should an artist be boycotted? The old debate about separating the deed from the doer has resurged in many Moroccan circles in the past weeks as Saad Lamjarred, the 33-year-old Moroccan singer, awaits trials in a French jail for two rape charges.  For a large number of women’s rights activists, trying—or eventually convicting—Lamjarred   is not enough to quell the “rape culture” that he embodies. They argue that the singer’s songs should be boycotted to ensure a “meaningful step” towards ridding Morocco of its predominantly patriarchal culture.  Boycotting Lamjarred, they hope, will deter many other men. And so critics are now venting their outrage on various platforms on social media, using the hashtag #Masaktach (I will not be hushed) to call on Moroccan radio stations to join the boycott initiative.  Calling Lamjarred a “serial rapist,” former Reuters journalist Samia Erazzouki suggested to Moroccan radio stations on Twitter that boycotting Lamjarred was a necessary step in the fight against “rape culture” and the silencing of women.  “Which side are you on?” Erazzouki asked confrontationally in her tweet, framing the issue in terms of a zero-sum game between those who value women’s rights and those who condone the misogynist culture that Lamjarred is believed to represent. The wave of online condemnation eventually prompted Hit Radio and Radio 2M, the country’s leading radio stations, to chime in with critics. Both radios announced their decision to stop playing the accused’s songs, citing their concern for women’s rights and dignity as their motive. ‘Saving Lamjarred’ Despite the online boycott and the seriousness of the charges Lamjarred is facing, some of the singer’s loyal devotees do not seem to have been impressed. Unencumbered by the sustained call-out targeting their talismanic star, their love for and devotion to Lamjarred seem to have doubled as a result of the web of accusations and condemnation he now finds himself in. “Saad Lamjarred, the Moroccan pop star, needs the help of Maitre Dupont-Moretti,” read a petition launched by the singer’s fans. They hoped to garner enough public support to convince Moretti, the “illustrious” French attorney, to “come back and save [Lamjarred’s] future.” (Moretti had earlier announced that he was no longer part of Lamjarred’s defense team. The French lawyer claimed that the Moroccan singer was deaf to his numerous warnings about public exposure.) Short as only a desperate cry for help can be, the fans’ petition presented him as a victim who, having fallen in a “trap,” probably set by “haters,” now more than ever needs the “heartfelt” support of his fans and the “illustrious” services of his former attorney. Call-out Feminism and Collective Hypocrisy But there is a third group that has emerged out of the Olympian social media feud opposing the singer’s boycotters and his saviors.  Proponents of the emerging ‘third way’—let’s call them that—are now venting their frustration at both groups. They lash out at the singer’s fans for their cultish tendency and their sheep-like readiness to support a celebrity no matter what. But they are equally disapproving of Twitter critics, whom they portray as hypocrites and circumstantial condemners calling out a culture they helped to sustain and perpetuate in the first place.  “Some of my friends who are very sensitive about anything feminist promised to boycott me—it is fashionable now—if I ever said something on this sacrilegious topic,” read the opening sentence of Naim Kamal’s article in L’Observateur’s September 28 issue.  Kamal, who by “sacrilegious topic” meant the ongoing Lamjarred affair, voiced his disappointment at the decision to boycott the artist’s songs. He emphasized the presumption of innocence principle, writing that however grave the charges, “only the court has the legal mandate to decide.” Arguing that Lamjarred, even if found guilty, should not be confused with his songs, Kamal continued, hammering home his point about call-out culture and collective hypocrisy: “This is mob justice. It stems from the crowd, the mob, and [social] conditioning. Nothing can be more execrable.… We danced, we sang; we even loved to the sound of Lamjarred’s music,” he wrote. He ironically asked how everyone readily celebrated the person they are now cursing, conveniently failing to notice all that time that his lyrics were in fact “misogynist and a bad example for Morocco’s youth.” Déjà vu Some may welcome the fact that people are actually talking about salient social issues that require social dialogue.  However, it is debatable whether there is any novelty to this Lamjarred episode, and whether the whole thing is not merely another temporary online storm after which things will go back to normal, as if nothing ever happened, as if some lives are condemned to be mildly spoken about on Twitter and Facebook.  In the aftermath of the Khadija affair, a group rape allegation that stirred another social media storm, Moroccan novelist Abdellah Taia remarked: “This is unfortunately a matter that may be forgotten next week. Or perhaps next month. We will pass on to something else. There will be another cause for collective uproar. Nothing will be done. Society will not even try to find a solution.” And indeed: Who is now speaking about Khadija?  Taia may have slightly exaggerated; he may have been carried away by the urgency of the moment. Or, as a writer, he may have deliberately given in to his writerly inclination towards linguistic theatrics, choosing to bring emotion and engagement to the page in order to galvanize his readers. But beyond the slight writerly slide into the emotional, Taia’s lines ring true and relevant in this Lamjarred affair: Morocco is still undecided about its men.

Rabat – Tensions between Saudi Arabia and Qatar have surfaced again, and this time it is about the television group BeIN.  Qatar’s BeIN, claimed Monday, October 1, $1 billion for “massive piracy” attributed to Saudi Arabia. Doha is also pursuing a case in front of the World Trade Organization (WTO) for “intellectual property violations.” As a global sports and entertainment giant, BeIN holds the expensive rights to broadcast numerous sporting events, including European football championships, basketball, and Formula 1 competitions. In its press release, BeIN justified its $1 billion damages claim saying it was “subjected  to the most pervasive piracy the world has ever seen in sports broadcasting.” As a “result of the arbitrary and discriminatory measures implemented by Saudi Arabia,” BeIN “has suffered damages exceeding the billion dollars that continue to increase every day,” said the bouquet of sports and entertainment channels. World Cup piracy row Before the beginning of the World Cup, tension mounted between Qatar and Saudi Arabia regarding the transmissions of BeIN Sports, which owned the broadcast rights to the World Cup, accused the Saudi-based pirate network of stealing the transmissions of games before the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Qatar’s BeIN Sports had urged FIFA to take measures against the Saudi Arabian “BeoutQ” television channel, investing £12,000 to stop BeoutQ from pirating broadcasts of sports events. BeIN asserted that “BeoutQ” decoders had been sold openly and extensively throughout Saudi Arabia, although Riyadh claimed to have made “unrelenting” efforts to fight piracy. Saudi Arabia had welcomed FIFA’s decision to end the pirated sports channel BeoutQ for illegal distribution of the 2018 World Cup, underlining its efforts to fight illegal activities.

Rabat- Several Spanish associations have urged Spain to bring justice to hundreds of Canary Islands victims killed by Polisario in the 1970s and 1980s. During a recent meeting, several associations representing more than 6,000 workers from the Canary Islands victimized in Western Sahara by terrorist attacks from Polisario and other organizations, held talks with Spain’s interior minister, Fernando Grande Marlaska. The president of the Canary Association of Victims of Terrorism (ACAVITE), Lucia Jimenez, who represents 300 victims of Polisario’s “bloody and brutal” attacks, called for the Spanish government to take “urgent and immediate” measures. The aim of the meeting is to bring justice to the victims and their families who “suffered from the terrorist scourge by different terrorist groups in the last 50 years years,” reported Spanish news outlet, La Provincia, quoting the Autonomous Federation of Associations of Victims of Terrorism in Spain (FAAVTE). FAAVTE also urged Marlaska to take legal measures against the Polisario Front and other organizations involved in the terrorist attacks, such as Terra Llure, a former Catalan terrorist organization, so that their crimes will not go unpunished. Between 1974 and 1976, Polisario led attacks on the phosphate conveyor belts in Laayoune in Western Sahara, in an attempt to stop Moroccan phosphate mining. Polisario also engaged in violent attacks on Spanish fishing vessels, the Moroccan army, and French nationals. Polisario’s targeting of Spanish citizens continued in the 1980s and claimed the lives of 300 civilians, according to a report by Spanish news website La Opinion de Tenerife. The report gives a detailed account of the attacks and the names of the victims. After the Western Sahara’s return to Morocco’s sovereignty in 1975, the Polisario used the assassination of Spanish civilians as a tactic to pressure Spain and punish it for signing a fishing agreement with Morocco 1976, which tacitly recognized the Western Sahara as Moroccan territory.

Washington D.C.- Pro-Polisario and Algerian media have sounded upbeat about the invitations Horst Kohler, the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General to Western Sahara, extended to the parties of the Western Sahara conflict. For instance, Polisario’s official news website Sahara Press Service, was quick to report that Kohler sent an invitation to both Morocco and the Polisario. The report made no mention of Algeria, Polisario’s main backer. The omissions contained in the news release were merely to mislead the readers and also convey the message that the Polisario leadership is on the verge of achieving a breakthrough by holding direct talks with Morocco. However, the reality is quite different from what Polisario’s mouthpiece has attempted to portray. First, the report neglected to mention that the Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General has invited Morocco, Polisario, Algeria, and Mauritania to participate in the upcoming meeting in Geneva. Algeria has previously participated as an observer party in meetings over the Western Sahara issue. Thus far, and following Morocco’s repeated calls on the UN to fully include Algeria in the talks, we do not yet know in what capacity Algeria will participate in the talks. Second, the meeting which Kohler has called for will neither kick off direct negotiations between Morocco and Polisario nor will it deal with any substantive issues. The meeting, instead, will be a round table involving Algeria and Mauritania. The Personal Envoy will seek to allow the parties to set the framework for conducting future direct negotiations. Kohler confirmed this during his briefing to the Security Council on August 8. Regardless of the format of the round table, the factor that will determine the talks’ outcome is whether the UN is prepared to meet Morocco’s main demand: to recognize Algeria as a major party to the conflict and not only an observer. In recent years, Morocco has emphasized more than once that no political breakthrough can be achieved as long as Algeria is not considered a main party to the conflict. King Mohammed VI confirmed this in his recent speech on Green March Day. The same position has been reiterated on many occasions by Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN Omar Hilale. The UN is aware of Morocco’s clear and unambiguous position. The UN is also aware that Algeria supports Polisario financially, politically, militarily, and diplomatically. Without Algeria’s support for the group, the conflict would not have lasted for more than four decades. Read Also: Western Sahara: Kohler Invites Morocco, Polisario, Algeria and Mauritania for Talks in Geneva The UN is also aware that Algeria is misreporting the real number of Tindouf camp inhabitants and is obscuring its embezzlement of humanitarian aid dedicated for the camps. If Algeria is an observer party to the conflict and not a direct party, why does it persistently refuse for UNHCR to conduct a census in the Tindouf camps? Morocco should cling to its firm position that negotiations must include Algeria. As long as the UN continues to adopt the same approach, which has proved to be a failure for 10 years, it is highly unlikely that anything will be achieved in the political process. At this juncture, Rabat’s accusation that Polisario colludes with Hezbollah and Iran with the blessing of Algeria to undermine Morocco’s stability makes the assumption that Morocco will engage in direct negotiations with Polisario unlikely. The alleged collusion was the primary reason Morocco cut off diplomatic relations with Iran. Read Also: Horst Kohler Briefs UN Security Council on Western Sahara These accusations undermine Polisario’s credibility and strip it of any legitimacy to negotiate over the Western Sahara conflict. If Morocco were to agree to the UN’s request to sit in direct negotiations with Polisario, it would indicate that Rabat was not serious about its accusations against Polisario. Such a move would imply that Morocco’s accusations were not based on solid facts. Nothing would indicate that Morocco is ready to put itself in this position and undermine its own credibility. In light of Morocco’s recent outreach to the American administration and its recent mobilization in Washington D.C., it appears that Morocco is determined to stand by its firm position to reject direct talks with Polisario and to reject any proposal that would not make its autonomy proposal the basis of future negotiations. That being said, Morocco will most likely respond positively to the UN’s invitation. The move will seek to show Morocco’s willingness to abide by Security Council Resolution 2414 and cooperate with the UNSG Personal Envoy. Morocco’s participation, however, will not be at the highest level. Morocco will most likely be represented by a counselor from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Morocco will seize this opportunity to reaffirm its firm position on the need to involve Algeria as a main party in future talks. By acquiescing to Kohler’s request and showing its readiness to cooperate with him, Morocco will buy more time until next April to lobby influential members of the Security Council, especially the United States, of the need to involve Algeria in future negotiations. Regardless of the outcome of the talks that will be held in Geneva in December, the ball is in the United Nations’ court, which should be guided by a spirit of realism to breathe new life into the stalled political process and bring the conflict to an end. Without adapting to the realities of today and letting go of past approaches that have proved to be failures, the UN will fail again in its political process.

Rabat – Amid outrage over the tragic death of Hayat, an anonymous source from Morocco’s military said that the undocumented migrants “were hidden under a tarp.” The source told AFP that the go-fast boat, which was carrying migrants across the Mediterranean, “had adopted a hostile attitude” and was operating in “dangerous maneuvers that could have caused a collision that was narrowly avoided.” A woman, Hayat, 20, was killed when the navy fired at the boat. The source added that two members of the royal navy opened fire “because the go-fast boats are used for drug trafficking.” The military source explained that the navy did not see the undocumented migrants in the boat. Read Also: Moroccan Killed in Navy Shooting is 20-Year-Old Woman “It is a regrettable incident,” the anonymous source added. On Sunday, the Justice and Development Party (PJD) quoted Morocco’s Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid as he commented on the incident. According to the minister, the members of the navy were “targeting a trafficker who challenged Morocco and its security forces.” Ramid made his remarks during a television program called “Sawt Shabab” (youth voice) on Medi1 TV channel on Saturday. He asserted that Hayat was not the target. The official commented on human rights in Morocco, saying, “Things are not as bad as it is imagined.” Read Also: Moroccan Navy Opens Fire on Migrant Boat “Human rights issues in the country are developing steadily and slowly; we are in the process of establishing a human rights state,” he said. The Spanish captain of the boat was arrested. Morocco’s law enforcement also opened an investigation to determine the circumstances of the incident. The death of Hayat, from Tetouan, sparked public uproar. On Saturday, hundreds of Moroccan citizens marched in Tetouan to denounce the navy’s action. Most of the protesters, who were football fans of Moghreb Tetouan, were dressed in black to mourn Hayat’s death. Videos of the protests went viral on social media. Pictures showing property damage were also widely shared on Facebook. However, some were more concerned about migration than property damage. Recently, several videos of people trying to emigrate put the government under pressure. The videos cause some officials to spoke about the situation. While Minister of Youth and Sports Rachid Talbi Alami said last Friday that migration is not the problem, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said that Morocco has “great employment opportunities.” “It is not the migration of these young people to neighboring countries that is a problem, but the way they try to immigrate, which puts their lives in danger,” said Alami. El Khalfi report noted that Moroccans account for 13 percent of undocumented migrants who attempted to reach Europe in 2018 (7,100 Moroccans).

Rabat – Morocco’s Popular Movement party members have elected Mohand Laenser as the party’s secretary general for his ninth term. Mohand Laenser, 76, has been serving as the secretary general of the Popular Movement (MP) party for 32 years. The MP party was founded in 1959. Laenser announced his candidacy three days before the opening of the party’s 13th congress, held September 28-30 under the slogan “Movement for the Homeland.” The re-elected secretary general easily beat his rival, Mostapha Assalou, a member of the party’s political bureau, on the second day of the congress. MP is the only political party which has not renewed its leadership for the last three decades, adhering to those who are described in the Moroccan political field as “eternal leaders.” Speaking at the congress, Laenser expressed dissatisfaction with the political disputes between MP’s coalition partners in the government, “which lead to failure in the implementation of many projects and which citizens are paying for.” “MP’s participation in the government does not prevent it from raising the attention of its allies to the urgency of some current issues,” Laenser added. Laenser also criticized the slow pace of education reform and the implementation of rural development projects that have led to protests.  In its statement following Laenser’s new election, the MP party stressed the need to increase the political participation of women and youth as well as the margin of freedoms and cultural and linguistic rights. The party also called for “practical solutions to achieve justice in the distribution of wealth; tackling unemployment; and improving health, education, university and vocational training to regain the citizen’s confidence in institutions and political parties.” Shouts of ‘Leave! Leave!’ While Laenser was delivering his speech on the sidelines of the party’s 13th congress in the Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, some members of the MP party shouted “Leave! Leave!” The opposing members called for Laenser’s departure. Laenser became angry and did not accept their slogans. Some other members of the party intervened to calm the situation in order to continue the work of the conference.  Approximately 2,500 people attended the MP’s 13th congress, including many political and party leaders such as Saad Eddine El Othmani, head of government and head of the Justice and Development party; Aziz Akhannouch, minister of agriculture and head of the National Rally of Independents party; Nizar Baraka, head of the Independence Party; and Hakim Benchamach, head of the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM).

Rabat – PJD Minister of Employment Mohamed Yatim has opened up about his controversial date. A 28-second-long video showing Yatim holding hands with a woman in Paris opened the door for rounds of criticism and controversy. In an interview with news outlet Al Omk Almaghribi, Yatim spoke about the video and his relationship with the unidentified woman. Yatim said their relationship was “legitimate” and known to her family. Read Also: Video: Yatim’s Paris Street Date stirs Polygamy Controversy “Since the engagement ceremony, I have been visiting her family for religious and social events. It is not a secret, even my family knows about it,” the minister said. Yatim, who had already proposed to the lady, is awaiting divorce papers to end his current marriage. Defending himself and his fiancee, Yatim said that the video dates back to Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting, which fell in May and June in 2018. He noted that they met for dinner “during the month of Ramadan in a restaurant and we met in Paris.” He explained that they were not traveling or living together, emphasizing that her parents would have been the first to react if “they had thought that our relationship was not serious.” “Breaking the fast in Ramadan in summer in Europe is late, and the same thing for dinner, which is at the same time a pre-dawn meal,” he said. He continued to say that there is nothing unusual in him accompanying his fiancee to the building where she lives, because they finished their dinner late. Yatim, a member of the ruling Moroccan Islamist party (PJD), also explained his choice to marry a woman who does not wear a hijab. He said, “The hijab was previously associated with organizational or kinetic affiliation and is no longer the same.” He added that hijab is “no longer a criterion for religiosity and moral obligation.” Yatim described his future second wife as “religious.” He added that she is looking forward to improve her religious practice, taking into account and agreeing that the “legal status of her future husband requires a gradual shift in this level.” According to several news outlets, Yatim met his future wife while she was nursing him after he was injured with a fracture earlier this year. The woman is allegedly a 30-year-old psychotherapist and a nurse. The 62-year-old minister faced rounds of criticism in July when Moroccans accused him of being in a polygamous marriage. In response, Yatim condemned the act of polygamy, saying that he would never engage in it, no matter the circumstances.

Rabat- The recent floods that swept Rhamna and Al Haouz, Sidi Ifni, Meknes, and Guelmim regions have caused five deaths, and others have gone missing. On Friday, September 28, the provinces of Rhamna and Al Haouz in the Marrakech-Safi region experienced heavy rainfall and thunderstorms, killing one man from Al Haouz, two women from Sidi Ifni, and a man and a child from Rhamna. The first victim, from Rhamna, was in a car that became submerged by the floods. Civil security forces have reported that a second occupant of the vehicle is still missing, according to Monday’s edition of Al Massae newspaper.  An eight-year-old boy, also from Rhamna, drowned on his way home from school in Bouchane town in Rhamna region.   The floods that hit Sidi Ifni, in the Guelmim-Oued Noun region on Sunday, killed two women. Al Massae reported that two other women from Sidi Ifni are still missing.  Meknes and other nearby regions that witnessed floods did not record any human losses. The floods have also caused extensive property damage and agricultural casualties to the affected regions, from flooding houses to drowning livestock and blocking roads. Following the floods, which raged Friday to Sunday, the Directorate of Meteorology warned citizens not to approach riverbanks in the coming days, as more heavy rainfall is forecast in the regions. Videos and photos of the floods have been circulating social media, showing the raging muddy waters of overflowing local rivers sweeping the regions and filling bystanders with panic. According to a person at the scene, people in the Saharan city of Guelmim were in a state of panic, fearing they would have to relive the floods of 2014, which cut the city off from the rest of the country and claimed the lives of dozens of people. In August, a violent storm hit Ourika Valley, 90 kilometers from Marrakech, causing floods and damage to many merchants and restaurateurs. Ourika Valley often experiences floods in the summer. In 1995, flash floods in the valley caused the deaths of at least 100 Moroccans and foreigners.

Rabat – Morocco’s foreign affairs minister Nasser Bourita participated in the annual coordination meeting of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Friday. At the meeting, the minister discussed King Mohammed VI’s “great efforts” to defend Jerusalem and the cause of the Palestinian people. Nasser Bourita told OIC foreign ministers, on the margins of the 73rd UN General Assembly, that Morocco will spare no efforts to “continue its action with its brothers and sisters in the Islamic world to defend the just cause of the Palestinian people and achieve lasting peace for the peoples of the region.” According to Bourita, the efforts of King Mohammed VI to defend Jerusalem are “part of Morocco’s commitment to the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.” He said that the efforts are both “in terms of diplomatic action with the leaders of the major powers and the international community and at the economic level through the activities of the Beit Mal Al Quds Agency and its development programs aimed at supporting the Holy City.” The North African country was among the first countries that condemned the US move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and the relocation of the US embassy to the city. In June, King Mohammed VI addressed a message to the participants of the 5th International Conference on Al-Quds. In his message, read by Bourita, the King said Morocco had “immediately rejected [the US move] and considered it to be incompatible with international law and with the relevant Security Council resolutions.” He also recalled the letters he sent to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and US President Donald Trump on the dangers of the embassy move. “In my letters, I emphasized that any modification of the legal, political or historical status of Jerusalem would have serious repercussions on peace in the region,” said the monarch. On Friday, September 28, Bourita reiterated that Morocco remains convinced of the need to “explore the international consensus rejecting the latest critical developments in the Palestinian question through new wise and realistic actions in collaboration with all international partners and influential forces.” He also called on the OIC member states to take their responsibility “seriously to face the new challenges and defend Palestinian law as well as the legal statutes of the Holy City of Jerusalem.”

Rabat – El Othmani has generated rounds of criticism for saying former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin told him that the “situation in Morocco is better than in France.” Head of Government El Othmani, who is also secretary-general of the Justice and Development Party (PJD), made the controversial remarks during the National Committee of the Party on Saturday. When talking about the social issues in Morocco, the head of government said that Villepin had visited him and told him, “The situation in Morocco is better than the situation in France.” The PJD head’s speech was broadcast on the party’s official Facebook page and received harsh criticism throughout the 35-minute live video. The comment comes amid public outrage over the death of Hayat, a migrant who was shot by the Moroccan Royal Navy in September. However, El Othmani said that Moroccans should express their anger towards immigration networks instead, saying they pose a threat to the stability of the country.  The head of government believes that the networks have a motive behind their offers to take migrants for free to Spain, the El Dorado. The official recognizes that “a number of things are not going well, but a number of reforming workshops are in the process of completion, some of which are beginning to show results.” Commenting on the recent tragic incident when the navy shot at a boat with Moroccan migrants in the Mediterranean, El Othmani said that he regretted the incident. Read Also: Moroccan Killed in Navy Shooting is 20-Year-Old Woman While some consider undocumented migration a threat to people’s lives, El Othmani said that “the phenomenon of immigration is universal and should not be exaggerated.” “Moroccan authorities have managed to thwart the migration of more than 20,000 people in the past few months,” he said.  Morocco is also experiencing difficulties in the education and health sectors. In a 2016-2017 annual report, Morocco’s Court of Auditors detected numerous problems related to medical services. Read Also: Moroccan Navy Opens Fire on Migrant Boat According to the report, Decree 2.06.656 on hospital organization “defined for each hospital level specialties and medical services to make available to the public.” However, some hospitals do not offer all the mandatory services to patients. In another report, the court identified serious deficiencies in Morocco’s education system.  The report found that Moroccan schools do not enjoy basic standards, including drinking water and electricity. The court also noted that some schools have multiple grade levels in one class. “The government’s priorities are clear: first education, second health, third employment and social protection,” he said. El Othmani also said that unemployment could be the result of the many university specializations that are not suited to the job market. Concluding his statement, El Othmani quoted UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. He said that even the UN chief acknowledged in his UN General Assembly speech that every country has its political issues. “He started his speech saying that the world is troubled; there is no longer confidence in political institutions; there is no longer confidence in states … this is how he started. It is an issue of confidence,” El Othmani said. Every country experiences the issues, El Othmani said, because it is a “global infection.” Despite the challenges, El Othmani called on entrepreneurs, political actors, media professionals, and civil society to stick to “objectivity.” He added that the actors should “cling to hope, when featuring the economic and social conditions in Morocco.”

Rabat –  In one of his first public speeches since taking office in August, Morocco’s new finance minister has emphasized the need to invest more in small businesses.  Speaking on Saturday at the first Casablanca Summer University organized by Morocco’s business leaders conglomerate (CGEM) under the title “A Strong Enterprise, A Winning Morocco,” Mohamed Benchaaboun said that attaining Morocco’s medium and long-term goals requires a more robust funding of small businesses, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and start-ups. According to Benchaaboun, helping to build a strong and vibrant environment for small businesses is one of the surest ways to propel Morocco on the growth and sustainable development path. He also said he would champion a “small business act” to decrease, alleviate, and ultimately end the numerous administrative hurdles entrepreneurs face when searching for financial support. In a bid to decentralize financing-linked activities, Benchaaboun reminded attendees at the Casablanca Summer University that it is important that the government some financing duties to the private sector, namely Moroccan investors and “external partners” with the means to inject more money to boost the country’s halting enterprise sector. Adding, however, that simple delegation of responsibilities will not be enough to put Morocco on track towards sustainable growth, the minister recommended building rapport with investors by providing incentives and removing current bureaucratic obstacles. “We need to increase the pace of [Morocco’s economic] growth. That is our priority at the moment,” the minister declared.  He added, in a prelude to his department’s annual report to be presented in early 2019, that his tenure in the finance and economy ministry will focus on boosting Morocco’s investor confidence. Benchaaboun hopes to further improve Morocco’s investment-friendly atmosphere by building a dynamic enterprise sector.  “Ninety percent of small businesses are underfunded,” the minister said. He added that his ministry is trying to work out a “mechanism” to optimize funds allocated to small businesses.  Another concern is the continued plight of start-ups. Morocco’s micro-financing support policy gives no more than MAD 50,000 to startups. The policy puts Moroccan startups in a “no man’s land where neither the state nor private investors can fund them.”  Benchaaboun concluded that the funding threshold should be raised so that nascent small businesses, which often require more than MAD 50,000, can receive funding from micro-finance agencies.

Rabat – The iconic American actor Robert De Niro will be honored at the 2018 Marrakech International Film Festival (FIFM) November 30 to December 8.  “Even though I have been to Marrakech many times, I feel that I am about to see another face of the city. A face that I have always wanted to discover. I am very grateful for this invitation and look forward to taking part in this great festival,” De Niro said in an official statement. A key figure in cinematic history, Robert De Niro has an extensive filmography. Born in New York in 1943, De Niro’s career began on Broadway, before he discovered cinema at age 20. He quickly became the favorite actor of Martin Scorsese who, from “Taxi Driver” in 1976 to “Casino” in 1995, frequently entrusted De Niro with neurotic roles. De Niro is perhaps most famous for his role in “The Godfather,” where his impression of a killer earned him an Oscar.  Throughout his impressive career, De Niro has won two Oscars, for “Raging Bull” and “The Godfather 2,” and a Golden Globe crowning his entire career. The FIFM jury will be chaired by American director James Gray who worked with the biggest stars of Hollywood such as Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Charlize Theron.  Since its inauguration in 2002, FIFM has welcomed notable cinematic personalities, including Francis Ford Coppola, Charlotte Rampling, Martin Scorsese, and Marion Cotillard. Last year, the Marrakech festival was cancelled “in order to allow the festival to advance in its mission not only to promote Moroccan cinema, but also to open up to other cultures,” the organizers said in a statement.

Rabat- “I have the firm belief that if you want to achieve something it will happen.” These are the words of Ihsane Elidrissi Elhassani, a Moroccan-born woman who has certainly achieved something. She has been shortlisted for the highest legal award in England and Wales. Of more than 90,000 female lawyers in England and Wales, Law Society’s Excellence Awards has nominated Elhassani for the “Woman Lawyer of the Year Category” award, along with 10 others. Law Society President Christina Blacklaws said: “There are more than 9,000 firms and 140,000 solicitors in England and Wales, so to be shortlisted for an Excellence Award is to be recognised as being among the best of the best.” The winners will be announced at the Law Society’s Excellence Awards ceremony in London on October 17. Elhassani told Morocco World News that she was “fortunate enough” to experience several cultures. “I was  born in Morocco, grew up  in Marrakech, studied, worked and lived in several parts of the world. My horizons were open from an early age, to be able to analyse a legal issue from different facets and not be one dimensional is a quality that served me a lot in my career,” she said. Born to a family of lawyers, Elhassani graduated with a bachelor’s degree in law from Cadi Ayyad University in the ocher city in 1996. “I grew up in a relatively legal household, several members of my family are lawyers. The choice of legal studies came naturally to me,” she explained. Elhassani fell in love with law at an early age, realizing that becoming a lawyer was the right path for her.  “When I started my first lectures, I realised that the law profession suited me to the T. Law is at the centre of everyday life and discovering life through the law binoculars is utterly fascinating.” Elhassani’s passion for law has driven her to various countries, where she has developed herself as a lawyer to become the successful person she is today. To expand her horizons, Elhassani moved to Belgium in 1996 to pursue a master’s degree in law which she obtained with merit. There, she worked in numerous legal positions before her ambition took her to another land. Elhassani moved to the UK to study English common law and graduated as a lawyer in 2007. After graduating, Elhassani worked in Morocco, Qatar, and the European Court of Human Rights in France for a few years. But eventually, she traveled back to England with more experience. In 2016, Elhassani became the first female Moroccan lawyer to open her own legal office in England. Commenting on her nomination, Elhassni told the Law Society that “being shortlisted in the Woman Lawyer of the Year Category is the ultimate recognition for any female law practitioner in England and Wales.”  The nomination is all the more thrilling for “a Moroccan born lawyer who graduated in law from a Moroccan university, acquired a Master’s degree in Belgium and qualified as a Solicitor in England and Wales,” said Elhassani. “The nomination highlights one of my many qualities that attracted me to practice law in the UK, a country that I call home now.” She told MWN: “I think that my biggest quality is that I don’t take no for an answer.”  Her ambition makes her a role model for all young girls wishing to pursue a career in law, in or outside of Morocco. Elhassani told MWN, “I have the firm belief that if you want to achieve something it will happen.” Elhassani believes, “The constant fact in every profession is that the road to success is always bumpy,” and, “It is up to us to develop the necessary skills and the thick skin to be able to carry on until we reach our goals.”  Elhassani took the opportunity to comment on the historic Law 103-13 on the elimination of violence against women which went into effect on September 12. The law gives women the ability to file complaints of sexual harassment and gives severe punishment to harassers. As a lawyer, and a woman who herself has experienced sexual harassment, Elhassani could not be more content with the new law. “From my point of view it is definitely a step in the right direction. The phenomenon of harassment and violence against women is not new, it does not spare anybody, I have been myself victim of it. So the new law is all music to my ears,” she concluded. Elhassani also took some time to consider her past. “What advice will I give to my younger self?” Elidrissi asked. “Do not panic, because you are on the right track.” “As a young teen,” she reflected, “I was overly critical of myself, the slightest perceived failure sent me to meltdown.”  She added, “I want to tell that person to relax, she is not in competition with the whole world and she will be just fine.” No matter the results of the award nomination, Ihsane Elhassani has already won the admiration and respect of many Moroccans who have heard her story. Elhassani is confident, saying “If you put in the effort, talent and hard work, you will be recognised, regardless of your nationality, skin colour or religion.”

Rabat – The secretaries general of PPS and PJD met again on Friday to discuss Morocco’s political situation. After repeated threats to withdraw from the government coalition, Progress and Socialism Party (PPS) Secretary-General Nabil Benabdellah visited Justice and Development Party (PJD) Secretary-General El Othmani at his home on Friday, according to a statement from PPS. The meeting followed a similar gathering of the heads of the parties on September 13. In the previous meeting, Benabdellah and Head of Government El Othmani discussed relations between the parties following a row caused by the dissolution of the Secretariat of State in Charge of Water, run by PPS member Charafat Afilal in August.  PPS condemned the move, which came at the proposal of El Othmani, and pledged to withdraw from the government’s ruling coalition. On September 13, however, the heads of PPS and PJD talked about their parties’ relations, describing the gathering as “friendly.” PJD touted its partnership with PPS, emphasizing that it is “clinging” to its alliance with PPS. The tension over the water secretariat is not PJD’s only political row with a coalition party. Recently, a volcano of criticism erupted between PJD and the National Rally of Independents (RNI). The tension started when member of RNI and Minister of Youth and Sports Talbi Alami accused the PJD of “imitating” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and of wishing to “destroy the country.” Several PJD members, including Deputy Secretary-General Slimane El Omrani, responded to the accusations. El Omrani described Alami’s remarks as “irresponsible” and “dangerous.” PJD member Abdelaziz Aftati called on RNI to withdraw from the government coalition and urged Alami to resign from the government. On Thursday, PPS’s Benabdellah called on the coalition parties to refrain from accusing each other and focus on youth’s demands instead.
