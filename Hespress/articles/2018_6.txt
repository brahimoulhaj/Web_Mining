Rabat- Amidst speculations about his future with the Atlas Lions, coach Hervé Renard has finally broken his silence, saying that he would like to coach the Moroccan side for the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN). Renard, who is known for his straight-talking, has been candid about things that need to be done to convince him to stay with the Atlas Lions, according to Al Ahdath Al Maghribia. The Frenchman has reportedly expressed gratitude for the renewed confidence of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), as well as the love and support of the Moroccan public. He also said he wanted to continue with the Moroccan squad for the upcoming African Cup of Nations, saying that he would not like to leave in the middle of the journey. But the Frenchman has allegedly made three requests of the FRMF that will play a major role in whether he chooses to keep his position. Renard’s first condition is that Nasser Larguet, the squad’s technical director, be allowed to stay at his post. Larguet’s contract ends today, June 30, and it is understood that the FRMF had a list of possible replacements. But Renard is believed to value Larguet’s role as an invaluable asset and a great part of the team’s recent performances. Renard is also pushing for more autonomy in decision-making. The Frenchman has asked the FRMF to allow him more room regarding the choice of players and staff members that he wants to works with. According to Al Ahdath Al Maghribia, Renard wants to get rid of assistant coach Moustapha Hadji, who is said to have issues with many of Renard’s key players.  After the Portugal vs. Morocco match, for example, team captain Mehdi Benatia took aim at Moustapha Hadji. Benatia complained about Hadji’s attitude towards the squad after their defeat against Portugal.  Prior to the 2018 World Cup, Renard had signed a contract extension until 2022. He has now asked FRMF to put the extension clauses on standby, suggesting that his decision may depend on how his men fare at the 2019 CAN in Cameron. Discussions between Renard and the FRMF are still ongoing, and the final decision is expected by early July.

Rabat – Moroccan football player Amine Harit might be in serious trouble. Several local media outlets have reported that the Atlas Lion hit a pedestrian in Marrakech, Friday night, June 29, after racing a car with his teammate Faycal Fajr.   According to these sources, including local Kech 24 and international German media Sky Sports (which specifies not knowing the circumstances of the tragedy or the exact identity of the person who was driving the offending vehicle), Harit’s Mercedes struck a pedestrian, injuring him fatally, in a “hit and run” accident. Local news site Kech 24, which published pictures of the car crash, originally reported that it was Amine Harit’s 14-year-old brother who was driving Harit’s car. The driver was chased by locals, who called the authorities. In an updated version, Kech 24 said that it was Amine Harit who was driving and hit a young pedestrian who was trying to cross the street a few meters from the jurisdiction of Marrakech-Safi. The public prosecution ordered that the Moroccan player’s passport be kept and presented if he wanted to be released before the completion of the investigation. He denied that there was any car race at the time of the incident. The incident resulted in the death of the 28-year-old pedestrian after he arrived at the hospital by ambulance.

Rabat – The Moroccan player Younes Belhanda has strongly criticized the video assistant referee (VAR), claiming that it is only used for the big nations. “Everybody knows it, everybody saw it. When it was about making a decision for Portugal or Spain to reject a goal, we did go back to the video. While when we [Moroccan team] asked to watch the action, the referee told us that he was in communication. But actually, he wasn’t communicating with anyone. Nobody told him [the referee] to check,” stated Belhanda. Belhanda disapproved of using VAR at all: “I am against the video since the beginning. Because it takes out football charm. But when we try to foul you during the gatherings about the VAR… It only serves the big teams.” Belhanda also spoke about the Moroccan national team’s ambitions and plans. “We should prepare a team for the next World Cup. I think that this new generation has promising young talents who have participated in the current World Cup. In four years it will be them.” The Galatasaray midfielder finished his talk by showing hope for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in the short term and the 2022 World Cup in the long term.

The crowd went crazy when the 28-year-old artist opened his concert with his famous hit “Starboy,” setting the tone for the second to last show of the 2018 Mawazine Festival Rhythms of the World.  The Weeknd received a standing ovation as he continued singing his greatest hits including “Party Monster,” “Secrets,” “Six Feet Under,” “Can’t Feel My Face,””I Feel It Coming,” “Earned It,” “Often,” and “Call out My Name.” The artist also interacted with the crowd, saying that he is performing for the first time in Africa and that he was really happy to be in Morocco. He even tried out a few French phrases on the Moroccan public.

Rabat- The Moroccan national anthem has been ranked 5th best among the anthems of the 32 nations that participated in the 2018 World Cup. The ranking was done by British outlet the Telegraph, which, explaining that national symbols are part and parcel of the World Cup, said that it made the assessment in terms of the “biggest tune,” “most powerful effect on players,” and “silliest trumps.” The British outlet described Morocco’s national anthem as having an “excellent opening bit” that is “very cinematic” and “sounds like the beginning of an epic battle.” After the “excellent opening bit” come lots of “cutlery, evocative chromatics, and a powerful sense of being somewhere quite hot.” It all finally “seemed to juice the Morocco team up nicely.” National colors and national anthems constitute an essential part of the World Cup, as each country sends players with the mindset of soldiers or national representatives dreaming of conquest and triumph. More than a show of technical skills and athletic energy, the tournament is essentially about each player’s determination to show the world a positive representation of their countries. The anthems of the other African countries did not fare as well in the Telegraph’s rankings. Senegal and Egypt came in 19th and 20th respectively, whereas Nigeria came in 22nd, followed by Tunisia in 23rd. Only the anthems of France (1st), Colombia (2nd), Mexico (3rd), and Brazil (4th) beat the Moroccan national fervor during the group phase of this year’s World Cup.

Rabat – Nordin Amrabat’s performance did not go unnoticed during the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Despite being out of the competition after Morocco’s losses against Iran and Portugal both (0-1), the Moroccan football player has again caught the attention of international press, which chose him as one of the 11 ideal players of the World Cup’s group stage. The 31-year old midfielder was chosen by the American outlet Bleacher Report  alongside other big names in football, such as Korean goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-Woo, Senegal’s defender Youssouf Sabaly, Sweden’s defender Andreas Granqvist, Uruguay’s defender Diego Godin, Brazil’s defender Màrio Figueira Fernandes, Croatia’s midfielder Luka Modric, France’s midfielder N’Golo Kanté, Brazil’s midfielder Philippe Coutinho, Spain’s midfielder Isco and England’s forward Harry Kane.  During the competition, the Atlas Lion has made quite the impression. He was called a “warrior” by Coach Hervé Renard and a “hero” by Moroccan fans.  Amrabat, who suffered a head injury during the Iran-Morocco game, showed the full extent of his talent with his fabulous attacking skills, showing great determination to make history. After the first game, Amrabat’s doctor gave him a week to rest but he did not want to leave his teammates and showed up to the Morocco-Portugal match wearing a helmet. During the third game against Spain, the football sensation has once again proved his worth by taking on Spain’s best players, including Real Madrid’s star Sergio Ramos. The CD Laganés football player earned the respect of the whole nation when he denounced the “unfair” use of VAR, speaking for many Moroccans. “VAR is bull****” he said in front of millions of viewers. As for the captain of the national team, Mehdi Benatia, he was chosen as a defender in French outlet l’Equipe’s dream team among the eliminated groups.  “The Moroccan defender was not particularly shown in the two games he played in the World Cup… However, Benatia can’t do anything about the goals scored against the Atlas Lions and remains an international class player,” wrote the outlet.

Rabat – Abdelkebir Tabih, a prosecuting lawyer of the bar of Casablanca, has said that the trial of the activists, arrested following their participation in protests in Al Hoceima was fair. Tabih, a prosecuting lawyer for the Moroccan state in the trial, said that the conditions for a fair trial were realized through 84 hearings, defendants’ opportunity to express themselves freely before the court, the summoning of witnesses for the defendants, and the presence of representatives of Moroccan and international human rights organizations and the media. The lawyer made the claims in a statement to the state-owned press Maghreb Arab News (MAP) after delivering the verdict. He said that one feature of a fair trial in Morocco is that a criminal judgment can be appealed to the highest court. Therefore, he said, “the trial phases have not been closed yet, and there is still hope for the defendants and their families.” He further emphasized that the principal of the judiciary’s independence was maintained in the trial. He also indicated that the president of the court and the representative of public prosecution had exercised their authority independently. For the first time in the history of contemporary Morocco, the president of the court exercised his duties under the supervision of the president of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary, while the attorney general acted under the supervision of the president of the public prosecution. On the other hand, Abdelkebir Tabih, stressed that “the Moroccan state did not stand up against the defendants but it came to defend the interests of security forces and victims of the riots that occurred in Al Hoceima and its surroundings.” The Moroccan state “called for any sanction against anyone, and did not oppose any request for provisional release, nor did it demand any material compensation, even though the losses exceeded 2 billion centimes, and it did not stand as a civil party against the journalist who is sued in this case.” “The Moroccan state is not a party to this prosecution, and the defendants are in conflict with the law,” he said. “The trial has no political character because the demonstrators’ demands are purely social and economic.” He further stressed that Moroccans have the right to be proud of their state and to defend it, especially since state institutions are strongly determined to respond positively to the demands and expectations of citizens through development projects to relieve social tensions under the program “Al Hoceima, Manarat Al Moutawassit” (Al Hoceima, the Lighthouse of the Mediterranean). Tabih considered that this ambitious development program embodies the “principle of reparation” which was brought by the Equity and Reconciliation Commission (IER). the Lighthouse of the Mediterranean.” Tabih further stated that this ambitious development program embodies the “principle of reparation,” which was brought by the Equity and Reconciliation Commission (IER).

Rabat – Following Centrale Danone’s announcement, Morocco’s boycotted mineral water company Les Eaux Minerales d’Oulmes has finally opened up about the circumstances of the major campaign against high commodity prices. After more than nine weeks of silence, the Moroccan brand confessed that the campaign has caused a “drop in its revenues for the first half of 2018.”  The company’s statement has discussed the details of the net loss, but has confessed that Sidi Ali revenues dropped, according to Reuters. The boycott began on April 20 when online activists launched campaigns on social media against three renowned brands: Afriquia gas, Centrale Danone and Sidi Ali. Besides the high prices of the companies’ products, citizens supporting the boycott have also accused the brands of monopolizing the Moroccan market. The first company to complain about the effects of the boycott on its revenue was Centrale Danone, which published several statements in an attempt to convince its consumers to end the boycott. The dairy company made multiple efforts to reconcile with Moroccan citizens to no avail. Recently, CEO Emmanuel Faber of Centrale Danone visited Morocco to personally discuss the major consequences of the boycott on his company. Faber announced his arrival in Morocco in a video on June 25, emphasizing that his visit aims to closely monitor the situation on the ground. “Even if I was following the situation closely, I decided to come personally to listen and meet with consumers, youth, shoppers, representatives of the employees, our team and farmers,” he said. Consoling worried Moroccan officials, who are concerned about losing foreign investments, Faber said in a press conference held on June 26 in Casablanca, that the French firm will never leave Morocco regardless of the consequences of the boycott. On June 4, Centrale Danone announced a net loss of MAD 150 million in revenue in the first half of this year. Faber acknowledged in the meeting that it will take the company several months to regain consumers’ trust. Afriquia gas, owned by Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch, has still not announced publicly the results of the boycott. The owner’s point of view regarding the campaign, however, is clear as Akhannouch has already denounced the boycott and publicly expressed support for Centrale Danone in April.

Rabat –  The Moroccan Delegate Ministry for Moroccans Residing Abroad has announced the organization of a two-day workshop that will convene Moroccan experts, entrepreneurs, and professionals living in France. The two-day workshop, which will be held in Skhirat near Rabat July 4-5, will discuss ways of “integrating Morocco in the ongoing worldwide digitization of markets.” “In a context of globalization, the notion of ‘brain drain’ is losing traction; instead, migration is now perceived by many as a source of wealth for both sending and receiving nations… As a result, Moroccan authorities are taking the initiative to mobilize the skills and expertise of Moroccans residing outside of Morocco,” read a press release shared with Morocco World News. Under the theme “Innovations and New Technologies: Opportunities for Morocco,” the workshop will discuss a wide range of topics mainly related to sustainable development and economic digitization.  The topics will include investment and entrepreneurship, education and digital training, environment and renewable energies, and scientific research and new technologies. According to the ministry, the workshop is part of a new policy guideline that Moroccan authorities have set for the country’s path to development in the next three to five years: channeling the expertise, international experiences, and technical know-how of Moroccan skilled workers residing abroad. The overarching goal is not only to equip Morocco with highly-trained and well-equipped human resources for the relentless transformations of the global digital economy, but also to make the country a more attractive destination for foreign investment and cooperation. Another important goal of the initiative is to reduce the high costs of emigration, the organizers said. The event is “a platform to facilitate exchange between Moroccan entrepreneurs” and “encourage Moroccan investors residing abroad to play a greater part in the country’s digital development agenda.” The initiative also promises the creation of professional networks to gather highly-skilled Moroccans (lawyers, physicians, researchers, etc.) practicing their professions in different parts of the world. The two-day workshop in July is set to be the first of twelve events expected to establish a larger platform to reflect on migration as an opportunity, rather than a danger, tor both sending and receiving countries.

By Chase Lacy Rabat – Friday five charges of first-degree murder were filed against Capital Gazette shooter Jarrod Warren Ramos. The gunman’s bail hearing was set at 10:30 a.m. in Annapolis, Maryland.  On Thursday, June 28, the gunman stormed into the office of the Annapolis-based newspaper and opened fire on the staff. The gunman shot through the glass door and, according to Anne Arundel County Police Chief William Krampf, “He entered the building with a shotgun and he located his victims as he walked through the lower level.” Staff in the small office began scrambling and hiding under their desks, hoping that the gunman would not cross their path. Staff members noted when they could hear his footsteps wandering around, the blasts of his shotgun, and when he reloaded.  Staff reported that the police reaction was swift, responding to an emergency call in less than two minutes. Police entered the building and, without an exchange of gunfire, apprehended the gunman hiding underneath a desk with his gun lying beside him.  Approximately 170 people evacuated the multi-office building with their hands in the air.  Victims of the attack were editorial page editor Gerald Fischman, assistant editor Rob Hiaasen, reporter John McNamara, sales assistant Rebecca Smith, and features writer Wendi Winters. Two other staff members sustained non-life threatening injuries and were released from the hospital.  The shooter had a tumultuous history with the Capital Gazette, filing a defamation lawsuit against the paper in 2012 because of an article written by Eric Hartley. The shooter claimed he was harmed by the article, which described his guilty conviction for criminal harassment of a woman online. The case was dismissed in 2013, and the ruling was upheld in 2015. Police reported that the suspect was not cooperative and that identifying him was difficult. They reported that he had no identification on his person and his fingerprints had been “altered.” The police reportedly used facial recognition software to identify the 39-year-old from Laurel, Maryland.  The last case of journalists shot and killed came in August 2015, when Vester Lee Flanagan II killed television reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward during a live broadcast in Roanoke, Virginia. The case is one among a multitude of shootings every year in the United States, and adds fuel to the ongoing bitterly divisive political debate amongst Americans regarding gun control.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has refused any action from the European Union to outsource migrant reception centers to Morocco, emphasizing that this suggestion is an “easy solution.” Criticizing the suggestion, the Moroccan official said that his country “rejects and has always rejected these kinds of methods for managing the issue of migration flows.” Bourita made his remarks after meeting Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Josep Borrell. According to Bourita, such measures cannot solve the issue of migrants, describing the moves as “easy solutions” and “counterproductive.” The number of migrants using the sea route from Morocco to Spain more than tripled between 2016 and 1017. In his statement to the press, Bourita said that the issue of reception centers of migration will be discussed at the European summit on migration, which opened on June 28 in Brussels, Belgium. Bourita also saluted the Morocco-Spanish cooperation model in managing migratory flows, describing it as an “exemplary.” While some sub-Saharan migrants chose to travel through Morocco to reach Europe, some have also chosen the North African country as a destination instead. In May, Morocco’s National Committee in Charge of Monitoring Immigrant Regularization announced that the country is taking measures to regularize over 24,000 undocumented migrants. In his most recent speech on the issue, King Mohammed VI called on the international community and African nations to increase efforts to address the issue of migration in Africa. AFP reported that 12,155 people have arrived in Spain in 2018, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The report revealed that 292 people died while attempting to reach Spain.  AFP estimated that 1,000 were killed in the Mediterranean in an attempt to reach Europe in 2018.

Rabat – Unlike France, Spain has refused to voice its opinion on the sentences of Casablanca’s court for Hirak Rif activists. Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell, on an official visit to Morocco, refused to comment on the sentences on Thursday. “This is an internal issue handled by Moroccan justice, pending the appeal since the process is not over yet,” he said. The defendants, who were involved in protests to condemn social disparities and the death of local fishmonger Mouhcine Fikri, received sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years in prison. In his statement to the press, Borell praised the diplomatic ties between the two countries, emphasizing that Morocco and Spain “are not friendly and neighboring countries, but also strategic partners that share the same ambition to reinforce this relation, based on respect, dialogue and mutual trust.” Borell also expressed satisfaction over the trade cooperation between the countries, which has doubled in the last six years, admitting that Spain is Morocco’s top trading partner. “But our relation is not only commercial, it goes far beyond that, it plays a geostrategic role in many issues and I hope it will continue,” he said. The former president of the European Parliament also expressed his country’s determination to further develop the bilateral ties with Morocco in different fields.

Rabat – In Thursday’s Government Council, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani called on his ministers to act on the ground and not just give orders from their offices. El Othmani encouraged his ministers to be in permanent contact with citizens. Moreover, he advised his ministers to “leave offices and go down to the field.” “This is a principle we have agreed upon. The government official cannot just work from his office, review files and give instructions,” he said. He also advocated for a “productive and direct interaction to meet the legitimate expectations of citizens.” El Othmani thinks that the government must communicate its achievements and inform the public constantly.  He stressed he would tolerate no laxity in implementing the decisions made by the government. El Othmani also regretted that some decisions and procedures are not implemented by some administrations or are delayed in their application. “I call for taking all the necessary measures for the application of the decree n ° 2-17-410.” The decree specifies how administrations can certify duplicates of original documents. El Othamni also congratulated the administrations that reacted quickly to the provisions of the concerned decree. The head of government reminded ministers that the government takes seriously the guidelines of King Mohammed VI relating to accountability. He stressed the need to provide financial resources to implement government measures. The rebuke is not the first of its kind. On October 26, 2017 just two days after the dismissal of three ministers and a secretary of state, El Othmani urged his ministers to learn a lesson from the royal sanctions.

By Chase Lacy Rabat – Wednesday, South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar signed a peace agreement to end the young country’s brutal 4.5-year civil war.  The deal, made in Sudan’s capital Khartoum, was signed in the presence of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.  After the ceremony, Machar said to reporters that the ceasefire would end the war and open a new page for South Sudan.  Provisions of the agreement The agreements’ provisions include the ending of hostilities, opening routes of humanitarian aid, the release of political detainees and other prisoners, and, within four months, the formation of a unity government to govern for a period of 36 months until free and fair elections are held.  An additional part of the deal also allowed members of the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development to deploy forces to enforce the ceasefire. This provision has been very unpopular amongst the opposition factions in South Sudan; many believe this allows Sudan and other states to meddle in South Sudanese affairs.  The latest peace agreement engendered cautious optimism; the last agreement in August 2015 fell apart completely when intense fighting erupted in the capital Juba in July 2016. Just last week, the first round of talks mediated by the reformist Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, failed to resolve disagreements.  In addition there are many factions that were not included in the agreement, and dealing with their contention will be a major challenge to implement the deal.  A bloody past The conflict in South Sudan began in December 2013, when President Kiir accused Machar of plotting a coup d’etat against him. The political crisis fomented a serious conflict with an ethnic element. Forces largely rallied along tribal lines between Kiir’s predominant Dinka tribe and Machar’s Nuer.  The war has ravaged South Sudan’s agriculture, destroyed its economy, and displaced approximately 3 million people. According to the international humanitarian group CARE, 7 million people of the country’s 12 million are in need of food aid.  Not only has the country been put on the brink of famine, but it has created the largest refugee crisis in Africa since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Though it is very difficult to accurately gauge due to conditions on the ground, the civil war has killed an estimated 50,000 to 300,000.  Reports of human rights abuses in South Sudan have been horrific, ranging from eye-gougings, hackings, mutilations, castrations, beheadings, and the pervasive use of gang rape as a weapon. People living in the many UN refugee camps are terrified to leave for fear of roaming armed groups and gangs.

Rabat – As though the World Cup championship in Russia has not already been politicized enough, primarily by the ongoing dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia over broadcasting services, it appears that political bias may be trickling down from the behind-the-scenes wrangling over geopolitical issues to judges happy to discriminate against non-European country, perhaps for the right price. The latest outrage was sparked by the American referee twice denying Morocco the visual assistance referee (VAR) intervention during the game with Spain, which, by all accounts, was played admirably by Morocco and ended in a 2-2 tie. The referee refused to let Morocco review the recordings of the alleged mistakes, thus effectively disenfranchising the team after visible errors. VAR technology was likewise denied to Morocco during the game with Portugal. Various sports experts and journalists likewise expressed their outrage at what appeared to be the bias of the judge in favor of well-known European countries. FIFA’s history of corruption predates the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The most famous of these issues in recent times is the 2015 FIFA corruption case in which US federal prosecutors charged a number of officials with fraud, racketeering, and other crimes related to taking millions of euros in bribes. A number of these officials continued taking money during the course of the investigation. Although the United States is not big on football (soccer), the case reverberated widely throughout the country, as a number of officials and others implicated in the case were dual residents or nationals, or had other connections to the US. Although the case blew open the extent of corruption, it was neither the first nor the last episode in the sordid tale of the way a sport that is supposed to be for the masses becomes a playing field for the rich and powerful. One could argue that the Russia-Qatar mutual support society in winning the 2018 and 2022 bids despite initially poor to non-existent infrastructure, allegations of vast bribery, and human rights violations, are the prime example of how everything in FIFA can be bought. Indeed, one needs to look no further than the political crisis between Qatar and the Saudis, which is manifesting itself not only via the broadcasting controversy. Qatar’s beIN Sports managed to procure an exclusive right to broadcast coverage of the event; the Saudis accused the service of running unrelated political commentary during the opening match between Russia and Saudi Arabia, which the latter lost 5-0. Qatar, on the other hand, is accusing the Saudis of spearheading a pirate service, which the head of the Saudi Sports Authority, Turki Al Sheikh denies. Al Sheikh claims that the pirated service is grassroots and that the country is actively fighting it. Saudi Arabia is also expanding its investment into football as part of its Vision 2030 economic development strategy. The economic plan calls for the diversification of investments from oil to entertainment, culture, and sports. The plan has caused Saudi Arabia to engage in a number of complicated political maneuvers, ranging from competition with Bahraini investors, to a short-lived honorary appointment of Al Sheikh as an Egyptian football club head. FIFA’s role in the story is unclear, but suspicious. Why did FIFA ever let Qatar’s broadcasting service secure a monopoly on displaying the game? Why did FIFA condemn the alleged Saudi piracy, yet take no action to investigate and punish the supposed culprits? The dubious star of this saga is none other than the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, who may have downplayed the concerns over piracy during the opening football match, and who is known to be a frequent visitor to Saudi Arabia, where he had met King Salman. There is speculation that FIFA may be sympathetic to KSA’s plans to underwrite a USD 25 billion consortium-led plan to significantly expand Club World Cup and an international Nations League. Infantino’s name may ring a bell: he was implicated in the Panama Papers corruption scandal from 2016.  He was cleared very quickly, which in itself drew criticism of the process by which conveniently powerful FIFA-affiliated officials once again avoided accountability for the organization’s failings. Soon, however, Infantino made headlines as the subject of an investigation by FIFA’s ethics committee. The investigation was sparked by a complaint regarding his replacement of the chairmen and members of the FIFA board and his allegedly seeking to influence a Confederation of African Football (CAF) election. He was also accused of destroying attempted reforms at the organization when the head of FIFA’s auditing and compliance resigned. Further, he is accused of having played an unseemly role in the controversial vote over the 2026 World Cup hosting rights, during the course of which Saudi Arabia engaged in heavy direct lobbying of FIFA and various countries to vote for the United 2026 bid, and against Morocco. The bidding process was beset with accusations of political interference, including US President Trump’s tweet, which was seen as a veiled threat against countries which did not support the US bid, and Saudi Arabia’s hosting parties for high level officials from various countries, strong-arming Morocco through rhetoric from Al Sheikh. It seems that Infantino has set an uninspiring tone for an organization with a history not only of financial misdeeds but bias against African countries and the Third World, and favoritism toward famous teams and players backed by money and power. FIFA’s rules are disadvantageous to Africa, the world’s second most populated continent with 54 countries—only five of which may qualify for the World Cup, due to the ranking enforcement. The qualification process has long been criticized for taking the “world” out of World Cup. African countries are not the only ones with an ax to grind against FIFA. During the 2018 World Cup, Serbia accused FIFA of directing referees to favor their Swiss counterparts. FIFA also covered up the Russian doping scandal for 18 months, which, if addressed directly, could have made a difference for a number of countries. There is speculation that some of the Russian players continued with doping throughout this World Cup. The scandal implicated 34 football players. This culture of impunity, bias, and favoritism appears to have trickled down from the top to the referee level. Mark Geiger, the US referee who adamantly refused Morocco’s repeated requests for VAR and sought to restrain or disqualify as many Moroccan players as possible through the use of yellow cards, himself has a history of murky accusations. In the US, Geiger was a source of a litany of complaints by players and coaches alike for the alleged abuse of red cards, which threatened the integrity of the game. Geiger’s claim to infamy also rests in the Gold Cup semifinals between Mexico and Panama, held in Atlanta in July 2015, where Geiger admitted that officiating errors impacted the outcome of the game. Panama, at the time, claimed that the game was fixed. Critics argue that there is a case to be made of favoritism against African countries and for well-known European teams with Geiger. In the case of Morocco, an Italian commentator believed he unfairly denied Morocco a deserved penalty. These issues are sparking outrage, worldwide, not just in Morocco. Many developing countries saw the 2015 corruption probe as an opportunity for a fresh start for the embattled organization. FIFA was supposed to bring together in unity and equality passionate football players and fans from all over the world. Instead, FIFA has turned into a mechanism for wealthy world leaders and influencers to buy prestige by bribing referees and officials, and undermining, excluding, or prejudicing teams from developing countries. Furthermore, these countries, which were disadvantaged financially from the outset and felt they were now being penalized on the basis of their origin in a case of a bizarre double jeopardy, were hoping for the restoration of justice when responsible parties would finally be called out for their misdeeds and publicly condemned. Instead, the probe appeared to end in a miscarriage of justice. Several officials were suspended, but one of the allegedly main culprits was cleared. Even with some officials are charged and prosecuted, it appears that not much has changed. The entire culture of FIFA may very well be based in bias, corruption, and easy manipulation by the rich and powerful. The only answer to Morocco’s grievances may lie in the reform of the ranking system, stringent vigilance of the rules, and international commitment to holding FIFA and its donors accountable for clearly biased policies, which leave little room for accountability and for the simple enjoyment, growth, and promotion of the sport the organization once aspired to provide.

Rabat– Following the Casablanca Court of Appeals’ sentencing of Hirak Rif activists on Tuesday, Al Hoceima’s Court of Instance has appointed new attorneys, judges, and court representatives. The new judges, appointed Wednesday, are graduates from the Higher Magistrates’ Institute, namely Noureddine Slimani, Mazin Al Qadawi, Hamza Bahour, Abdel Halim A’ad, Anass Kass, Yasser El Wafi, Farid Shawraq, and Mohammed Agmid. The deputies for the King’s public prosecutor are Imad Ould Al Sharif and Mohamed Al Rakouni. Casablanca’s Court of Appeals sentenced Hirak leaders Nasser Zefzafi and Nabil Ahemjik, as well as activists Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid, to 20 years in prison. Zakaria Adehchour, Mohamed Haki, and Mohamed Bouhenouch received 15 years in jail, whereas Mohamed Jelloul, Karim Amghar, Salah Lackham, Omar Bouharass, Bilal Ahaddad, Jamal Bouhaddou, and Achraf Yakhloufi were sentenced to 10 years. Others were sentenced to 1-5 years. The Hirak activists were held for over a year, awaiting trial and verdict.
The court’s decision resulted in nationwide controversy and protests calling for the release of the activists. Demonstrations took place on Wednesday in the capital of the Rif region, Nador, near the Parliament in in Rabat, and on Boulevard El Oumame Al Moutahida in Casablanca. People in Meknes protested on Friday.
 
Casablanca’s Court of Appeals has separately sentenced Moroccan journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui on Thursday, to three years in prison for “inciting participation in a banned protest” and “threatening national security.” El Mahdaoui gave a speech to a crowd gathered at Place Mohammed VI in the Riffian city of Al Hoceima, encouraging them to take part in the July 20, 2017, protest which had been banned by the government.  The Hirak protests began in October 2016 after the death of Mouhcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck as he was trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities in Al Hoceima.

Rabat – On Thursday morning, a policeman fired his gun in warning and then shot an individual threatening passengers on a bus as well as police officers. The policeman, a member of the mobile brigade in Temara, fired five shots, including two warnings at the individual brandishing a knife. The knife-man had a criminal record. The suspect destroyed the front windshield of two buses, according to a statement from the Directorate General of National Security (DGSN). When the suspect violently resisted and obstinately tried to attack the occupants of the bus, the police officer was obliged to use his service weapon. The policeman shot the suspect three times in his knee and thorax, according to the DGSN. The injured suspect, placed under medical supervision at the hospital, will be brought to the court as soon as his health is stabilized. The statement concluded that the suspect will be subjected to an investigation under the supervision of the competent prosecutor’s office.

Rabat – Will he stay or will he go? Hervé Renard’s fate is now preoccupying Moroccan football fans’ conversations. After Morocco’s disappointing exit from the 2018 World Cup, there is doubt about the future of the French coach with the national team. “Very proud to have been your coach at all for this World Cup” wrote Renard on his Instagram, after Morocco’s last game with Spain (2-2) which has sparked controversy over “unfair” use of VAR. The post is raising many questions among Renard’s fans who want him to stay with the Moroccan team. Following the rumors, Fouzi Lekjaa, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) President, has given assurances in an interview with Medi 1 TV that he will give answers in July. “At the end of the World Cup, I will sit with Hervé Renard and have a discussion regarding his future with the Atlas Lions,” he said, recalling that the national team must play a game against Malawi on September 7 as part of the pre-2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN). The president of the FRMF considers that the national team should move on and continue to progress with or without Renard. “The team belongs to Moroccans, and its performance should continue to improve. Our level is now recognized worldwide,” Lekjaa said, adding that “no one should be indispensable to the national team.” FRMF had previously thanked the Frenchman for the team’s performance in Russia. Lekjaa reportedly reiterated his trust in Renard, saying the Moroccan public liked and appreciated what he and his men showed in Russia. Under contract with Morocco until 2022, Renard has received offers from the Egyptian and Algerian federations. According to Arabic outlet Al Massae, Egypt, which will separate from coach Hector Cuper after a disappointing World Cup, is seriously thinking of recruiting Renard. As for Algeria, the president of the Algerian Football Federation (FAF), Kheireddine Zetchi, has announced that Hervé Renard is on the waiting list of potential coaches for the Algerian selection to replace coach Rabah Madjar after his departure. Among Moroccan players, the general mood is that Renard should stay. Players say they are happy with his coaching style and his approach to the game. “He must stay. He should not go,” said midfielder Mbark Boussoufa. Boussoufa added: “The coach has done a remarkable job, and he should be allowed to continue what he started two years ago.” Hervé Renard has not yet made any public statement regarding his future with the Atlas Lions following the team’s World Cup performance. He has said he would make an announcement at the appropriate time.

Rabat – The Moroccan pro boxer, Mohammed Rabii, has encountered an issue in acquiring a visa to enter the European Union to fight his sixth professional battle. The Republic of Czech and Belgium have denied visas for Rabii and his team, despite the guarantees and reservations that he provided on his visa application in addition to his professional fight invitation. The fight is scheduled for July 21st in Germany’s capital Berlin. In the absence support from the Royal Moroccan Boxing Federation, the professional athlete continues to sacrifice and persevere in order to improve his level to be ready to achieve his dream in the Tokyo 2020 summer Olympics. Rabii will try to acquire the Schengen visa through another European country, but he will have to postpone his fight until August. A similar issue kept the Moroccan steeplechase runner, Soufiane El Bakkali, from competing in the US when his visa request was denied.

By Safaa Kasraoui and Tarek Bazza Rabat- Sahrawi activist and Polisario critic Mustafa Salma has written a letter to the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy for Western Sahara Horst Köhler during his visit in the region.  After fiery criticism and condemnation of Algeria and Polisario, Salma’s subdued letter aims to sensitize Köhler to the worrying situation that Sahrawis are experiencing in the Tindouf camps due to Algeria’s interest in prolonging the conflict. Salma asked Köhler, who began visiting the Tindouf area Thursday, to listen not only to the Polisario, but also to other Sahrawis. Salma posted his letter on Facebook. The activist, who also served as a police chief in the Tindouf camps in southern Algeria, explained the unbearable situation that Sahrawis are encountering. The Sahrawi activist expressed disappointment in the prolongation of the conflict. “We Sahrawi people, are paying the price for the delayed development of our region, the suffering of our scattered families, and the difficult conditions in which tens of thousands of us are living in camps in Algeria.” Salma who has been criticizing Algeria and Polisario since 2011, regretted that Polisario is the only group recognized as representing the Sahrawis. With condemnation, the activist said that the separatist front gets its blessing from one side only: Algeria. “As for Polisario, which claims to represent us, it has nothing but the support of its sponsor Algeria, which has an interest in the continuity of the conflict. While Sahrawis are suffering a scorching situation in the Polisario-run Tindouf camps, Algeria, according to Salma, is the main beneficiary of this situation. Subsequently, the activist recognized that as long as Algeria shrinks from its responsibility to contribute to the UN-led political process, the situation will remain the same. For Salma, “it does not take much perception to understand that this situation will not lead to a compromise between the Sahrawis and Morocco, as long as Algeria claims to have nothing to do with the conflict over the Sahara.” For decades, Algeria has denied that it forms a main part in the conflict, rejecting Morocco’s and the UN’s requests to contribute to finding a mutually acceptable solution to end the conflict over Western Sahara. Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel and his Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia denied that Algeria is abdicating its responsibility in the conflict several times during interviews and at international conferences. Algeria, however, was embarrassed when an Algerian military airplane dramatically crashed on April 11, claiming the lives of more than 200 people, including members of the Polisario. The incident came only a few weeks after Messahel denied his country’s responsibility in the conflict. “I do not need to prove that there is no dissenting voice in the Sahara camps against Algeria’s interests and its vision of the solution,” Salma said. Salma condemned Polisario’s move to keep him separated from his family for more than eight years “because of a mere press statement in which I said that autonomy is the closet realistic solution to the Sahara conflict.” In his message, Salma denounced the absence of an opposition in the Tindouf camps and said the “imposition” of the separatist group “as the sole representative of the Sahrawis is yet another proof that we have no opinion in the camps.” He added that Sahrawis, who sought to defend their rights through the Sahrawi National Initiative for Change, are “subjected to much pressure to prevent them from their activity in the camps, which will force them, like their predecessors, to move their project abroad, away from the Sahrawis.” Throughout his letter, the personal envoy reminded the UN and its personal envoy that Polisario does not represent all Sahrawis. “You and everyone who sees the Polisario Front as the sole representative and speaker in the name of the Sahrawis are wrong and are contradicting the principles of human rights that respect and give the opportunity to all opinions without discrimination.” According to the activist, the front is not trustworthy enough to tackle the issues of the Sahrawis living in camps. Like in a previous post, Salma recalled the death of two Sahrawis in “mysterious circumstances in the D’Heibya prison, which is run by the security services of the Front.” The activist said that the separatist front has been monopolizing Sahrawis’ decisions and “harassing” opposition parties in the camps. Salma also recognized that the front embezzles humanitarian aid from the international community meant for Sahrawis, claiming that the leaders of the Polisario are involved in “corruption related to enjoying international organizations’ aid at the expense of Sahrawi refugees.” Polisario cannot be a “trustworthy partner and patron of the Sahrawi’s interests in the political process that you are running in the name of international community,” Salma told Köhler. He added that the aim of his letter is not to exclude “the Polisario Front as a movement in the Sahara. However, we demand our right to political participation and to express our opinion on ways to determine our fate and to end the suffering of our people for decades.” Concluding his letter, Salma invited the Personal Envoy to engage the Sahrawis living outside and inside the camps in the political process. For Salma this option “would eventually lead to a settlement of the conflict.” He also believe that Sahrawis’ “contribution will inevitably provide a great service for peace and international security, and will save the effort of international organizations and their resources spent on the Sahara conflict.”

Rabat – He is the third Moroccan to join the prestigious academy. Following Moroccan filmmakers Nabil Ayouch and Khadija Alami in 2017, French-Moroccan actor Said Taghmaoui has accepted to be part of the Oscars’ Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences.  The Hollywood actor, who has recently acted in the 2017 “Wonder Woman,” shared the news with his fans on his Instagram with several screenshots of the Oscars’ academy invitation. The academy is a Hollywood institution that selects films and actors nominated in for the coveted Oscars golden statuette. As a member of the academy, Taghmaoui’s mission will be to vote for Oscar-nominated films. This year, the academy has focused on diversifying its thousands of voting members. According to AFP, among the new artists, 38% are people of color, including actress and comedian Mindy Kaling; the young Quvenzhané Wallis (14); actor Daniel Kaluuya (“Get Out,” “Black Panther”); and musicians Nitin Sawhney, Kendrick Lamar, and Carlinhos Brown. According to AFP, if all guests agree to join the Academy, the number of members would increase to 9,226. The year 2017 had already marked a sharp increase in the number of people invited, with 774 new members against 684 in 2016. Taghmaoui will certainly bring that additional Moroccan touch to the jury committee. The 44 year-old artist has always displayed immense dedication to his home country. He recently called upon Moroccans to support Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup. Last year, he appeared in two videos commemorating the 60-year anniversary of Royal Air Maroc (RAM). Another time, while exploring Casablanca, Taghmaoui stated that he “will never forget [his] origins.” Born in France to Moroccan parents, Said Taghmaoui became a naturalized US citizen in 2008 and established himself in the Hollywood industry. He was a professional boxer when he met French filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz and collaborated with him in the writing of the successful movie “La Haine,” with Vincent Cassel in 1995. His participation earned him a nomination for the French version of the Oscars, the “Césars.”  Taghmaoui has appeared in several Hollywood productions including “G.I Joe,” “Wonder Woman,” “House Of Saddam,” and “Lost…”

Rabat- A delegation of the Istiqlal party, led by the party’s Secretary General, Nizar Baraka, met Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani on Wednesday to review the finance bill (PLF 2018) aimed to boost investment, employment, and entrepreneurship, in response to concerns in the Rif. The meeting was organized in line with the heavy sentences given to the Hirak activists on Tuesday. El Othmani and Baraka discussed the issue, suggesting that the meeting about the 2018 finance bill is within the government’s action to solve the issue. El Othmani said that “in order to alleviate the current tension in the kingdom, concrete measure should be taken into account.” According to El Othmani, the finance bill, which was adopted in October 2017, has to be “applied for officials who do not fulfill their duties or cause citizen’s interests to be delayed,” with a focus toward fighting corruption and territorial disparities. The legislation also seeks to elevate the social sector in education and health. The Istiqlal party also proposed that the government “raise salaries” to improve incomes. The party also called for the government to protect the purchasing power of citizens, especially with regard to fuel prices. For his part, El Othmani stressed that the primary purpose of PLF is to improve the financial situation of citizens through social dialogue. The PLF also calls for measures to protect the environment and promote sustainable development. On Tuesday, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals sentenced Hirak leaders Zefzafi and Ahemjik, and activists Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid, to 20 years in prison for their involvement in the 2016-17 Hirak Rif protests.

Rabat- That is it then for Africa in Russia 2018: there will be no African representatives in the Round of 16. Group H was wide open before yesterday’s matches. Japan and Senegal topped the group with 4 points; Colombia came third with 3 points, while Poland sat at the bottom with 0 points, having lost their two previous games. Senegal came energetically to the Colombia game. The Africans were vastly superior in the first half. They imposed their physicality in the middle while at the same time suffocating Colombia on the wings. Spurred by Liverpool forward Sadio Mané, Aliou Cissé’s men pushed almost impulsively in the first half, straining for an early goal, as they had done in their previous games. And yet no goal. For the 45 minutes in the first half, the Teranga Lions were buoyant and roaring, sending in crosses, hitting the Colombia defensive citadel, or forcing Ospina, Colombia’s goalkeeper, to make his best saves. For all of Senegal’s urgency, Colombia, who also needed a win to ensure qualification, were drowsy and uninspired. To say that the 0-0 scoreline at the first half was unfair to Senegal would be an understatement. Colombia came to the second half with more engagement. They slowly gained the ball and started circulating it in the manner that many would expect of a good South American side. 70 minutes into the game, the match texture changed greatly. Senegal, losing its tempo, started conceding space in some very strategic locations on the field. Crosses became sporadic, while the constant runs on the wings diminished in intensity. Meanwhile, Colombia pushed, gradually convinced that they could send Senegal home. At minute 74, Senegal sent out injured right back Youssouf. In came Moussa Wagué, also a right back. And that is when Colombia’s corner came in, transformed into a beautiful goal by a towering header from defender Yerry Mina. The goal rekindled Senegal. From fatigued and drained, they became urgent and dangerous, quickly regaining their first half strength. But it was too late, and the scoreline remained unchanged. In the other Group H game, Poland claimed an honorable victory over Japan. Colombia, with 6 points, now tops the group. Japan and Senegal finished with 4 points. But Japan goes through due to fair-play, having received  two fewer yellow cards than Senegal got. This is the first time since 1982 that Africa has failed to reach the next stage. This will be the story of the best African sides—Morocco, Senegal, and Nigeria—at the 2018 FIFA World Cup: they dominated their opponents and possessed the ball. They were confident and impressive. But when it came to making the crucial difference, they were either impotent or unfortunate.

Rabat- The head of Morocco’s National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) in the Fez region, Mohammed Berkia, has announced that the office is adopting projects to improve potable water supply in Al Hoceima until 2035. Berkia said in a statement to the state-owned press, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), that the ONEE’s projects aim to solve the problem of potable water in the Rif region and provide supplementary water for laundry and other uses. Berkia revealed that the projects will cost an estimated MAD 714 million. The government has budgeted MAD 900 million for the project, which will launch by the end of the year. The muddy waters of the Ben Abdelkrim El Khattabi reservoir dam in Al Hoceima have contributed to a shortage of clean water in the region, making it insufficient for the population’s daily needs. With respect to potable water supply in urban areas, the office will invest MAD 300 million to carry out the project until 2035. The water flow speed in the region will reach 200 liters per second. The projects also include the treatment of seawater to be preserved in a tank with a capacity of 2,000 cubic meters.  To increase water supply in the rural areas of the Rif region, Berkia announced that 13 new dam reservoirs will be built at a cost of MAD 330 million. The project is within the framework of King Mohammed VI’s  Manarat Al Moutawsit development program. The implementation of the program has suffered a slow start and did not meet a strategic vision integrated and shared by all stakeholders, according to the Court of Auditors. The court noted that most stakeholders at both central and local levels were significantly delayed in carrying out their duties for the program. In October 2017, the King sacked several ministers and high officials who operated in the previous government lead by Abdelilah Benkirane.

Rabat – Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi has commented on the heavy prison sentences given to Moroccan activists, saying that the “government does not have the right to interfere in court cases.” In a press briefing after the Government Council on Thursday in Rabat, El Khalfi argued that “the judiciary is independent from the government,” and that the cabinet cannot interfere“ because it does not fall within its jurisdiction, in accordance with the constitution and the democratic rules.” He added that the defendants, whose sentences ranged from 1 to 20 years, can appeal the court’s decision, adding that “the head of government and the minister of state for human rights follow this file very closely.” The Casablanca Court of Appeals also sentenced Moroccan journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui to 3 years in prison for “inciting participation in a banned protest” and “threatening national security.” When the court decided to sentence the Hirak leaders, including Nasser Zefzafi, to 20 years in prison on Tuesday night, the court separated Mahdaoui’s case from the rest of the Hirak defendants, trying him separately Thursday. Police arrested El Mahdaoui on July 20, 2017, for giving a speech at Place Mohammed VI in Al Hoceima encouraging the crowd to join a banned protest.  El Khalfi’s statement is the first official reaction of the government to the activists’ sentences, which were heavily criticized by protesters who took to the streets of Nador, Rabat, and Casablanca on Wednesday to condemn the sentences. Journalists, human rights activists, and citizens gathered together in front of the government to chant anti-government slogans and to criticize the justice system in Morocco. Demonstrators called for the immediate release of the convicted activists.

Rabat – The President of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), Fouzi Lekjaa, has addressed a letter to FIFA President Gianni Infantino to complain about the use and non-use of VAR in Morocco’s World Cup matches with Spain and Portugal. The letter is a complaint for the refereeing mistakes committed against Moroccan players that cost Morocco its qualification into the Round of 16. The refereeing mistakes include Portugal’s Pepe’s fault against Moroccan forward Boutaib inside the penalty area, leaving space for Ronaldo to score. It also includes depriving Morocco from two deserved penalties in the 30th and 80th minutes of the game. The FRMF is also claiming fouls were not whistled in the Morocco-Spain face to face. At the 8th minute of play a reckless tackle from Spain’s Piqué on Boutaib deserved a yellow card. And there was an undeserved warning on Al Ahmadi at the 22nd minute. At the 47th minute, a handball by Piqué in the penalty area was not whistled and also deserved a yellow card. Moreover, in the last minutes of the game, a corner that led to Spain’s equalizer goal is invalid. The ball crossed the line from the right side of the keeper before touching Moroccan midfeilder Romain Saiss’ foot, but the corner was played from the left side instead of the right. Even though the referee pointed to the left corner, the Spanish players rapidly played it from the other side without any interference from VAR control room members. The referee should have awarded Morocco a goal kick. Instead he offered Spain its equalizer goal. The FRMF official letter to FIFA: ????? ???? ??????? ????? ?????? ????? ??????? ????????? ???? ???? ??? ??????? ??????? ?? ??? ?????? pic.twitter.com/Gxxp2Hp57D — FRMF (@FRMFOFFICIEL) June 28, 2018

Rabat – Moroccan 19-year old central defender Achraf Hakimi is expected to join Borussia Dortmund on loan from Real Madrid next season.  The German outlet Kicker announced that Real Madrid is set to sign a deal with Germany’s Dortmund for Hakimi as the football club is planning to look for a “backup” for their Lukasz Piszczek. According to Tribuna, the Spanish giant aims to make Hakimi “gain the similar experience as Dani Carvajal,” who played for Bayer Leverkusen for the 2012/2013 season. The sports outlet added that the club has not confirmed the news, but volunteered to Kicker that the news “make sense.” The rising star made his official debut at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium on October 1, 2017, when Real Madrid’s key defender Dani Carvajal could not play due to injury. The footballer netted his first goal for his Spanish team on December 10 against Sevilla, becoming the first Moroccan ever to score for Real Madrid. Born in Spain to Moroccan parents, Hakimi was also the first Moroccan footballer to win Champions League with Real Madrid on May 26. The Moroccan footballer also delivered a spectacular performance in the 2018 World Cup against the deadly group of the World Cup: Group B. In February, CIES Football Observatory ranked the international footballer among Europe’s “50 most promising under-20 footballers.”

By Intissar Faouzi Rabat- Cycling is an ecological and elegant sport. Its limits are only determined by how far you want to move. The definition of adventure can differ greatly from one person to another. Discovering new roads and riding in new areas is the principle of our definition. From the heart of human experience, our story captures the essence of a man with the passion for cycling; it is a story about tenacity, passion, persistence, hope, and success. From Meknes to Mecca, a 58-year-old Moroccan cyclist Mohammed Rbouhate has challenged himself to complete the Hajj pilgrimage by bicycle. At 16 years old, Rbouhate started this wonderful hobby. He fell down many times but day by day he continued to discover the sport and experience the freedom of moving on two wheels. In his long life as a cyclist, Rbouhate has cycled thousands of miles; he passed through every city in Morocco, faced numerous dangerous circumstances, and met people from all different backgrounds and countries. These trips were unforgettable adventures. After a long period of training and practicing, he has taken this sport under his wings and enjoyed remaining connected with the biking community. He was always so curious to hear about cyclists’ stories.  Rbouhate had always wished to make the pilgrimage, which is considered the fifth pillar of Islam. This spiritual trip is the realization of a long-held dream. “After a long experience in cycling, I said to myself, ‘Why not experience new travel outside of Morocco?’ The first thing that I thought about is travelling on Hajj, knowing that I have already travelled to make the pilgrimage by car in 1988,” Rbouhate said. In order to help fulfil this journey, Rbouhate followed all the procedures: he first contacted the Royal Court in order to receive approval for travelling; then, he contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, and the embassies of the countries he planned to pass through in addition to regional provinces and national security authorities in Meknes. Although his family was initially against the idea of his journey, Rbouhate’s daughter has followed in his footsteps and now is a beginner cyclist. “My wife and my children couldn’t accept the idea that I will be away for months, they were worried about the problems I may face during my travel, as well as the danger on roads,” Rbouhate said. “On the contrary I am not worried at all, because I believe deeply that Allah will protect me since I am doing all of this for the sake of his forgiveness.” Rbouhate said that he did not receive any support from any region or prefecture except the national security. “I feel sorry to say that when I arrived to Dakhla city, I asked the general secretary of the alderman of the region of Dakhla Oued Dahab to provide me with a shelter or a hotel where I can spend the night before I continue my journey, then he gave me only MAD 100 from his own money…whereas I was not begging him money but all I wanted was just a shelter.” He also said that he asked for  support from the Ministry of Youth and Sport and the urban community of Meknes; however, he did not receive any answer.  Cycling over thousands miles, the courageous cyclist will pass through eight countries: Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia, as well as crossing the Red Sea. Rbouhate started from the city of Ismailia on April 1, 2018, passing through every Moroccan city. He arrived later in Mauritania, then  stopped in Bamako, the capital of Mali, to complete the first leg of his adventure. After a long ride, he arrived now to Sudan. Upon completing the first portion in Bamako, he confirmed that he did not face any difficulties, as he had brought with him everything needed in case of a breakdown. “It took me one month to study and explore the infrastructure, the nature and the weather of the countries I will be passing through,” he said. Throughout the countries he crossed during his journey, he received support and encouragement from African people, especially Moroccans. Moroccan ambassadors of these countries offered him a warm reception along with other members of the Moroccan community. “I have met a lot of people and I am often stopped by people who were happy to see me raising the flag of Morocco, as well as the ambassadors of Morocco in these African countries, such as Ambassador to Mali Hassan Naciri, Ambassador to Niger Ali Laachab, and Ambassador to Chad Abdellatif Roja as well as many others from the Arab community in Africa.” Along his journey, Rbouhate faced various obstacles, from torrential rain to dry desert heat. He is still cycling through very rural areas, enduring the desert and temperatures that exceed 50 degrees Celsius, which sometimes led him to postpone his travel. When Morocco World News asked Rbouhate about the country in which he faced the most difficulties, he answered, “Mauritania.” It is mostly covered by desert and has very few means of comfort, in contrast with Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. The total distance he will pedal from Morocco to Saudi Arabia exceeds 30,000 kilometers. Rbouhate will use a ferry to cross the Red Sea and reach Saudi Arabia. The goal of his journey is the most important on a pilgrimage; the path is only a means for achieving the goal.   The Hajj is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, the holiest city for Muslims. A mandatory religious duty for all adult Muslims who are physically and financially able to undertake the journey, the Hajj must be carried out at least once in a lifetime. The idea of sacred travel runs deep in human religion, dating back to when Muslims would climb hilltops and deserts to be closer to God. Using a bike to reach the holy city of Mecca evokes traditional methods of travel for Moroccans and Arabs around the world. Over one thousand years ago, when Islam appeared, Muslims making the pilgrimage used to walk or ride camels and horses thousands of kilometers to their destination. “This journey is my life-changing experience which will test my determination and passion, and it is not supposed to be easy, and I am always carrying with me this verse of Qur’an as my principle during all my journey: “And whoever relies upon Allah, then he is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allah will accomplish his purpose” (Surah 65:3). Over the past decades and before advances in air travel, people would write their testaments in case they never came back; nowadays, people can complete the Hajj in two weeks.  
“A Journey for Peace” is the slogan Rbhouhate chose to accompany him during his entire journey. This slogan reflects his desire to spread peace and tolerance in every country he passes by. “I called it a journey for peace because everyone aspires to live in peace, and I am always wishing to spread it in all Arab and Islamic countries,” he said. “In addition to this, peace was the approach of our prophet, therefore, we should all follow this approach.” The purpose of Rbouhate’s trip is to promote the values of Islam and to foster peace between countries, knowing that King Mohammed VI is emphasizing inter-African cooperation during his multiple visits to the different countries of this continent. “African people always welcome me once they know that I am coming from Morocco. Their love towards Morocco generally and our King specifically is very clear in their warm reception.” Rbouhate’s deep wish is to make this journey mark his lifetime achievement, something that will make his children and his grandchildren always feel proud when they talk about it.  The most common effect of a pilgrimage is unity and social cooperation, which leads to understanding among nations. The most important factor behind understanding is the rightful teachings of a religion which bridges the gaps, brings hearts together, creates a link between east and west, and units the blacks and whites, Arabs and non-Arabs. “The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page” – Saint Augustine.

Rabat – Germany felt Wednesday what Spain, Portugal, and Argentina narrowly escaped: the ire of the “underdogs,” who are growing tired of being deemed unfit to win the World Cup. Media outlets have duly reacted to “Germany’s dramatic end,” all agreeing that it was a footballing earthquake. Global reactions “The end of the world as we know it,” the Guardian called the game, hinting that the German national squad embodied an era and a mindset. For the Times Sports, June 27 will now symbolize the “Day the Germans just disappeared.” “Bye-bye Germany,” Spanish sports outlet AS headlined, capturing one of the most telling images from the match: German right back Joshua Kimmich, midfielder Toni Kroos, and central defender Mats Hummels heavily walking off the pitch, crestfallen and hands on their heads. Not since 1938 had their country failed to reach the knockout stages. In a post-match commentary that sounded more like a eulogy, prominent sports journalist Jonathan Wilson said: “This, then, is how the world ends, not with a bang but with a whimper. There are certain events so apocalyptic that it feels they cannot just happen. They should be signaled beneath thunderous skies as owls catch falcons and horses turn and eat themselves. At the very least there should be a sense of fury, of thwarted efforts, of energies exhausted.” Wilson’s futuristic tone is barely an exaggeration. For many, the prospect of a German exit from the group stage could only be imagined in movies, horror comedy perhaps. But not everyone was filled with empathy for a fallen giant, for other media were exultant, some for revenge’s sake and others for the pleasure of seeing others unhappy and unfortunate. The Sun chose the German word Schadenfreude (pleasure derived from another person’s misfortune) to report on Germany’s “historical failure,” with a glimpse of Gareth Southgate, England’s coach, saying: “Let Germany defeat be a warning for England.” As for Brazilian media, still harboring grudges for Brazil’s 7-1 humiliation at German hands in the 2014 World Cup semifinal, the sense of celebration was palpable: at least one serious contender is out, which should be good news for Brazil. German media In the run-up to Germany’s historical humiliation against the South Koreans, the Germans were coming from a scintillating last-minute winner against Sweden in their second match. The German press was rhapsodic after that last-minute win. “Some day our children will ask us: where were we when Toni Kroos curled the ball over Robin Olsen’s head?” German outlet Die Zeit said after the 2-1 win over Sweden. Bild, Germany’s most popular daily, was euphoric: “Against Sweden Germany was already clinically dead. Now it is brimming with strength.” How will they recount the Russian adventure now that South Korea happened? What will they be telling their children about that fiasco? “Speechless,” Bild titled its post-match analysis. “Speechless” was the exact same word the daily had used in June 2014 when Germany thrashed Brazil 7-1. In 2014, Bild was speechless because it was beaming with joy; it is now “speechless” because it is overwhelmed with grief. “Over and out,” headlined Die Welt, next to a picture of a dejected Toni Kroos, whose last-minute goal against Sweden was not enough to salvage the German ship from sinking. Kroos’ goal had been touted a “spectacular salvation” after the Sweden game. Now, Die Welt seems to see in it a pale prelude to an equally spectacular devastation. Frankfurter Allgemeine, a Frankfurt-based daily, was melodramatic. “Germany’s downfall,” it called the event. The newspaper contrasted images of Saturday’s elation against Sweden with those of yesterday’s heavy defeat. “Germany is back to the earth with a bump,” it said, suggesting that the hopeful jolt of last week’s victory clouded judgments about the team’s weaknesses. “It is a big surprise, a huge disappointment, and it has left me and many of my compatriots feeling completely empty,” wrote German columnist Thomas Hitzlsperger. To Hitzlsperger’s “huge disappointment,” however, Joachim Löw, Germany’s coach, also visibly shocked and disappointed, added a sense of “deserved” failure. “We didn’t deserve to progress,” Löw said, explaining that his men exhibited a sense of “highhandedness” from the outset in their Russian adventure.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – Jamaican singer Chronixx took the stage on Monday night, June 25, at Rabat’s Mawazine’s Festival, playing a mixture of reggae songs at an intimate performance on the festival’s fourth evening. Chronixx took the Bouregreg Stage, named for the river that bisects the cities of Rabat and Salé, and, greeting the audience, played for an hour and a half on the edge of the river and Rabat’s famed Kasbah des Oudayas. Jamar McNaughton, who performs under the stage name Chronixx, played a setlist drawing mostly from his 16-track album, Chronology, released last year. The 25-year-old played hits like “I Can” and “Likes,” the latter a jab at his generation’s social media preoccupation and reaffirming, “Do it for the love / Me nuh do it for the likes.”  Chronology contains a number of tracks about black empowerment, made explicit on songs like “Black is Beautiful” and “Majesty.” At Monday’s performance, Chronixx reiterated his message while speaking between songs, addressing the audience directly. “This is a music of the people, music from Africa, as a music for liberation for all African people,” he intoned, over shouts of “freedom” from the audience. He continued, “and ultimately for the liberation of all humanity, without any discrimination of class, color, or creed. Remember that. So this [song], it says ‘forget your troubles and rock with me,’” before launching into a rendition of “Skankin’ Sweet.” Chronixx first received international acclaim following his 2012 album Less than Greater Than and solidified his standing in the international music scene two years later, with the release of Dread &amp; Terrible. Earlier this year, he released a hit single, “Unity We Need,” in collaboration with fellow Jamaican artist Richie Spice. Although one of the most prominent contemporary reggae artists in the world, Chronixx also draws from a number of musical genres, from the Caribbean or abroad. Songs on Chronology contain varying influences from jazz and electronic to dancehall, on tracks like “Spirulina.”  The singer has also engaged in high-profile, genre-bending collaborations with electro-reggae-dancehall group Major Lazer, lending his high, sing-song voice to the music’s electronic rhythm. Chronixx has previously performed on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” on the American television network, NBC. The Kingston-native has performed on stages the world over, from California’s Coachella to Britain’s Glastonbury.  Nearly a year since its original release last July, Chronology remains on iTunes’ Top 20 album chart. However, the artist downplayed his celebrity and proclaimed solidarity with the audience. “These are my people, they look just like me.”  Gesturing to the crowd, “my brothers are over here, my sisters are over here.”  Following his performance and chants of “one more,” Chronixx and the other six musicians continued for two more songs. Disappearing from stage for a brief moment, he re-emerged for the encore carrying a Moroccan flag, which he draped over the microphone for the duration of the set. Later, in a post on the artist’s Instagram page, Chronixx thanked the crowd: “Always a great joy to be in Africa.” Always a great joy to be in Africa.

Rabat – After sentencing four Hirak Rif activists to 20 years in prison, Casablanca’s Appeal Court  has sentenced Moroccan journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui to three years for “inciting participation in banned protest” and “threatening national security.” The court pronounced its verdict against El Mahdaoui on Thursday night.  The court decided on Tuesday to try El Mahdaoui separately after pronouncing harsh sentences against 54 activists. The court of appeal said that the journalist, who is also the editor-in-chief of the news outlet Badil Info, was found guilty of failing to report “an attempt to undermine internal state security” to the national police. Police arrested El Mehdaoui on July 20, 2017, for giving a speech at Place Mohammed VI in Al Hoceima encouraging them to join a banned protest. The court also decided that El Mahdaoui should pay a fine of MAD 3,000. On Tuesday, 54 activists and journalists received sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years. Leaders of the protests, including Nasser Zefzafi, Nabil Ahamjik, and Ouassim Boustati, were given 20 years. The harsh sentences against journalists and activists sparked an outrage on social media. Several journalists, celebrities, politicians and activists took to their social media accounts to condemn the court’s decision. Earlier today, international NGO Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemned the heavy sentences, calling for the immediate release of the journalists who were detained in the protests, which started in October 2016 after the death of local fishmonger Mouhcine Fikri. Amnesty International also condemned the court’s decision, urging it to review the sentences.

Rabat – The symphony of death continues in Syria, as government forces shell, and drop barrel bombs, accompanied by Russian air strikes, on the southeastern province of Deraa.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reports in Deraa’s east that at least 53 strikes have been conducted from midnight Wednesday to Thursday morning.  The government forces have been pressing Deraa intensely since June 19. So far at least 70,000 have been displaced. The SOHR reports that at least 93 civilians have been killed by the shelling since June 19.  Lawrence Adam, a journalist for the pro-rebel Nabaa media group, told Al Jazeera that at least three hospitals and medical centers had been either completely destroyed or rendered closed by the damages sustained.  On Tuesday there was heavy fighting concentrated at Basr al-Hairir, with at least 200 airstrikes and 150 barrel bombs targeting the area, said activist Jihad Hamza to Al Jazeera.  Deraa province has been divided between rebel and government forces for years, however after multiple victories around Damascus, the government is targeting one of the only rebel strongholds left in Syria. Defeating the rebels in Deraa has symbolic importance as the “cradle of the revolution.”  The Free Syrian Army announced the creation of a central operations room in the southern province and remained defiant, saying that they would not betray the sacrifices made by their comrades, nor give up an inch of their territory. Refugees trapped in Syria  People in the eastern part of the province have been fleeing to villages and towns along the border with Jordan. Jordan’s Foreign Minister, Ayman Safadi, said that the border will remain closed.  An economically struggling Jordan says it has reached its capacity for refugees, and cannot handle another influx. Jordan’s Minister of State for Media Affairs, Jumana Ghunaimat, said, “We have received enough numbers of Syrian refugees; we already have a large number and we simply cannot receive more.” The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that Jordan has the second highest number of Syrian refugees per capita, with 89 for every 1,000 inhabitants. Jordan has on record at least 660,000 registered refugees, but estimates that there are actually double that number in the country.  Those on the western side of Deraa have been fleeing to the towns and villages along the Golan Heights, where they have been receiving whatever aid the residents there can give them, as well as Israeli humanitarian aid.  Deraa is part of the de-escalation zone agreement between the US, Russia, and Jordan. The proximity to Jordan and the border of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights puts the two countries especially on high alert.  The Syrian civil war, now in its eighth year, has killed over 500,000 and displaced over half of the prewar population of 22 million.

Rabat – Speaker of the House of Representatives Habib El Malki has been received in Belgrade by Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who affirmed his country’s support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. The Wednesday meeting was also attended by the Moroccan Ambassador to Serbia, Mohamed Amine Belhaj. The Serbian president said that he aspires to give new impetus to the economic relations between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Republic of Serbia to raise them to the level of the political ties linking the two countries. The Serbian head of state noted that he has great esteem and consideration for Morocco under King Mohammed VI’s leadership, mentioning his gratitude to the sovereign’s determination to promote Moroccan-Serbian relations. Serbia is keen to do much more to consolidate relations with Morocco, as well as to coordinate the convergence of the two countries’ stances on international issues, he said. President Vucic praised the relations between the Moroccan House of Representatives and the Serbian National Assembly, reinforced by the signing of a cooperation agreement between the two legislative bodies. Habib El Malki thanked the Serbian president for supporting Morocco’s territorial integrity. He also commended the historical depth of Moroccan-Serbian relations. El Malki recalled Morocco’s support for Serbia’s territorial integrity, noting that the reforms Serbia has undertaken have strengthened its ambitions to join the European Union, its regional status, and its role in promoting peace in the region. He also reviewed Morocco’s positions and its role in settling various regional and international conflicts through dialogue and in supporting stability and peace. El Malki started an official visit to Serbia on Tuesday, at the invitation of the president of the Serbian National Assembly, Maja Gojkovic. During his stay, El Malki will hold talks with several parliamentary and government officials.

By Safaa Kasraoui and Tarek Bazza Rabat – On Tuesday night, 54 Moroccan activists received harsh sentences for serious charges after their arrest in Al Hoceima province, which was the home of social demand demonstrations between 2016-2017 after the death of the local fishmonger Mouhcine Fikri in October 2016. The list of the Hirak Rif activists who were prosecuted includes some of the notable figures who led massive demonstrations in the Al Hoceima province against social inequalities. Nearly a year later, with more than 80 trials, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals has handed down its verdicts and sentences, sparking nationwide backlash and condemnation as heavy as the sentences received by the activists. On Wednesday, Moroccan news outlet Media24 published a 1,920-page document from the Court of Appeals. The document lists 54 detainees who were sentenced Tuesday night. The list also includes Salima Ziani, called Sylia, who received a royal pardon on July 29, 2017. The royal pardon included 41 other activists. The file also features the leaders of the protest, with their arrest date, charges, and some of their statements. 20 years in prison The figurehead of the Hirak Rif movement, Nasser Zefzafi, was arrested on May 29, 2017. Born in Al Hoceima in 1978, Zefzafi was arrested for “undermining the security of the state” and for other heavy criminal acts. Zefzafi’s arrest order came after his obstruction of “freedom of worship” when he interrupted an imam at a mosque during a Friday’s sermon, calling for “further demonstrations.” Nabil Ahamjik, 32-year-old unemployed man, was born in Al Hoceima and holds a diploma in Business Administration. He is the second most prominent leader of the Hirak Al Rif movement, known as Zefzafi’s right-hand man. Nabil was always present in the main Rif protests. He was charged for escalating protests and general strikes in Al Hoceima calling for the release of Hirak Rif detainees. He was arrested on June 5, 2017, for undermining the internal security of the country. Ouassim El Boustati, a 25-year-old born and raised in Imzouren in northern Morocco, also received 20 years for undermining the stability and the security of the state and preparing conspiracy against security. Samir Ghid was the fourth activist to receive 20 years in prison for similar charges. 15 years in prison Zakaria Adahchour received a 15-year sentence on Tuesday night. The 27 year-old was born in Imzouren. On March 26, 2017, he faced heavy charges including “plotting to undermine the security of the state” over protests in the Rif region and “voluntary arson of an inhabited building and a vehicle.” Mohamed Haki and Mohamed Bouhenouch also received 15 years in prison for their participation in unauthorized protests and for undermining the stability of the state. The list of convicted people also includes journalists, who were charged for inciting people to  participate in unauthorized protests, including Hamid El Mahdaoui, whose trial is today. 10 years in prison Several activists were given 10 year sentences on Tuesday, including Mohammed Jelloul. Jelloul was born in Tifarwin in 1971. In 2011 he became a prominent leader in the February 20 movement during the Arab Spring and led a large protest movement in the city of Bni Bouayach. As a result, he had already spent a five-year sentence for provoking to rebellion and violence against public forces. Karim Amghar, born in 1984 in Imzouren, was also arrested for his involvement in the unauthorized protests in Al Hoceima. Mohamed Al Assrihi, a day laborer, was born in July 1987 in Al Hoceima. He got a technical diploma and then a diploma in tourism. Dreaming of becoming a journalist, Al Assrihi covered all the Hirak Rif protests to film and report the exact details directly through his Facebook page. Mohamed Almjaoui, a laborer, was born in the village of Ait Omar in 1971. Orphaned while young, Almjaoui was adopted by another family. He holds a bachelor’s in law, obtained in 1995.  3 years in prison Mohamed El Hani, a merchant, was born in Al Hoceima. The 31-year-old was  arrested for involvement in “unauthorized protests.” 2 years in prison Ana El Khattab was born in 1992 in Al Hoceima. He works as a wood merchant. The decision of the court received nationwide backlash, with activists, journalists, human rights NGOs and celebrities condemning the harsh sentences.

Rabat – She was NOT going to let him get away with it. “Never do this to a woman,” said an indignant Brazilian reporter, Julia Guimaraes, when a fan rushed toward her and tried to kiss her while she was filming a live World Cup broadcast before the Japan-Senegal game. The journalist of TV Globo and SportTV, who dodged the kiss, was quick to put the brazen fan in his place. “Don’t do that! Never do that again,” she shouted at her attacker, who began apologizing. “Do not do that, I do not allow you to do that, ever, OK? It’s not polite, it’s not good. Never do that to a woman, okay? Respect,” she said.   On social media, the Brazilian journalist was praised for her quick response to her harasser. She also tweeted about the encounter: “It’s hard to find the words … Fortunately, I have never experienced in Brazil. Here, it happened twice. Sad! Ashamed!” Female reporters covering the 2018 World Cup have been subject to sexual harassment from football fans, including being groped on live television and being criticized for the pitch of their voices, according to the Washington Post. On the opening day of the World Cup, a Colombian journalist was sexually assaulted when a fan grabbed her breast and kissed her on her cheek. The offender then apologized publicly.

Rabat – Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has asked for the release of the six journalists, Mohammed al-Asrihi, Rabiaa al-Ablak, Abdelali Houd, Houssein el Idrissi, Fouad Essaidi, and Jawad al Sabiry, who were sentenced for covering the Hirak protest movement in the Rif, between 2016 and 2017. “Reporters Without Borders condemns these harsh prison sentences against citizen journalists who have only exercised their right to report on a social movement that has rocked their country,” said Souhaieb Khayati, director of RSF’s North Africa office. “We demand their immediate release.” Morocco ranks 135th out of 180 in the World Press Index in 2018. Yesterday, the same court of appeal had decided to judge the case of journalist Hamid el Mahdaoui, editor of the website Badil.info, separately from his 54 co-defendants, who were sentenced Tuesday. Mahdaoui was prosecuted for “non-denunciation of a crime affecting the internal security of the State.” The court should decide on his fate today at a separate hearing. The court gave sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years in prison for the activists, some of whom were arrested nearly a year ago. Four leaders of the protest movement, including Nasser Zefzafi and Nabil Ahemjik, received 20 years in prison. Following the decision of the court, anger and condemnation have erupted nationwide from journalists, celebrities, and human rights activists on social media as the Casablanca Court of Appeal pronounced heavy sentences Tuesday night for the Hirak Rif activists. In the view of activists, the sentences were unfair for the young protesters, who fought for social equality and denounced the lack of human rights in the Al Hoceima region. The digital society has called the sentences a “dramatic error.” Two protests were staged yesterday evening, in Rabat and Casablanca. Additionally, students in the northern city of Nador protested during the day Wednesday. Protesters, from the youngest to the oldest, chanted anti-government slogans in front of Rabat’s Parliament and in Casablanca’s Place des Nations Unies. Demonstrators held banners or chanted slogans saying “We are all Zefzafi” and “The people want freedom for the activists,” “Freedom, dignity, justice for society,” “Long live the Rif,”  “This country is corrupt,” and “Mourning.” The Hirak protests began after the death of the local fishmonger, Mouhcine Fikri, who was crushed to death in a garbage truck in October 2016 while attempting to retrieve his goods that authorities had confiscated. The death of Fikri angered Moroccan citizens, especially people in the Al Hoceima province, who condemned the situation and the social disparities in the region. Throughout the protests, law enforcement arrested more than 400 Hirak activists for their participation in “unauthorized demonstrations,” on charges of “undermining the internal security of the state.”

Rabat – The harsh sentences imposed by Casablanca’s Court on Moroccan activists is making international headlines. The French Foreign Affairs Ministry has criticized the verdict, emphasizing that the French government “is committed to respect public freedoms.” Following the sentencing, the spokesperson of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Agnes von der Muhll, said, “We have taken cognizance of the sentences pronounced in the context of the trial of the protesters of the Moroccan Rif Hirak.” The spokesperson made her remarks in a press conference held on Wednesday, June 27. The French official also recognized that her country is aware of the economic situation in the Rif, where France carries out  “cooperation actions with Moroccan authorities, through the French Development Agency, for the benefit of the population of this region.”  Casablanca’s Court of Appeals handed down sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years in prison for a group of activists who were jailed for participating in “unauthorized protests” and for “undermining the internal security of the country.” Leaders of the protests, including Nabil Ahamjik, Nasser Zefzafi, and Ouassim Boustati, were given 20 years. International NGO Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemned the heavy sentences, calling for the immediate release of the journalists who were detained in the protests, which started in October 2016 after the death of local fishmonger Mouhcine Fikri.  Protests continued until 2017, and another round of demonstrations began yesterday to condemn the sentences given to Moroccan activists. RSF denounced the conviction of Moroccan journalists, who received up to five years in prison. “After eight months of trial, the six Moroccan journalists Mohamed Al Asrihi, Rabii Ablak, Abdelali Houd, El Idrissi Houssein, Foued Essaidi and Jawad Al Sabiry were sentenced by the Court of Appeal of Casablanca, June 27, 2018, up to five years in prison for covering the Hirak du Rif,” wrote RSF. RSF noted that journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui, who was arrested in July 2017 for giving a speech at Place Mohammed VI in Al Hoceima encouraging them to join a banned protest, will be tried in court Thursday, June 28.

Rabat- Hirak Rif journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui’s lawyer has denied rumors that El Mahdaoui was sentenced to five years in prison, saying that a verdict in his case has not yet been reached.  El Mehdaoui’s trial started Thursday afternoon. After sentencing Hirak Rif activists up to 20 years in prison on Tuesday night, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals has decided to try El Mahdaoui separately on Thursday for “inciting participation in a banned protest” and “threatening national security.” Mahdaoui has been accused of engaging in suspicious phone calls with an individual residing in the Netherlands. El Mahdaoui’s lawyer, Lahbib Hajji, said in a statement to Moroccan news outlet Lakome, that the rumors about Mahdaoui receiving five years in prison were fake. For its part, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has called for the immediate release of six journalists in the name of journalism freedom and expressed relief that the court had decided to separate El Mahdaoui’s trial from the rest of the activists’, who already received heavy charges. RSF previously said that El Mahdaoui, a journalist on the news site Badil, was merely doing his job before Al Hoceima authorities arrested him.  El Mahdaoui gave a speech to a crowd gathered at Place Mohammed VI in the Riffian city of Al Hoceima encouraging them to take part in the July 20, 2017 protest which had been banned by the government. He was arrested later that same day. The journalist said in the speech: “The continuous detention of activists is an aggression against us…the state might be strong but we are stronger with the fact that our cause is just.” Commenting on El Mahdaoui’s choice of words at the time, the public prosecutor stated that it was “incompatible with journalism as a profession dealing with collecting information and facts or investigating about them in a professional way in order to write or make media material.” On Tuesday, Hirak leaders Zefzafi and Ahemjik, and activists Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid, were sentenced to 20 years in prison after being held awaiting trial and verdict for over a year. Zakaria Adehchour, Mohamed Haki, and Mohamed Bouhenouch received 15 years in prison, whereas Mohamed Jelloul, Karim Amghar, Salah Lackham, Omar Bouharass, Bilal Ahaddad, Jamal Bouhaddou, and Achraf Yakhloufi were sentenced to 10 years. Others were sentenced to 1-5 years. In reaction to the court’s decision, many Moroccan citizens across the country rallied on Wednesday to call for the liberty of the Hirak activists. A peaceful demonstration took place near Parliament in Rabat’s Mohammed V street on the same day when dozens of people joined together carrying banners reading “Mourning” and “Long live the Rif,” while chanting “We are all Zefzafi.” Many university students in the capital of the Rif region, Nador, also went on a march to decry the sentences and even decided to boycott university exams in protest. Citizens also took to the Boulevard El Oumame Al Moutahida in Casablanca. The Hirak protests began in October 2016 after the death of Mouhcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck as he was trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities in Al Hoceima. 

The incident caused citizens across the country, especially in the Al Hoceima province, to protest nationwide to condemn Fikri’s death and social disparities in Morocco.

Rabat- After all the frustration and public fervor that marked Morocco’s Group B World Cup performance in Russia, another question is now preoccupying Morocco’s footballing conversation: Will Hervé Renard retain his position as coach of the national team? Morocco’s early exit from the ongoing FIFA World Cup has received a wide range of interpretations both within and without Morocco. Whereas some say that failing to beat Iran was an avoidable mistake that then culminated in the team’s disappointing exit from the tournament, others are adamant that Renard’s side played well but was unlucky. But for all the frustration and disappointment brought by a very early exit from the World Cup to a football-loving nation with high expectations that had not participated in the tournament since 1998, there is a consensus that the team’s performance and mentality have vastly improved since Renard signed with the national squad in 2016.  Before Germany’s shocking exit yesterday, some pundits had said Morocco is the best team to have failed to reach the knockout stages, reflecting the cohesion and sporting spirit that Renard’s men displayed. Sensing the fuss surrounding Renard’s future with the Atlas Lions, Fouzi Lekjaa, president of the  Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), took the initiative to “exclusively speak to the national coach,” according to Al Ahdath Al Maghribia.  Thanking the Frenchman for his team’s performance in Russia, the FRMF president reportedly reiterated his trust in Renard, saying that the Moroccan public liked and appreciated what he and his men showed in Russia. Quoting sources close to the FRMF, Al Ahdath Maghribia noted that the final decision regarding Renard’s future with the Atlas Lions will be reached by early July.  According to the Casablanca-based outlet, Renard’s future is “an urgent issue for Moroccan football,” especially as other countries—Egypt and Algeria, for example—are keen to call on Renard to coach their national sides. Kheireddine Zetchi, the president of the Algerian Football Federation, is said to have made public Algeria’s interest in signing the French tactician. Among Moroccan players, the general mood is that Renard should stay. Players say they are happy with his coaching style and his approach to the game. “He must stay. He should not go,” said midfielder Mbark Boussoufa. Boussoufa added: “The coach has done a remarkable job, and he should be allowed to continue what he started two years ago.” Hervé Renard has not yet made any public statement regarding his future with the Atlas Lions following the team’s World Cup performance. He has said he would make an announcement at the appropriate time.  Sources close to the Frenchman have, however, been quoted as saying that Renard is attached to Moroccan football and is willing to renew his commitment to “complete his mission.”

Rabat – The Minister of Agriculture, Sea Fisheries, Rural Development, Water, and Forests, Aziz Akhannouch, has discussed preparations for Eid Al Adha with Mohamed Karimine, the president of the Interprofessional Federation of Red Meat (Fiviar). The meeting, which took place Tuesday in Rabat, was attended by several organizations, including the National Office for Food Safety (ONSSA) and the National Agricultural Advisory Board (ONCA). The meeting is part of the kingdom’s preparation operation for the sacrificial Eid, when thousands of sheep and goats will be slaughtered for the holy day. The objective of the meeting was to ensure better animal traceability and transparency in commercial transactions. The meeting was an opportunity to check the progress of the operation. Previously, ONSSA had run a registration campaign of the breeding and fattening processes. Fiviar is currently in charge of the identification operation through the free installation of a special “Eid Al Adha” tag for the livestock destined to be sacrificed. All of these parts of the Eid operation, supported by ONCA services and the regional services of the Department of Agriculture, are strongly mobilized to carry out large-scale awareness-raising actions to ensure that farmers and breeders adhere to the program. The Rabat meeting also aimed to coordinate the actions of the different stakeholders, to ensure quality to the consumer. All necessary measures have been taken and any failure or non-compliance with quality requirements of any link in the chain will cause all stakeholders to be severely punished.

Rabat – Ahmed Zefzafi, the father of Moroccan activist Nasser Zefzafi, has spoken about the heavy sentences given to Hirak Rif protesters on Tuesday night. In a statement to Spanish news outlet El Pais, Ahmed said he was grateful for people who stood against the verdicts and heavy sentences of the Casablanca Court of Appeals. The court pronounced a total of 260 years of imprisonment for the 54 convicted activists. Nasser Zefzafi, as well as three others, received the court’s harshest sentence of 20 years in prison. Sarcastically criticizing the sentences, Ahmed said: “I am very happy because I live in a country of joy.” Ahmed added that he does not “care about anything as long as we have the support of all the Moroccan people.” Surprised by the sentences, Ahmed said that “even in the era of Franco, there were no such sentences,” referring to Spanish general Francisco Franco, who ruled Spain from 1939 to 1975. After his brief statements, Ahmed said that “it is better” for him to remain silent. On Wednesday, the families of the activists visited them in the Oukacha Prison in Casablanca. Angry about the decision of the court, the parents shed tears and consoled each other, holding out hope that after the appeal the court will review the sentences given to their relatives. The activists’ defense team has ten days to appeal the court’s sentences. Said Benhemmani, a member of the activists’ defense team, criticized the sentencing, emphasizing that the team was “surprised by these convictions … [the] sentences are very severe. We have ten days to appeal. We will first consult with our clients before making any decision.” The activists were found guilty of several heavy charges, including participation in unauthorized demonstrations, which broke out in the northern Al Hoceima province between 2016 and 2017.

Rabat – Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez highlighted Morocco’s “strategic” role in fighting irregular immigration before the Congress of Deputies on Wednesday. Morocco has made a “decisive and effective” contribution to minimize the impact of the humanitarian tragedy of irregular immigration, said Sanchez, at a session to inform deputies of Spain’s position at the upcoming European Council meeting.  The meeting is scheduled for Thursday and Friday in Brussels. He added that Spain will receive more funds from the European Union (EU) to strengthen its dialogue and cooperation with countries of origin and transit of irregular immigration. Sanchez stressed that certain countries collaborating in the management of migratory flows towards Europe—including Morocco—also require more funds to address this phenomenon.

Rabat – The UN International Conference on Jerusalem, which kicked off Tuesday in Rabat,  was an opportunity for Morocco to reiterate its firm determination, support, and solidarity with Palestine. In the opening ceremony, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita read King Mohammed VI’s letter before the attendees of the fifth conference on Jerusalem. The King reassured Palestinians that Morocco will spare no effort to help Palestinian people regain their inalienable rights. The monarch said that this year’s event is different from previous ones, noting “serious developments, referring to the decision of the US administration to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to move its embassy to the area. “We, in Morocco, immediately rejected this step and considered it to be incompatible with international law and with the relevant Security Council resolutions,” said the King. The King also recalled his letters to US President Donald Trump and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to denounce the US decision, emphasizing the importance of the historical status of Jerusalem. Realism can end conflict The King said the conflict has lasted for “too long, causing a great deal of sorrow and pain? it has caused and is still causing far too many innocent victims and has ruined many opportunities not only for development, but also for a free safe life for many generations.” The King then called on the international community to make all efforts to reach a plan that would help end the decades-long conflict. “This should be achieved through an orderly process based on a realistic vision and a specific timeline, using the existing frame of reference to which the parties concerned would commit in a serious, proactive and responsible manner.”  Tense situation  The sovereign noted the “lack of political prospects in the Palestinian Israeli conflict, is the main reason for the tense situations that lead to acts of mutual violence and excessive use of force by the Israeli occupation forces.” The tension, according to the King, could be seen in protests throughout the “Great March of Return at the Gaza border, which were of a peaceful, symbolic nature.” The King also denounced the Israeli crackdown on demonstrations, rejecting “dangerous Israeli behavior which is incompatible with international law.” The symposium, which will continue until June 26, is being co-organized by the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People (CEIRPP) and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The event, which is convening international political experts, is taking place under the theme “The Question of Jerusalem after 50 years of Occupation and 25 years of the Oslo Accords.”

By Chase Lacy Rabat- On Tuesday, US Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL (ISIS) Brett McGurk met Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita in a coalition meeting to discuss defeating ISIS. The coalition previously met in Kuwait in February this year; in Morocco they seek to reaffirm their commitments against the terrorist group.  The meeting’s program focused on eradicating the extremist group in Iraq and Syria, countering its global networks, halting its financing, providing a counter message, and curbing recruitment.  “Within the framework of the evolution of the strategy of Daesh [ISIS], Africa is among the most targeted zones,” said Bourita, calling for cooperation amongst African states and the global coalition.  Bourita noted that, excluding Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan, Africa suffers the greatest number of militant attacks and that the continent has a lot to learn from the global coalition’s efforts against ISIS.  McGurk said, “We are particularly grateful to Morocco’s leadership and its contributions” and that Morocco had achieved “much progress in its efforts to erase the terrorist organization and thwart its influence in many parts of the world, including Africa.”  Morocco through the years has cracked down strongly on terrorist cells recruiting and planning attacks in the kingdom and abroad.  McGurk noted that there were 52 delegations, including 24 from Africa, in attendance at the meeting in Skhirat near Rabat. With the addition of the Republic of Guinea and CEN-SAD (the community of the Sahel-Saharan States), coalition membership has increased to 77 countries. The presidential envoy also announced that the coalition will spend USD 90 million on the stabilization of Raqqa.  The meeting comes in the aftermath of ISIS losing swaths of territory recently since their rapid offensive that swept across Syria and Iraq in 2014. With ISIS losing ground in Iraq and Syria, the coalition can further concentrate on rooting out the extremist militant group from the other branches of its global network, of which Africa is a major region.

Rabat – The Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF) is looking for a reasonable explanation from FIFA regarding the alleged unfair refereeing against Morocco’s Atlas Lions during their participation in the 2018 World Cup. BeIN Sports journalist Julien Chaput announced FRMF’s decision on his Twitter yesterday. “The Moroccan Federation decides to seize the @FIFAcom and asks for explanations on the referring errors of which the Moroccan selection was victim.” To back its arguments, FRMF is expected to address several videos to FIFA. La Fédération Marocaine décide de saisir la @FIFAcom et demande des explications sur les erreurs d’arbitrage dont la sélection marocaine a été victime. A l’appui plusieurs vidéos ont été transmises au dossier ! #MAR #CM2018 @beinsports_FR — Julien Chaput (@Julienchaps) June 27, 2018  Morocco’s performance during the first round of the World Cup received loud applause worldwide, with footballers and journalists criticizing FIFA and the absence of video assisted referee (VAR) in favor of Morocco in the competition. In its two latest games, Morocco’s football team was shocked as the referees denied them a set of penalties that could have qualified them for the next round. On June 25, the referees awarded an equalizer to Spain, even though the corner-kick preceding the final goal of the match should have been played from the right side. International media, including Le Parisien, heavily criticized the refereeing during the game. In the Portugal-Morocco game on June 20, the referee refused to use VAR three times as Portuguese footballers committed obvious mistakes that could have resulted in penalty kicks for Morocco. After the game, FIFA issued a statement to deny that Mark Geiger, the US referee in Morocco- Portugal game, was biased towards Portugal, saying the referee acted in “an exemplary and professional manner as an appointed match official.” FIFA also rejected claims made by Moroccan footballer Nordin Amrabat that the US referee asked for “the shirt of the captain of Portugal” during the game. FRMF has not issued any statement to condemn the referee’s mistakes yet. However, French journalists wrote anti-FIFA statements condemning the failure to use VARin the games. Herve Penot of the French football outlet L’Equipe took to his Twitter to denounce the unfavorable refereeing against Morocco in both games. “The referees have a concern with Morocco or there was a will to see Spain and Portugal” in the next phase of the tournament, wrote Penot.

Rabat- For Thursday’s government council meeting, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Otmani will lead discussions regarding “dangerous dog breeds” deemed to threaten the safety of humans. The council will examine the draft decree concerning dangerous dog breeds based on their aggressive and morphological characteristics.  Dogs such as pitbulls will be added to a list prohibited from being imported or tamed, for the sake of security. The breed-specific legislation, passed in August 2013, seeks to “protect people against the danger of dogs” and clamp down on the owners of aggressive dog breeds. Any violation of the law can incur a penalty of up to five years in prison and fines of up to MAD 50,000.  The law was Morocco’s first legislation seeking to tackle the problem of people being bitten by dogs.

Rabat – After causing public uproar with his controversial statements on African-American history and his endorsement of President Trump, the American rapper Kanye West has finally opened up to the New York Times about what led him to make the bold moves. In an extended interview with New York Times pop critic Jon Caramanica, Kanye spoke about his personal challenges, including suicidal thoughts, his experience with bipolar disorder, and the many problems his Trump and slavery comments created within his entourage. “There were people who said Trump would never win. I’m talking about the it-will-never-happens of the world, people in high school told you that things would never happen,” Kanye said, hinting at the comment he’d made before that Trump was like him: an outside-the-box person. Kanye told the Times that his sympathy for Trump is engrained in the belief that Trump challenges received ideas. Donald Trump represented for Kanye a figure of autonomy, courage, and dissent. He believes that Trump embodies anti-establishment thinking and “intellectual courage.” Escaping the ‘mob-thought’ To endorse Trump sounded to Kanye like a liberation from society’s expectations. He said he has always wanted to live defiantly, to be a rebel against established norms and opinions, and live only according to his own choices. Supporting Trump made that sound possible, as the pair shared “dragon energy,” something Kanye described as steadiness and courage in espousing values and opinions that can cause hostility and public uproar. “I felt like I knew many people who voted for Trump that were celebrities that were scared to say that they like him. But they told me, and I liked him, and I’m not scared to say what I like. Let me come over here and get in this fight with you,” he said. “I was living inside of some universe that was created by the mob-thought, and I had lost who I was, so that’s when I was in the sunken place.” However, on the slavery comments and Trump’s “Muslim ban,” the rapper expressed mixed feelings. “No, I don’t agree with all of his policies,” Kanye defended himself, as he explained that loving or supporting somebody does not equate total agreement with them on everything they do. “I said the idea of sitting in something for 400 hundred years sounds—sounds— like a choice to me, I never said its a choice. I never said slavery itself—like being shackled in chains—was a choice,” he said. Will fans remain loyal? Asked whether he feared that the fans he has angered may boycott him at some point, he said: “It’s not going to happen…. [Fans] got a bunch of different opinions. You’re not always going to agree, but they’re not going to leave.” But what about the expectations that society and family have of a “successful Black man”? Does Kanye ever feel the urge to be representative, to speak for a specific group of people, and be a spokesperson for a cause? “We need to be able to be in situations where you can be irresponsible,” he said. “That’s one of the great privileges of an artist. An artist should be irresponsible in a way—a 3-year-old.”

Rabat – The introduction of video assistant referee (VAR) technology in the 2018 World Cup in Russia was intended to eliminate controversy and criticism over refereeing decisions.  However, the new technology service has not only brought severe criticism and even protest against referees’ decisions, but against the way in which this service was used as well. As has been seen during many matches of the 2018 World Cup, VAR has often been consulted when major teams stood to gain against smaller teams. While France was awarded a penalty in its opening match against Australia after the referee had consulted VAR, Iceland thought VAR should have been used to award them a penalty in their game against Argentina. VAR was again employed when Peru was awarded a penalty in their match against Denmark. As for the match of Portugal against Iran, the referee awarded a penalty for the Portuguese after Cristiano Ronaldo fell inside the penalty area. Again, the referee had decided to resort to VAR. Iran was fortunate that Cristiano missed the awarded penalty kick, thanks to the Iranian goalkeeper. In contrast, VAR was not used when Ronaldo appeared to elbow Morteza Pouraliganji, the Iranian player, escaping a red card as a result. In response to this, Iran’s coach Carlos Quieroz said in a news conference “Elbow is a red card in the rules, the rule doesn’t say if it’s Messi or Ronaldo.”  VAR not used for Morocco VAR was not used in Morocco’s favor. The Atlas Lions strongly protested that their referees did not use VAR, which was one of the main reasons they were eliminated from the World Cup in Russia. This was demonstrated Morocco-Portugal game, where the Moroccan team suffered a great injustice of not being given two clear penalties, after the referee refused to resort to VAR, claiming that his radio, which is connected with the VAR room in Moscow, was not properly working. Then in the Spain-Morocco game on Monday, VAR was employed in the last five minutes to rule that Spain’s Iago Aspas had not been offside, allowing the equalizing goal.  On the other hand, the VAR team did not see that a ball kicked by Spain’s Rodrigo Moreno had crossed the goal line before touching Ghanem Saiss’ foot. The action should have awarded a goal kick to Morocco. Instead, the corner was awarded to Spain, but played from the other side without any inference from the linesman.  In addition, there was a handball by Spain’s Gerard Piqué in the penalty area that was not whistled.  Morocco’s team protested when Piqué launched a two-footed tackle to dispossess Morocco’s Khalid Boutaib. Again, there was no interference from the VAR control room or any reaction from the referee to ask for their assistance.  Mohamed Aboutrika, sports analyst for beIN Sports channel commented on the match: “The Moroccan national team was subjected to injustice by not resorting to VAR in their match against Spanish team.” “VAR is forbidden to the Moroccan team in 2018 World Cup in Russia. There is something that suggests that this is intentional,” he added. VAR “is useful only for major teams and it’s not fair.” Morocco’s midfielder Youssef Naciri said in an interview with beIN, “The video technique is used whenever they [VAR control room] want. We had the right to be awarded three penalty kicks, but they refused to use the video technique. But when the other team asked for the VAR assistance, they responded to it.” Football teams may not be treated the same way when it comes to using VAR. The injustice Morocco suffered because VAR was not used was seen as racial, and the Atlas Lions could have qualified for the next round if it was used for them.  FIFA is required to interfere if there was prejudice in the choice of when to use VAR for Morocco in the first round of the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The referee leading the match between Morocco and Portugal should be punished for not awarding two penalties especially since he was near the two incidents which could have changed the match final result. According to FIFA, VAR assists the referee to determine whether there was an infringement that would disqualify a goal. “As the ball has crossed the line, play is interrupted so there is no direct impact on the game.” VAR does not make any decisions. It supports the referee in the decision-making process, and the final decision can only be made by the referee.  When is VAR used? The main incidents that have been identified as game-changing by FIFA are:  Despite the benefits of VAR used in the 2018 World Cup in Russia, this video technique has been strongly criticized for being consulted in favor of major teams against smaller ones. Refusing the use of VAR when the Moroccan team was in strong need of it has led to a state of anger among fans, describing this as an injustice and biased against the Atlas Lions.

By Anna Schaeffer Rabat- What Trump has called a “watered-down” version of his original 2017 executive order affects nationals from Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen, and Somalia as well as Venezuela and North Korea. The Supreme Court’s majority decision defers to presidential power, stating that the law “entrusts to the President whether and when to suspend entry, whose entry to suspend, for how long, and on what conditions.” This is the third manifestation of the “Muslim ban” that Trump promised in his presidential campaign; after issuing the Department of Homeland Security to comprehensively evaluate the compliance of information and risk assessment baseline of every nation. Shortly after assuming office he signed Executive Order No. 13769: “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.” For 90 days, nationals from seven countries—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen—faced suspension from travel to the US. After a district court issued an order temporarily blocking the ban, Trump followed with a new executive order, restricting entry for each previously suspended country except Iraq. Courts in Maryland and Hawaii challenged this action. Trump responded with the third similar executive order. In September  2017, the president issued a proclamation entitled “Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats.”  For Iran, North Korea, and Syria, nations that “do not cooperate with the United States in identifying security risks,” all nationals, except those seeking nonimmigrant student and exchange-visitor visas face suspension. The ban restricts all nationals from Libya and Yemen seeking immigrant visas and nonimmigrant business or tourist visas.  Somalia “was found to present special risk factors,” although it meets standards otherwise.  The ban suspends all nationals seeking immigrant visas and demands greater scrutiny for those seeking nonimmigrant visas. Venezuela’s ban, by far the least restrictive, limits only specific government officials and their families.  Chad, originally on the list of undesirable nations, “sufficiently improved its practices” for the president to lift restrictions. The Supreme Court’s decision offers Chad as an example of a continuous process of observation and modification by the Department of Homeland Security, which will report suggestions for restrictions to the president every 180 days. Plaintiffs challenging the proclamation in court were the State of Hawaii, three individual citizens whose foreign relatives are affected by the suspension, and the Muslim Association of Hawaii. They argued that the ban violates the US First Amendment’s  prohibition on establishing a religion and the Immigration and Nationality Act, except as applied to North Korea and Venezuela. While the four justices in the minority offered dissenting opinions, majority Justice Thomas concurred. Dismissing the grounds of anti-Muslim discrimination as “unpersuasive,” he argued that because the “alleged religious discrimination” within the proclamation is directed at “aliens abroad,” the plaintiffs cannot dispute the order with the First Amendment. Justice Breyer, one of the dissenting justices, was joined by Justice Kagan in his written opinion that evidence exists to “support the view that the Government excludes [Muslims] for reasons based upon their religion.” Breyer cited one example of a child in Yemen with cerebral palsy, whose application to enter the US required a circuitous and ambiguous process. “Doctors said she would not survive in Yemen. Her visa application was denied… Though this is but one incident and the child was admitted after considerable international attention in this case, it provides yet more reason to believe that waivers are not being processed in an ordinary way.” Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ginsburg, dissented as well. She repudiated the “repackaging” of Trump’s original “Muslim ban” rhetoric and said the majority decision “leaves undisturbed a policy first advertised openly and unequivocally as a ‘total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States’ because the policy now masquerades behind a facade of national-security concerns.” Citing various quotes by Trump and his advisers, Sotomayor addressed the discriminatory attitude towards Islam displayed by the president in past statements; one example is his declaration that “we’re having problems with the Muslims, and we’re having problems with the Muslims coming into the country.” According to a key adviser of Trump, “When [Donald Trump] first announced it, he said, ‘Muslim ban.’ He called me up. He said, ‘Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.’” Sotomayor concluded her dissenting opinion with a focus on religious discrimination: “Our Constitution demands, and our country deserves, a Judiciary willing to hold the coordinate branches to account when they defy our most sacred legal commitments.” US Attorney General Jeff Session called the decision “a great victory for the safety and security of all Americans” and “critical to ensuring the continued authority of President Trump — and all future presidents — to protect the American people.” Protecting the American people is the rhetoric used by Trump to justify the controversial proclamation. “In this era of worldwide terrorism and extremist movements bent on harming innocent civilians, we must properly vet those coming into our country,” Trump said. “As long as I am President, I will defend the sovereignty, safety, and security of the American People, and fight for an immigration system that serves the national interests of the United States and its citizens. Our country will always be safe, secure and protected on my watch.” Supreme Court analyst Stephen Vladeck agreed the result was a victory for the White House. “The Supreme Court has reaffirmed the President’s sweeping statutory authority when it comes to deciding who may and who may not travel to the United States,” he said. “Authority that both President Trump and future presidents will surely rely upon to justify more aggressive immigration restrictions.” John Bellinger, who served under the Bush administration, said, “It’s still a pig, but the administration has put just enough lipstick on it for it to look pretty for five of the nine justices.” The first Muslim elected to the US Congress, Keith Ellison, stated that upholding the ban gives “legitimacy to discrimination and Islamophobia.” Civil Rights Director for the Washington chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Jasmin Samy, expressed disappointment as well. “The Muslim ban in itself impacts negatively the community that lives here. So, people don’t see the rhetoric that’s happening because of the Muslim ban.” Protesters across the United States gathered in streets with posters reading, “Say No To Scapegoating Muslims” and “No Hate, No Fear, No Ban.” Some posters read, “We are all immigrants!” and “ALL Religions Welcome Here.” Democratic House of Representative Leader Nancy Pelosi predicted that the ban will backfire as a “recruiting tool” for terrorists.  “The President’s disdain for our values and the safety of the American people has led him to undermine relationships with critical allies, embrace autocrats and dictators, launch damaging trade wars and sow fear in our communities with his hateful, ugly language,” Pelosi said.  “Whether tearing children from their parents at the border or advancing a ban founded on open bigotry, President Trump is making our nation less safe at home and less respected abroad.” The ban is currently in effect and will remain essentially as law.

By Safaa Kasraoui and Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat- Protesters, from the youngest to the oldest, chanted anti-government slogans in front of Morocco’s parliament on Wednesday evening to condemn the heavy sentences given to Hirak Rif activists on Tuesday night. Demonstrators held banners or chanted slogans saying “We are all Zefzafi” and “The people want freedom for the activists,” “Freedom, dignity, justice for society,” “Long live the Rif,”  “This country is corrupt,” and “Mourning.”

The court sentenced four activists to 20 years in prison for participating in “unauthorized protests,” and for “undermining the internal security of the country.” Moroccans and non-Moroccans alike joined together in front of Parliament, next to which security forces stood to ensure the safety of civilians during the peaceful protest. An Iraqi citizen who participated in the protest told Morocco World News that although he felt that he did not have the right to comment on this internal issue, he believed that the sentences were a “step backward” for the country’s social progress. He added: “These sentences will not enable the government to mitigate the situation.” The protester said that the government should review the sentences as soon as possible to avoid further escalation. Some protesters carried Amazigh (Berber) flags in the demonstration.
 Two women attending the protests voiced their opinion that the convictions against Hirak Rif activists are “unjust” and “unjustified.” The sentences are “unjust and unfair for the youth who took to the streets in peaceful demonstrations for social demands,” human rights activist Jabri Abdelilah told MWN. Emotions evident on her face, a young protester told MWN that the sentences were an “unfair” move.  Rabat’s demonstration was not the first in the kingdom on Wednesday. In the morning of the same day many university students in the capital of the Rif region, Nador, went on a march to decry the sentences. The students have also decided to boycott university exams in reaction to the court’s decision. Citizens also took to the streets of Boulevard El Oumame Al Moutahida in Casablanca. Along with the Hirak’s leaders Zefzafi and Ahemjik, activists Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid were also sentenced to 20 years in prison after being held awaiting trial and verdict for over a year. Zakaria Adehchour, Mohamed Haki, and Mohamed Bouhenouch received 15 years in prison, whereas Mohamed Jelloul, Karim Amghar, Salah Lackham, Omar Bouharass, Bilal Ahaddad, Jamal Bouhaddou, and Achraf Yakhloufi were sentenced to 10 years. Others were sentenced to 1-5 years. The Hirak protests began in October 2016 after the death of Mouhcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck as he was trying to save his goods that was confiscated by authorities in Al Hoceima. The incident caused citizens across the country, especially in the Al Hoceima province, to protest nationwide to condemn Fikri’s death and social disparities in Morocco. The protests were confronted by a heavy security response as law enforcement arrested more than 400 Hirak activists, most of whom received heavy sentences, ranging from 20 to 1 year. Protesters await the reaction of the government to their demands: freedom for all the detained activists and what they have described in the protests as “equal social justice.” The sentences have also been condemned by politicians, celebrities, and journalists. Former Minister of Urbing Planning and Housing Mohamed Nabil Benabdallah, who was sacked for “dysfunctions” in the project called “Al Hoceima Manarat Al Mutawasit,” also  condemned the decision of Casablanca’s court. The project was launched by King Mohammed VI to develop the Al Hoceima province in 2015. After problems in the implementation of the projects, the King sacked several authorities, including Former Minister of Health, Houcine El Ouardi, and Mohamed Hassad, former Minister of Education, who also served as former Minister of Interior in the government led by Abdelilah Benkirane.

By Intissar Faouzi Rabat- Two protests are scheduled today, in Rabat and Casablanca, to denounce the harsh sentences pronounced against Hirak activists. The sentences handed down Tuesday night by the judges of the Criminal Division of the Casablanca Court of Appeals against 54 Hirak leaders ranged from 1 to 20 years in prison. No activists were acquitted. Moroccan activists expressed their anger on their social media accounts, calling for justice. As a result, they organized protests today, June 27, to make their voices heard. The first protest will be organized by activists from Rabat in front of the Parliament, starting at 6 p.m. under the slogan “They were arrested for us, let’s fight for them.” The second will also take place today in Casablanca’s Place des Nations Unies (United Nations Square) starting at 7 p.m. On the Casablanca protest’s Facebook event, organizers wrote, “We thought we would not relive the years of lead [authoritarianism in the Rif region], and that we would no longer experience human rights violations. We were expecting that the state would finally think about cities and marginalized areas of the country but there is apparently no happy ending, the verdicts pronounced against the detainees of Hirak show the reality of justice in Morocco.” The court’s sentences have caused a big controversy. Many associative, cultural, and activist actors did not hesitate to express their indignation. The activists, including Nasser Zefzafi, were arrested for conspiracy against the security of the state after protesting conditions in Al Hoceima in 2016 and 2017. The protests began after the death of Mouhcine Fikri, a local fishmonger working in the informal economy. He was crushed to death in a garbage truck in October 2016 while attempting to retrieve goods that authorities had confiscated. The incident resulted in many protests in Al Hoceima and the surrounding areas. Chanting social slogans, the protesters decried social disparities in the region.

Sweden and Mexico, also in Group F, each have 6 points. The group stage exit is the first of its kind for the Germans since 1938.

On Tuesday night, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals sentenced Zefzafi and Ahemjik, along with activists Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid, to 20 years in prison after being held awaiting trial and verdict for over a year.

Rabat – Fiat subsidiary Magneti Marelli officially launched the construction of its automotive production plant in Tangier on Tuesday. The plant is located in the Tanger Automotive City Free Zone, allowing it to benefit from various tax breaks. Morocco’s Minister of Trade and Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy attended the ceremony along with CEO of Magneti Marelli Pietro Gorlier and Chairman for the Supervisory Board of the Tangier-Mediterranean Special Agency Med Fouad Brini. A statement published by the Moroccan Ministry of Industry, Investment, and Digital Economy said on Tuesday that the plant will cost MAD 405 million and will create 500 job opportunities. The project forms part of an agreement between the Moroccan ministry and the Italian company in 2017. The plant, which will cover an area of approximately 20,000 square meters, is expected to be operational by 2019. The project seeks to provide services for the company’s customers in Morocco and in southern Europe: Spain, Italy, and Turkey Elalamy welcomed the project, emphasizing that “with this industrial project, a new business is developing in Morocco and the national automotive sector gains in integration.” He added that the company’s project will also benefit local suppliers, from whom the Tangier plant will order materials. The ceremony also marked the signing of an investment agreement for the construction of a second unit dedicated to the production of lighting systems, electronic systems, and pedals. Elalamy and Gorlier signed the deal. This new project will cost an estimated MAD 312 million and will create 200 additional jobs, according to the statement. Commenting on Morocco’s industrial strategy, Elalamy expressed his satisfaction, saying that “we are delighted  that the current dynamics of our automotive industry and the Kingdom’s strong position in this sector have led the Magneti Marelli Group to expand its business in Morocco.”

By Sarah Goodman and Zoubida Senoussi Rabat – French Montana set the tone during a press conference he held on Tuesday, June 26, conducting it in Arabic. Addressing journalists at Rabat’s Villa des Arts, he discussed his concert, cracked jokes, shared his influences, and expressed his pride in returning home.  Montana, whose given name is Karim Kharbouch, flew to Morocco to perform on Saturday, June 23, in Rabat’s ongoing Mawazine Festival. After arriving to the press conference an hour late, he reflected on his performance at the festival: “I loved it. I was so proud to see so many Moroccans attending my concert.” According to Montana, 100,000 Moroccans appeared to hear him last Saturday.  100 thousand Morroccans that look just like me came out to show love ?? I love y’all !! ?? A post shared by  French Montana (@frenchmontana) on Jun 23, 2018 at 5:21pm PDT  Montana specifically cited “feel[ing] like being part of the Arabic success,” adding that Arab rappers account for “only a small community” in the global hip-hop forum. “I just loved being a Moroccan guy who left his home at 13 to make the best music possible,” said Montana.  The Moroccan celebrity went on, discussing his musical background and deep ties to the “raî” (Algerian folk) music of his childhood, citing Cheb Hasni as his biggest influence, as well as Cheb Khaled, the iconic Franco-Algerian singer.  “I have been listening to Cheb Hasni since I was 10. It is part of my music influences,” said the 33 year-old artist, who closed his show with raî music at the OLM Souissi stage. Born in Casablanca, Kharbouch emphasized keeping in touch with his roots in Morocco. “I am still an Aroubi (country man),” he joked when asked about becoming a naturalized United States’ citizen. Later, when asked about the policy of US President Donald Trump toward the country’s immigrants, he quipped “That’s why I did everything to get my papers, so he would not kick me out!” which earned laughs from the journalists seated. French Montana received a tricky question when a journalist asked him about his booking fee for the show. She asked the superstar why he did not donate his concert’s money to Moroccan associations like the Emerati singer Ahlam Alshamsi promised to do after her show.  “I spent more money coming to Morocco than I have earned to perform in Mawazine. I spent 50 million and I don’t need to justify myself in front of the journalists,” he insisted. “I always give back to the Moroccan community, I have helped a lot of people.”  French Montana engages in many philanthropic projects across Morocco and across the continent more broadly. In February this year, Montana pledged philanthropic support for Morocco’s education system. He continues his work with the PanAfrican Movement and CARE Morocco, which ensure that the children of Casablanca have full access to a quality education and healthcare.

Rabat – Anger and condemnation have erupted nationwide from journalists, celebrities, and human rights activists on social media as the Casablanca Court of Appeal pronounced heavy sentences Tuesday night for the Hirak Rif activists.  The court gave sentences ranging from 20 years to 1 year in prison for the activists, some of whom were arrested nearly a year ago. After condemning FIFA for “unjust refereeing,” Moroccan social media users and activists shifted their focus to criticize the justice system in Morocco, criticizing the heavy sentences towards Hirak Rif activists. In the view of activists, the sentences for the young protesters were unfair, who fought for social equality and denounced the lack of human rights in the Al Hoceima region.  The digital society has called the sentences a “dramatic error.” A journalist and former editor in chief of Moroccan news outlet Telquel, Driss Ksikes, strongly condemned the verdict, emphasizing that “the convictions of the Rifi activists brought the Moroccan autocracy back to a time of trivialized and globalized repression and injustice.”
 Four leaders of the protest movement, including Nasser Zefzafi, received 20 years in prison while others received sentences between 1 and 15 years in addition to fines of MAD 2,000. A Moroccan analyst and journalist at Moroccan television channel 2M, Abdellah Tourabi, tweeted that “the heavy sentences against Hirak Rif are a historical mistake that we are going to pay for as a nation and citizens.” ??????? ??????? ???? ???? ?? ?? ????? ???? ????? ?? ??? ?????? ? ????? ???? ????? ???? ? ???? . — A Tourabi (@Atourabi) June 26, 2018  Moroccan activist, professor, and head of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU) Nabila Mounib shared her opinion in a video posted on her official Facebook page. The Moroccan politician condemned “the complete absence of an independent judiciary” and the lack of accountability in the country.  She also denounced the security’s approach and repression of the detained activists. The politician then called for their freedom. 
Former Minister of Urban Planning and Housing Nabil Benabdellah also took to his Facebook page to criticize the heavy sentences against Hirak Rif detainees. 
Benabdellah, who is also the head of the Party of Progress and Socialism Party (PPS), wrote on his Facebook today:“We strongly hope that all possible legal and judicial review of this file will be realized in order to inject the necessary democracy into the national political life.”   Sports journalist Said El ABadi wrote “in the space of 24 hours, the pride of the Moroccan people for their national team and their support has given way to disappointment for justice …” En l’espace de 24h, la fierté du peuple marocain pour son équipe nationale et ses supporters a laissé place au dépit pour sa justice… #Hirak — Said El Abadi (@Selabadi) June 26, 2018  Moroccan political activist and MP Omar Balafrej expressed anger in three (Arabic) words on his Twitter, saying “just arrest us all.” ??? ????? ?????? — omarbalafrej (@omarbalafrej) June 27, 2018  Citizens also took to their social media accounts to decry the sentences against the activists. “Imagine getting 20 years in prison just because you were asking for basic human rights for your people… i am ashamed of our goverment (sic)  #Zefzafi #Hirak,” wrote a Twitter user. Imagine getting 20 years in prison just because you were asking for basic human rights for your people… i am ashamed of our goverment #Zefzafi #Hirak — sana (@riffianprincess) June 27, 2018  “Morocco, a place where a football injustice gets more reactions and outrage than actual injustice and lack of human rights. #hirak,” said another. “Last night, the verdict has been announced: 20 to 1 year of prison for young people who invested their time and energy, risked their lives and faced the state’s machinery of oppression. For a better Morocco. For “dignity, freedom and social justice”. 
We are mourning!” Last night, the verdict has been announced: 20 to 1 year of prison for young people who invested their time and energy, risked their lives and faced the state’s machinery of oppression. For a better Morocco. For “dignity, freedom and social justice”.
We are mourning!
#Hirak — Uness Eagle (@younessfatati) June 27, 2018  Online activists created a Facebook page, calling on a protest against the sentences in front of Parliament in Rabat today, Wednesday,  at 6:00 p.m. More than 1,200 Facebook users marked themselves as “going” to the protest, while 10,000 marked themselves as “interested.” Citizens are also expected to organize a sit-in in Casablanca. The social protests began after the death of the local fishmonger, Mouhcine Fikri, who was crushed dramatically to death in a garbage truck in October 2016 while attempting to retrieve his goods that authorities had confiscated. The death of Fikri angered Moroccan citizens, especially people in the Al Hoceima province who condemned the situation and the social disparities in the region. Throughout the protests, the law enforcement arrested more than 400 Hirak activists for their participation in “unauthorized demonstrations,” on charges of “undermining the internal security of the state.” The May 2017 arrest of the leader of the social protest, Zefzafi, seriously escalated the situation, with citizens in the Al Hoceima province organizing further protests to condemn the security crackdown. After nearly 80 trials and frequent postponements, the court gave heavy sentences to Zefzafi and other detained activists.

By Chase Lacy Rabat- Today Qatar is presenting its case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against a year-long land, sea, and air blockade imposed by Saudi Arabia and its allies. However only UAE will be present of the anti-Qatar quartet that also includes Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bahrain.  Qatar argues that the UAE has violated the human rights of Qatari and Emirati citizens by deporting Qataris, restricting their travel, and prohibiting Emiratis from entering Qatar, separating families, and denying companies and individuals access to their properties and even medical care.  According to Al-Jazeera’s Neave Barker, Qatar accuses the UAE of violating the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). The UAE has signed the convention; however, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bahrain are not signatories.  Article 1 of the convention states “racial discrimination” shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.” Qatar hopes the ICJ will order the UAE to comply with the CERD and pay reparations of an undisclosed amount.  Qatar has been under blockade by the quartet of Arab countries since June 5, 2017. Saudi Arabia and their allies called on Qatar to accept a 13-point list of demands to end the blockade.   The quartet’s demands include the immediate closure of Al-Jazeera and other news networks, reduction of ties with Iran, the severing of ties with “terrorist” organizations, removal of the Turkish military, reparations, handing over files on Qatari contact with the political oppositions in their countries, and monthly audits.   Qatar views the blockade as an attempt by the Gulf powers and Egypt to punish them for pursuing an independent foreign policy.

Rabat- The Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General for Western Sahara Horst Köhler met Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita on Wednesday and will meet Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani on Thursday. During his visit to Rabat, Köhler will hold talks with El Othmani in Rabat before heading to Dakhla and Smara in Western Sahara to examine socio-economic development in the region. Köhler will also visit MINURSO headquarters in Laayoune to monitor the ceasefire agreement, violated by the Polisario front in recent months. Bourita received Köhler on Wednesday, when they held a meeting regarding the Sahara issue, addressing Morocco’s autonomy plan to find a fair solution for the conflict.  Köhler’s visit to  Morocco’s capital city is a part of his 10-day tour to Western Sahara, June 23-July 1. His Western Sahara tour is to deepen his “understanding of the reality on the ground, and discuss how to move forward in the UN-led political process, in accordance with Security Council Resolution 2414,” according to UN Spokesman Farhan Haq. The resolution extended the mandate of MINURSO’s mission until October 31, 2018, and called for a “realistic, practicable and enduring” political solution. It also urged Algeria to contribute to finding a solution for the four-decade-long conflict over Western Sahara. Köhler has visited Mauritania and southern Algeria where he met Polisario representatives in the Tindouf camps. The Polisario Front carried out a parade on May 20 east of Morocco’s defense wall to celebrate the “45th anniversary of its armed struggle,” symbolizing a violation of the resolution just a few weeks after its adoption. Morocco strongly condemned the destabilizing maneuver, which once more defied the 1991 ceasefire agreement between Morocco and Polisario and Resolution 2414.

By Intissar Faouzi Rabat- Emirati singer Ahlam Alshamsi has announced that she will donate everything she receives for her performance at the Mawazine Festival to a Moroccan hospital in solidarity with the ongoing boycott campaign. After Moroccans launched a campaign in late April to boycott three major companies selling dairy, bottled water, and fuel, in response to increased prices, some called for the  Mawazine Festival to be boycotted as well. Alshamsi, a judge on the Arab version of The Voice and Arab Idol, has come under criticism from Moroccans who have accused her of hypocrisy and not loving Moroccan people.  In response, Alshamsi said on her social network pages that she sympathizes with the demands expressed by a number of Moroccans to boycott the Mawazine Festival, but she cannot refuse any invitation to meet her Moroccan audience. Furthermore, she said, Mawazine is a cultural and humanitarian festival that encourages tourism in Morocco. Alshamsi wrote on her Instagram account “I am participating with you in this campaign by giving my payment as a donation to one of the hospitals in Morocco. My participation is a support and a declaration of sincerity and love that I carry for you, to meet the Moroccan public is the real gain that I can receive #mawazine.” Alshamsi will perform on the final day of the 17th Mawazine Festival, Saturday, June 30, on the Nahda stage. ???? ???? : ?????? ?????? ???? ????? ?? ?????? …?? ????? ???? ?????? ???????? ???? ?? ?? ??????? ????? ?????? ???? ????? ?? ?????? ???? ?????? ?????? ???? ?? ?? ?????? ??????? ?? ?????? … ???? ?????? ????? ???? #?????? ????? ??? ????? ???????? ??????? ?? ???? ?? ???? ?? ???? ???? ?? ???? ???? ?????? ?? ?????? ????????? ??????? ?? ???? ????? ????????? ??????? ?????? ???????? ??????? ?????? ??????? ????? ??????? ?? ????? ??????? ?? ?????? ???? ??? ??? ??????? ??????? ???? ?????? ????? ???? ?????? ???? ???? .. ??? ??? ????? ???? ???????? ?? ???? ??????? ?? ?????? ???? ??? ???????? ?? ??? ????? ??? ???? ????? ???????? ??????? ?????? ?? ????? ??????? ???? ????????.. ?????? ???? ???? ????? ??? ????????? ???? ????? ??????? ??????? ?? ????? ??????? ??? ????? ????? ?????? ???? ?????? ????? ?????? / ??????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ????? ?? ????? … ????????? ?????? ?????? ?????? … ??? ?? ??? ????? ??? ??????? ????? ?? ????? ????? ????? ????? ?? ?????? ??? ?????? ????? ????? ????? ????? ???? ?? ?????? ????? ??? ?????? … ??? ?????? ????? ?? ???? ????? ???? #?????? #mawazine #??????_?????? ????????????????????????????????? ??? ???? ????? ??????? ???? ?????? ??????? ??????? ?? ?????? ??????? ???? ????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ???? ?

Rabat – While many football pundits have called Spain’s 92nd minute equalizer against Morocco a “VAR goal,” French outlet Le Parisien has reported that the discussion on Spain’s goal should focus on the buildup that led to the goal.  With the final whistle blow of the dramatic 2-2 match between Morocco and Spain, many people said Spain’s second goal was another example of “VAR-bias,” pointing to a real or perceived inequality in the use of the system to ensure that “weak teams” are out of the World Cup. No offside, but wrong corner Le Parisien agrees that Ravshan Irmatov, the Uzbek referee of the Spain-Morocco match, committed a refereeing error in Monday’s Morocco-Spain match. The French outlet, however, says that VAR got it right when it decided that Spain’s Aspas was not offside. So where was the refereeing error? Why should have the goal been called off? “While the VAR system rightly ruled that Aspas was not offside on the action that led to his equalizer for Spain, the problem occurred seconds prior to the goal,” Le Parisien wrote, explaining that La Roja, as Spain’s national squad is known, “took advantage of the referee’s moment of low focus to score a controversial goal.” The corner-kick that led to the goal should have been played from the right side, Le Parisien argued. It pointed out that, according to FIFA regulations, a corner-kick should be played from the side nearest to the spot from where it is conceded. The article strongly criticized the referee, saying that he allowed Spain to distract him, as he pointed to the right side while granting the corner-kick, but did not stop the game when Spain played the ball from the left corner. “Iago Aspas was alone and unmarked because Moroccan players positioned themselves expecting the ball from the right corner, where the referee had rightly pointed.” VAR applies to goal buildup An essential principle of the use of VAR is that referees and their assistants should always consult VAR if they are unsure of an important decision regarding “the validity of a goal, a penalty kick, a red card,” or for identifying a hidden foul, and the player who committed it. But, Le Parisien maintained, “since the VAR regulations also say that a referee can consult VAR to examine the buildup to a goal,” Irmatov should have consulted the video system before granting Spain their equalizer. Hervé Renard, who also noticed the glaring irregularity in the buildup, said after the match: “So we line up to expect the ball from the right and Spanish players play it from the left! Is that allowed? I sincerely cannot tell. But if that is not allowed, it was surely a huge refereeing mistake.”

By Dana Leger Rabat – At the opening of the Fifth International Conference on Jerusalem in Rabat, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has delivered King Mohammed VI’s statement on the challenges in Jerusalem in light of recent developments.  The conference, which opened Tuesday, June 26, is jointly hosted by the UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People (CEIRPP) and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Morocco upholds Palestinian rights The King’s letter condemned the US’ decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem on May 14 and to declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel.  “The American decision is a step outside the bounds of international legitimacy; it undermines the frame of reference set by the relevant resolutions, diminishes the stature of the United Nations and puts security and stability at risk in the region and beyond.” The King pledged “Morocco’s full solidarity and its strong commitment to exert all possible efforts to rally international support to uphold the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to an independent State, with East Al-Quds [Jerusalem] as its capital.” The letter said narrow-minded perceptions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, coupled with misleading ideas and actions, have intensified an already complex issue.  A need for binding international resolutions The King went on to tell of the peaceful demonstrations of the Great March of Return at the Gaza border in which, “Israeli occupation forces reacted to them by firing live bullets directly at the demonstrators, killing dozens and wounding hundreds of unarmed Palestinian civilians.” King Mohammed VI concluded his letter with, “I believe Al-Quds needs greater rallying of diplomatic efforts to secure binding international resolutions that protect the city and safeguard its spiritual, cultural and legal character. It also needs action on the ground to promote development in social and humanitarian fields to help Palestinians resist policies of displacement, eviction and expulsion applied against them.” The opening was attended by Mohammad Shtayyeh, Palestinian Minister of Public Works and Housing; Miroslav Jen?a, UN Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs; Fodé Seck, representative of CEIRPP; and Samir Bakr, representative of OIC. The conference will continue until June 28 and is held under the theme “The Question of Jerusalem after 50 years of Occupation and 25 years of the Oslo Accords.”  In the following days, the event will include discussions from Palestinian, Israeli, and international experts on East Jerusalem. It will also provide a platform for youth from East Jerusalem to voice their concerns to the international community and for participants to identify actionable solutions to the challenges confronting the youth.

Rabat – Niska and Damso’s catchy songs entertained the OLM Souissi crowd all night. Two of France’s most successful rappers have succeeded in performing their brilliant rap on Monday, June 25, on the fourth day of Mawazine Festival Rhythms of the World. The French rapper Niska started the show with his famous song “Freestyle PSG”, in front of a crowd in trance, who came together to dance the famous “Charo dance.” In his very unique and easily recognizable voice, Niska continued to delight the public with several hits, including “B.O.C.,” “H &amp; M,” and “Versus,” produced in collaboration with the “Prince of the Afro Trap” MHD. Niska has also interpreted his titles “Medellin,” “Love X,” “Salé,” “Favélas,” “Commando,” “La Wewer,” “J’suis dans la baye,” “Tuba life,”—produced with the famous rapper Booba—and “Hunting man,” taking his young audience into a frenzy with his music, that sometimes takes the color of African sounds. Before a conquered audience, Niska closed his concert with his famous hit “Résaux,” thrilling his fans who enthusiastically sang along with “Pouloulou,” before sharing an intimate moment with the public, listening to the Moroccan national anthem. The Belgian rapper Damso then gratified the hysterical crowd with his “Kietu,” before continuing with his numerous titles “Periscope,” “Lové,” “Report,” “NJ Respect R,” and the famous “Macarena” hit song.   The Belgian rapper was faithful to his style that stands out with raw lyrics, sometimes tinged with a certain verbal violence and inspired mainly by his personal experience. He also knew how to touch his audience with his sensitivity, through deep melancholic expressions, captivating sweetness, and endearing romance. The Belgian rapper, who sang a capella at some points, caught the attention of the public, who never ceased to sing the furiously fascinating words. At only 24, Stanislas Dinga Pinto, aka Niska, is one of the most talented rappers of the moment. He rose to fame thanks to his collaboration with Maître Gims on the song “Sapés comme jamais,” released in August 2015. His hit single “Réseaux” won the title of the France’s summer 2017 hit, hoisting him to the top spot of France’s Top Single, Top Shazam, Top Youtube, and Top Streaming. A true star of this new wave of French rappers, Damso, whose real name is William Kalubi, was first spotted by French rapper Booba. He then joined the collective and label 92i and signed at Universal. The rapper released his first album “Low Battery” in 2016, which is certified platinum. His second album Ipséité, released in 2017, was a great success in France and Belgium, and is certified quadruple platinum disc in France and platinum record in Belgium.

Rabat – Dutch football club Ajax has recognized its responsibility for providing “inadequate” medical treatment for Moroccan footballer Abdelhak Nouri after he collapsed on the field during a match in 2017. Ajax general manager Edwin van der Sar expressed regret for the club’s insufficient medical treatment of Nouri during a friendly game against Germany’s Werder Bremen. The collapse caused the 21-year old footballer a permanent brain injury. Quoted by British news outlet the Guardian, van der Sar said in a press conference: “We recognize our responsibility and liability for the consequences of this.” He added that the club had been “convinced” that the footballer received proper care on the pitch. Back in January, Dutch media revealed that Nouri’s collapse was caused by heart rhythm problems. According to Dutch daily NRC Handelsblad, tests conducted in April 2014 by Ajax revealed the presence of a heart disorder in the Dutch-Moroccan footballer. The incident shocked his family, friends, teammates, and club, leading international footballers to show solidarity and support with the youngster. The CEO of Ajax, former Manchester United star van der Sar, described the news as “terrible.” “We feel enormously for his parents, siblings and other relatives,” van der Sar said. “The blow is also difficult for Ajax,” he said in October 2017. The young footballer was one of the most talented young players in the Netherlands. He started his youth career in 2005 at the age of 7 and played for the Netherlands Under 15, Under 16, Under 17,  Under 18, and Under 19 categories.

Rabat – The judge of Casablanca’s Appeal Court has pronounced sentences against detained Hirak Rif activists. Two leaders of the protest movement, Nasser Zefzafi and Nabil Ahemjik, received 20 years in prison. The court gave the heavy sentences against the activists on Tuesday night. Activist Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid also received 20 years in prison, while Zakaria  Adehchour, Mohamed Haki, and Mohamed Bouhenouch received 15 years in prison. Mohamed Jelloul, Karim Amghar, Salah Lackham, Omar Bouharass, Bilal Ahaddad, Jamal Bouhaddou, and Achraf Yakhloufi have all received 10 years in prison. Those sentenced to 5 years in prison and a fine of MAD 2,000 are Mohamed El Majjaoui, Chakir Makhrout, Rabii Ablak, Ilyass Hajji, Souleimane Fahili, Mohamed Asrihi, Lahbib Hannoudi, Abdelali Houd, Ibrahim Abakoui, and Houcine El Idrissi. The court sentenced to 3 years in prison Ibrahim Bouziane, Othmane Bouziane, Youssef Hamdioui, Mohammed Enaimi, and Mohamed El Hadi. Rachid Aamarouch, Abdellatif El Mousaoui, Youssef Fadel, Jawad Sabiri, Abdelmouhcine Atari, Jamal Mouna, and Abdelaziz Khali received a sentence of 2 years and a fine of MAD 2,000. Zakaria Kadouri was sentenced to 1 year in prison and a fine of MAD 2,000. Said Benhemmani, a member of the activists’ defense team, criticized the sentencing, emphasizing that the team was “surprised by these convictions, … sentences are very severe. We have ten days to appeal. We will first consult with our clients before making any decision.” The activists were found guilty of several heavy charges, including participation in unauthorized demonstrations which broke out in the northern Al Hoceima province between 2016 and 2017. Others were prosecuted for “undermining the internal security of the state,” and “preparing a conspiracy against internal security.”  The protests began after the death of Mouhcine Fikri, a local fishmonger working in the informal economy. He was crushed to death in a garbage truck in October 2016 while attempting to retrieve goods that authorities had confiscated. The incident resulted in many protests in Al Hoceima and the surrounding areas. Chanting social slogans, the protesters decried social disparities in the region. To respond to the Rif demonstrations, King Mohammed VI tasked Driss Jettou, First President of the Court of Auditors, to present him with a report regarding the delay of royal development projects in Al Hoceima. Subsequently, King Mohammed VI fired several ministers, including Mohamed Hassad, former Minister of Education; El Houssaine El Ouardi, former Minister of Health; and Mohammed Nabil Benabdellah, former Minister of National Planning, Urban Planning, and Housing.

Here follows the full text of the speech that was read by Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita: “Praise be to God May peace and blessings be upon The Prophet, His Kith and Kin Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, I should like to welcome to the Kingdom of Morocco all the participants in this Fifth International Conference on Al-Quds, which Rabat is proud to host. First of all, I wish to reaffirm our strong commitment to the Palestinian cause as well as our unwavering support and full solidarity with our Palestinian brothers in keeping with the irreversible pledge Morocco has made to maintain its support until the Palestinian people regain their inalienable rights. The latter derive their legitimacy from international law, from facts on the ground and from historical evidence. This session is very different from previous ones. It is taking place in a context marked by serious developments, namely the decision by the United States of America to recognize Al-Quds as the capital of Israel and to move its embassy there, which it did officially on 14 May 2018. We, in Morocco, immediately rejected this step and considered it to be incompatible with international law and with the relevant Security Council resolutions. As Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee, I foresaw that decision and therefore wrote to the President of the United States, Mr. Donald Trump, and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. António Guterres. In my letters, I emphasized that any modification of the legal, political or historical status of Al-Quds would have serious repercussions on peace in the region and would undermine international efforts to create an environment conducive to the resumption of peace negotiations with a view to finding a just, comprehensive solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. I also informed my brother President Mahmoud Abbas that we reject the American decision and assured him of Morocco’s full solidarity and its strong commitment to exert all possible efforts to rally international support to uphold the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to an independent State, with East Al-Quds as its capital. Ladies and Gentlemen, The American decision is a step outside the bounds of international legitimacy; it undermines the frame of reference set by the relevant resolutions, diminishes the stature of the United Nations and puts security and stability at risk in the region and beyond. Given the serious, disturbing developments which followed the American decision, I consider that the resolve shown to hold this session as planned attests to international awareness of the importance of overcoming all difficulties still hindering the settlement of this conflict. It also shows there is still hope of finding a way to achieve that settlement. Ladies and Gentlemen, There are a number of misconceptions regarding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It has been feeding on false, misleading ideas and has been governed by narrow-minded perceptions. All of that has made it a difficult, complex issue. Nevertheless, it is still possible to address it as a mere conflict which can be brought to an end, rather than as an inevitable destiny. This is a conflict that can be resolved if delusions and nostalgia for the past are abandoned, and provided a sense of realism and confidence in the future prevail. What is required, therefore, is a rational approach to history through the unleashing of a constructive dynamic that charts the way forward towards a better future; what is needed is a break with negative, destructive ideas that take their proponents one step back. This conflict has lasted for far too long, causing a great deal of sorrow and pain. It has caused and is still causing far too many innocent victims and has ruined many opportunities not only for development, but also for a free and safe life for many generations. It has also created deeper rifts and divisions within the international community. What is even more serious is that the longer the conflict is allowed to go unresolved, the more difficult and complicated a settlement will become, and the greater and more disastrous the impact will be on the region and the world. The duration of the conflict and the state of political stalemate it has been in since 2014 should not lead to apathy or indifference; nor should the stalemate lead to negative attitudes or unjust decisions that deepen the feelings of frustration and resentment among the Palestinians, plunging them into situations conducive to radicalism and despair. In view of the above, the international community is duty-bound today to pool efforts at a faster pace so as to put the issue on the table with a view to reaching a negotiated, safe and fair settlement. This should be achieved through an orderly process based on a realistic vision and a specific timeline, using the existing frame of reference to which the parties concerned would commit in a serious, proactive and responsible manner. The influential global powers, particularly the United States of America, and dominant regional countries, should each play their role in a responsible, equitable manner in their respective sphere of influence. Ladies and Gentlemen, The lack of political prospects in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict – which is compounded by unilateral decisions and practices the Palestinians find provocative – is the main reason for the tense situations that lead to acts of mutual violence and to the excessive use of force by the Israeli occupation forces. This tension was clearly felt in the demonstrations which were held during the Great March of Return at the Gaza border and which were of a peaceful, symbolic nature. The Israeli occupation forces reacted to them by firing live bullets directly at the demonstrators, killing dozens and wounding hundreds of unarmed Palestinian civilians. The Kingdom of Morocco immediately condemned and rejected this dangerous Israeli behavior which is incompatible with international law. Morocco also expressed deep sorrow at the tragic events which exacerbate human suffering among our Palestinian brothers. As I was keen to help alleviate this suffering and demonstrate our concrete solidarity with our Palestinian brothers on the ground, during the holy month of Ramadan I launched a humanitarian initiative, which I supervised personally. It concerned the Gaza Strip and was later extended to Al-Quds Al-Sharif and Ramallah. We have also set up a field hospital in the Gaza Strip, managed by the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces. It covers a range of medical specialties, including pediatrics, orthopedics, gastroenterology, ophthalmology and ear, nose and throat conditions. Ladies and Gentlemen, Many symposia and conferences have been held on Al-Quds. These are praiseworthy, welcome initiatives, so long as such events are based on solid foundations, their intent is sincere and they serve the cause, either through solidarity, insight and supportive stances, or through realistic, constructive recommendations. However, I believe Al-Quds needs greater rallying of diplomatic efforts to secure binding international resolutions that protect the City and safeguard its spiritual, cultural and legal character. It also needs action on the ground to promote development in social and humanitarian fields to help Palestinians resist policies of displacement, eviction and expulsion applied against them. This is the approach I have adopted as Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee through close, regular contacts with the leaders of the influential powers, with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and with the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and also through the continuous action on the ground, carried out, under my guidance and supervision, by Bayt Mal Al-Quds Al-Sharif. This institution has managed to implement many important economic and social projects in the holy city, in such areas as housing, education, health and social affairs as well as care for women, children, young people and groups in precarious situations. Ladies and Gentlemen, Al-Quds needs a realistic, equitable political settlement leading to the determination of the final status, through direct negotiations between the parties concerned based on the existing international frame of reference. The entire international community has a responsibility to shoulder in terms of working to achieve this settlement by putting the peace process back on track, by supervising it and by accompanying the two sides concerned. The issue of Al-Quds does not concern a specific faith, people or country. It is a question that concerns two peoples and two states. Its settlement requires genuine political will, concerted efforts and the involvement of international sponsors, relying on their experience, clout, neutrality and the ability to exert influence. This requires mobilizing the good will of all those concerned, within a unified framework, relying on a balanced collective mechanism that helps both parties to the conflict to abide by international law, international legitimacy and bilateral agreements and understandings, to refrain from predetermining solutions to any of the final status issues, particularly those relating to Al-Quds, refugees and borders, and to pledge to deal with these issues within the framework of final status negotiations. Al-Quds has been and will remain a space for coexistence and tolerance – a collective heritage shared by the followers of the revealed religions. We must all preserve and safeguard it by being purposefully mobilized, exerting sincere efforts and proposing sound ideas. To give concrete substance to this approach, which reflects the importance and universal, symbolic value of Al-Quds, I suggest that the convening of certain sessions of this international conference in countries outside the Arab and Islamic world be considered. I pray that Almighty God grant you success in your efforts to promote peace and security.”

New York– Morocco is experiencing a cultural and economic renaissance that will have a huge benefit for its own population and the wider region. Poised to assume a leadership role in Africa, Morocco has made great strides toward providing medical aid to underserved constituencies, implementing educational reform, creating durable economic development and delivering strategic humanitarian aid. Internal Social and Economic Reforms Morocco’s internal reforms will benefit the country’s development by addressing existing shortcomings directly and forcefully. This head-on an approach is expected to inspire confidence among domestic and foreign investors. For example, the Ministry of Education recently announced a major overhaul of Morocco’s widely criticized educational system. The plan includes constructing nearly 2,000 new classrooms across the country, integrating younger children (enrolling them at the ages of approximately 4-5), targeting children at an early age to learn  reading in Arabic and French, expanding French education, including the use of French language as well as French educational model, revising curricula, expanding school enrollment and granting easier access to education. While the current plan may not address all economic , such as the gaps between rural and urban areas, failure to provide marketable skills, and resolving the issue of overcrowded classrooms,  it will go a long way toward expanding access to Morocco’s formal education system and improving the country’s persistently low literacy rate. Introducing technology in some of the classroom is the beginning of the visible change in that direction. These reforms complement recent efforts to introduce skill-based training for young people. Such training has been launched as part of three humanitarian projects in Kenitra, and Likewise, these ongoing reforms will help the country to embrace innovation and development in other ways. In April, the Penitentiary and Reintegration Agency gathered the nation’s prison guards for a one-day training workshop that focused on preventing torture in Morocco’s prisons. This was a  step toward preventing due process violations and cruelty against inmates, welcomed by the United States and other Western partners. King Mohammed VI also introduced a number of Ramadan initiatives, including the opening of the psycho-social center in the region of Mediouana. The opening of the center is part of a four-year program of local development, and it will also serve the larger goals of increasing access to medical services and improving human development. Other Ramadan projects included inaugurating a training center in Rabat and a mosque in Salé. Meanwhile, Morocco is set to launch its first Integrated Health Project in Zenata, a village located near Casablanca that is home to the country’s largest eco-city. The project, launched in partnership with the Saudi-German Hospital Group, is tasked with building a new hospital in line with the city’s vision. This vision emphasizes the importance of considering human development from a social, economic and environmental perspective. This means using sustainable natural resources while also creating jobs and increasing the community’s access to affordable housing. Other efforts are underway, including major infrastructural improvements in major urban areas like Casablanca, Marrakech and Fez. Will this joint effort be slowed down by the latest tensions between Rabat and Riyadh? Morocco saw Saudi Arabia’s open backing of the United 2026 World Cup bid as nothing short of betrayal, due to the aggressive lobbying of states that would likely have otherwise voted for Morocco. Rather than promoting unity among Arab and Muslim states, the head of Saudi Arabia’s General Sports Authority Federation Turki Al Sheikh, created additional discord by making this effort as much as an effort against Morocco as a bid to appeal to the US president Donald Trump. His motivations? Sheikh was upset with Morocco’s warm relationship with Qatar, and claimed that states (presumably including Morocco) should be looking towards Riyadh. He also tied this move to Morocco’s allegedly insufficient presence with the Arab Coalition in Yemen. The final straw was the throwing of parties for high-level officials of various states with an attempt to persuade them to vote against Morocco. This strong-arming backfired, as Rabat perceived such actions and comments as an attack on its national sovereignty and rights to formulate an independent foreign policy, not just a sports-related backstabbing. As al-Sheikh continues to politicize soccer in a failing effort to make Saudi Arabia’s great, the relationship between the two countries soured. When Saudi Arabia lost the first match of the 2018 World Cup to Russia 5-0, Moroccan fans booed Al Sheikh and spared no effort to underscore his humiliation. Shortly after, Saudi Arabia called a public emergency meeting to discuss an ongoing attempt to retake the port of Hudeidah in Yemen, a strategic port, which is currently held by Iran-backed Houthis. Due to Houthi tactic of forcing civilians into the center of the city where they are likely to fall easy victims to the fighting, this effort is projected to be a humanitarian disaster. Without it, however, Iran will likely to continue using the port to supply advanced weapons into the country. Morocco sent a strong message to Saudi Arabia by being too busy to attend the meeting, scheduled for June 23.. This fallout happened only a few days after the interior ministers of both countries met in Jeddah, and Saudi Arabia reaffirmed its support for Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran and for protection of its national sovereignty and territorial integrity. In light of Al Sheikh’s comments, and lobbying efforts, which revealed themselves to their full extent recently, such affirmations seem at best inconsistent and at worst hypocritical. For that reason, although the two countries had an opportunity to grow closer over a slate of security-related concerns, as well as socioeconomic projects, unless something changes drastically, such efforts may be soon cut short altogether. Some in Moroccan circles are now calling for a complete withdrawal of Moroccan forces from Yemen, and others want to downgrade diplomatic relations between the two countries, which doubtless would not reflect well on the business cooperation either. Morocco, however, is not depenedent on Saudi Arabia for development, and in fact intendes to meet the benchmarks for 2026, putting it in a more competitive position for its 2030 bid, for which Qatar, during a recent phone call with King Mohammed VI, already issues support. This growth in infrastructure is more than just about building new stadiums, and will be sure to benefit various segments of society, besides sports fans. These growth-oriented efforts, which are intended to strengthen the country’s economic core and educational foundation, are part of Morocco’s anti-terrorism strategy, which consists of monitoring mosques for extremism, training imams, and improving social and economic conditions inside the country. To temper extremism in the county, Morocco has also begun training imams in a moderate form of Islam and emphasizing intercultural tolerance and understanding. In doing so, Morocco seeks to create a bulwark against the influence of extremist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and ISIS without resorting to state-backed ideological enforcement, as Iran has done. Morocco Uses Education and Development to Strengthen African Countries against Radicalization However, aside from inoculating its own population against extremist messaging by foreign groups and distortions of Islam by uneducated imams,  Morocco is also leading the charge to prevent interventionism, in the shape of extreme education, conversion efforts, and infrastructure subsidies by Iran, Turkey,  and terrorist organizations across the region. Recently, Morocco and the Congo signed a series of 14 investment agreements in Brazzaville. The agreements came after the First Climate Summit in Brazzaville, which also included Niger, Gabon, and Angola, and during which the two countries reach an understanding with respect to a number of crucial domestic and regional issues. Following Morocco’s reintegration into the African Union, the country has been revamping its image to emphasize its African-ness. King Mohammed VI completed a two-month long tour of Africa, engaging in fruitful visits that led to many further engagements and state visits over the past year. Another recent strategic visit included a Nigerian delegation that came to observe Morocco’s development work in its southern provinces. Nigeria, a Sunni majority country, has suffered under the pressure of jihadist groups. One of them, Boko Haram, has staged a number of mass abductions and suicide attacks in recent years. With Morocco’s help, Nigeria may soon be on track to mobilize education and economic reform as means of protecting its most vulnerable communities from the propaganda of various terrorist organizations, who frequently promise social services in exchange for fealty. Many young Nigerians have joined Morocco’s religions training programs, gaining valuable skills that they can use to help their communities and guard against extremist incursions. Countering Iran and Turkey’s Influence Peddling in Africa However, non-state actors are not the only ones causing destabilization and chaos in developing African countries. Iran has been using armed Shi’a militias to create a state of perpetual warfare and uncertainty in Nigeria and other African countries. At the same time, Iran has made a show of reaching out with “help” in the form of humanitarian aid and ideological influence. Indeed, Iran seems determined to consolidate its hard and soft power across Africa. It has been building Shi’a mosques in West and Central Africa and establishing hospitals, universities and military bases across the continent. Sudan is one of the countries where Iran is looking to create problems for the Saudis, who have been that country’s traditional ally. Creating a Shi’a military contingent in Sudan will not single-handedly ensure the dominance of Tehran’s influence in the country, but it will create additional distractions and will likely lead to local hostilities. In that sense, Iran’s actions will benefit Turkey and Qatar, both of whom have appeared to offer Sudan’s President Omar Bashir additional military and financial aid. Like Morocco, Qatar is looking to develop an independent foreign policy in Africa. For that reason, it finances a number of humanitarian projects in Sudan and elsewhere. And unlike Turkey, which tried to use schools in Morocco to peddle ideological influence, Qatar and Morocco continue taking mutually beneficial steps in upgrading ties in trade, agriculture, and other areas. The reason behind such offers of aid may well be to exacerbate tensions between Sudan, Egypt, and Ethiopia while also distracting Sudan from its relationship with Saudi Arabia, and which indeed irks KSA – which in turn takes out its frustration by attacking Morocco’s relationship with Qatar. These tensions have done nothing to help the local Sudanese population, who is still suffering from massive human rights violations. Rather than enmeshing itself in Middle Eastern conflicts playing themselves out in Africa, Morocco is asserting an independent stand, and focusing on developing positive and constructive relationships which are likely to benefit populations of member states, regardless of other state actors’ geopolitical ambitions. It is in this context that King Mohammed VI’s upcoming visit to Sudan in October will attempt to bring some hope to the troubled country. Sudan has recognized Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara, a thorny issue in Africa. Morocco’s regional rival, Algeria, has embarked on a costly campaign to create discord and promote the Polisario, a separatist group claiming sovereignty for the Sahara, despite Morocco’s historic claims to Western Sahara. This issue is one of the many wedges Algeria has inserted in the African Union, shifting that body’s focus from promoting development, counterterrorism and anticorruption efforts to dealing with the attacks on Morocco by some states. Morocco’s Leadership Role In Africa Brings It Closer to Saudi Arabia for a Common Purpose The dispute over the Sahara took on a sinister undertone after recent revelations that Algeria allowed Iranian intelligence agencies to provide the Polisario with advanced weapons. Satellites captured images of Polisario operatives engaging in illegal maneuvers near the border wall with Morocco. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that members of the Polisario had met with Hezbollah operatives. The Hezbollah operatives visited the Tindouf camps in Algeria and trained the Polisario members in urban guerrilla warfare. As a result of these revelations, Morocco severed its diplomatic relationship with Iran. A diplomatic crisis ensued, during the course of which Algeria denied all knowledge of these activities. Morocco’s Foreign Ministry, however, presented evidence of specific dates, names and meetings to substantiate its claim. It’s unclear how far back Algeria’s dealings with Iran and Hezbollah go. However, it is clear that the involvement of foreign influencers in the long-simmering dispute constitutes a significant change to the status-quo. As a result, the members of the African Union will not only have to contend with Algeria’s direct support for the Polisario, but also with Iran’s involvement and all the attendant international consequences. Sudan’s recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara is an important and hopeful sign. Despite Sudan’s flirtation with foreign investors hostile to Morocco’s interests, such as Turkey, and despite allowing Iran-backed Shi’a militias to operate on its territory, the country may be able to avoid becoming just another pawn in a campaign to destabilize the entire continent. Iran and Turkey’s bellicose moves should be countered on a regional level. Strengthening relations with Morocco, improving the region’s educational outcomes, boosting local economies, and expanding the reach of moderate religious education, would go a long way in achieving that objective. Additionally, it is important to see Morocco’s role as providing support for domestic and regional interests rather than as unnecessarily meddling in local conflicts. During King Mohammed VI’s 2017 trip to South Sudan, for example, he signed nine bilateral treaties. The Moroccan renaissance, which is ultimately a cultural and socioeconomic movement, is capable of rejuvenating even the poorest and most conflicted countries in the region. With Morocco’s leadership, the continent will be able to build strong foundations for the rise of civil society and promote educational and artistic exchange across the region. Morocco likewise recognizes the importance of combining hard and soft power. By doing so, external threats can be prevented from spreading across Africa. Therefore, Morocco recently purchased a contingent of Abrams tanks from the United States, along with jets and other weaponry. These purchases came in response to Algeria’s recent military expenditure. However, Morocco is also looking to form alliances with countries who remain vulnerable to exploitative foreign interference. Most recently, Mauritania summoned the Iranian ambassador to discuss the alleged propagation of Shi’a Islam inside the country, accusing an imam of extreme ideological outreach. As a result, the accused imam was fired. However, Iran disputes the narrative of the course of events, claiming that the meeting with the ambassador was aimed at strengthening bilateral relations. Yet, there is likely more to the story, especially given that summons followed Morocco’s break with Iran and the consequent flurry of diplomatic activity. Mauritania is a particularly vulnerable country, infamous for its corruption and the proliferation of militias and assorted jihadist groups. It is also a country with a history of major human rights abuses, including the ongoing practice of slavery. The Polisario has been implicated in the selling of arms inside Mauritania, which has facilitated the spread of illicit weapons all over the continent. At the same time, Mauritania was one of the countries specifically targeted by Iran’s foreign minister during his 2017 African tour. The minister’s itinerary also included stop-offs in several security-challenged Western African countries, and Morocco’s troubled North African neighbors, Tunisia and Algeria. Iran, meanwhile, has a long history of acting in conjunction with African Hezbollah to sell illegal weaponry in Western and Central Africa, while Mauritania has facilitated the spread of arms and drugs to North Africa. Morocco’s Example Puts Pressure On Iran’s Aggressive Religious Outreach In The Vicinity None of these events should be viewed as coincidental. Mauritania has been a thorn in the region’s side for many years and its connections with the Polisario are well known. However, any ideological support for Iran’s spread of Shi’a-Khomeinist ideology threaten to have devastating consequences for the region’s stability. Saudi Arabia has also been leaning heavily on Mauritania. This pressure has led to deteriorating relations with Iran. Mauritania, a nation long mired in poverty, is seeking to benefit from lucrative deals with Tehran, who has been generously supplying impoverished nations with humanitarian aid in exchange for their loyalty. Iran and Algeria have previously denied any involvement with weaponizing Polisario, while Hezbullah accused Morocco of acting out of KSA’s pressure. Nevertheless, the events have transpired differently. Morocco broke with Iran upon discovering its increased involvement along Morocco’s borders, which constituted a serious threat to Morocco’s territorial integrity. Following the public revelation of Iran’s involvement, the Gulf States – including Saudi Arabia – were supportive of Morocco’s drastic steps to curtail Iran’s influence. Morocco has also publicly revealed the extent of Iran’s ideological influence peddling. Saudi Arabia, who has long been active in countering Tehran’s influence in Africa, understands that Iran’s African outreach threatens a strategically located and highly valuable ally. As a result,, the revelations of Iran’s overstep have enhanced relations between Morocco and Saudi Arabia. After all, regional stability is an issue of mutual interest. Saudi Arabia has also actively attempted to counter Iran’s Shi’a influence in Mauritania. Saudi Arabia’s greater involvement in the region comes in the context of a recent German intelligence report. This report demonstrated that Iran continues to seek technology for the production of weapons of mass destruction. Notably, Tehran has purchased uranium in Africa and has likewise engaged in an arms trade, purchasing illicit technologies in its various spheres of influence. However, the incident with Morocco underscored the clear and present danger of Iran’s hegemonic strategy. This danger threatens local Sunni communities and, therefore, must be understood as more than a simple regional rivalry over resources and primacy. All of this began in 2010, when the president of Mauritania visited Tehran. Since then, conversions to Shi’a Islam have risen dramatically in Mauritania. Many of the country’s new converts have traveled outside the country to spread a form of religious ideology that is friendly to Iran’s regional ambitions. At the same time, Morocco and Saudi Arabia may be looking to provide viable alternatives to Iran’s lucrative deals. Whether or not alternative partnerships will come to fruition remains to be seen; however, Mauritania, until recently, has been happy to milk both cows, and little has been done on a regional scale to attenuate Iran’s ideological outreach. King Mohammed VI’s strategy of strengthening relations with African countries may prove useful in that regard. Morocco Spreads Goodwill to the Middle East, Countering Outreach by Aggressors Finally, Morocco has been active in outreach beyond Africa, looking toward the Middle East. Morocco has accepted a number of Syrian refugees and King Mohammed VI recently sent humanitarian aid to Gaza, Ramallah and East Jerusalem. The aid packages were provided by the king’s charitable foundation and consisted of food, medical aid, blankets and other basic necessities. The significance of this move cannot be underestimated. In demonstrating his support for the Palestinians, the king has also sought to avoid the misuse of financial aid by corrupt third-party agencies, such as the Muslim Brotherhood proxies, or by state actors, such as Iran or Turkey, who have used humanitarian aid to the region as a way of promoting radicalism and further inciting and fueling tensions. By giving directly to the people, King Mohammed VI fulfilled his country’s responsibility while addressing concerns about the limited oversight that can lead to aid being diverted for other purposes. His example is a good model for other governments to follow and will help counter outreach by malevolent parties. Hopefully, Morocco’s leadership will help spearhead social and economic reforms across the region. By bringing together artists and thinkers from all over the world, a better and more prosperous future may be secured for Africa, the Middle East and Europe – the three continents whose cultures and traditions formed Morocco’s diverse and multifaceted identity and which now all stand to benefit from the Moroccan renaissance.

By Intissar Faouzi Rabat – Morocco’s team coach Herve Renard criticized the arbitration in Monday’s 2-2 match between Morocco and Spain, saying that everyone was surprised with the corner that led to Spain’s second equalizer. Speaking after the match, Renard told reporters that the Moroccan national team was determined to beat Spain, despite the presence of big Barcelona and Real Madrid players. At the same time he said, “we must pay tribute to all players of the team for their great performance.”   The coach acknowledged that the World Cup 2018 was a unique opportunity to play with major teams, such as Spain and Portugal. “I think we missed the experience during the first game against Iran, unfortunately, and when you do not score, at least you should not get goals and lose that way,” he said. The French coach showed great respect for the Moroccan audience as well as the “Atlas Lions,” asserting that the sensation of playing the national anthem in Russia, among thousands of Moroccan fans, will remain entrenched in their memory for a long time. In regards to his future with the national football team, Renard  did not give a clear response, saying that “for the moment we must live this participation in all its details, so that the future is thought at a later stage.” “The Moroccan team left the World Cup with honor and pride, after 20 years of absence. It was necessary to cross from such positions to progress in the future, while our hearts are now with Senegal and Nigeria to represent Africa powerfully,” he said. “There were some tactical imbalances from the 20th minute to the end of the first half, with many leaks for the Spanish players, but we corrected the situation in the second half, and we created many problems for the opponent,” he added. Mehdi Benatia was missing from the match because of an injury, and the team captain preferred to sit out the game in order not to affect his performance with his team next season. Renard asserted that the group whom he entered played well. Renard proudly said that the Moroccan national team does not have Cristiano Ronaldo in its side, but they were able to embarrass Spain a lot, and they were close to victory.

Rabat- The 2nd annual Conference of Peace and Security in Africa has convened specialists, policy makers, and academics to discuss the high stakes of peace and security in Africa.   Organized by OCP Policy Center, a leading Moroccan think tank, the June 19 conference aimed to “diagnose” and “propose solutions” to the continent’s most salient issues in terms of political violence, wars, and related instabilities. The conference marked the presence of many distinguished panelists, including Youssef Amrani, Morocco’s Delegate Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation; Miguel Angel Moratinos, former Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister; Mahamat Saleh Annadif, chief of the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali; and the former Foreign Affairs Minister of Chad, among others. Discussing the theme “Peacekeeping Operations in Africa: Realities and Challenges,” panelists gave recommendations to capitalize on available resources to make the continent safer and more peaceful. Although diverse in their backgrounds and perspectives, the majority of the panelists made the case for “the necessity of involving civil society and local populations in peacekeeping missions.” To provide citizens in an unstable or conflict-ridden country with shelters and relative peace, their needs and concerns need to be taken into account, some panelists suggested. Others said that empowering civil society and local human rights advocacy groups may be a more effective means to “conceive a new system of peacekeeping in zones of conflicts.” Such discussions come at a time when Africa is often called the fastest growing continent, reflecting the popular narrative among economists and political commentators that “Africa is Rising.” Without denying that the continent has achieved positive growth in the past decade, the conference suggested that a crucial challenge today is to “reconcile” the economic with the safety aspects to ensure “a growing and peaceful” Africa. They argued that “no economic growth can be attractive to foreign investments and private business if peace and security are not maintained.” According to the panelists, another crucial factor in successful continental peacekeeping is to strike a balance between continental autonomy and external assistance. While it is important that the African continent takes responsibility for its own peacekeeping and security concerns, many specialists who spoke at the conference argued that the “transnational” and “transatlantic” aspects of the challenges require “strong collaboration between national governments, international partners, and international organizations.” Panelists estimated that “the material and immaterial” costs of peacekeeping can only be  covered by a strong tripartite cooperation between the AU, the UN, and the EU. In addition to providing the necessary funds for peacekeeping missions, panelists argued that strong and well-equipped multilateral bodies can also help solve other security-related issues, such as human rights abuses, ethnic cleansing, sexual exploitation in conflict areas. Multilateral bodies can also help guarantee respect for international law by investigating the causes and perpetrators of “crimes against humanity” in the aftermath of peacekeeping interventions.

Rabat – A group of influential French sports journalists did not hesitate to slam the unfair refereeing in the Morocco-Spain and Morocco-Portugal World Cup games. Herve Penot of the French football outlet L’Equipe took to his Twitter to denounce the unfavorable refereeing against Morocco in both games. Je rectifie pour l’arbitrage défavorable vs Maroc : contre le Portugal et contre l’Espagne. Le tacle les deux pieds en avant de Pique, pas un jaune ???? Et l’histoire du corner… Les arbitres ont ils un souci avec le Maroc ou il y avait volonté de voir espagne et Portugal en 8e — Herve Penot (@hpenot_lequipe) June 25, 2018  “The referees have a concern with Morocco or there was a will to see Spain and Portugal” in the next phase of the tournament, wrote Penot. The former director of sports channel Canal+ and former director delegate of beIN Sport, Charles Bietry, agreed. “Now it is clear: the referee is no longer a referee, he’s an auxiliary of a group of technicians hidden 500 km from the match and who will decide as they want, or as they will have been asked, the fate of a match. And yet football remains beautiful,” said the journalist on his Twitter account. French footballer Gregory Coupet commented on Bietry’s ost, saying that he completely agreed. Complètement d’accord ? — Grégory Coupet (@CoupetCoupet) June 25, 2018  For his part, football expert and journalist Didier Roustan praised Morocco’s performance as he expressed regret at seeing the Atlas Lions quit the World Cup field due to referee mistakes. “Beautiful Morocco!!!! Having taking on Spain in that way in a 3rd match as they were already eliminated .. respect.. (even if big regrets against Portugal and this wooden [own] goal at the last minute of the 1st match..)  can be proud, real lions.. from the Atlas,” he said. In its second World Cup game, Morocco was denied three penalties throughout the game after US referee Mark Grieger refused to consult VAR to review the mistakes committed by Portuguese footballers. Referees in yesterday’s game repeated the same plot against Morocco in the Spain clash, which pushed Moroccan football fans to heavily criticize the controverisal use of VAR as unjust and unfair. While the referee denied VAR for Morocco, he awarded an equalizer to Spain in the last minutes of the second half. French news outlet Le Parisien described the referees’ errors as “disastrous.” The awarded equalizer saved Spain’s La Roja team from elimination. Spanish media recognized that without VAR, the Spaniards would have to pack to join the countries that left the World Cup after a tough first round. Spanish football newspapers MARCA and AS published today’s issue with the title “Viva El Var,” thanking the referees for the equalizer that saved Spain. Many football fans and analysts agreed that Morocco deserved to proceed to the second round of the competition for their spectacular performances. In Group B, both Iran and Morocco left the World Cup, with Spain and Portugal staying for the next round.

Rabat- Spanish defender Sergio Ramos said that his team went through “some uncomfortable minutes” during the World Cup’s final Group B game against Morocco on Monday. Although Spain is now leading World Cup Group B, after pulling off a 2-2 equaliser with Morocco in the last minutes of the match, Ramos was not happy about his team being taken on by the Atlas Lions who had been leading the game with a pulsating 2-1 score.  “We progress first in the group, which was the aim, although the game wasn’t good,” he told Spanish national news press, Marca. Morocco has made the giant football team consider self-criticism to improve their performance for their next games in the second round of the World Cup. “It’s a night to self-criticise from the first to the last, we have to change the current feeling, although we don’t have to see it so darkly,” Ramos said. Spain has emerged the Group B winner, having beat Iran 1-0 and tied Portugal 3-3. After the match against Morocco, Spain hopes to deliver a better performance against Russia, another challenging foe. The July 1 match will open the World Cup Round of 16: “Now it’s difficult, hopefully we can play brilliantly against Russia.” Social media users were amazed by Morocco’s surprise goal in the early minutes of the game. Some commentators said it was their best World Cup match.

By Chase Lacy Rabat – The first Eritrean delegation to visit Ethiopia in two decades arrived in Addis Ababa Tuesday morning.  Eritrean Foreign Minister Osman Sale, accompanied by the Eritrean president’s close advisor Yemane Gebreab, were greeted at the airport by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Eritrea, landlocked Ethiopia’s only route to the sea, fought a brutal three-decade war until they gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.  Even though Asmara has maintained a permanent delegation at the African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Eritrea have not held diplomatic relations since 1998. That year conflict fomented once again with a bloody border war that killed 80,000 and displaced hundreds of thousands.  Hostilities were ended by the UN-backed 2000 peace agreement. However, Ethiopia has categorically refused to implement the deal until new reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed rose to power.  Among his proposed reforms are more transparency in governance, the release of thousands of political prisoners arrested in a 2015 crackdown, opening state-owned companies to domestic and foreign investments, unblocking websites and channels, and honoring the 2000 peace agreement with Eritrea.  Earlier this month, Prime Minister Ahmed, speaking to Parliament, said, “We are fully committed to reconcile with our Eritrean brothers and sisters and extend an invitation to the Eritrean government to start dialogue and establish rapport.”  Ahmed’s willingness to fully honor and implement the peace agreement means that Ethiopia will cede disputed border territories, such as the town of Badme, to Eritrea. Actual implementation may face opposition in some areas, such as local residents’ resistance to such a move.  There is widespread hope that restoring ties between the two nations will bring further stability to the region with economic ties and open the authoritarian Eritrean regime to reforms by ending the militarization of the border, the separation of families, and proxy wars

Rabat- Coface has again given Morocco the rating “A4” for credit risk of businesses defaulting, making it among the highest-ranking countries in Africa. Coface (Compagnie Française d’Assurance pour le Commerce Extérieur), a French insurance company for foreign trade, published its country risk and sector risk assessment map for the second quarter of 2018 last week. The assessment comprises 160 countries around the world and is drawn up on the basis of macroeconomic, financial, and political data.  Morocco has again received the “A4” rating, which corresponds to a “reasonable” risk. Alongside Morocco, only Kenya, Botswana, and Mauritius received such a high ranking in Africa. In the MENA region, Morocco joins the United Arab Emirates and Qatar with the same risk ranking. Israel ranked first, with A2, followed by Kuwait ranking A3. Oman was the only country in the MENA region whose rating improved, from C (high risk) to B (fairly high risk). The development is explained by the country’s growth, thanks to a rise in the oil and gas sector and continued moderate growth in other sectors, according to Coface. Coface downgraded Argentina (C), Turkey (C), Sri Lanka (C) and India (B) as well due to their dynamic internal demand favoring imports, political tensions, and the deterioration of their trade balance. Coface is considered to be a trustworthy reference in credit insurance, risk management, and the global economy. It operates globally, offering companies solutions to protect them against the risk of financial default of their clients. The company’s services and solutions protect and help companies to make credit decisions to improve their ability to sell on both their domestic and export markets. Coface estimates the average credit risk in a country’s businesses. The assessment map is an invaluable tool, giving an indication of a country’s potential influence on businesses’ financial commitments.  Coface’s analyses use an eight-level ranking order of risk from A1 (very low) to E (extreme).

Rabat – The Moroccan campaign against high commodity prices has led the CEO of the boycotted dairy company Centrale Danone, Emmanuel Faber, to personally come to Morocco and address the major consequences of the boycott on his company. In a one-minute video, Faber said that he has been following the case closely since the boycott began April 26, and expressed his regret as the company has operated in Morocco for decades. In his message, the Frenchman called the boycott of the 59-year-old company “major.” “For  all of the people who chose to not buy the Centrale Danone brand, I would like to say that I totally respect your choice despite my profound regret.” The CEO of the company recognized that the boycott against a “brand like Centrale Danone is a strong message,” which led him to come to Morocco to understand the situation. “Even if I was following the situation closely, I decided to come personally to listen and meet with consumers, youth, shoppers, representatives of the employees, our teams and farmers,” he said. He added that his visit aims to listen to the message of Moroccans and understand it to change the situation. Faber’s message came nearly a month after the General Director of Centrale Danone campaign shared the consequences of the boycott on the company. “It makes me sad because the situation has damaging consequences for the company and the country.” Lamblin added that the company “spared no efforts” to reconcile with customers during the holy month of Ramadan. In the first half of 2018, the company suffered a net loss of MAD 150 million.  Centrale Danone said it had made a profit of MAD 56 million in the same period last year.

Rabat- The Atlas Lions delivered an unforgettable final match against Spain Monday evening, and Moroccans could not be more proud of their national team’s performance. Although the Atlas Lions were eliminated from the 2018 World Cup tournament, their last game against Spain did not disappoint, and many wished to see more of the team in the tournament.  Throughout the match and after it had ended, social media users expressed their pride in the Lions: “So proud of you guys. Thank you for 3 amazing matches with 2 of the most powerful teams.” one Twitter user said. So proud of you guys ??? Thank you for 3 amazing matches with 2 of the most powerful teams.

Hashtags like #shame_on_you_fifa and #var_is_bull[****], quoting Nordin Amrabat, emerged to denounce FIFA’s controversial VAR use. We love you #Amrabat ??

They took on the team and led the match  1-0 14 minutes into the game, making Spain worry, only for the European giant to finish the game with a 2-2 equaliser. MOROCCO TAKE THE LEAD OVER SPAIN!

By Anna Schaeffer and Emily Hodge Rabat – Streets emptied in Rabat as locals gathered around any available screen broadcasting the nailbiter match. Usually bursting with hustle and bustle, this intersection boasted only one motorbike driver. All along the medina’s once-crowded avenues stood throngs of fans, attention fixed on Morocco’s forward Khalid Boutaib after a beautiful first goal of the game. In a local gym, every athlete yelled at the moment Morocco scored, weights and jump ropes laying forgotten on the floor. Indoor and outdoor segments of this Rabat cafe have, respectively, better vantage points of specific television screens. An observer in the open-air patio focuses on the ball’s movement towards Spain’s goalie. The indoor crowd collectively gasps as Morocco’s forward Youssef En-Nesyri approaches the goal and…scores! A moment of joy as the crowd reacts to En-Nesyri’s “goooaalllll!” The stress and anticipation of football tie together Moroccan fans like family blood; as young men walk the medina (the market in the walled city), the game captivates and draws strangers into one collective body. Other shops, namely those lacking television screens, sit vacated. This shop’s owner abandoned his place in search of a glimpse at Morocco’s final World Cup game. The face of frustration after a well-placed kick by Spain. Emotions rose and fell with gusto as men in this restaurant physically turned their bodies away from the match during painful moments, only to return with greater hope a moment later. Loyalty to the team prevented them from spending longer than a few seconds gazing anywhere but at the screen. It was a bitter end to an exactingly close match. The referee’s use of the video assistant referee (VAR) awarded a late goal to Spain, and fans across Rabat shook heads and shook hands before entering into lively conversation, reliving the high points of the match.  Said a young fan who shares his first name with Moroccan football star Mehdi Benatia, “I’m proud of us. I’m proud of Morocco.”

By Chase Lacy Rabat- The Libyan National Army, commanded by renegade General Khalifa Haftar, is handing over the Sidra and Ras Lanuf oil terminals to Libya’s eastern government’s National Oil Corporation (NOC).  The transfer is regarded as “illegal” by the NOC of the internationally recognized government based in Tripoli, in western Libya. The head of the Benghazi NOC, Faraj Said, said they are preparing to issue instructions for oil companies to begin operations.  However, there is serious uncertainty about who will buy the oil produced under the eastern government’s control. In 2015, the eastern government, based in Tobruk 150 kilometers from Egypt, failed in an attempt to sell 300,000 barrels. No buyers, banks, or insurers were willing to conduct business with the Benghazi NOC, due to the legal risk of cooperating with an unrecognized government. The UN Security Council and Western powers have passed resolutions that recognize the Tripoli NOC as the sole entity that can market and sell Libyan oil.  Ahmed Mismari, spokesman of the LNA, said on television, “All the oil terminals controlled by LNA are being handed over to the National Oil Corporation dependent on the provisional government that is headed by Faraj al-Hassi.”  Mismari also said that no tankers may dock at eastern ports without the permission of the NOC entity in Benghazi. He cited the transfer of the ports to the NOC as a measure to prevent the funding of militias. Mismari specifically called out “Chadian mercenaries” as some of the fighters that purportedly fought alongside Ibrahim Jadhran, who is sympathetic to the Tripoli government.  Jadhran’s Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) had controlled the terminals from the overthrow of the late Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 until September 2016, when Haftar’s Libyan National Army seized them.  Earlier this month, Jadhran retook the facilities from the LNA, however the PFG and allies could not retain the terminals when the LNA launched a counteroffensive.  The closure of the ports this month has resulted in a loss of 450,000 barrels per day (bpd), from a total of a little over 1 million bpd.  Libya, since the fall of Gaddafi in 2011, has undergone successive turmoils. Khalifa Haftar and the Tobruk-based government control the majority of eastern Libya, in opposition to the internationally recognised government based in Tripoli. Huge swaths of the country are still controlled by local militias, and parts are controlled by ISIS.

By Anna Schaeffer Rabat – Fez’s 1.1 million inhabitants live at the crossroads of Tangier and Marrakech in a city praised by UNESCO as “one of the most extensive and best conserved historic towns of the Arab-Muslim world.” A World Heritage site and home to both the world’s oldest continuously-operated library and university, Fez is a destination both multifaceted and extraordinary. Enter through the blue gate, or Bab Bou Jeloud, into the Fez medina: the world’s largest urban pedestrian zone, completely car-free but not without the regular donkey sighting within its walls as artisans transport goods to market. Thousands of men, women, children, and animals wind through its labyrinthine alleys every day between vendors of everything from camel heads to copper saucepans. The world’s oldest operating library rests within the medina since its genesis in 859 AD. Twelve centuries ago, Fatima El-Fihri dedicated her inheritance to a three-part project: library, mosque, and university. The Qarawiyyin Library reopened to the public in 2016 after renovation and contains a reading room, ancient religious documents, and thousand-year-old manuscripts That same school spearheaded by El-Fihri, University of Al Quaraouiyine, stands as the oldest continuously functioning university in the world. A state university since 1963, the institution still welcomes students within its walls to study language and religion. Colorful and intricate niches compose the medina, replete with leather shoes, caramel-colored dates, woven rugs, or sweet-smelling dried flowers. Certain categories of artisanal goods tend to group together: all the candle vendors along one walkway, pastel candies congregated in another. Leather shoes, bags, and tools are a common sighting, and the leather often hails from Fez’s celebrated tanneries. Tourists are given a sprig of mint to mask the strong smell as they observe kneading, tanning, and dyeing techniques little changed from medieval days. Housing an all-natural and ancient process, leather tanneries span the centuries between Fez of the eighth century and the Fez of today. Throughout the market, artisans proudly exhibit their creations in eye-catching displays and are quick to demonstrate the usefulness of argan oil or provide a sample of dried apricot. The combination of sights, sounds, and smells along with its massive size distinguishes Fez from any other medina in Morocco. Riads, traditional townhouses built around an open courtyard, sometimes date from Fez’s medieval era. The unassuming front doors open to a palatial wood-and-tile home built into the medina’s walls, often four stories high with a rooftop view of the city. Although families still inhabit a number of these homes, owners have transformed hundreds of riads into distinctive hotels for visitors. Each is unusual and original with its own personality, as remarkable as its one-of-a-kind front door. Cats and kittens seem to be as natural within the medina walls as a tea vendor. Roaming freely, they provide another unique facet of the huge market.  One kitten benefitted from the tenderness of an older, gruff shopkeeper—the man purchased a triangle of cheese and placed it on the side of the road to keep the tiny animal out of wheelbarrow and foot traffic. Especially colorful about Fez is its inhabitants: artisans, guests, imams, scholars, tourists, and more. Hailing from every corner of the world, young and old congregate to buy and sell, to worship and study. Within just one day the Medina sees a diversity of individuals, and this, perhaps more than anything else, sets Fez apart.

Rabat – A Moroccan fan was arrested after the Morocco-Spain game on Monday, June 25, for wearing a shirt with the message “Shame on you FIFA.” The Moroccan fan, who bears an American passport, was later released. In a video published on his Instagram account, the Moroccan-American Yassine Omairy shared a video in which he was ambushed by a FIFA representative asking him to remove his shirt.  A FIFA representative forced me to remove my T-shirt but guess what FIFA, thanks to this video and thanks to social media the whole world will hear our voice Loud and Clear.. let’s all share!

Shame On You FIFA.” he wrote. Following the altercation, the Moroccan fan was arrested by the police who confiscated his passport. He was released a few hours later, thanks to the intervention of the American and Moroccan embassies, as he explained on Facebook.    “Thank god I got my passport back! I’m ok now, too bad I was not able to watch the whole game. Thanks to all my friends that called to check on me and many thanks to the Moroccan &amp; the US Embassy as well . I don’t have any regrets or doubts about what I did and to be completely honest, I would do it again… I’m pretty sure you all feel the same way.” Just like the Atlas Lions, their coach, and Moroccan fans across the world, Yassine Omairy wanted to raise his voice about the controversial use of VAR and the refereeing in the Morocco-Portugal game, that led to the national team’s exit from the 2018 World Cup.

Rabat – Nordin Amrabat has spoken for every Moroccan in the world. “VAR is bull****,” the Atlas Lion shouted in front of millions of viewers after the Morocco-Spain game, Monday, June 25. The 31-year old player, called a “hero” by Moroccan fans was not afraid to say what he, the team, and Moroccans were thinking about the game’s refereeing, sending a clear message to waiting camera crews.

thank you @NAmrabat53 — reda allali (@RedaAllali) 25 juin 2018  The image of Nordin Amrabat denouncing VAR went viral on social media. Many Moroccans praised Amrabat for his gesture.  Amrabat: "VAR IS BULLSHIT"??? ???????? ?????? ??????: ????? ???? ???? @n_amrabat_official #maroc#morocco#lionsatlas#amrabat#dimamaghrib?? A post shared by @ la_chelha9 on Jun 25, 2018 at 2:10pm PDT  Although the Atlas Lions were already eliminated from the competition, they offered a spectacular performance by scoring a double (Boutaib, 14’) and (En-Nesyri 81’) and giving Spain a run for their money.  The national team scored their first World Cup goal in 20 years, opening the score in the 14th minute thanks to a kick from forward Khalid Boutaib who took advantage of a mistake by Spain’s Sergio Ramos. Unfortunately, the controversial use of VAR crushed Hervé Renard’s goal to “save the honor” of the team. A goal from Spain’s Iago Aspas at the start of the additional time (90th + 1) was first canceled for being offside, before being validated by the referee who consulted VAR. Morocco sorely remembers that the referee did not consult VAR in Morocco’s game against Portugal. After yesterday’s game, the Atlas Lions, including Amrabat, defender Benatia, midfielder Belhanda, their coach, and Moroccan fans have complained of unfair arbitration on the only goal of the match for Portugal (1-0), which could have been canceled due to a fault made by Cristiano Ronaldo. Moreover, some sports experts, including former Arsenal coach Arsène Wenger, former Coach of PSG Luis Fernandez, and former France football icon Marcel Desailly have asserted that the national team should have been granted a penalty in the Morocco-Portugal game.

Rabat – #Shame_on_you FIFA, VAR not for Africa, and Stop Racism against African Teams are just some of the new hashtags that flooded social media networks by Moroccan football fans after the Morocco-Spain World Cup game yesterday to denounce the “unfair” refereeing. In the view of Moroccan fans, FIFA’s referees have been reluctant to use the video assistant referee (VAR) for Morocco throughout its participation in the 2018 World Cup game. In its last two games, Morocco’s national football team were denied several penalty kicks that may have changed the balance to afford them qualification into the next round of the tournament.  According to Moroccan football fans, luck has nothing to do with this; it was FIFA referees who disappointed the Moroccan hope, which took them 20 years to fulfill. The Atlas Lions will pack up to come back home in the coming days. However, their participation in the 2018 World Cup has not gone unnoticed after their spectacular performances against European champions: Spain and Portugal. The Atlas Lions made Portugal and Spain’s qualification dream a hard task to achieve with their skills, determination, and strength. While their participation marks a snapshot of history, Moroccan fans may never forgive FIFA and its referees for the perceived mistakes of referees and unjust refereeing in both games against Spain and Portugal. The Atlas Lions’ supporters cherished their team and praised their efforts to make fans happy again. Some of them, however, shed tears to see the Atlas Lions leaving the World Cup field so early. Moroccan football star Nordin Amrabat heavily criticized FIFA and VAR through a clear message addressed to FIFA in front of the cameras surrounding the Kaliningrad stadium after the Morocco-Spain game. The camera captured Amrabat saying “VAR is bull****.” Football fans were quick to share the video in agreement. Amrabat’s phrase even inspired some Twitter and Facebook users to create other hashtags and memes against VAR. “SHAME ON YOU DEAR FIFA !! #VARISBULL[****]” one Twitter user wrote. The hashtag was widely shared yesterday after the game. “#VAR only for Europe,” wrote another. SHAME ON YOU DEAR FIFA !! -_- #VARISBULLSHIT pic.twitter.com/6ZawazNbbO — nouhaila amenzou (@AmenzouNouhaila) June 25, 2018  One Twitter user also criticized referees for not using VAR in the Portugal-Iran game, which took place yesterday. “Save Ronaldo; Save sponsors. #shameonFIFA.” Save Ronaldo; Save sponsors.#shameonFIFA@FIFAcom@FIFAWorldCup@FIFAWorldCupIRN pic.twitter.com/0tnVNUhBSB — Roshan Norouzi ????

Spain’s higher number of goals earned it first place over Portugal. Iran ended the World Cup group stage with four points, while Morocco left with one.

By Intissar Faouzi Rabat-The eighth Marrakech du Rire (Marrakech of Laughter)  has concluded. The annual festival is one of the most popular events for Arabic and French comedy, the organizers of the festival told MWN. Among the highlights of the June 20-24 festival was the sold out opening of the Grand Gala hosted by Eko and his friends. The scene of Marrakech’s Badii Palace brought together many comedians, singers, dancers, and actors for an atmosphere of madness, while the orange scene of the Jemaa El-Fna Place, which broadcast the show live, attracted an exceptional crowd. The best of comedy was also present at another major event: the second Gala Africa, also at Badii Palace, was sold out and attracted enthusiastic spectators. The festival boasted several French-speaking comedians from Cameroon, the Congo, Senegal, Gabon, and Côte d’Ivoire. All were led by Nigerien comedian Mamane, whose introduction excited the crowd. Algerian Abdelkader Secteur deployed all his talents to a packed room on the Royal Theater stage, displaying good humor and numerous hilarious anecdotes about his life between the two shores of the Mediterranean. The group “Jamel et ses amis” (Jamel and His Friends) was eagerly awaited by the public. Among comedians Ahmed Sylla, Jeff Panacloc, Camille Lellouche, and Malik Bentalha at the Badii Palace, Jamel Debbouze and his friends were the masters of an exceptional show broadcast worldwide. The great D’jal also created an atmosphere of laughs with the presentation of his latest show. The humor illusionist Eric Antoine came back to present his best magic tricks, and Akim Omiri made a strong impression with his mischievous smile. Amoutati was present with a quirky and irresistible look at the mixing of cultures, not to mention Camille Lellouche, who performed twice at the Badii Palace. In addition, from Monday, June 18, to Saturday, June 23, the actor, composer and director Oscar Sisto hosted a masterclass event at the French Institut. Marrakech du Rire is also a cinema display. The legendary Colisée screened the films “Les Indestructibles” and “La Finale,” the two feature films full of surprises that made all families laugh on Thursday, June 21, and Friday, June 22. Marrakech du Rire established itself as one of the most popular francophone comedy festivals in the world, which has hosted a total of 90,000 participants and gathered 70 million viewers.

Rabat – Taking place in Essaouira, Morocco, from June 21st to the 23rd, the Gnaoua festival brought musicians from across the globe. An estimated 500,000 participants attend annually and flock to the medina (old town) of Essaouira. From artists such as Snarky Puppy, Shabaka Hutchings, Africa United, and Maâlem Hamid El Kasri, this year’s three-day event brought together music and people from different cultures, traditions, and races.   Walking around the streets, chill vibes and peace signs seemed to fill the air as Moroccan locals played covers of The Tide is High and One Love. Crowds formed around local Gnaoua groups, dancing and playing their local music by cafes as people sipped tea. French, Arabs, Americans, Italians, and others, gathered in groups, and a mix of languages seemed to culminate the festival’s theme of sharing cultures from different parts of the world.  Historically, Gnaoua was the music of an ethnic group of people that were trafficked as slaves throughout Morocco during the 11th century. Gnaoua music represents all the black Africans who were enslaved, retells the history of oppression, and constructs the identity of their freedom. Gnaoua music is deeply spiritual and historically corresponds with religious practices as well. Now the music is shared with everyone around the world and continues that storytelling tradition for all to hear.  The three-day festival offered a range of sounds and styles from all regions of Morocco, including Marrakech, Tangier, and Essaouira. Musicians also came from Europe, the US, and other African countries, and some shared fusions of music between Gnaoua and other genres of music.    Locals from all over Morocco gathered to watch the historical festival. Chaymae El Younoussi, a Moroccan, came with a group of friends to the Gnaoua festival to get to know more about the music itself. “I’m a Moroccan woman and I don’t know that much about the music of Gnaoua, but I came here to know more.”  Her friend Raashnie Gopalrai is an American Peace Corps worker who came for the festival’s historical presence and international aspect. “I like the history behind Gnaoua fest. It goes way back to the days of slavery and also, I just wanted to meet a lot of my friends that are here from Peace Corps. There’s a really good vibe around here and it’s awesome!”  They both had enjoyed the festival so far and El Younoussi expressed her excitement to see Hamid el Kasri. “He makes me feel so excited about the music!” Chiara Gandini, 22, is an Italian student who attended the event. She had not originally gone to Essaouira for the festival, but once she arrived there, she met so many people who were attending the event that she decided to as well. Couchsurfing with some people she met at her host family’s home, she realized that the music they liked was similar to the music she enjoyed. “I surprisingly realized that I liked it as it combines various genres I usually listen to! I guess the thing I enjoyed the most was the general vibe of the entire city this weekend. Till early in the morning you could see floods of people wandering around the medina chatting, dancing, eating, and drinking. It was a huge gathering of different people just having a great time together.”  The Gnaoua festival continues to bring excitement to people all over the world and will continue to do so as it innovates its sounds and bring in new talent.

Rabat – US Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan is expected to pay an official visit to Morocco later this week as part of his Europe and North Africa tour from June 25 to 29. A statement from the US Department of State said that the US official will discuss “a range of US priorities, including joint efforts to maintain an enduring defeat of ISIS and promote cooperation on regional and global security challenges.”  The statement further explained that Sullivan will meet several Moroccan senior officials “to discuss a range of political, economic, and security issues, including Morocco’s important contributions to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.” He will also meet with a group of Moroccan youth in Casablanca. Sullivan will first travel to the Netherlands and Denmark. Before landing in Morocco, the US official will also visit Algeria to meet government officials and to participate in the 5th annual bilateral dialogue between the US and Algeria on security and the fight against terrorism. The US Department of State has issued several statements to recognize Morocco’s leading role in the fight against terrorism. In December 2017, the State Department said that the North African country, along with the US, are “leading global efforts at the international level” in the fight against terrorism and extremist ideologies. The US Department of State added that Morocco is a leader in training security and law enforcement officials “from friendly nations such as Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, and Senegal.”

Agadir, Morocco- Hijra wa Himaya, a program for the migrant children of Morocco, was launched on Thursday during the Government Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD), in partnership with a UNICEF workshop. The two-day conference was held in the Atlantic Palace Resort in Agadir, Morocco, June 21to 22.  Launched by the Ministry of Moroccan Residents Abroad and Migration Affairs in partnership with the EU in Morocco and UNICEF, Hijra wa Himaya is a new project to ensure that the migrant children of Morocco have better access to their rights.   In Morocco, migrant children represent about 10 percent of the actual migrant population, 35 percent of these being girls. “Today we join UNICEF with Hijra wa Himaya to ensure that migrant children, regardless of their legal status, have equitable access to education, health care, social and judicial care and appropriate emergency accommodation,” said Claudia Wiedey, EU Ambassador for Morocco.  Hijra wa Himaya will operate on a budget of MAD 26.7 million. The EU has contributed approximately MAD 20 million. The program will provide services to 2,000 immigrant children in Morocco.   The workshop focused on the theme of “Children and Youth on the Move: Implementing Sustainable Solutions.”  The overarching theme is part of a series of workshops under the GFMD which are held all over the world, including cities such as New York, Geneva, and Marrakech.  The workshop focused on children and young people who are affected directly and indirectly by migration in terms of protection gaps, social inclusion, and access to services and labor markets all over the world.  The participants ranged from international organizations such as IFCR, UNDESA, UNHCR, IOM, and many others, to youth delegates and young activists.

Rabat – Once again FIFA’s referees showed how biased they are against Morocco. After depriving it of the use of VAR in at least 4 instances in its match against Portugal, causing it to lose the match and be eliminated, in its match against Spain, VAR was used against Morocco, allowing Spain to level the score and secure a comfortable first position in Group B. What is even more scandalous is that, prior to the corner that led to Spain’s equalizer, the ball had exceeded the limit of the pitch. More scandalous still, while the corner should have been kicked from the left side of the pitch, Spanish players played it from the right side. As a football fan, I have never seen this injustice inflicted on a single team in two consecutive matches in the highest football competition. Neither did I see a referee and his assistants allow a team to play a corner kick from a different side than the one where it should be played.  #??????_???????#Mar
Shame on you FIFA pic.twitter.com/rDjFkNpdms — FingerPrint (@Halvlza) June 25, 2018  What happened to Morocco is beyond scandalous. Rather than using VAR to invalidate the whole action leading to the goal, since the corner was not kicked from the right spot, the referees chose to simply overlook that, but looked to whether or not the Spanish player was offside.  It’s not available for any #Africain team in #WorldCup #shame #shame_on_you_fifa #disgrace #injustice #ESPMOR #MoroccoVsSpain #Morocco #??????_??????? pic.twitter.com/EgESXzJ90m — Saad Miri (@MiriSaad) June 25, 2018  There is unanimity among football experts that Morocco played one of the best matches in this World Cup, whether against Portugal or Spain, not to mention Iran. Without FIFA’s selective use of VAR, Morocco would have qualified to the second round. I watched the whole World Cup on the Spanish language channel Telemundo, and since the start of the tournament, all its commentators and experts were unanimous in lauding Morocco’s style of play, the players’ talents and devotion, and their generous efforts to honor their country in the World Cup. As I was watching yesterday’s match against Spain, the two speakers who were commentating the game clearly said that the referee was distributing uncalled for yellow cards to the Moroccan players. They also expressed disapproval of the many fouls that were not given to Morocco.  In the past, Moroccans grew accustomed to being wronged by sub-Saharan African referees. For so many years, Moroccan fans were deprived of seeing their team achieve great performances at the continental level because of poor refereeing. But as African refereeing has made great strides in recent years, Morocco finds itself now facing the deliberate intentions of FIFA to eliminate them from this World Cup.  Great game for Morocco against Spain ??
Thank you for this spectacular show,
Shame on you FIFA for being racist against Morocco vs Portugal game and for not using VAR technology. #fifaworldcup #moroccovsspain #russia2018 #shameonyoufifa #varforeveryone #varisbullshit pic.twitter.com/18rT9FGhZv — Ennejmy (@Ennejmy3) June 25, 2018  It is undeniable that Morocco did not play only against three teams of its group, but also against FIFA and its referees. The world was a witness of the injustice that American referee Mark Geiger inflicted on Morocco during its match against Portugal on June 22. Experts throughout the world were unanimous in expressing their disappointment with the selective use of VAR during Morocco matches against Portugal and Spain. Football legends such as Italian striker Christian Vieri, former French defender Marcel Desailly, French coaches Luis Fernandez and Arsene Wenger said in unison that the American referee—who was once involved in match-fixing accusations—did a lot of harm to Morocco.  The same story happened in yesterday’s match against Spain. Since the beginning of the match, it appeared that the referee had one goal in mind: to qualify Spain to the second round, even if this meant giving Moroccan players as many yellow cards as possible and eventually red cards. In the post-match discussion, former Egyptian striker Mohamed Aboutrika wondered whether there was a deliberate intention from FIFA to eliminate Morocco from the World Cup.  As I said in a previous article, given the entirety of circumstances that surrounded Morocco’s match against Portugal and Spain, there is every reason to think that FIFA President, Gianni Infantino, was intent on harming Morocco and making it pay for the media campaign Morocco launched to pressure FIFA and deter it from disqualifying the Moroccan bid to host the 2026 World Cup prior to vote day. It was no secret that Infantino, who owes his post as head of the world’s football body to the Americans, wanted to return the favor by allowing the United 2026 North American bid to win the rights to host the 2026 World Cup. However, FIFA’s schemes and its attempt to eliminate Morocco through the Task Force it created for that purpose fell through. This is perhaps the reason why FIFA’s president wanted to retaliate against Morocco.  That Spain’s equalizer was allowed at the 93rd minute right after Iran leveled the score in its match against Portugal raises suspicions about the clear intent of FIFA and its referees to avoid Spain’s elimination from the first round of the World Cup. In the event Morocco held its advantage against Spain and Iran scored a second goal against Portugal, Spain would have been left out of the competition, allowing Iran to qualify for the next round of the World Cup. Such a scenario would have been catastrophic for FIFA, whose economic model is built on ratings. The higher the ratings, the higher the profits. A World Cup in which one of the favorites is eliminated from the first round would lose its appeal for FIFA’s big sponsors, mainly television channels who pay hundreds of millions of dollars to buy the rights to broadcast the World Cup.  The lesson learned from this World Cup is that FIFA is one of the most corrupt organizations around the world. It is there to help powerful nations and so-called big football nations to keep their monopoly over this sport. It is not there to promote the values of football, nor is it there to promote understanding between cultures and peoples, it is there to make money and to perpetuate the domination of certain countries. This World Cup will go down in history as one of the most scandalous tournaments.  This year’s World Cup was not only tarnished by the bad refereeing inflicted on Morocco and other teams, such as Sweden, but also by the suspicions of doping surrounding the Russian team. British newspaper the Daily Mail revealed that FIFA is involved in a cover-up scandal surrounding the Russian team. Not only was FIFA aware 18 months ago of the Russian ministry’s schemes to cover the doping cases, but it had not done anything so far to sanction the unsportsmanlike practices of the Russians. Rather FIFA chose instead to hit at underdogs, such as Morocco, urging it to explain why its player Nordin Amrabat was allowed to play against Portugal, five days after his head injury against Iran.  In light of the injustice inflicted on Morocco in its matches against Portugal and Spain and the brazen and disgraceful favoring of the “good” teams, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation should work hand in hand with the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to submit a formal protest to FIFA. The ignominious refereeing mistakes made against Morocco are unprecedented and should push all African federations to mobilize and call on FIFA to apply the rules equally to all its members regardless of their track record or the fame of their players.  As long as teams participating in the World Cup do not play on a level playing field, football will no longer be the sports of the masses, but the realm of the powerful and the well-to-do, and African countries will never be allowed to go beyond the stages that are considered as acceptable to profit-driven and biased people who pull the strings within FIFA. CAF is composed of 55 members, and it should use this card to convey to the FIFA president that he risks losing the support of African confederations in his reelection scheduled in June 2019 if FIFA does not explain why Morocco was the victim of unfair and disgraceful refereeing during this World Cup.

Rabat – With Morocco disqualified after two consecutive losses in its first two games, and Spain almost assured of a qualifying spot for the knockout stage, the Spain vs. Morocco match this Monday had a lot less at stake compared to both teams’ previous matches. And yet, Spain wanted group leadership in order to be matched against Russia, deemed less dangerous than Uruguay; Morocco, for their part, were playing for honor and pride, to wash away the misfortune and “injustice” that had tarnished the quality and beauty of their two other performances. “We will prepare for this game like any other,” Coach Hervé Renard said yesterday in the pre-match news conference. “We are ready to fight like Lions for the honor of Morocco.”  That Morocco had the technique and the squad it took to make this a painful last match for Spain had already been acknowledged by both Spanish midfielder Busquets and Coach Fernando Hierro. Football, they said, had been “unfair” to Morocco whose quality “deserved more than the zero points they have.” Morocco’s buildup and ball circulation had been beautiful throughout the tournament. The connection between the midfield and the flanks had been impeccable, although they had failed to turn their beautiful game into mathematical advantage. Spain knew that, sensed it, prepared for it, and played accordingly. Hence, what a terrific night it was in Kaliningrad! What an exquisite show of footballing masterstrokes from both sides! In the first minutes of the game, Morocco, mindful of the ball possession-leaning football that makes the outstanding might of the Spaniards, pressed high. They ran tirelessly, trying to stop Spanish midfield and attack transitions. Spain’s Isco was excellent; Iniesta was brilliant; Alba was magisterially present on the flanks; but Morocco would not just allow for the possession to distract their game. So they pressed when necessary and made an immaculate use of the ball when they possessed it. Their determination and drive paid off at the 14th minute when another high and bold Moroccan pressure culminated in a certain panic in the Spanish defense, ending in a ball loss very unlike Spain. Morocco’s Boutaib, whom Renard preferred to El Kaabi for tonight, could not miss this. He outran the entire Spanish defense, beautifully lodging the ball pass between De Gea’s legs. With a 1-nil score for Morocco, Moroccans at the Kaliningrad Stadium were exuberant. The stadium felt like playing at home in Casablanca. But no sooner had Morocco’s celebration of the goal ended than Spain regained supremacy in the middle, supremely passing the ball as if it were a toddler’s toy. The higher Morocco pressed, the more Spain kept the ball, trying hard to find a crack in Morocco’s tactical disposition. Isco’s beautiful low-range finish came at the 19th minute after another terrific one-two moment with Iniesta. At half time, the 1-1 scoreline reflected the game, as Spain’s ball possession was marked by Amrabat and Harit’s spotless performances on the flanks, their seemingly boundless energy gave Morocco an aura of constant danger. Refreshed, both teams entered the second half with the same tempo as before. Spain’s 75% ball possession was always met by Morocco’s counterattacks, the intelligent touches and circulation whenever they had the ball at their disposal. For almost 80 minutes, it looked as though the match would end in a draw, but 1-1 would not be the final score. En-Nesyri’s 81st minute header delivered temporary victory to Morocco, sure that with 9 minutes left they could secure it, a beautiful end to a saga of pain and misfortune. But Spain was unyielding, pressuring, restless, angry, and hungry for a goal. The air was heavy, smelling of a goal at any time before the final whistle. Spain had come looking for victory. “Morocco has a technical team. They are very good. But our aim is to play well, score, and win,” the Spanish coach had said before the game. Now, though, victory was not what they were striving for. They wanted a draw, at whatever price. As the end drew near, Morocco’s elation was palpable. They were out of the tournament. But what else can be more beautiful, braver, than deservedly beating Spain in the last game? But that final victory eluded them, for Spain’s Aspas, who had just entered the game to replace Diego Costa, scored a last minute goal in stoppage time. The referee first disallowed it, before accepting that it was a goal after consulting the video assistant referee (VAR) intervention. At some stage in their disappointing tournament, Morocco had to deliver an uplifting performance, and this match was it. Amrabat’s beautifully shot 54th rocket would have rendered Morocco wild and given them a raucous victory over one of the footballing heavy weights, but, as Busquets said before the game, “football can sometimes be unfair.” But with a rather terrific 2-2 draw with Spain, football can be said to have been unfair to Morocco (there was a handball from Piqué that the referee did not see), but tonight the unfairness was beautiful, ravishing, delightful. With tonight’s game, Group B has completed its round of matches with Spain topping the group, followed by Portugal, Iran, and Morocco.

Rabat – In the midst of a visit by the Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General for Western Sahara, Horst Köhler, in Algeria, Polisario critic Mustapha Salma has highlighted atrocities in the Tindouf camps. The UN official is touring the region from June 23 to July  1. During his visit to Algeria, Köhler will meet Polisario representatives in the Tindouf camps, in southwest Algeria. Köhler will also visit Morocco to hold talks with Moroccan authorities on June 28-29 in Rabat. ‘Sahrawis are being killed like dogs’ Commenting on Köhler’s visit, Polisario dissident Mustapha Salma heavily criticized Algeria for torturing Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps. Salma made his remarks on a Facebook post on Saturday: “Algeria receives UN envoy with more bodies of Sahrawis, before burying the body of the young man Brahim Salek, who was killed in a Polisario-run prison.”  Salma was referring to the death of the  30-year old Sahrawi opponent Brahim Ould Salek Ould Breika, who was allegedly tortured in the infamous D’Heibya prison in Algeria. To date, the victim’s relatives have not been allowed to see Ould Salek’s body, according to Salma. The prison, south of Tindouf, allegedly holds some Sahrawis and dissidents who never received trials. Salma, a former police chief in the Tindouf camps, added that the “killing machine returned to claim the lives of young Sahrawis, and this time by the bullets of the Algerian army.” The dissident claimed that on Saturday the Algerian army “assassinated” Rabas Abdelrahman Yahdeh, another young Sahrawi who studied at an Algerian university. According to Salma, the young Sahrawi was shot while he was in a car in the outskirts of the Laayoune camp near Tindouf with his friends, who “miraculously survived.” “This crime comes on the first day of the visit of the personal envoy in Algeria, which is hosting Sahrawi camps where Sahrawis are being killed like dogs, without anyone lifting a finger,” he said. He added that if such cases occurred in Morocco, the incident would not go unnoticed. Since 2011, Salma has regularly criticized Polisario’s provocative actions, describing the front as losing its influence in the conflict since the 1991 ceasefire agreement. Köhler will visit all MINURSO sites Köhler’s visit comes on the heels of the violations of the front on May 20 in Tifariti, east of Morocco’s defense wall, to celebrate the “45th anniversary of its armed struggle.” The violation came in defiance of the UN resolution adopted on April 27 by the Security Council. The resolution extended the mandate of MINURSO to six months instead of one year and pressured the Polisario to end the violations of the agreement. The UN Personal Envoy is expected to visit all of the sites under the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) to monitor the ceasefire agreement, including those east of Morocco’s defense wall.

Rabat – Moroccan attacking midfielder Hakim Ziyech has reportedly reached an agreement with Italian giant AS Roma on a five-year contract. The player, who is expected to take part in Morocco’s last 2018 World Cup game, will leave his Dutch team Ajax for AS Roma this summer. Dutch-based sports outlet Telegraaf reported that the player’s agent and AS Roma were regularly negotiating his move as they are expected to finalize the agreement in less than a week. Roma has reportedly offered Ajax EUR 30 million for the youngster, but sports outlets reported that the Dutch-based football team seeks a larger offer to let one of its favorite footballers leave and join the ranks of the Italian league. If Ziyech accepts to sign with AS Roma, he will be the second Ajax player to join the Italian giant after Justin Kluivert, who will join them this summer. Kluivert signed with AS Roma for EUR 20 million. Leaving Ajax anyways? Several European football clubs have been chomping on the bit to recruit Ziyech, offering the Dutch football club millions of Euros to secure a contract with the talented Moroccan midfielder. Besides AS Roma, Inter Milan, Liverpool, and Tottenham also expressed interest in signing the footballer at the end of season.  The footballer’s contract with Ajax will come to an end in 2022. Spanish football team Atletico Madrid also offered a deal to Ajax for the Mercato summer transfer window. In April 2018, Ajax named Ziyech player of the year after he led his Dutch team to a major win over AZ Alkmaar (3-0). The award recognized Ziyech’s excellent performance with the Dutch team during this season. Born in  the Netherlands to Moroccan parents, Ziyech chose to represent Morocco internationally. On October 2015, the player made his debut for Morocco in a friendly with Côte d’Ivoire, which ended with a 0-1 victory for Côte d’Ivoire. In 2014, Ziyech left Heerenveen for FC Twente, with whom he signed a four year contract. The footballer then signed with Ajax in 2016. Ziyech also played for Netherlands Under 19, Under 20 and Under 21 teams between 2012 and 2014.

Rabat – Whether it be the reserved exuberance of “Cosmic girls,” the delectable funkiness of “Virtual insanity,” the beatific insanity of “Runaway,” or the exultant cult-like philosophy of their early tunes, Jamiroquai remain to their fans the epitome of the subversive beauty of funk music.  Although fundamentally faithful to the basic tenets of the funk genre, the British jazz-funk band has lately found quite an interesting way of mixing and exploring genres from electronic and disco to pop and rock. Hours prior to a superb performance at the 17th Mawazine Festival, the group gave a 15-minute press conference at the Rabat Art Gallery (Villa Des Arts) on Sunday, June 24. In what sounded more like a fifteen-minute chat with old friends, they talked about their music, how it felt to deliver a premier performance in front of a passionate Moroccan public, and their conception of art and its place in society. How did it feel to be in Morocco for the first time? What surprises did the band have for the thousands of Moroccan fans whose attachment to the band’s type of music has something of a religious elevation of spirit? asked a pack of journalists. Jay Kay, the band’s leader, laughed encouragingly at the questions. “It always feels good to sing, to perform, and do music,” he said, straddling the unique feeling of being in Morocco and that of being a celebrated music band whose dexterity has won them the admiration of a worldwide audience. “We are tired. We are just coming off Ukraine, where we’ve just given another performance,” he said, but promised the band will do what they do best for their Moroccan fans: Music. “The plan is to play really well,” they said. “It is interesting and refreshing to go somewhere we’ve never been before. It is exciting to be here.” Jay Kay, who that afternoon spoke on behalf of the group, talked about the band’s origins in terms of a constant drive to “synchronize.” The singer suggested that “A Funk Odyssey,” the group’s fifth studio album, was essentially about mixing, changing, and exploring unknown musical territories, new grounds—both for their own good as artists and the good of millions of fans who demand constant creativity and novelty of musical perspectives and instruments. “I think it is difficult to strive far away from what we do. But this album is a bit hybridized. Well, it’s always been hybrid, really,” Jay Kay said. “I think in terms of drums and how different it sounds [from previous albums]. I listened to some of the albums from day one, and I realized how much complexity and changes were in it.” To a journalist who asked about the group’s memory of Toby Smith, a founding member of Jamiroquai who passed away in April 2017, aged 46, Jay Kay said: “I saw his wife the other day…There is at least that nice thing that he has left his children—he has left three children behind–and his wife. There is a nice legacy for them to have. It is kind of there, the music does not go away.”

Rabat – A picture of Moroccan midfielder Fayçal Fajr using his phone during a training session in Russia has gone viral on social media, angering Moroccan fans who felt the Moroccan football player was not taking the last game against Spain seriously. The Atlas Lions will play against Spain tonight at 7 p.m (Moroccan time). After being defeated by Iran on June 15 and Portugal on June 20, the Moroccan team will leave the competition after its last game with Spain’s la Roja team. Hervé Renard said that his Atlas Lions will play their last match against Spain as if they were trying to qualify for the next phase of the 2018 World Cup. However, Moroccan fans who need the Atlas Lions to be very concentrated for this last game “to save the honor” were not okay with one of the players using his phone while training. People on social media guess that Fajr was going against the rules and should be sanctioned for his behavior. “Morocco is eliminated but they still have a match against Spain to save the honor. Fayçal Fajr, he seems to have moved on from the World Cup. The guy trains phone in his hand on the eve of the last game of his team,” “How can Hervé Renard let Faycal Fajr use his phone?” “Fajr doesn’t care about his team,” “Fajr has scored more on social media than on the field,” commented people.  Following the backlash, the 29-year old football player has explained himself on his Instagram account.  Aujourd’hui nous affrontons l’Espagne, les troupes sont motivés pour donner le maximum incha’allah. Avant que tout soit mal interprété, j’aimerai attirer l’attention sur le fait que nous, joueurs, avons pour habitude de s’entraîner sur un fond musical, cela fait partie de nos méthodes d’entraînement, que l’on a pour habitude d’apporter 1 tempo (BPM) à nos entraînements par le biais d’un iPod et d’une enceinte. Des consignes données que j’ai toujours suivi. En aucun cas, il a été question d’amusements sur un téléphone, je connais très bien l’importance de ce match, de cette coupe du monde, de l’importance des couleurs que je porte, les couleurs de mon pays. Nous sommes tous concentrés pour donner tout ce qu’on a aujourd’hui. Cette photo est un mal entendu. En espérant avoir été compris. Dima Maghreb??? A post shared by  Fayçal Fajr (@f.fajr11) on Jun 25, 2018 at 4:59am PDT  “Today we are facing Spain, we are motivated to give the maximum incha’allah. Before everything is misinterpreted, I would like to draw attention to the fact that we, players, have a habit of training on a musical background, it is part of our training methods, that we have for used to bring 1 tempo (BPM) to our workouts through an iPod and a speaker. Instructions that I have always followed,” said Fajr. “I was not playing on my phone, I know very well the importance of this match, this world cup, the importance of the colors that I wear, the colors of my country. We are all focused on giving everything we have today. This photo is a misunderstood. Hoping to have been understood,” he added, shutting down the gossiping. Fajr was not the only one who spoke about the picture. David Ducci, a staff member of the national team also defended the Atlas Lion: “This picture that circulates on social media has gotten out of context.  ?Cette photo circule sur les réseaux sociaux mais sortie de son contexte En effet, c’est avec l’accord du coach @herve.renard.hr que @f.fajr11 a utilisé son tel pour effectuer l’échauffement en musique 4mn comme nous le faisions en Zambie et Côte d’Ivoire parfois ? ?Il n’y a aucun lieu à polémique. Tous les joueurs de l’équipe nationale sont respectueux de la sélection nationale et de ses règles. À bon entendeur salut ! @officielfrmf A post shared by  David Ducci (@david.ducci) on Jun 25, 2018 at 12:12am PDT  “Hervé Renard has agreed to let Fayçal Fajr use his phone to put music for the warm-up, as we were doing in Zambia and Ivory Coast sometimes,” he said. “There is no place for controversy. All players on the national team are respectful of the national team and its rules,” he added. Moreover, his teammate Manuel Da Costa also wanted to make things clear, saying that the staff and the players wanted to put some music on for the warm-up. “Those who understand will support us, as for the others we don’t need your unfounded criticism,” he added.

By Chase Lacy Rabat- Morocco’s neighboring country Algeria, according to an AP report, has abandoned 13,000 migrants  in the Sahara without any food, water, or supplies over a 14-month period. Algeria has indiscriminately packed men, women (including pregnant women), and children by the hundreds into densely crowded trucks, and dropped them off at “Point Zero,” approximately 15 kilometers from the Nigerien border. After “Point Zero,” migrants are forced to trek out of Algeria, sometimes at gunpoint, into the blistering Sahara heat, which can reach temperatures of up to 48 degrees Celsius. The vast majority of the migrants attempt to cross the 15-kilometer no-man’s-land to the border village of Assamaka in Niger. An unknown number have perished along the way; some collapse into the sand and are left; many wind up lost in the desert and are never seen again.  Alhoussan Adouwal, an official for the International Organization of Migration (IOM) in Assamaka, said “They come by the thousands, I’ve never seen anything like it.” Many, once they pass through Assamaka, make their way on buses to Arlit, six hours to the south. From Arlit, they are transported to Agadez, where they board IOM-sponsored flights back to their home countries.  A Liberian migrant named Janet Kamara described the horrific scene. “Women were lying dead, men…other people get missing in the desert because they didn’t know the way.” Janet herself was pregnant when she was left at Point Zero, and lost her baby due to the merciless journey. Another pregnant woman with her went into labor and sadly lost her baby as well.  Another Liberian migrant, Ju Dennis, who captured video evidence of Algeria’s abuses said if “you’re facing deportation in Algeria, there is no mercy.” Algeria has continuously denied that human rights violations have been committed against migrants.  European Union pressure has led Algeria to increase the expulsions of migrants attempting to reach the Mediterranean, claiming that as long as the deportations follow international law, Algeria as a sovereign nation has the right to do so.  Algeria provides no statistics on the expulsions. However since IOM began keeping track in May 2017, a total of 11,276 have survived the crossing into Niger. Additionally 2,500 were forced into Mali, and an unknown number have died there.  IOM estimates that for every migrant killed attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Europe, two are killed in the Sahara. Since 2014, possibly over 30,000 have been killed in the desert.

Anna Schaeffer Rabat – Over 230 pages of proposals in the report address decriminalization of homosexuality and banning of anal tests, gender equity in inheritance law, remarriage stipulations, and “total abolition of the death penalty.” President Beji Caid Essebsi of Tunisia created the commission in response to the 2014 constitution, a legal change following the 2011 Arab Spring revolts.  The presidential committee’s recommendation to decriminalize homosexuality and ban anal tests is expected to face backlash from conservative Muslims. Currently, homosexuality is illegal; same-sex sexual activity is punishable by up to three years in prison. Anal testing, a procedure declared “torturous” and without “medical justification,” is used to test for “evidence of homosexual conduct.” It only transitioned from a forced practice to one requiring consent in Tunisia in April 2017. The reform proposal suggested that a previously mandated jail time for homosexual activity could be replaced by a fine of DZD 500 (USD 200).  In a law inspired by the Qur’an, women currently receive only half of an inheritance available to a man. “Where there are any sons, the male inherits twice as much as the female,” the legislation states. Last week’s proposal seeks to introduce inheritance equality for men and women while retaining room for personal decision-making in an inheritance. Another proposal addresses present remarriage requirements, which outline a “period of waiting” necessary for women to observe, after divorce or widowing, before remarrying. For example, the “non-pregnant divorced woman” requires “a waiting period of three months” while “the waiting period of a pregnant woman ends with childbirth.” Liberal reform proposals point towards the abolition of these laws. Tunisia is often cited as the most prominent success story from the Arab Spring uprisings of seven years ago and a trailblazer for women’s rights in North Africa. The landmark law on violence of July 2017 seeks to prevent women from harm, and a law prohibiting Muslim women from marrying non-Muslim men was abolished September of the same year. The “total abolition of the death penalty” also finds its place among these sweeping social reforms. Although the government has not carried out any reported executions since 1991, the death penalty remains legally mandated.  Bochra Belhaj Hmida, a Tunisian lawyer and politician, praised the reforms as championing the “well-being of every individual.” She went on to state freedom’s importance as compared to that of bread. Not all reactions are positive, however; one religious leader criticized the movement as “intellectual terrorism.” Sabri Abdelghani, a prominent imam, warned the reforms would “eradicate Tunisian identity, by leaving the people without religion.” A political movement in Morocco argues for a similar change in inheritance law. Called “sexist” and an example of inequity faced by women, the inheritance law in the Moroccan family code prohibits women from accessing the full property left to them. Public figures and over 6,000 other signatories have indicated their support to repeal the legislation. Tunisia’s next election will occur in 2019; speculations of a “window of opportunity” to change the law preceding the election point to Essebsi’s current governmental power. However, the commission will not publish its full proposals in writing until May 2019, following municipal elections.

By Dana Leger Rabat – The Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People (CEIRPP) and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) will jointly host an international conference in Rabat June 26-28. The event will be held under the theme “The Question of Jerusalem after 50 years of Occupation and 25 years of the Oslo Accords.” It will bring together Palestinian, Israeli, and international experts to reflect upon the situation in East Jerusalem and will provide an opportunity for participants to outline their positions and share opinions, particularly in view of recent developments. The conference will also provide a platform for youth from East Jerusalem to voice their concerns to the international community. Participants will then discuss and identify actionable solutions to the challenges confronting the youth, who are recognized as vital to both the future of the city and the goals of a peaceful and stable future. CEIRPP, a subsidiary organization to the UN General Assembly, has offered its sincere appreciation for the leadership of King Mohammed VI in establishing and chairing the Al-Quds (Jerusalem) Committee of OIC and acknowledged the hospitality and support being provided by Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the conference. After the Gaza massacre on May 14, Morocco launched a humanitarian operation in Palestine that included the deployment of a Royal Armed Forces (FAR) field hospital and the distribution of medicines, blankets, and foodstuffs. On May 30, King Mohammed VI personally supervised the transport of humanitarian aid at the Casablanca airport. A Palestinian official later stated that Morocco’s support and humanitarian aid proved that the Palestinian cause is a priority of Moroccans, the King, and the government.  The conference will be inaugurated at 3 p.m. on June 26 at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the presence of Nasser Bourita, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Morocco; Riad Malki, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the State of Palestine; Miroslav Jen?a, UN Assistant Secretary?General for Political Affairs; and Samir Bakr, OIC Assistant Secretary?General.

Rabat – Mohamed Salah’s relationship with Egypt’s national team has been tainted by politics, and the Egyptian forward is reportedly considering early international retirement due to his “unhappiness” over what happened in Grozny, Chechnya, Egypt’s training base at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Mohamed Salah, who this year had a magnificent season in the Premier League with Liverpool, earning six individual awards in the process, is the leading star and captain of Egypt’s national squad at the World Cup in Russia. At the squad’s training camp, however, there was a fallout between the player and the Egypt Football Association (FA) over a picture of the Liverpool star and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov taken just before the start of the World Cup. The picture, which featured the Chechen leader smiling profusely alongside Liverpool’s “Egyptian King” who wore a rather contrived smile, went viral in the first week of the tournament. Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya, a Russian federal subject, since 2004, has been criticized for his hostile attitude towards political dissent and minority rights. Last week, Kadyrov went a step further by making Salah an “honorary citizen of the Chechen Republic.” The Chechen leader tweeted a picture of himself and Salah at what looked like an official ceremony. “Mohamed Salah is an honorary citizen of the Chechen Republic! That’s right! I gave Mohamed Salah a copy of the order and a pin at a celebratory dinner that I gave in honor of the Egyptian team,” the tweet read. Many football enthusiasts and commenters have said that the Chechen leader used the Liverpool star as a pawn to serve his own image. The latest reports suggest that Mohamed Salah felt the same way. Salah believes that he has been politically used and is therefore considering putting an end to his international career, say reports, elaborating that the forward is waiting for his country’s final match at the Russian World Cup to make a final decision. Explaining Salah’s reluctance of being associated with anything outside of football, and particularly politics, a source close to the star told CNN that Salah “felt exposed by what happened in Chechnya.” A statement by the Egyptian FA denied the allegations, however. “We were always informed by Salah when he takes any decisions,” the statement said. “We spend the whole day together and he never discussed the issue with any of the delegation’s members.” Egypt, who have been eliminated from the tournament following two consecutive defeats in Group A, played their final match today against Saudi Arabia. Both teams were already out of the tournament, but played to secure an honorable end to their Russian adventure. Salah scored an early goal for Egypt, but Saudi Arabia soon scored an equalizer, and in the final moments of the game, Saudi Arabia took victory with a second goal.

Rabat – Spanish coach Fernando Hierro knows very well what his team will deal with tonight. The Spaniard warned his squad of Morocco’s strength, even though they will not move to the next phase of the 2018 World Cup. The Atlas Lions and La Roja, Spain’s team,  will play tonight in Kaliningrad at 7:00 p.m. (Moroccan time). However, Morocco’s team will fight for its honor after two defeats against Portugal and Iran, while Spain will fight to qualify for the second round of the tournament. For the Spanish coach, Morocco is a “tough rival,” according to American television channel ESPN. “Basically if they qualified for a World Cup we know they will be a tough rival,” said Hierro before the game. He added that his squad cannot have a moment of relaxation  as the team has to be “very much awake, with our eyes very much open, and we are aware that Morocco is not going to give anything away.” Spain and Portugal are in Group B, along with Morocco and Iran. Only two teams will qualify for the next round of the competition. Iran is in third with three points, while Morocco ended its two previous games pointless. Spain, Portugal, and Iran will fight for qualification, while Morocco will fight to bring joy to its fans and to show everyone that its goodbye was due to the “unfair” arbitration in the Portugal-Morocco game on June 20. The Spanish coach might have heard about the plan of Morocco’s coach Hervé Renard, who expressed his determination to offer a good match against Spain tonight. In his pre-match press conference, Renard promised that his Atlas Lions will play this game as if they were trying to get qualified for the next round.  In response, Hierro said that “we can’t get into the coach’s head; we’re not sure how they’re going to play tomorrow.” He added that the Moroccan team could make a surprise. “We can’t take anything for granted. We have to trust in our skills, our qualities, and that’s what’s more important ahead of tomorrow’s match.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has sent a congratulatory message to the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani, on the anniversary of his assuming power. In the cable, the King expressed his sincere congratulations and best wishes for health and tranquility, and further progress and prosperity to the brotherly Qatari people. The monarch lauded the privileged links of fruitful cooperation and active solidarity that unite Morocco and Qatar. He reiterated his firm determination to continue joint action with the Emir of Qatar to strengthen these relations and expand their fields, serving the interests of the two fraternal peoples. Hamad Al-Thani, the fourth son of Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, succeeded his father June 25, 2013. His father appointed Sheikh Tamim as heir apparent in August 2003, after his older son Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al-Thani renounced his rights to the throne in favor of Sheikh Tamim. Morocco and Qatar have been reiterating their determination to further develop and reinforce their bilateral ties continuously.  In June 2017, Morocco announced its decision to maintain neutrality in the Gulf crisis launched by the Saudi-led coalition against Qatar due to claims that the Qatari state financed terrorist groups. King Mohammed VI was the first leader to visit Qatar in November 2017 after the Saudi blockade was implemented, prompting the Qatari media to describe him as the “blockade breaker.” Qatari people and media have praised Morocco’s neutrality.  However, Saudi Arabia took Morocco’s decision as an offense, pushing it to make political decisions against Morocco. Recently, Saudi Arabia financed a campaign against Morocco’s 2026 World Cup hosting bid to lose its chances to be the second African nation to host the World Cup. On June 5, Hamad Al-Thani published documents approving the draft conventions signed between the two countries on various collaborations. Morocco and Qatar have maintained diplomatic ties since 1972 in different areas in the interest of serving both countries and peoples. The draft conventions, signed in Marrakech in 2013, cover taxation prevention, industry, and three memorandums of understanding on the mutual recognition of diplomats. Qatar and Morocco also held a joint cooperation mission last March, with both countries signing 11 agreements, MoUs, and action programs covering diverse topics.

Rabat – Anyone that has been keeping up with the World Cup has without a doubt seen some exciting games thus far. Maybe you’ve won some money or lost some money along the way.  Whatever the situation is, there is a very good chance that spectators keep a close eye on the Morocco and Portugal game. In fact, this game was just one of the many upsets that most fans will see throughout the entirety of this tournament.  It was so mistaken that Morocco was the better team on the field and deserved much better than to be eliminated, but they just couldn’t pull out the win against the Portugal team. With the one to zero loss the team was without a doubt heartbroken and they should be. It is no mistake that the first loss of the tournament is always a tough one, but this one was especially tough. How did this happen? Well, Portugal fans already know just how important Cristiano Ronaldo has been for their home team. And, it especially showed in this game. The game took place on a Wednesday at the Luzhniki Stadium and it was a fairly competitive one. Just four minutes into the game and Cristiano Ronaldo make history. While his performance might not have been as impressive as the one that he put on against Spain, it did make his fourth goal of the tournament thus far. The goal marked his 85th in his career and it was a header nonetheless. With this goal Ronaldo truly made history as a European player. He passed Ferenc Puskas for most international goals and is not listed as the second highest international goal scorer of all time. He is just right behind Ali Daei, who holds the record with an impressive 109 international goals. Morocco certainly did their part to keep the game interesting and competitive, but they just didn’t have what it took, despite they were probably the better team. Morocco put out waves and waves of attack in attempts to score and they did come close, but the ball just wouldn’t seem to fall through. Younes Belhanda did come extremely close to tying the game, but a miraculous save by Rui Patricio was able to deflect the attempt. Both teams have used Five Channels and other avenues to boost their annual revenues. The defender Mehdi Denatia even had a close attempt that went over the goal, but the most disappointing missed opportunity came from another attempt by Mehdi. He had a clear wide open shot and just happened to scoop it over the goal again. With this win behind them the challenges will not stop. Portugal will now face a familiar face when they battle Carlos Queiroz and the Iranian national gym. Despite their win it is safe to say that Portugal’s performance in the second half was not as impressive as the first, as they had to face some difficulties and left Rui Patricio to make some great save. The team will have to step up their game against the Iranian team if they want to advance. Sponsored Content.

By Intissar Faouzi Rabat- Turkish Head of State Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected in the first round of voting on Sunday for a new five-year term, securing 52.5 percent of the vote. The 64-year-old who has led Turkey for the past 15 years has conquered powerful opposition parties  to be re-elected in Turkey. The Turkish electoral authorities said early Monday, that Erdogan had obtained an absolute majority of the votes cast, allowing him to be elected in the first round. With more than 97 percent of the votes counted, the Election Commission Chairman Sadi Guven confirmed that Erdogan ranks the first in Turkey’s election. As for the parliamentary elections, Erdogan’s AKP achieved 42 percent of the vote. Erdogan’s closest challenger, the Social Democrat Muharrem Ince, received 30.7 percent of the vote. The anti-Erdogan alliance formed by several opposition parties for the parliamentary poll collected 34 percent of that vote, according to the partial results published by news outlet Anadolu. “The winner of this election is democracy, the national will. The winner of this election is each of the 81 million of our citizens,” said Erdogan, to his supporters gathered in Ankara in front of the AKP headquarters. Erdogan confirmed that the new phase of power will deeply allow him to treat the national and economic problems and fight Kurdish rebels in southeast Turkey as well as in neighboring Iraq and Syria. Erdogan is the most powerful and influential Turkish leader in the country since the days of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, president of Turkey from 1923 to 2938, who is known as “the founder” of modern day Turkey. Morocco and Turkey share mutual cooperation on many international issues. Both countries signed an agreement to establish a high level strategic council in 2013.

Rabat- France’s anti-terrorist police have recently arrested a gang plotting to attack Muslim people in France. The French police arrested ten individuals late on Saturday, June 23, linked to the radical far-right party who had an “ill-defined plan to commit a violent act targeting people of the Muslim faith,” French prosecutors told Agence France-Presse (AFP). France’s General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) monitored the suspects’ messages revealing that they were planning to buy weapons and target “radical Muslims.” Anti-terrorist forces then made the arrests while carrying out operations across the country, including on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica. Since early 2015, France has suffered a series of terrorist attacks, lead by terrorist rings affiliated to the Islamic terrorist group ISIS.  The previous attacks included bombings, shootings, and vans plowing into pedestrian crowds. A total of 230 people have been killed in these terrorist attacks, mainly in the capital city of Paris.

The OLM Souissi crowd was really into nostalgia! Rabat – Jamiroquai has invited the public of Rabat to his funky world. Performing at the 2018 Mawazine Festival Rhythms of the World, the British band, led by jazz singer Jay Kay, has succeeded in bringing together a crowd from the youngest to the oldest, friends, families, and colleagues who came together as one to funk it! Missing some 90’s vibe? Jamiroquai was gladly here to make us live (or relive) the golden years. “Salam Morocco,” he addressed his excited fans, before starting his very colorful and spacy concert with an electrifying performance. Jay Kay was surrounded by 5 members of his band and a female choir. Coming after the fired-up performances of Martin Garrix (June 22) and French Montana (June 23)—who said that the international stage had the“best crowd I have seen in a long time”—Jamiroquai has proven that he has nothing to envy of the new generation of artists.    Unstoppable and energetic, the band led by the British star, for nearly two hours plunged the public into an incredible trance. Furrowing the scene from side to side in a hyperactivity out of the ordinary, the artist stopped only to drink a sip of water and to interact with the crowd. “I am delighted to be here, thank you for your presence,” he repeatedly said. The nostalgic Moroccans have enjoyed the band’s anthological hits, such as “Cosmic Girl,” which was warmly requested by the audience, as well as “Now We Are Alone,” “You Give Me Something,” and “When You Gonna Learn.” Saving the best for last, Jamiroquai performed the worldwide hit song “Virtual Insanity,” in front of a crazy crowd, singing and dancing along. Having a great time on stage, the 48-year old leading singer will probably never forget his first concert in Morocco. For over a decade, Jamiroquai has proven to be one of the most influential funky bands of the 1990s generation. Having a great effect on pop culture, the very-colorful band formed in 1992, and, led by the soulman Jay Kay, rose to fame thanks to his hit single “When You Gonna Learn?” which has sold more than 2 million copies worldwide. The funky pals continue to amaze fans through the years with singles like “Cosmic Girl” and “Virtual Insanity.” Their global success can be seen in their more than 27 million album sales, 2 Grammy Awards, 5 sold-out world tours, and more than 25 years of making jazzy hits.

Rabat – Will Hervé Renard leave the national team after the World Cup? It seems that Algeria and Egypt want to recruit the French coach of Morocco’s football team. Hervé Renard made quite the impression during the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The coach of the national team had succeeded in getting the Atlas Lions qualified for the competition after 20 years’ absence. Despite the defeat of the Moroccan team against Iran and Portugal (both 1-0), Renard was praised for bringing together a talented group of players who gave it all during the games. Under contract with Morocco until 2022, Renard has received offers from the Egyptian and Algerian federations.  According to Arabic outlet Al Massae, Egypt, which will separate from coach Hector Cuper after a disappointing World Cup, is seriously thinking of recruiting Renard. As for Algeria, the president of the Algerian Football Federation (FAF), Khaireddine Zetchi, has announced that Hervé Renard is on the waiting list of potential coaches of the Algerian selection to replace coach Rabah Madjar after his departure.  Will Renard, who has coached both Côte d’Ivoire and Zambia in the past, consider the African federations’ offers? The 49-year coach has had a rough couple of days during the World Cup, especially after his altercation with US referee Mark Geiger during the Morocco-Portugal match on June 20. Renard was very upset when the referee denied Morocco three penalty kicks during the game. In addition, the referee did not use the VAR to determine whether Cristiano Ronaldo’s goal was legitimate. After the game, the teary Atlas Lions coach expressed his anger about the ‘unfair’ arbitration, feeling like victory was robbed by the referee. However, despite all the speculations, Renard, who did not answer the rumors, wants to stay focused on the last game of Morocco against Spain, today. In a pre-match press conference held yesterday in Kaliningrad, Renard said that the most difficult thing is “to play such a game, knowing that we will have to pack and go home and leave the competition.” He added that the loss is easier to accept “when you are not up to the job.”

By Chase Lacy Rabat- After Saturday’s brutal grenade attack on reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmad’s rally, reports of fatalities have surfaced. Ethiopian Health Minister Amir Aman confirmed that 2 people have died, and 156 were wounded, of which 5 are in critical condition.  Nine police officials, including the deputy head of Addis Ababa police commission, were arrested for negligence that led to the serious security lapses.  Thirty suspects have reportedly been arrested for alleged involvement in the attack. However, no groups have claimed responsibility.  The new reformist leader, who took office in April, had finished a speech to a densely packed crowd of tens of thousands at Meskel Square, when according to witnesses, an unidentified assailant wearing a police uniform attempted to hurl a grenade at the stage.  Ahmad said after the attack that there are those that seek to undermine the rally, “The people who did this are anti-peace forces. You need to stop doing this. You weren’t successful in the past and you won’t be successful in the future.” Ethiopia’s new prime minister has vowed to reform the country. Among his proposed reforms are more transparency in governance, the release of thousands of political prisoners arrested in a 2015 crackdown, opening state-owned companies to domestic and foreign investments, unblocking websites and channels, and honoring the 2000 peace agreement with Eritrea.

Rabat- Nothing could drive Z’hour Ansar away from achieving success in her baccalaureate exams, not even the fact that she does not have hands. Ansar’s courage and positive attitude have inspired Moroccan social media users. In an interview with Moroccan news site Hespress, Ansar described how she passed the baccalaureate exam, then spoke of her dreams and ambition to succeed in life and not allow her disability to get in the way. Ansar could have relied on the help of an assistant based on the Ministry of Education’s new initiative to adapt baccalaureate exams for special needs candidates. Instead, Ansar passed the exam without an assistant, using her own arms, and asked exam supervisors not to give her “simple” questions because of her disability. With a decisive look on her face, she told the interviewer: “I felt that I did not need easy questions and wanted to pass the exam just like the rest of the students around me.” Ansar passed the baccalaureate exams with non-special needs students. Ansar used the interview as an opportunity to call on authorities to install service ramps in schools across the country for special needs students using wheelchairs.  Ansar’s mother also called on parents to follow in her steps and encourage their special needs children to pursue their education. One of Ansar’s acquaintances, believed to be her teacher, said that her smile never leaves her face, thanks to her positive attitude. Ansar also participates in activities such as theater and music. Those who recounted Ansar’s story all wished that young people would make a role model of her and learn to succeed no matter the hardships. This year, 77.91 percent of special needs students passed the baccalaureate exam in the June session.

Rabat – “Best crowd I have seen in a long time” said French Montana during his concert. The 33-year old artist lit up the stage at OLM Souissi in an exceptional show. The enthusiastic crowd sang along with him, Saturday, June 23, at the 2018 Mawazine Festival and Rhythms of the World. Moroccan-American rapper French Montana has made a big comeback in his home country of Morocco, where Morocco World News attended his concert. Following Dutch artist Martin Garrix, who electrified the stage, at the festival’s opening, Friday, June 22, Karim Kharbouch, better known as French Montana, did not fail to entertain his Moroccan fans.

He continued with his well-known tracks, “Shot Caller,” “All the way up,.” and “Loyal.” Montana also sang several hits, in which he collaborated with famous artists, such as Drake, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, and Nicki Minaj. Montana’s Special Bond with Morocco The rapper, who recently acquired the US citizenship, has not forgotten where he comes from. Born in Morocco, Kharbouch spent the first 13 years of his life in Casablanca before immigrating to the US with his family, which he did not forget to mention to the crowd. “Are there people from Casablanca here?” shouted the artist before switching to interact with the crowd in Arabic. Khloe Kardashian’s ex-continued his incredible concert with his hit, “No shopping,” which he wrote in collaboration with the famous singer, Drake. He also sang “Do not panic,” “Welcome to the party,” produced for the soundtrack of the American movie Deadpool 2, and his hit single “Famous,” the video for which was shot in the blue pearl, Chefchaouen. Saving Best for Last: When the crowd began chanting”Haan,” a cult expression of the rapper, French Montana interpreted the chant as a call for his much-awaited hit song, “Unforgettable.” The song was released in collaboration with the American artist Sawae Lee and the crowd appeared to know the lyrics by heart. The backdrop included images, full of color, of Morocco and the national flag, raised to the left of the stage throughout the entire concert.  Montana also invited dancers wearing traditional Moroccan clothes to add a“Moroccan touch” and adding to the impressive scenography. Montana Expresses His Love for God, the King, and his Country: French Montana wanted to show his pride in being Moroccan. Before finishing the show, the singer, songwriter, and producer expressed his love and devotion to God, his country, and the king.  Montana thanked the Moroccan public, who he esteemed to be the “best crowd” he had seen in a long time. In Arabic, he praised the king and said how much he loved “Allah.” Montana took a picture with the crowd before leaving the stage, which he later posted on his Instagram page. “100 thousand Moroccans, who look just like me came out to show [their] love ?? I love y’all !! ??,” wrote Karim Kharbouch. The artist was later spotted at the Sofitel nightclub near the Hilton Forest. 100 thousand Morroccans that look just like me came out to show love ?? I love y’all !! ?? A post shared by  French Montana (@frenchmontana) on Jun 23, 2018 at 5:21pm PDT

Rabat – Head coach of the Moroccan national football team Hervé Renard said that his Atlas Lions will play their last match against Spain as if they were trying to qualify for the next phase of the 2018 World Cup. In a pre-match press conference held today in Kaliningrad, Renard said that the most difficult thing is “to play such a game, knowing that we will have to pack and go home and leave the competition.” He added that the loss is easier to accept “when you are not up to the job.” Morocco will play its last game on June 25. The coach, however, was in high spirit, emphasizing that the team has to be professional, especially “since we are going to play a team for which we need to be fit from a psychological point of view.”  Accompanied by goalkeeper Munir Mohand Mohamedi, Renard said: “We have to force ourselves to find something to fight for so that we can compete in the best possible psychological conditions.” For Renard, it is unjust to be “already eliminated,” recalling the injustice Morocco faced in the Portugal clash.  Renard also praised Moroccan fans, who showed support for the Moroccan national team throughout the first phase of the tournament. In the Morocco-Portugal match on June 20, US referee Mark Geiger denied Morocco three penalty kicks during the game. In addition, he refused to use the VAR to determine whether Cristiano Ronaldo’s was legitimate.  Moroccan football fans are expected to protest in a special way during the Morocco-Spain game on June 25. The fans will carry white wipes and banners with clear messages addressed to FIFA.

Rabat – The Moroccan national football team landed in Kaliningrad, Russia on June 23 ahead of their last 2018 World Cup game against Spain. The Atlas Lions will face La Roja on June 25 at the Kaliningrad stadium. Moroccan footballer Achraf Hakimi, who plays for Spain’s Real Madrid football club, is keeping his spirit up despite Morocco’s defeats against Iran and Portugal. The youngster told Spanish sports outlet Marca that the team will try to win to please Moroccan football fans, who supported the Atlas Lions in the World Cup. “We know that we are now eliminated from the World Cup, but we are going to try to leave a good impression in the World Cup, we will do this for our supporters and for all the people who support us,” said the 19-year old footballer. Hakimi also promised his fans to do his best during the last game. Speaking about Morocco’s defeats, Hakimi said that “it is football, we must move forward, we are already thinking about scoring a goal against Spain, we fought at our last matches and our supporters know it very well.” Hakimi knows that Spain will do its best on June 25 to win the game in order to qualify to the next phase of the tournament. Spain played its first match against Portugal on June 15, finishing with a draw 3-3. La Roja then played against Iran on June 20, finishing the game with a 1-0 win. During the Morocco-Spain match, Moroccan fans are expected to protest against the referees of the Morocco-Portugal game. The referees of the game denied Morocco two penalties and refused to consult the video assistant referee (var) to check the mistakes committed by Portuguese footballers. Portugal won the game played on June 20 against Morocco 1-0, owing to an early goal scored by Cristiano Ronaldo in the 4th minute. The goal should not have been allowed. Seconds before to goal, Portuguese defender, Pepe, tripped Moroccan player Khalid Boutayeb inside the penalty area.  Morocco shouted three times for penalty kicks. The first was in the 26th minute of the game when footballer Raphael Guerreiro pushed Moroccan winger Nordin Amrabat in the penalty zone. The second time was after Portuguese footballer Fonte crashed into Khalid Boutaib in the 30th minute of the game in the penalty zone. The US referee Mark Geiger also denied Morocco a deserved penalty kick at the 85th minute. As Pepe wanted to clear a ball coming from a corner, the ball hit his arm, causing the ball to change its trajectory. The fans are expected to protest in a special way, carrying white wipes or banners with clear messages addressed to FIFA. The fans also launched a petition on Thursday at Change.org to denounce the “unjust” and “unfair” arbitration in the game. The petition generated more than 52,809, aiming at 75,000.

Rabat – June 25 will be a day of mourning for Moroccan football fans as it will mark the last day for Morocco’s Atlas Lions in the 2018 World Cup. The fans who followed the Moroccan team to Russia are expected to protest against the arbitration of the Morocco-Portugal game. In a Facebook post, the Equipe National du Maroc fan page of the national football team called on Moroccan citizens in Russia to protest the arbitration “injustice” in the Portugal match by lifting banners with clear messages addressed to FIFA. “We have received many messages saying that the Moroccan fans present in Morocco-Spain match should put a badge on their arms to show our sadness and anger against FIFA and to protest against the scandalous arbitration imposed to Moroccan national team in its meeting with Portugal,” wrote the page in a post published yesterday. The post received more than 6,000 likes and was shared more than 1,300 times.  The first post by the fan page reads: “We can express  anger against the arbitration injustice in the Portugal game in an easy move:  raising white wipes or banners with clear messages to FIFA to make it a snapshot of history witnessed by the whole world.” Moroccan fans expressed dissatisfaction and anger over the “injustice” of the US referee who denied Morocco two penalty kicks in the Morocco-Portugal game.  Morocco lost to Portugal 1-0 on Wednesday, but the penalties could have changed the result and provide Morocco with a shot to move to the next phase of the 2018 World Cup. Morocco’s team will return home after their game with Spain on June 25 as the Atlas Lions are pointless after their first defeat against Iran on June 15. Saddened by Morocco’s disqualification, Moroccan football fans launched a petition on Change.org addressed to FIFA to denounce the “unfair” arbitration in the game. The petition reads: “Anyone who watched the match will realize how much unfair it was: Morocco should’ve had 2 PK [penalty kicks] but no one bothered to check the Var.”

Rabat – The Quebec government will soon open a representative office in Rabat, Morocco, by virtue of an agreement signed in Rabat on Friday, 22 June 22. Mohammed Ali Lazreq, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, and Christine St-Pierre, Canadian Minister of International Relations and La Francophonie, signed an agreement between the government of Québec and the government of Morocco concerning the establishment of the Quebec representation office in Rabat. The Ministry of International Relations and La Francophonie issued a communiqué last Friday saying that the opening of this new representation office is “proof of Quebec’s desire to strengthen its bilateral, economic and cooperation relations with Morocco.” In addition to 29 representation offices of Quebec abroad, this one will be its first representation office in North Africa and the third in Africa. The same communiqué added that this opening will also strengthen and facilitate student mobility and labor mobility. Mrs. St-Pierre confirmed that relying on immigrant labor and skills in Quebec remains a necessity for maintaining economic growth, as well as for increasing the competitiveness of businesses. “We are fortunate to have a large community of Moroccans in Quebec. More than 100,000 Moroccan people contribute daily to the advancement of Quebec society.” At the signing ceremony, Ali Lazreq said that this office will contribute to strengthening the relations of cooperation, esteem and respect, which unite the two peoples, thanks to the values of tolerance, openness, and democracy they share. “The convergence of our views on international issues, especially when it comes to issues of peacekeeping and disarmament, tripartite cooperation and the dialogue of cultures and civilizations, are just some of the expressions of our shared will to reinforce and enhance this cooperation, “he added. Mrs. St-Pierre has also met Mohamed Yatim, Minister of Labor and Occupational Integration, last Friday. The focus of their talk was primarily on human resources and talent mobility. She welcomed the very deep relations between the two areas, expressing her wish to strengthen them further by establishing new partnerships in the fields of economy, culture, and vocational training. For his part, Yatim emphasized his department’s commitment to work towards consolidating further gains, through specific trainings, which take into account the needs of the Quebec labor market, to properly qualify young people and allow them to have better professional integration. In this regard, Head of Government Saâd Eddine El Othmani held talks with Mrs. Christine St-Pierre last Friday on means to promote bilateral relations. The head of government praised the excellent relations of friendship and fruitful cooperation between the two countries, given the common human and cultural ties. Morocco is considered to be an important partner for Québec because of the long-standing bilateral, cooperative, and immigration relations that unite them. Morocco features regularly in the list of the five countries that send the most immigrants to Québec.

Rabat – Serious concerns have been raised in the longstanding Rohingya crisis following the emergence of on-site evidence of gang rapes, mass graves, and forced deportations, prompting the International Criminal Court (ICC) to push for criminal investigations of alleged atrocities. “Harrowing accounts of Rohingya women tied to trees and raped for days by Myanmar’s military and men being pushed into mass graves, doused with petrol and set alight have been sent to the International Community Court,” the Guardian reported today. The evidence was compiled and sent to ICC prosecutors by a coalition of Bangladesh organizations. Accusing the Myanmar government of forced deportation and genocide, the Bangladesh organizations urged ICC prosecutors to intervene in the issue by requesting a criminal probe into the allegations. ICC prosecutors reportedly met to discuss whether the Rohingya crisis is within the competence of the court. The court subsequently sent the government of Myanmar a criminal probe request. The Myanmar government has until July 27 to respond to the request, as well as its accompanying allegations, and demonstrate whether or not the ICC has jurisdiction over the case. The problem, however, is that Myanmar, as opposed to Bangladesh, is not a member state of the ICC, which means that the organization has no legal authority to intervene in a case that involves Myanmar. A further obstacle to the ICC’s prospective legal action is that Myanmar rejects all allegations of violence or crimes committed against Rohingyas. The country’s authorities argue that its military only made “legitimate use of force” against “illegal migrants from Bangladesh,” which is how many in the Buddhist-majority country are reported to perceive Rohingyas, who are mostly Muslims. The Myanmar government maintains that the allegations of mass rape and ethnic cleansing are part of an external plot to damage the country’s reputation in the international community. Last Wednesday, a social media account run by the office of State Councillor Aung San Suu Kyi, whom many have described as “Myanmar’s de facto leader,” dismissed the allegations as “hate narratives from outside the country,” aiming to fuel social tensions within Myanmar. Despite the legal and political obstacles in its way, the ICC is pushing towards investigation into alleged atrocities. Fatou Ben Souda, the court’s chief prosecutor, believes that the cross-border component of the Rohingya crisis, particularly the “forced deportations” part, gives the ICC legal leeway. She argues that the ICC has territorial jurisdiction when deportations happen between a country that is an ICC member state and another country that is not. Other important voices in the legal world have welcomed the prospect of an ICC investigation (and possible prosecution) in the Rohingya issue. They argue that the organization’s move is much overdue, as the ICC’s mandate is to condemn and “punish crimes against humanity.” Sir Geoffrey Nice, a British lawyer who was involved with the ICC in the case of killings and atrocities in former Yugoslavia, told the Guardian that the court “must be brave and accept it has jurisdiction and ensure that these crimes are properly investigated.” He said that not prosecuting would “be a huge setback for justice and undermine the court’s very authority.” UN estimates suggest that more than 700,000 Rohingyas have fled Myanmar in the wake of state-sponsored militant attacks, systemic violence, and a military crackdown as long ago as August 2017. The UN describes the plight of Rohingyas as an ethnic cleansing “bearing all the hallmarks of genocide.”

Rabat– Morocco’s Lions will play against Spain on June 25 wearing the Adidas white kits that were strongly criticized online for being “ugly” before the World Cup tournament. The Atlas Lions wore the new red-green Adidas kits to their opening match with Iran and their second one with Portugal, after which they were eliminated for not scoring a goal against either teams during the World Cup group stage, losing both games.  The national team has decided to exit the tournament wearing the first version of their Adidas kits, white kits with red and green accents, representing the Moroccan flag and the symbol of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF). Many Moroccans were unimpressed with the previous Adidas design and took to social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, to express disappointment and mockery, describing the kit as “ugly” and pajama-like.  Some of them even pondered boycotting Adidas, drawing from the Moroccan-made product boycott in protest of the high prices of Sidi Ali (bottled water), Afriquia (gasoline), and Centrale Danone (dairy products). Much to the Moroccans’ disappointment, Adidas had delayed official release of the design until April 27. “So this is the design they spent like forever to come up with?” wrote one commenter on an MWN article. “UGLY .. they took forever to release it and the result is this !!! such a disappointment,” another one commented. As a response to Moroccans’ distaste, Adidas had decided to make a new design that would appeal to the Moroccan public. Still, the new design also received a small share of criticism. “This is for the kingdom of Polska not Morocco!” an MWN follower said on Facebook. “I like the first one more. I like simple it’s about how they will play and not what they will wear,” another one argued. The national team’s performance during the two first matches has made Moroccans proud and has been internationally recognized and described as “commendable” and “outstanding,” albeit their 0-1 loss to both Iran and Portugal teams. Morocco will play Spain on June 25, their final and expectantly unforgettable World Cup 2018 game.

Rabat – Kadim Al Sahir has once again worked his magic during the opening of the 2018 Mawazine Festival Rhythms of the World, Friday, June 23, at the oriental stage of Nahda. The not-to-be-missed artist has resurrected the most beautiful poems of Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani in front of an amazed crowd. The Iraqi artist, who has become a regular at this major artistic and cultural event, has drawn from his rich repertoire to gratify the crowd of an unforgettable show with hits such as “Wa Nasito Dai,” “Inni Khayartoki Fakhtari,” “Madrasat al Hob,” “Akrahoha,” or “Zidini Ichkan.” The artist transported the audience to the world of pure love and disinterest, but also generosity, giving fans the opportunity to make requests for him to interpret a particular song. Kadim is considered a master of Arabic song and one of the most praised artists in the Arab world, making his concert an event not to miss. The artist is known for his rich discography, ranging from romantic ballads to extremely political work. The Iraqi artist is making his fifth appearance at Mawazine after remarkable performances in 2009, 2011, 2014, and 2016. The 60-year-old icon has marked the spirits with his majestic presence and haunting mastery of the smallest details and subtleties of Arabic music and song. He has once again proved his greatness by delivering an incredible show which will remain engraved forever in the festival-goers’ memory. Kadim gave a special gift to his Moroccan fans. He performed an unpublished song called “Henniya Henniya” written and composed by Kadim himself. The public was also shown songs from his latest album, including “Koni Imraatan Khatira,” “Ween Akoune,” and “My Bayna Hobbin wa Hobbi.” Kadim Al Sahir started her artistic career in 1989. He rose to fame in 1995 with the song “Ha Habibi,” which was awarded the prize of the best Arabic song at the first edition of the Cairo Festival of Arabic Song. He has since received several international awards and prizes, including the Unicef Prize for his song “Dalaâ.”

Washington D.C – Moroccans are crying foul against the Federation Internationale of Football Association (FIFA) and demand explanations for the non-use of the VAR system during the Morocco-Portugal match on Wednesday. A petition was launched on Thursday to demand that FIFA replay the match and undo the injustices that the referees inflicted on Morocco. The petition, which as of now has been signed by 48,000 people, accuses the world’s football governing body of using the VAR only for powerful countries. Millions of fans and experts around the world were astonished to witness the injustice that American referee Mark Geiger committed against Morocco in at least three instances. First, in the goal scored by Cristiano Ronaldo at the fourth minute, which should not have been allowed. Right before the Portuguese striker scored the winning goal, his teammate, Pepe, committed a clear foul against Moroccan player Khalid Boutaib. The foul was so clear that it warranted the use of the VAR to determine whether Pepe committed a foul before Ronaldo’s goal. Despite Moroccan players and their head coach’s protests, the referee had a different opinion and decided to allow the goal. The decision of the referee was in total disregard of FIFA’s own rules. In page 14 of its document “Law 12 Fouls and Misconducts,” FIFA says clearly that “referees are reminded to make an early intervention and to deal firmly with holding offences, especially inside the penalty area at corner kicks and free kicks.” And when these offences happen while the ball is in play, the referee should award a direct free kick or a penalty kick. But nothing of these rules were applied despite the clear foul committed against the Moroccan player before Ronaldo’s goal. To add insult to injury, the American referee overlooked two clear penalties in Morocco’s favor. The first one was again a clear foul against Moroccan striker Khalid Boutaib. At the 30th minute of the match, the Moroccan player was openly pushed from the back inside the penalty area, a foul deserving of a penalty kick. Once again, despite Moroccan players’ insistence on the use of the VAR, the referee, who was just meters away from the action, overlooked the foul and decided to deprive Morocco of the use of this technology. The referees’ injustice against Morocco did not stop there. At the 85th minute, Portuguese defender Pepe was again at the center of an action that should have been cause for a penalty kick in Morocco’s favor. As Pepe was trying to clear a ball coming from a corner, the ball hit his arm, causing the ball to change its trajectory. In accordance with FIFA rules, when the ball touches the hand of the player and changes the trajectory of the ball, a penalty kick must be given to the opposing team. But once again, the American referee overlooked this foul and refused to use the VAR. Several renowned experts, referees, and managers have denounced the prejudice with which the American referee treated Morocco throughout the entire game. Commenting after the match on beIN Sports France, Arsene Wenger, Arsenal’s former head coach, said the American referee deprived the Moroccan team from two penalty kicks. The same opinion was expressed by former Senegalese star Hadji Diouf, former French player Marcel Desailly, former French player and coach Luis Fernandez, and former Italian striker Christian Vieri. “We understand the attitude of Hervé Renard. Video refereeing has been put in place to avoid this. It was not used as it should have been,” said Fernandez. “I think the anger of the coach after the match was acceptable,” he added. Other experts have also denounced the poor performance of the American referee. Speaking to Italian TV station Mediaset, Italian referee Mauro Bergonzi said that the American referee deprived Morocco of a deserved penalty after Portuguese player Fonte pushed Moroccan player Khaled Boutaib from the back at the 30th minute. The Italian referee said that that mistake was the “most serious” so far in the World Cup. Referees’ mistakes in football matches are very common and there have been many instances in the past where teams were wronged by the referees. But what makes the pill bitter for Moroccans and millions of fans around the world is that the Moroccan team was the victim of outrageous refereeing injustices in the presence of the VAR. More still, what angers Moroccans the most is that the VAR was used in several litigious actions in this World Cup, playing a determinant role in defining the results of many matches. We have all witnessed how Australia benefited from two penalties in two matches through the use of the VAR. The first one was against France, allowing it to level the score, though it eventually lost 2-1. The second one was against Denmark. Australia is still alive in this competition thanks to a penalty kick that allowed it to snatch a precious draw against Denmark. Other teams, such as France, Spain, Costa Rica, and Mexico also benefited from the use of the VAR in actions that were less clear than the actions overlooked by the American referee in the Morocco-Portugal match. Before the installation of the VAR system, FIFA said repeatedly that it was meant to avoid the injustices that many teams suffered in the past because of monumental mistakes by many referees around the world. However, it seems that this video technology was not put in place to make this sport fairer. It was put in place to favor what many consider as “big” nations. One wonders what would have been the decisions of the American referee if those fouls were committed by Morocco. In that scenario, there is no doubt that the goal would have been disallowed and Portugal would have been given two penalty kicks. The performance of the American referee, his inglorious resume, and the timing of the match raise many questions about the integrity of FIFA. One could just wonder why FIFA would appoint a referee who was already involved in similar cases. Mark Geiger has some precedents in assassinating the hopes and dreams of other nations. In the semi-final of the Gold Cup match pitting Mexico against Panama in July 2015, Geiger vanquished the dreams of Panama’s fans to reach the final of the competition because of his glaring mistakes. The scandalous performance of the American referee caused Panama to lose the match in the most ignominious manner. Why appoint a referee who has committed such injustices in the past and was even accused of match-fixing? Many are wondering whether there was a deliberate intention from FIFA’s President, Gianni Infantino, to eliminate Morocco from the World Cup. Millions of Moroccans around the world tend to believe that the FIFA president was not pleased by the pressure Morocco put on him before the vote on the 2026 World Cup bid, and he retaliated against the team. It was clear since the beginning of the bidding process to host the 2026 World Cup that Infantino was in favor of the United 2026 North American bid. Infantino was indebted to the Americans who allowed him to become FIFA’s head, following the forced departure of former President Sepp Blatter. Infantino intended to eliminate Morocco before reaching the voting stage. However, Morocco’s pressure and the media campaign it launched forced Infantino to allow the Morocco 2026 bid to reach the final stage. The poor performance of the American referee against Morocco is raising serious questions, putting the credibility of FIFA on the line. We may never know if there was a deliberate intent to harm Morocco. But one thing is certain: the outpouring of solidarity with Morocco following its match against Portugal shows that millions of fans around the world are convinced that FIFA’s main concern is not fair play, but marketing. Fans are aware of FIFA’s obsession with making more money after each competition. Obviously, for big sponsors who look for more ratings and earnings than fair play, having a player like Cristiano Ronaldo eliminated from the first round of the World Cup would deal a hard blow to the whole competition, causing a steep drop in ratings and earnings. In the face of the selective use of FIFA’s rules in this World Cup and its total disregard for the so-called small teams, the African Football Confederation (CAF) should raise its voice and play its role in defending the interests of its members. CAF President Ahmad Ahmad should denounce in clear terms the injustice inflicted on Morocco and call on FIFA to enforce its rules equally on all teams participating in the World Cup. What happened to Morocco in this competition may happen to other African teams in the future. Therefore, it is incumbent on all African members of FIFA to speak with one voice and demand that the World’s football governing body treats African teams with respect and justice.

By Chase Lacy Rabat – A grenade was launched today at the rally of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Addis Ababa.  The new reformist leader, who took office in April, had finished a speech to a densely packed crowd of tens of thousands at Meskel Square when an unidentified assailant attempted to hurl a grenade at the stage.  Prime Minister Abiy announced there had been fatalities, however his Chief of Staff, Fitsum Arega, claimed on Twitter that there were no deaths, but 83 were seriously injured. The police said that at least 100 were wounded.  Abiy said after the attack that there are those that seek to undermine the rally, “The people who did this are anti-peace forces. You need to stop doing this. You weren’t successful in the past and you won’t be successful in the future.” Ethiopia’s new prime minister has vowed to bring reforms to Ethiopia. Among his proposed reforms are more transparency in governance, the release of thousands of prisoners, opening state-owned companies to domestic and foreign investment, and honoring the 2000 peace agreement with Eritrea.  Ethiopia and Eritrea have had a tumultuous relationship for decades. Eritrea fought a long and brutal war for its independence in 1991, and another costly and bloody war with Ethiopia between 1998 and 2000, when the peace agreement was finally signed. However, Ethiopia until now has refused to implement the agreement until additional rounds of talks were held. Per the agreement, Ethiopia is to cede the border town of Badme to Eritrea, a move fiercely contested by local residents who say they refuse to leave their homes.

Rabat – Activist Fadwa Rajouani has written a letter in response to a recent publication by detained journalist Taoufik Bouachrine, in which he expresses sadness over missing his son’s birthday. While she said she feels sorry for his son, Rajouani strongly condemned Bouachrine’s alleged rapes as “unacceptable”, expressing her heartbreak for the pregnant complainant in the case. Several women, including a pregnant woman, lodged complaints against Bouachrine in February, accusing him of “violent rape, human trafficking, and sexual harassment.” This week, the journalist addressed a letter, shared widely by news outlets, to express sadness for missing his son’s seventh birthday and shared with readers his suffering for being away from his son, who is confused due to the unexplainable absence of his father. While Rajouani sympathized with Bouachrine’s young child, who is “loaded with questions about his father’s absence, she wondered if Bouachrine felt the same way when he was raping the pregnant complainant. On her Facebook page, Rajouani wrote a post full of literary expressions, trying to make the readers imagine the impact of the rape scene on the unborn child. Rajouani asked rhetorically if the defendant owes an apology to the little baby girl, who “was groaning in her mother’s womb?” Criticizing Bouachrine’s letter to his son, the human rights activist said “do you feel a pang of conscience only when it is about your offspring and kin, but not when it is about the victim’s children?” For the five months of his arrest, Bouachrine has been denying the charges against him during his trial. According to his lawyers, the charges are a “conspiracy.” During his arrest, police authorities seized more than 50 videos, which allegedly document sexual assault, rape, and violence against the complainants, who worked in his office. The defense team, however, condemned the allegations and said the videos were “falsified.” For Rajouani, the arrest of Bouachrine is the “justice of God.” “What prevented you from meeting your son Reda is neither the law, the bars of the prison nor the jailer, but rather the oppressed prayers to God for the injustice they are suffering.” Rajouani said that the baby of the pregnant complainant will be haunting Bouachrine for life. “The infant spoke on behalf of all mothers and said: You will always owe me a letter of apology no matter what the court convicted you of or claimed your innocence.” Slamming Bouachrine’s claims of innocence, the activist called on the journalist to not “blame the law” for his deeds. “You know that the “couch” was the cause of your downfall; and that your back was bent because your conscience was absent,” she said. Bouachrine’s wife, Asmae Bouachrine, opened up about her husband’s case for the first time in March, emphasizing that she has full confidence in her husband. “Of course, I will remain in solidarity with my husband, 1000 percent,” she said, adding that an investigation will prove her husband is innocent. “The case remains “mysterious” and “subject to rumors.” But, she said “it does not bother me, I know myself and I know Taoufik too.” She also said that it remained to be seen whether the videos are true or were falsified.

Rabat – The Moroccan Ministry of the Interior has launched a campaign to replace local authorities in various Moroccan cities and towns. According to the Ministry of the Interior, the move comes as a follow-up to King Mohammed VI’s instructions to equip Morocco with a modernized and responsive public administration. On Wednesday this week, King Mohammed VI addressed a Royal Order to the Interior Ministry urging it to devise a new system of recruitment of public officials based on “merit, competence, and equal opportunities.” Of the 1,574 people concerned with the ministry’s move to reshuffle administrative representation in cities across the country, some officials been promoted to higher offices, while others have been fired “for grave errors in the exercise of their duties.” In a recent press release, the Interior Ministry explained the reasons for the move in terms of “the necessity to reinvigorate and reorganize” the Moroccan public administration. The move mainly concerns public officials who have worked for four years or more in the same position. According to the statement, the move is a structured shift aiming to bring more dynamism by making public officials more accountable and more responsive to citizens’ demands. “This operation is a partial redeployment measure that will seek to establish a match between positions [in public offices] and skills, fill vacant positions, and meet social and health concerns.” 212 officials have been promoted to high public offices, including: 22 former pashas, presidents of city councils, and chairpersons of district councils promoted to secretary-general; 163 caids promoted to pasha and city councilor; and 27 khalifs promoted to caid. Meanwhile, whereas 114 new graduates of the Royal Institute of Administration have been integrated in public offices, 110 former administrative authorities have been punished for both “disciplinary reasons and lack of respect for their mandates and duties as state representatives.” This included cases of revocation, firing, demotion, as well as written reproach and warnings. The statement also pointed out that this “vast operation of administrative reconstitution” is in line with King Mohammed VI’s plan to rebuild the Moroccan administration by promoting excellence and inclusiveness. It said that the main objective remains to ensure a culture of “responsive, accountable, and competent” public service.

Rabat – Morocco’s currency reforms have contributed to more economic stability and promoted an attractive business climate for international investors.  Citi shared with Morocco World News its vision for growth in the North African country. Morocco’s strategy to expand its footprint in Africa and make itself the gateway of the continent has drawn the attention of foreign investors. Flavio Figueiredo, Citibank Global Head of Foreign Exchange Corporate Sales, told MWN in an interview that King Mohammed VI’s strategy has been reaping benefits and described the country’s economy as “stable.” He added that the “King has been working to diversify [the] economy into different sectors.”  Figueiredo also discussed Citi’s strategy with MWN. Mr. Figueiredo said that the bank’s plan has for a long time been to “leverage” the institution’s “footprints globally” and to  “connect with our clients who have global presence and to expand into the world.” Impacts of foreign exchange reform Citi’s regional footprint, according to Figueiredo, enables the company to help its clients to “expand into the region and expand their businesses in the region.” Figueiredo also talked about foreign exchange reform. “We’ve seen many countries stabilizing their economies and becoming stronger as they have been trying to adopt? more flexible strategies through floating their currencies and making the flow of the capital more freely accessible to locals and foreign investors.” He added that the reform also attracts foreign investors. “I think the currency regime change implemented by the Kingdom is very important to attract foreign capitals and increase their flow into the country as it comes freely convertible.” Morocco announced its decision to launch a flexible exchange rate for the dirham currency on January 12, 2018. Digitalization and banking Digitalization has become an important aspect in the banking industry. “It is the future of banking. Technology is driving the banking industry today. You can’t think of a bank without thinking of technology,” Figueiredo said. He added that banks have to evolve and expand their technology and their capabilities. “Clients are more and more interacting with banks in different digital forms. People don’t go to branches nowadays; it’s all online.” Figueiredo evidenced his arguments on Citi’s longstanding expertise in markets and foreign exchange. “The pace of change is faster than ever. Globally, more than 50 percent of our? corporate or non-financial clients probably interact with us electronically. The digitalization of markets has shifted clients’ requirements for greater visibility, control, and automation. Having that ability to provide our services through digital means is crucial for the future,” he said. MWN also spoke with Mounir Belkouch, Markets Head for Citibank Maghreb, about the challenges the company faces and the benefits of dirham liberalization. Reiterating Figueiredo’s comments on Morocco’s strategy, Belkouch said that Morocco’s strategies “have significantly improved the business climate and the country’s attractiveness for foreign investments.” He added that the country has made significant progress in strengthening its “macroeconomic fundamentals and maintaining the FX reserve, while keeping inflation and [the] interest rate at a low level.” For Belkouch, these aspects contributed to make Morocco “a hub for investments of large multinational corporates in the region.” Belkouch added that “Citi, which is the go-to bank” for international firms in Morocco, “has an estimated market share of 30 percent.” Role of Citi in Morocco and services The markets head at Citi said, “Our role is to leverage the local teams’ and the bank’s international experiences in order to assist local corporates to better understand the constraints of the local market, the risks, and the regulations.”  The company offers its advisory services to public sector companies and trade finance and treasury services for banks. “We continue to focus on growth and being the best bank globally through launching new products to enhance client loyalty and onboard new clients, as well as provide added value market analysis.” According to Belkouch, Citi provides clients with updated and reliable information related to their market activity.  Belkouch also commented on the dirham currency liberalization and the effect on the value of the currency. Belkouch said that since the implementation of liberalization, the local currency “has shown a great resilience and stability and has sometimes slightly appreciated against EUR and USD.” Belkouch, however, believes that the value of the dirham “within the current boundaries will depend on the country’s foreign currency inflows/outflows and current account in the near future.”

The energetic Dutch DJ, Martin Garrix, has offered a spectacular show that the festival-goers will probably never forget. Morocco World News was there to tell you all about it. It is 9 p.m at the OLM Souissi stage near the Hilton forest and the Sofitel hotel, and the crowd is starting to get impatient. To pass time, the Moroccan fans of Martin Garrix have set the mood by shouting his name and singing. The Atlas Lions were not forgotten during this first day of the festival. Leaving the 2018 World Cup competition, the national team was cheered up by Mawazine’s crowd who raised their flag and shouted Amrabat’s, Bouhaddouz’s, and Dirar’s name while singing the national anthem.  The excited crowd also had a lot to say regarding the first night of the festival.  Talking to MWN, Driss, 21, said that he was here to meet his “idol,” Martin Garrix. “I have been waiting for this moment for too long now. I’m feeling so impatient to see one of the best DJ in the world performing live in front of me, it is a dream come true.” Meryam, 18, told MWN that she is celebrating her graduation from high school. “My parents offered me Martin Garrix’s tickets as a gift to reward me for my good grades, I could not be happier.” As for Ali, 23, he is a Mawazine regular, as he doesn’t miss a single concert. “I am used to come to Mawazine, I attend all the concerts. It is such an incredible thing to have big festival like Mawazine, I wouldn’t miss it for the world.” A warm up by Justin Mylo: If his name doesn’t sound familiar, it probably will now after his set. Justin Mylo, a close friend to Martin Garrix and a DJ and producer, has prepared the crowd, opening the concert for Garrix with a song called “Cheap Motel” and a remix of the famous track “Closer” by the Chainsmokers.  Mylo succeeded in keeping the crowd entertained with half an hour of pure excitement.  Crowd goes crazy for sensational Garrix: “Salam Alaykoum Morocco,” said Garrix before starting off his set. The worldwide DJ dropped the first notes of his famous track “Forever,” firing up an unbelievable crowd who started to dance and sing along with the artist.

He sublimated his fingers on the turntables, transforming it into a tool of a haunting musical creation in a show mixing electronic music with lighting and pyrotechnic effects.  The DJ offered the Moroccan audience a 90-minute set of madness, with songs like “Turn up the Speakers” produced in collaboration with DJ Afrojack, “Virus (How about Now)” produced with the DJ MOTi, and his famous song “Lions in the wild,” a collaboration with the duo Third Party.

The Dutchman also delighted his audience with his reference tube “Animals,” which became a worldwide success, as well as with his titles “In the Name of Love” and “Ocean,” before intensifying the tempo thanks to his hits, such as The Weeknd’s “Can’t Feel my Face” or Calvin Harris’ “How Deep is Your Love.”  Garrix’s show praised: The opening of the 17th Mawazine Festival and Rhythms of the World has kept all its promises, bringing together a large audience. On social media, people seemed to be satisfied by the DJ’s performance.  “I’m not a fan of electronic music but I have to admit that Martin Garrix’s show was exceptional,” “It was amazing, best concert I have seen in my life,” wrote people on social media.

In five years’ time, Garrix has already made it to stardom following the release of his songs “BFAM” and “Just Some Loops” and was named “the world’s top DJ” by DJ Mag’s annual Top 100 DJs poll for 2016-2017, making him “the youngest ever recipient of the award.” Martin Garrix has prepared the stage for more artists to come. Big names of the international music industry will perform at the OLM Souissi stage, including French Montana, who will be singing tonight, Jamiroquai (June 24), Niska and Damso (June 25), The Chainsmokers (June 26), Bruno Mars (June 27), Texas (June 28), The Weekend (June 29), and Luis Funsi (June 30), who will close this years’ festival.

Rabat – Italian referee Mauro Bergonzi has joined the list of people who have heavily criticized FIFA and the referees of the Morocco-Portugal World Cup game over their failure to use the video assistant referee (VAR). While VAR has been used in this World Cup to assist referees throughout the competition, Morocco was deprived of its chances to use the technology on June 20 to contest mistakes made by Portuguese footballers. Bergonzi told Italian television Mediaset that the American referee, Mark Geiger, denied Morocco a deserved penalty kick after Portuguese footballer Fonte crashed into Khalid Boutaib in the 30th minute of the game in the penalty zone. Morocco asked for VAR technology to be used after the alleged mistake, but the referee refused Morocco’s demand. Fonti’s criticized intervention was not the only mistake made by the Portuguese team in the game. In the 26th minute of the match, footballer Raphael Guerreiro pushed Moroccan winger Nordin Amrabat in the penalty zone. The footballer and other Moroccan footballers then asked the referee to check the VAR, but his request was not obliged. After the game, Morocco’s coach Hervé Renard and his Atlas Lions expressed disappointment over the lack of VAR technology in the game. In a statement to the press, Amrabat questioned the fair play during the game and said that Geiger asked for Portugal’s Ronaldo’s kit, a violation of FIFA rules. “This is the World Cup, it’s not a circus,” Amrabat told the Netherlands news service NOS.  FIFA, however, denied the allegations, emphasizing that its referees “are under clear instructions with regard to their behavior and relationship with the teams and it can be confirmed that Mr Geiger has acted in an exemplary and professional manner as an appointed match official.” The impacts of VAR in the 2018 World Cup and in the Morocco-Portugal game specifically have made international news headlines recently. VAR was used in several other games, including the Australia-Denmark game. The technology awarded a penalty for Australia to score an equalizer. The referee’s choice not to use VAR in the June 20 game pushed Moroccan fans to launch a petition to FIFA. The petition, on Change.org, has generated more than double the signatures it first called for, and now has over 34,000. The petition reads: “Anyone who watched the match will realize how much unfair it was: Morocco should’ve had 2 PK [penalty kicks] but no one bothered to check the Var.”

Rabat- Israeli fans have denied allegations that Moroccan fans tried to snatch their flag at Morocco-Portugal World Cup match on Wednesday, saying that the media reports were “fake news.” Following the end of the World Cup match between Morocco and Portugal on Wednesday, a video showing Moroccan fans tugging at an Israeli flag held by Israeli fans in the stands led viewers to assume that the Moroccan fans were attacking them. Several international news outlets reported about how Morocco’s 0-1 defeat to Portugal had Moroccan fans lash out at Israelis and attack their flag. Some even suggested that the fans’ display was to condemn the Gaza massacre where dozens of Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers. However, the Israeli fans told Israeli television channel Kan that Moroccan fans were very friendly towards them and the fight shown in the footage was over the Atlas Lions’ captain Mehdi Benatia’s jersey. After the match ended, Benatia threw his jersey to the Moroccan fans close to Israeli fans who clarified that Moroccan fans were tugging on the flag to reach the jersey. “There was a great atmosphere during the game. Everyone welcomed us,” one of the fans told Kan, reported the Times of Israel news site.

Rabat- Ahead of the Spain vs. Morocco match to be played on June 25, Spain’s Barcelona veteran midfielder Sergio Busquets has said that Morocco will make it difficult for the Spanish national squad to win the game and become leader of Group B. Busquets, who was speaking to the Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo after his country’s 1-0 win over Iran on June 20, said that the general perception in the Spanish squad is that Morocco is a serious challenger, as the Atlas Lions outperformed both Portugal and Iran despite losing to both teams by one-nil. La Roja, as the Spanish team is known, wants to top Group B to have a relatively easier match in the round of 16. But Busquets, who acknowledged the tactical depth and technical quality of the Moroccan national squad, said that the African side will pose a serious obstacle in Spain’s way to achieving Group B leadership. “I think Morocco played better than Iran and Portugal, but they are already eliminated,” the Spaniard declared, hinting at the possibility of a less intense Moroccan performance in their match against Spain. “The most important thing in the group phase is to always secure victory. I hope we will claim the three points against Morocco, but it will be a very difficult task because they have a team that plays well with the ball.” Although the Atlas Lions’ first two appearances at the 2018 World Cup boasted a delightful football of high pressure and possession that captivated football fans within and without Morocco, winning them the respect and admiration of many observers, their two losses against Iran and Portugal have prematurely put them out of the 2018 Russia World Cup. But Hervé Renard, Morocco’s French coach, said after the 1-0 defeat against Portugal that his side will try to go down in bravery and finish the World Cup with honor.  “Moroccans are very proud of their national team,” the Frenchman said, explaining that his men will play against Spain feeling entrusted with the task of “keeping that pride and honor.” With Spain dreaming of finishing at the top of Group B and Hervé Renard urging his squad to “leave the Word Cup with honor,” the Kaliningrad match on June 25 promises some high quality and beautiful football between two sides, whose playing styles at this tournament bear strong resemblance to each other.

By Chase Lacy Rabat – What is #Keepfamiliestogether? It is a hashtag that represents the fury in the US and internationally over the US policy of separating the families of asylum seekers and irregular immigrants since the “zero-tolerance” policy went into effect in April. As US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, “illegally entering this country will not be rewarded, but will instead be met with full prosecutorial power of the Department of Justice. Between April and May, 1,995 children were separated from their parents. While parents are prosecuted as criminal offenders for crossing the border, their minors are sent to relatives already in the US or to shelters.  At the shelters, children have been kept in cages, distraught, crying, and begging for their parents. To make conditions worse, staff have been prohibited from physically consoling the children.  The official “ports of entry” have been excruciatingly slow and turned away scores of people. Many of those detained have crossed the border illegally, and even those that applied for asylum after crossing are being prosecuted as criminals.  Article 13 of the Refugee Convention says that states shall not criminalize those seeking asylum, whether they have entered illegally or not.  Even the US Department of Homeland Security’s own guidelines state that “Any individual processed for removal, including those who are criminally prosecuted for illegal entry, may seek asylum or other protection available under law.” Under the Obama administration the separation of families did occur in some cases, however, under the Trump administration, the practice has become systematic. Under the current policy, however, there are no priorities, and even those with misdemeanors are subject to criminal prosecution.  The ugly paradigm is that these children are identified as unaccompanied minors and resettled in the US, while their parents are prosecuted and potentially deported without the ability to locate or contact their children.  The Trump administration has claimed that their hands are tied by the law regarding the separation of families, though none of these laws necessitated the separation of families. President Trump’s claim he was tied by congressional inaction was discredited on Wednesday by his executive order to end separations.

Rabat –  The International Festival of African Fashion (FIMA) has announced that the 2018 festival will be held in Dakhla from November 21-24, 2018. The event is expected to gather thousands of fashion professionals, artists, journalists, and other participants to celebrate the creativity and diversity of the African continent, said the organizers. As it coincides with FIMA’s 20th anniversary, the event will focus on pan-Africanism and shared African cultural references. This year’s FIMA will also be the first to be celebrated outside of Niger, which has hosted the event since its inception in 1998. According to the organizers, the change of setting pays tribute to the continued financial and moral support the Moroccan government has lent to the development of Pan-African culture and art, as well as intra-African political and economic integration. In addition to celebrating the continent’s creativity, FIMA also aims to push towards the “consolidation of African integration and South-South cooperation, in line with the event’s slogan: Peace, Culture, and Development,” according to a press release. While FIMA has always promoted African fashion and “modes of being,” this year’s festival will put a particular emphasis on “culture and art as important ingredients of African integration.”

Rabat –  Moroccan former footballer Youssouf Hadji hopes that French coach Herve Renard will stay with Morocco’s national football team. In an interview with SoFoot, the former international footballer emphasized he wants Renard to “stay” with the Atlas Lions “even if he is asked to.” “He has qualified Morocco for the World Cup, he has made a good CAN in Gabon….  he’s been working well since he’s here, he’s a very good coach, we need continuity, not to question everything because there was an elimination at the first World Cup phase.”  “Moroccan fans are connoisseurs, I think they saw that the selection did their best in Russia, obviously it would be good to finish on a positive note against Spain, because starting with three defeats would be hard.” Morocco will play its last 2018 World Cup game against Spain on June 25. Some Moroccan fans blamed Renard’s choice to exchange some players with others during the game for the team’s defeat. Some fans wanted the coach to make Amine Harit play during the Morocco-Portugal game, while others complained when Renard exchanged Khalid Boutaib with Ayoub El Kaabi and Younes Belhanda with Mehdi Carcela. Last year, BBC Sports reported that Morocco extended Renard’s contract to 2022. Renard helped the Moroccan team reach the final stage of the World Cup after a successful World Cup qualifier. In 2015, Renard also led Cote D’Ivoire at the Africa Cup of Nations. Three years earlier, he won the same title with Zambia.

By Chase Lacy Rabat- Forces loyal to Libya’s renegade general Khalifa Haftar claim they have recaptured the Ras Lanuf and Sidra oil terminals taken last week by Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) and militias, a claim denied by the PFG.  The oil terminals in Libya’s northeastern oil crescent came under heavy fighting after Ibrahim Jadhran, head of the PFG, claimed in a video he had formed an alliance to retake the terminals. Jadhran’s PFG controlled the terminals from the overthrow of the late Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 until September 2016, when Haftar’s Libyan National Army seized them.  The National Oil Corporation (NOC) said that on Saturday storage tanks had sustained “significant damage.” Two storage tanks destroyed by fires have reduced Ras Lanuf’s storage capacity by 400,000 barrels.  Mustafa Sanalla, head of NOC, said the fighting “will ultimately result in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in construction costs and billions in lost sale revenue.” Output has been reduced by 450,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) plus 70 million cubic feet of natural gas by the recent fighting, resulting in a loss of USD 33 million in revenue.  Libya is in desperate need of its oil revenue for reconstruction and social prosperity efforts. During the Gaddafi era, Libya produced 1.6 million bpd. After the 2011 revolution it dropped to 20 percent of this figure, but gradually recovered to over one million bpd by the end of 2017.  Libya, since the fall of Gaddafi, has undergone successive turmoils. Khalifa Haftar controls the majority of Eastern Libya, in opposition to the internationally recognised government based in Tripoli. Huge swaths of the country are still controlled by local militias, and parts are controlled by ISIS.  Haftar’s forces believe the attack was to hurt their main source of income, and that the PFG were supported by the Tripoli government. In the meantime, Haftar’s LNA is engaged in an offensive to take Derna, the last coastal city in the east that Haftar has not captured. LNA believe the attack on the oil terminals could be meant to distract from the Derna conflict. The destabilization of Libya is especially concerning for European nations that have received millions of migrants and refugees who set off from Libyan shores. Currently in Libya there are an estimated 700,000-1 million migrants, and the Libyan authorities have not adequately created facilities for these people.  There are additional worries over human rights abuses that have become commonplace in Libya, such as slave markets, as revealed in an undercover report by CNN.

Rabat – The Gnaoua festival has already worked its magic on Essaouira. The city of wind has vibrated on the sound of magical Gnaoua music coming from Moulay El Hassan Place for the first evening of the Gnaoua World Music Festival. From June 21 until June 23, the 21st Gnaoua World Music Festival is a musical communion full of emotions, as much for the artists as for the public. This year’s festival has followed the tradition, starting with a colorful opening parade from Maâlems (Gnaoua singers) in Essaouira’s Bab Doukkala. The ceremony was attended by André Azoulay, adviser to the King and founding president of the Essaouira-Mogador Association, and Neila Tazi, the event’s producer. The show has kicked off with a mesmerizing encounter between the legendary American jazz fusion band Snarky Puppy and the unbeatable Maâlem Gnaoui Hamid El Kasri, who together delighted the festival-goers with fresh and resounding melodies, the fruit of a four-day artistic residency in Essaouira. Through exclusive compositions, Snarky Puppy, a collective accustomed to collaborating with artists of all stripes, conquered the music lovers who danced and sang relentlessly to the new rhythms brought to the most famous songs by Maâlem Hamid El Kasri, such as “La Illaha Illa Lah”, “Bania,” or “Assalat Ala Nabi.” “Being able to play, like tonight, alongside great musicians and spend several days learning new things from them is an incredible opportunity,” said Snarky Puppy’s bassist and composer Michael League to the MAP. “Gnaoua music has a particular spiritual significance that submerges the body and makes it go into a trance,” the three-time Grammy award winner added. A new generation of maâlems from Casablanca, made up of Ismael Rahil, Brahim Hamam and Khalid Sansi, were then invited to the mythical scene, located between the beach and the old medina of the port city, to give a warm show, shouting loudly that a Tagnaouite (Gnaoua) youth is there to ensure the succession of this oral heritage. Following the energetic band, the Moroccan group of fusion rock, hip hop, funk and folklore, Hoba Hoba Spirit took the stage to present their latest 13-track “Kamayanbaghi,” released in January 2018, reflecting the richness and diversity of the festival which always has new music in the program. This unique musical event in Morocco began in 1998. Its purpose is to connect people with music and to allow listeners to forget life’s reality for a moment and indulge in spirituality. “Since the birth of the festival, its unique character has given it a place of choice in cultural events that have confirmed to the world that Africa is more than ever a land of dialogue and creation,” said Neila Tazi. The Gnaoua festival attracts an audience of 300,000 visitors each year. It offers a varied program to celebrate the Gnaoua heritage and to invite the best global jazz artists to come and perform in Essaouira. At the festival, the singers, called maâlems, begin to chant in Arabic or Gnaoui. The message is usually spiritual.

The Sale stage audience will experience the pulsating beats of Moroccan rising stars Ihab Amir, Cravata, and Reem starting at 10:00 p.m. The Mawazine stage of Sale has picked the winner of the MEMA Award, 22-year-old Moroccan singer, songwriter, composer, and guitarist Ihab Amir to take part in the opening concerts of the festival.

Rabat – Moroccan football fans have addressed a Change.org petition to FIFA to condemn the referee’s choice not to use video assistant referee (VAR) in the Morocco-Portugal game on Wednesday. The petitioners say that FIFA’s referees during the game were“unfair” toward Morocco as FIFA did not use VAR in the Morocco-Portugal game. “FIFA use VAR to help big teams win, and is being racist toward Morocco which is an African country,” reads the petition. “Anyone who watched the match will realize how much unfair it was: Morocco should have had 2 PK [penalty kicks] but no one bothered to check the Var.” We call for a review of Morocco’s match against Portugal, due to the referendum mistakes that deprived the Moroccan team of two penalties — ???????????? (@hanane49647983) June 20, 2018  Moroccan footballers, fans and the coach were disappointed after referees did not give Morocco penalty kicks twice. Moroccan winger Nordin Amrabat was the first to shout for a penalty in the 26th minute of the game after Portuguese footballer Raphael Guerreiro pushed him in the penalty zone. Amrabat and other Moroccan footballers asked the referee to check the VAR, but his request was not obliged. Morocco’s head coach Hervé Renard also expressed anger after Portuguese footballer Pepe crushed into Moroccan footballer Khalid Boutaib. The mistake, however, went unnoticed by the referees, and VAR was not consulted. The petition has generated more than 43,000 signatures. The neglect of VAR received wide backlash from Moroccan fans as it was used in several other matches, including yesterday’s Australia-Denmark game. “We call for a review of Morocco’s match against Portugal, due to the referendum mistakes that deprived the Moroccan team of two penalties,” said a Twitter user. Some people have even demanded a replay of the game between Morocco and Portugal. Morocco lost to Portugal 1-0 on June 20 in Moscow after Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winning goal for his team in the fourth minute of the match. International football stars, analysts, and fans recognized that Moroccan football team deserved the win as the team delivered a solid performance. Morocco has one game to go against Spain on Monday, June 25. However, the team cannot move to the next phase of the World Cup because of its first defeat against Iran on June 15.

By Intissar Fouzi Rabat – The Spanish king will give the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Civil Merit to Mehdi Qotbi, President of Morocco’s National Museum Foundation (FNM), on Wednesday, June 27. The painter took to his Facebook account to express his gratitude to the Spanish King Felipe VI. “This distinction of His Majesty Felipe VI, is an honor and a wonderful encouragement for the work performed by the FNM.”  “I feel this as an honor and a wonderful encouragement to continue this path of development and culture through very large exhibitions that put art in the reach of every Moroccan,” Qotbi said in a meeting at the Elysee Palace. Since the inauguration of the Mohammed VI Museum of Contemporary Art in 2014,  Mehdi Qotbi, the director of the museum and the president of the FNM, has set up numerous visiting exhibitions to introduce the Moroccan public to the work of major international artists. Last year, the museum boasted an “Africa in the Capital” exhibit, while later this year, it will feature the works of Francisco Goya and other contemporary Spanish artists from October 31 to February 4, 2019. Mehdi Qotbi is a  symbol of culture today in Morocco. At the same time, he continues to address new topics in the country’s art.

Rabat- A disturbing video of a priest slapping a crying baby across the face in the process of his baptism ceremony has sparked outrage on social media platforms. The 40 seconds of footage show the French-speaking priest caressing a crying baby, held in his mother’s arms, saying: “I’m going to put water on the forehead, and then I’ll embrace the little man because he will have become a little Christian.” As the baby continued to cry, the priest shocked those present by suddenly yelling at him and slapping him on the face, only to cradle his head again. The clergyman soon held the child’s neck and gave him a violent hug. “Calm down!” the priest repeated aggressively, but the baby’s cries increased. Voices in the room can be heard saying to the priest “don’t hit the kid, sir.” The man, believed to be the baby’s father, seemed to have had enough of the priest’s disturbing behavior and pulled the baby from the priest’s arms, pushing him away before the video had ended. The unsettling footage was viewed over 1 million times on YouTube and angered people online who denounced the priest’s “sadistic” and “sociopathic” behavior. One commentator said: “First of all, he’s holding his head, and it looks uncomfortable. No wonder he’s all fussy like that. Second, there was [no] reason to slap a child like that. No reason. When the parent tries to grab their child from you, you don’t refuse to give them up, unless of course the parent is a threat to the child.” Another one said: “Who wants to fund me a trip so I can go slap him!!!”

Rabat- The Ministry of Equipment, Transport, and Logistics has denounced rumors that it will extend the formally required training period for driver’s licenses to six months, insisting that it is fixed at 30 days. The 30-day training period begins from the application day and lasts until the test period. Some news outlets had reported that driving candidates would be required to wait six months to take their first test. The ministry emphasized that driving permit applicants will benefit from an extended contract period of six months, renewable for a further three-month period. The extended contract is to improve training conditions and ensure transparency between trainees and driving schools. The ministry added that the training hours during the 30-day training period are not required to exceed 20 hours for all license categories and 30 hours for heavy equipment vehicles. The contract will include the number of additional training hours agreed on between the trainee and the driving institution. The ministry also announced that the training fees will be fixed at MAD 2,250: MAD 37 per hour for the theoretical test and MAD 75.5 per hour for the applied training for category B, the license to drive regular cars. Since December 2017, driving candidates must earn 34 points out of 40 to pass the theoretical test for license B. The previous passing score was 30 points out of 40.

Rabat- After a decades-long ban on women driving, Saudi women will be allowed to drive for the first time throughout the kingdom on Sunday, June 24, 2018. On June 4, authorities in Saudi Arabia began issuing national driving licenses to women who held international driving licenses, according to the Saudi Press Agency (SPA). “The exchange process is taking place on various spots, around the kingdom, to lay the ground for women sitting behind the wheels on the roads,” the state news agency said, describing this as a “turning point set to be actualized, on June 24.” “We welcome King Salman’s decree allowing women to drive, and trust that this now starts the journey to substantive equality for women and girls in Saudi Arabia,” said Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, UN Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of UN Women in a statement. Mlambo-Ngcuka added “Women being able to apply for a driver’s license in Saudi Arabia, and subsequently drive, is a long-awaited milestone in the Kingdom, that puts them at par with their male counterparts in this one area of public life and gives them a right to a life-saving skill that they should never have been denied.” Moreover, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) praised the royal decree, noting “OIC Secretary General, Dr. Yousef Al-Othaimeen, said this very important step comes as part of the continued reform effort to drive progress and development for the Kingdom.” The organization confirmed the move is in line with the OIC 2025 Programme of Action and the OIC Plan of Action for the Advancement of Women. Until now, Saudi Arabia has been the only country in the world where women are not allowed to drive. In September 2017, King Salman announced that the ban would be lifted in June 2018, as part of a reform program inspired by his young son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The societal reforms of Prince Mohammed bin Salman have also allowed the reopening of cinemas, concerts, and other forms of public entertainment. Since Salman’s announcement last year, many Saudi women have started taking driving lessons, and training centers have started intensive programs to instruct them on traffic regulations and driving skills.

Rabat – FIFA’s video assistant referee (VAR) at the 2018 World Cup is stirring controversy among Moroccan football fans as it was used in several football matches, but not in the Morocco-Portugal game. Yesterday, Australia scored an equalizer against Denmark on a VAR-awarded penalty in the first half, while on Wednesday, the VAR rejected Iran’s goal against Spain. FIFA referees, however, at no time used VAR in the game between Morocco and Portugal on Wednesday, June 20, which sparked outrage among Moroccan football fans. A Twitter user said yesterday “Var made by against African team @FIFAcom @FIFAWorldCup ex:why don’t you use var for maroc vs Portugal @EnMaroc @CAF_Online @infatino don’t forget football is not war.” Var made by against African team @FIFAcom @FIFAWorldCup ex:why don’t you use var for maroc vs Portugal @EnMaroc @CAF_Online @infatino don’t forget football is not war — rwanda_reddevils (@PNyombayire) June 22, 2018  Social media users have also launched a petition, complaining that FIFA did not use VAR for the Morocco-Portugal game. “We demand FIFA to use VAR for Morocco-Portugal game.

Renard said: “You have to look at number 3 (Pepe) in slow motion, I think everything is said.” Renard was referring to the hand of the Portuguese central defender, which was not called out by Referee Geiger or his assistants. According to Renard, Pepe’s move deserved a penalty in favor of Morocco in the 85th minute.

Rabat- Since April 20, Rabat and Brussels have been negotiating the renewal of the Morocco-EU fisheries deal, but as of last week’s second round of talks, Morocco is driving a hard bargain for MAD 800 million in investments. In February, the European Court of Justice ruled to exclude “waters in the southern provinces” from the Morocco-EU fisheries agreement, saying that the deal did not profit local populations. In the current deal, Morocco grants fishing licenses to fishing vessels from EU countries, in exchange for MAD 400 million from the EU. Shipowners also pay fishing fees of roughly EUR 14 million. Negotiations to renew the deal, which have been going on since Morocco challenged the ICJ’s ruling, are expected to be resumed on Monday, June 25, when officials from both sides will convene in Brussels. The meeting will be the third round of negotiations. Last week, diplomats from both parties met in Rabat to try to find common ground on the political and financial aspects of the agreement. The week-long meeting in Rabat was the second round of the renewal process, the first round having come to a satisfactory conclusion when EU and Moroccan diplomats agreed on general guidelines for the renewal process in Brussels. At the Rabat meeting, however, the two parties failed to come to an agreement. While both parties quickly agreed to include the waters off the Western Sahara, they had a harder time finding common ground on the financial component. While the EU currently invests MAD 400 million in the fisheries agreement,  Morocco is now requesting 800 million for the new deal. Moroccan officials have been reported to be firm on their position, with Rabat saying that it would not engage in any agreement offering less. Rabat’s firm stance comes at a time when the country has a strong bargaining chip, especially as the current deal expires on July 14. Moroccan officials have asked European fishing boats to leave Moroccan waters should the EU fail to meet Morocco’s demands by July 14. Consequently, EU fishermen have urged European officials to compromise to save the deal. “It would be a great pity if the deal is not renewed by its expiry date, because Morocco has made it clear during the second roundtables that all European boats should depart from  Moroccan waters,” said Pedro Maza, president of a fishermen’s association in Spain.

Rabat- The Ministry of Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education, and Scientific Research revealed on Friday that 187,138 students have passed the exam in the June session, representing a passing rate of 57.36 percent. The pass rate for those taking the exam in the June session has increased by 8 percent from last year’s 50.28 percent.  The ministry noted that the 55 percent of those passing were female students. A total of 103,567 students, compared to 92,771 male students, passed. The percentage of students who passed with merit represented 49.58 percent of those who passed. This year’s highest baccalaureate grade in the country is 19.44 out of 20 in the branches of physics and French literature, recorded in the regions of Marrakech and the coastal city of Safi. In the scientific branches, 60.74 percent passed; meanwhile 51.81 percent passed in the literary branches. The pass rate of “free baccalaureate” exam takers, who could not attend regular courses for reasons such as work or health issues, is estimated at 24.92 percent. The low success rate in this category may be the result of its absence rate during the baccalaureate exam, which was 44.12 percent. The pass rate for special needs students who benefitted from adapted baccalaureate exams this year was 77.91 percent. 

The number of baccalaureate candidates who will be allowed to retake the exam is 15,3931. The make up exam will take place July 10-13. There were 440,000 baccalaureate exam candidates this year, compared to last year’s 325,191 students.

Rabat – The nightmare has ended for the Moroccan children. Spanish authorities have dismantled a child pornography network exploiting minors, including Moroccan children, in the production of pornographic images and videos. After months of investigations, Spanish police have arrested 12 people. The 12 were behind a network that produced and distributed pornographic films of minors via the internet. More than one million child pornography films were seized. A joint statement from the Spanish Civil Guard and the Catalan police, broadcast on Wednesday, June 20, reports that “a large part of the child pornographic material broadcast was produced by the criminal network itself, through the sexual exploitation of minors in a situation of socioeconomic precariousness, originating from the cities of Barcelona, Tortosa, Valencia and Morocco.” The videos of 80 minors, filmed during trips between 2000 and 2015 were also exploited by a criminal gang in Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, Singapore, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, the Czech Republic, and France. The investigation was launched when the Directorate-General for the Protection of Children and Adolescents noticed a suspicious case at the Tortosa Education Center in north-east Spain. The manager contacted the police, who discovered a residence prepared for the recording of child pornography videos.

Rabat – It is official: the Personal Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General for Western Sahara Horst Köhler is set to start a 10-day visit to Western Sahara Saturday. UN Spokesman Farhan Haq confirmed the UN official’s visit on Thursday. “I can confirm that Horst Köhler, the Secretary General’s Personal Envoy for the Sahara, will be touring the region again from 23 June to 1 July 2018.” The spokesperson explained that Köhler’s visit is aimed to deepen “Köhler”s understanding of the reality on the ground, and discuss how to move forward in the UN-led political process, in accordance with Security Council Resolution 2414.” Resolution 2414, adopted by the UN Security Council on April 28, extended the mandate of the UN Mission for Western Sahara (MINURSO) to six months instead of one year and pressured the Polisario to end their violations of the ceasefire agreement. The resolution also urged Algeria to contribute to finding a solution for the four-decade-long conflict over Western Sahara. The motion also expressed full support to Köhler’s mission and efforts to find a solution for the conflict. Earlier this week, MINURSO’s headquarters in Laayoune, the largest city in Western Sahara, were mobilizing to receive the special envoy. Köhler is set to meet with Moroccan officials and is also expected to meet Polisario representatives in the Tindouf camps in southern Algeria. The UN Personal Envoy is expected to visit all MINURSO sites in Western Sahara to monitor the ceasefire agreement, violated by the front in recent months. On May 20, the separatist group conducted an illegal parade to celebrate the “45th anniversary of its armed struggle,” angering both Morocco and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The move came in defiance of the UN resolution.

Rabat – They did not come to Russia just for the love of football. Some Moroccan fans at the 2018 World Cup have tried unsuccessfully to enter the EU illegally by crossing into Finland. According to AFP, Russian border guards have arrested four Moroccans who tried to escape near the small Russian village of Ketrovaara in Karelia, about 10 kilometers from the border with Finland. The four men entered Russia with the “FAN ID,” a document that provides visa-free access to Russia from June 4 to July 15, and tickets for the June 15 Iran-Morocco match, according to a statement from the authorities in Karelia. “The Moroccans explained that their real goal was not to see the World Cup but to cross the border and go to Finland,” it has been reported to AFP. The four men were sentenced to be expelled from Russia and fined 2,000 rubles (MAD 300). Since the beginning of the World Cup, five people, including three Moroccans, a Nigerian, and a Chinese national have crossed the Russian-Finnish border to seek asylum in Finland, according to Marko Saareks, the head of a Finnish Border Guard Unit. This situation was anticipated, according to senior Belarusian border guard Alexey Sitenkov. “We know what trains they are going to take and we are preparing for Europe to refuse them and to go the other way,” he said. Two weeks before the incident, Abdelkader Lecheheb, the Moroccan Ambassador to Russia, warned Moroccan fans regarding their stay in Russia. “A supporter who stays in Russia for more than 50 days is liable to administrative and financial penalties,” he told Moroccan outlet Le Matin. “Those who don’t follow the rules must go before a judge and possibly receive a fine before being allowed to leave Russian territory. We explained everything because we do not want our fellow citizens to be exposed to sanctions. We also insisted on the behavior and the respect of the Russian laws and regulations.”

By Jamal Laoudi Washington D.C.– With the early exit of Morocco’s national team, dubbed the Atlas Lions, from the 2018 Russia World Cup, Moroccan fans have shifted their attention to dissecting what went wrong.   What makes this question interesting is the gladiator nature of Morocco’s effort and performance in this tournament. They had the giant Portugal, with Ronaldo and his 5 Ballon d’Or honors, on their knees, but simply could not deliver a swift blow. Moroccan supporters will point to poor referring as the main reason. While that claim holds some water, there is a pattern that has plagued Morocco every time it partakes in a world cup, and this tournament is no different. Morocco always manages to find a way to shoot itself in the foot.   In its first World Cup appearance in 1970, Morocco had an okay showing given the game was, comparatively, severely underdeveloped in the country.  They lost to Germany and Peru, two powerhouses at the time, and tied Bulgaria. They were first to score against Germany only to lose at the end, and lost 3-0 to Peru.    They did not make it past the first round, but managed to get 1 point. No controversy here.  In 1986, Morocco topped its group with 4 points, having maneuvered through the giants of the time: England, Portugal, and Poland.  In the round of 16, Morocco was eliminated by Germany with a 1-0 score. Germany’s goal was earned on a free kick in minute 88, just two minutes away from the end of regulation. If that outcome was expected on paper, the performances of both teams did not reflect it.  Morocco was as much in the game as Germany was. It came down to a mistake in wall-placement after the referee whistled a free kick. German legend Lothar Matthaus exploited the hole, and Morocco was out of the tournament in round 2. Moving on to the 1994 World Cup. Up until then, FIFA had been using the two-point system. In the group stage, a team got 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, and 0 points for a loss.  But in that tournament, it had moved to the 3-point award system, giving teams 3 points for a win, while draws and losses rest remained unchanged.  In the 1994 World Cup, despite losing its first game with a score of 1-0 against Belgium, Morocco had a great game and quite a few missed opportunities. One such memorable opportunity came when Morocco’s center forward, Chaouch, hit the ball into the crossbar after a perfect pass from the right side, courtesy of the elusive midfielder Bahja, who had come in as a substitute. But it was a game against Saudi Arabia that did Morocco in.  The Lions’ supporters were outraged. They blamed their goalkeeper for failing to stop a meager shot coming from 30-plus yards.  That loss proved unforgivable. Morocco ended up exiting the tournament, at the bottom of the group, with zero points. That was its worst World Cup participation to date.    Moving on to 1998, Morocco’s exit was also in the first round, but it was a heartbreaker.  They tied Norway, lost to Brazil, and beat Scotland convincingly with a 3-0 final score. The game of interest is the 2-2 tie with Norway.  Norway’s first goal was courtesy of Moroccan midfielder, Youssef Chippo, who headed the ball into his own net while attempting to clear it out.  The own-goal came in the dying minutes of the first half.  As for the World Cup in Russia, it is the same old broken record.  An own goal by Morocco against Iran in its first game in the 95th minute cost them the game. Center forward Aziz Bouhaddouz, who came in as a substitute in the 77th minute, dove to clear an Iranian cross from a free kick, only to see it inside his own net.  “We were crucified,” Lions’ coach Hervé Renard commented. This one, also, proved harsh. Morocco found itself out of the tournament with 0 points after only two games.   The moral of the story is that the World Cup requires nerves of steel.  To get attention, you need to be able to hang with the big boys. And to win it, you need to be a big boy!

Rabat – The football experts have spoken. Criticism continues to pour in for American Referee Mark Geiger.  After Morocco’s Coach Hervé Renard, captain Mehdi Benatia, and attacking winger Nordin Amrabat expressed anger against “unfair arbitration” in the Portugal-Morocco game yesterday, some sports experts, including former Arsenal coach Arsène Wenger, have affirmed that the national team should have been granted the penalty. Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo scored the only goal of the game in the 4th minute. Media and sports experts gathered to comment on the game on beIN Sport. “There is a penalty for a hand from Pepe,” said Marcel Desailly, former world champion with the France team. As for Arsène Wenger, the former coach of Arsenal, he thinks there should have been a penalty in striker Khalid Boutaib’s favor, as the score should not have been given to Ronaldo. Wenger added that he didn’t see “why there would not be penalty for Morocco.” Former coach of Paris Saint Germain (PSG) Luis Fernandez agreed with Hervé Renard who, during his “after” interview strongly condemned the referee’s decisions. “We understand the attitude of Hervé Renard. Video refereeing has been put in place to avoid this. It was not used as it should have been,” said Fernandez. After the controversy, FIFA spoke out to refute accusations that the referee favored Ronaldo, Nordin Amrabat’s allegation that he heard Pepe talking about the referee’s request for Ronaldo’s jersey before the game. “Mr Geiger strongly refutes these claims and categorically states that such a request was not made,” FIFA said. “FIFA unequivocally condemns the allegations supposedly made by a member of the Moroccan team,” said FiFA. “FIFA referees are under clear instructions with regard to their behavior and relationship with the teams at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia and it can be confirmed that Mr Geiger has acted in an exemplary and professional manner as an appointed match official.”

By Chase Lacy Rabat- Oil prices have decreased as OPEC and non-members, such as Russia, will attend their bi-annual meeting in Vienna, Austria, tomorrow.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is anticipated to increase production output of oil. The move will likely be supported by major non-OPEC member, Russia. Increasing production backtracks a 2017 deal between OPEC and Russia to lower oil production, raising prices, tightening the market, and addressing a global glut.   Early Thursday morning, Brent Crude LCO dropped USD 1.76 to USD 72.98 per barrel, but has resurged slightly to USD 73.34 a barrel. Last month the benchmark crude oil had reached a 3 and a half year high mark, with prices above $80 a barrel. The past few months have seen widespread calls for OPEC to increase output ceilings and reduce prices. Calls have been driven by a drastic drop in Venezuelan production and fear that Iranian exports will decrease due to the reinstatement of US sanctions.  Iran has opposed production increases, however on Wednesday, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said that he would accept a modest rise in output.  Henry Tchilinguirian, head of oil strategy at French Bank BNP Paribas, said in a report to Reuters that he expects at least a small increase in production. “It would seem that an aggregate increase in production for OPEC+ of between 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) and 1 million bpd is the range being considered.”  Russia had originally proposed to boost production to 1.5 million bpd, but met fierce Iranian opposition. Saudi Arabia has sought to compromise the figure to increase production between 600,000-800,000 bpd.  According to Tamas Varga, an analyst at PVM Oil Associates, Saudi Arabia and Russia “will be pitted against Iraq, Iran, and Venezuela. The latter countries need every petrodollar they can put their hands on for political and economic reasons, and the U.S. withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement adds spice to Iran’s resistance in increasing production.” Moroccan consumers have experienced prices impacted by market trends since the government deregulated oil in 2016. The increase of prices and widening profit margins for companies such as Afriquia, led to a sustained boycott against the company since April 20th. The Moroccan government has been put under increasing pressure to intervene and reduce prices. Recently, fuel companies agreed to lower their prices for six months.

Rabat- King Mohammed VI has sent a message to Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to thank him for his support for Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup.  Morocco’s Ambassador to Algeria Abdelkhalek Lahcen said in an interview with Algerian television channel El Bilad that the King’s letter mentioned “Algeria’s noble initiative” which “mirrors his excellency president Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s principles of magnanimity, honesty and loyalty.” On June 13, Morocco lost its 2026 World Cup bid to the united trio, Canada, Mexico, and the US, which received 134 votes compared to Morocco’s 65 votes.   When asked about the possibility of a united bid between Maghreb countries for the 2030 FIFA World Cup, Lahcen said that Morocco will welcome all initiatives made by neighboring countries. Although relations between the two countries are tense, Lahcen added that “His majesty insisted that he will work with [Bouteflika] to further strengthen the relations between the two countries in all fields and promote more cooperation and unification between them.” Along with France, Algeria was among the first countries that vowed support for Morocco’s 2026 FIFA World Cup bid.  All but 11 countries in Africa voted for Morocco. The eleven were: South Africa, Guinea, Liberia, Benin, Sierra Leone, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Cape Verde, and Zimbabwe. Countries that voted against Morocco also included several Arab countries: Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates.

Rabat – He was one of the most recognized painters in Morocco. The Moroccan painter and artist Hassan El Glaoui died Thursday morning in Rabat, at the age of 94, according to a statement of his family, reported by MAP. The painter had distinguished himself by an exemplary artistic career and is considered one of the pioneers of contemporary art in Morocco. His paintings have received international recognition. Famous for horse painting, Hassan El Glaoui owes his success to former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who, on one of his visits to Marrakech, convinced El Glaoui’s father to allow him to pursue his artistic vocation. He was subsequently sent to France, where he continued his studies at the Ecole Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Hassan El Glaoui organized numerous exhibitions in Morocco and abroad, including paintings depicting the reality of Morocco in general, and Marrakech in particular. The funeral will be held on Thursday at Zaouia Hassounia in Salé following Al Asr, the afternoon prayer. Hassan El Glaoui is the eldest son of the last Pasha of Morocco, Thami El Glaoui, who participated in the pacification of the country on behalf of the French protectorate.  Born in Marrakech in 1924, El Glaoui worked in various workshops in Paris between 1950 and 1960. His first solo exhibition took place in 1950 in Paris, followed by one in New York in 1952. In 1957, he participated in the 2nd Biennial of Alexandria and in 1963 in the “Two thousand years of art in Morocco,” a collective exhibition at the Charpentier Gallery in Paris. Churchill ‘told my father that I have talent’ The Moroccan painter met Winston Churchill as a young artist in the making. He recalled meeting Churchill, known as a prolific painter, in an interview in 2014 with French outlet Le Figaro. “My first memory is in fact a memory of my mother, warning me that my father’s house was in full preparation to receive his great friend, the British Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill. It was in the 1940s, 1943 maybe. One day, in particular, my father asked me to organize an exceptional trip for Churchill to discover southern Morocco.” “I am very grateful that [Churchill] told my father that I have talent and that I should be allowed to pursue academic training in Paris,” he added. El Glaoui will continue to live through his legacy. His youngest daughter, Touria El Glaoui, who launched the 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair in London, has been referencing her father’s work for ten years. In January 2011 in London and then in 2013 in Marrakech, she organized a mirrored exhibition of paintings by Winston Churchill and Hassan El Glaoui called Meetings in Marrakech.

By Intissar Faouzi Rabat – During Algeria’s national  high school exams, which began Wednesday, authorities are applying an anti fraud law and turning off the internet nationwide during exams. The country’s internet will be suspended during the first hour of each exam, in a radical attempt to curb cheating. . The measure was taken in reaction to a scandal involving dozens of people that tainted the 2016 exam session of the Algerian baccalaureate, after many exam questions were leaked on Facebook. The exams were canceled and many thousands of candidates had to retake the exams. Even though last year the authorities asked internet network providers to prevent any social media access, the voluntary procedure was not enough. Nouria Benghabrit, the Minister of Education in Algeria, said in a statement to Annahar newspaper that during the entire period of exams, social media generally and Facebook specifically will be blocked across the country. Ms Benghabrit also said of the drastic move“We should not passively give up our fight against any possible leak.” Moreover, as a stronger method used this year to deter cheating, all electronic gadgets with internet access have been banned in the 2,000 exam centers for both students and school staff. This operation relies on metal detectors set up at exam center entrances. The minister also said that they have installed surveillance cameras and mobile jammers in exam printing presses to prevent leaking. The blackout procedure of blackout will be in place from June 20-25 when the baccalaureate exam is given. There are nearly 700,000 candidates taking the high school certificate exam over the next week and results are expected to be published from July 22.

Rabat- Since the launch of Islamic “participatory” banks in July 2017, more than 71 agencies have joined the non-interest banking program throughout Morocco. “We are at more than 71 participating agencies. They are continuously multiplying,” said Abdellatif Jouahri, the governor of Bank Al Maghrib (Morocco’s central bank), after the second quarterly meeting in 2018 of the bank’s board. The participating banks have granted a total of MAD 1.1 billion in loans, he added. Jouahri highlighted the special interest that murabaha (Islamic financing) is especially attractive for both real estate and automobile customers. “People are more and more interested in the real estate murabaha and even the automobile murabaha.” Similarly, the governor stressed that Morocco is preparing to issue its first sukuks (Islamic bonds) in July 2018 which will complement the services offered by participatory banks. Meanwhile, Jouahri said that Morocco’s central bank has already begun to receive the first sharia compliant reports of Islamic “participatory” banks, ensuring that the central bank keeps notifying “banks that have not yet released their reports” and that “things are progressing and setting up little by little.” While the order approving the takaful (Islamic insurance) circular has already been finalized, the legislative texts are still being finalized. Jouahri said, “The takaful is in its final phase, which is to change certain provisions of the insurance code.” He ironically added “We assure you that we have even made the Ulema [Islamic scholars] work on Saturdays and Sundays to speed things up.” After reviewing the participatory banks’ achievements, Jouahri praised the various steps taken by this major project, in particular the validation of many legislative texts by Morocco’s Higher Council of Ulema.

Rabat – Morocco’s loss to Portugal yesterday sealed the Atlas Lions’ fate, ending their 2018 World Cup. After such an early exit, football legends Iker Casillas and Alessandro Del Piero have said the Atlas Lions “deserved better.”  Iker Casillas, who made his mark on the game as a Real Madrid and Spain goalkeeper, captaining the Spanish side that conquered Europe and the world from 2008 to 2012, said that it is unbelievable that a team of Morocco’s caliber could lose twice in a row and not even score once. Morocco lost to Iran June 15 with a 95th minute own goal. The Spaniard pointed out that the quality in Morocco’s squad and the impressive performances they delivered in their two appearances make it “unbelievable” that they could have such a disappointing world cup. “I think it is unbelievable that Morocco did not secure even one point in its two matches. But it is even more unbelievable that they have not scored a single goal,” the former Real Madrid stopper said. “But this is football!” he exclaimed. For his part, former Italy and Juventus legend Alessandro Del Piero slightly criticized the Atlas Lions for lacking sharpness and effectiveness in their finishes. He said that it is a pity that a team could play as the Atlas Lions did and yet fail to claim even one point. “Cruel World Cup for Morocco. First the Iran joke, then Cristiano punished you when you were least focused,” the Italian legend said. “Two solid matches, good organization, impressive football, but zero point. That’s a pity, you deserved better!” Portugal’s Coach Fernando Santos echoed similar feelings during yesterday’s post-match press conference, saying that Morocco’s pressure and good organization damaged the confidence of Portuguese players. While such opinions will not reverse Morocco’s standing in Group B, it is surely a consolation for many Moroccan fans that the Atlas Lions’ solid performance has  won them the respect and admiration of international fans and observers.  However, such public acclaim for quality football and teamwork put an even stronger pressure on Moroccan players when facing Spain on Monday, June 25. With no qualification at stake in the Spain game, the Lions will still have to score to end the contest with honor.

Rabat- Morocco’s Ministry in Charge of Moroccans Living Abroad (MRE) has appointed attorneys to defend Moroccan seasonal workers who have reported they were sexually assaulted in Spain. The ministry will fund a number of Spanish and Moroccan lawyers to bring justice to the women who have complained of sexual assault by their employers and supervisors in Spain’s Huelva province. The ministry also stated that it had received several Moroccan NGOs, who pledged full support for the rape victims, and said its decision to entrust the case to the Spanish lawyers was in the framework of the legal cooperation between Morocco and Spain. Previously, Morocco’s Ministry of Employment had denied claims that Moroccan women working on Spanish farms were sexually assaulted. The ministry maintained that “no specific case of abuse or violation against Moroccan workers was found,” after it had sent a Moroccan-Spanish delegation to inquire about the women’s conditions on the Spanish farms. In January, Spain agreed to hire 10,400 Moroccan agricultural workers to pick strawberries and other berries for the April to June harvest season following a meeting between 18 representatives of agricultural firms and officials from the General Directorate for Migration. Several news outlets, including US-based online media company Buzzfeed News, Spain’s El Mundo, and El Pais have reported on the stories of Moroccan seasonal workers who said they were raped and insulted in Heluva. The MRE’s decision came after several Spanish and Moroccan women in Huelva protested the sexual assault against these women. The protesters rallied  in a march of solidarity on Sunday, June 17, holding banners which read “Work Without Sexual Slavery.”

Rabat – The referee did not ask for Ronaldo’s jersey before the game, according to FIFA. On Thursday, the international football federation published a statement denying Nordin Amrabat’s accusations against American Referee Mark Geiger after Morocco’s defeat against Portugal (0-1). “Mr Geiger strongly refutes these claims and categorically states that such a request was not made,” FIFA said. “FIFA unequivocally condemns the allegations supposedly made by a member of the Moroccan team.” “FIFA referees are under clear instructions with regard to their behavior and relationship with the teams at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia and it can be confirmed that Mr Geiger has acted in an exemplary and professional manner as an appointed match official.” Yesterday, Nordin Amrabat took issue with the referee’s behaviour in a game that will send Morocco out of the World Cup after the group stage. “On field, he was really impressed by Ronaldo,” Amrabat said. “When I walked by [Portugal’s] Pepe, I heard him say that the referee has asked for Cristiano Ronaldo’s jersey during the first period. But, frankly, who are we kidding? We’re at the World Cup, it’s not a circus here.”

Rabat- Cristiano Ronaldo has been crowned man of the match in the Portugal-Morocco game by some football fans following his early goal which won the game for Portugal. However, not everyone agrees that Ronaldo deserves the title. The Atlas Lion attacking winger Nordin Amrabat is the “man of the match” to many people who were mesmerized by his performance at the game, despite his serious concussion after a fall in the match against Iran on June 15. Amrabat’s doctor gave him a week to rest but he did not want to leave his teammates and showed up to the match wearing a helmet on his injured head. One Twitter user wrote: “Amrabat the real man of the match.” Respect ??#Amrabat the real man of the match ?? pic.twitter.com/d7XIfSPZJB pic.twitter.com/mSVkPQ0g5Q — FaZe Snipr (@fazesnipr) June 20, 2018  Another one wrote, “We are proud of our national team and Amrabat was the man of the match.” We are proud of our national team and @NAmrabat53 was the man of the match #Amrabat #fifa_rematch_morocco_portugal #we_are_the_winners #morocco pic.twitter.com/DVtN4KVCY8 — Oumaima abn (@AbnOumaima) June 21, 2018  The “GoFootball” Facebook page shared a post on Wednesday, saying: “I do not understand why Cristiano was elected as the man of the match, but i think that Amrabat deserves it! …This is my first time watching the Moroccan team play, and I became a fan of this nation.” 

“Morocco deserves to win this game, they played way better than Portugal.I am feeling sorry for Moroccan, you should be proud of your team,” the page wrote again. 
Although the Atlas Lions lost by 0-1 to Portugal, ending their World Cup 2018 tournament, international press, social media users, and even Portugal’s coach Fernando Santos  have all recognized and praised the Atlas Lions’ fighting spirit during the match. British newspaper the Guardian called Morocco’s performance a “gallant display,” writing that it was “beautiful and exasperating to watch.” The Guardian added: “It’s slightly bizarre that they could exit this tournament without scoring a goal. Apart from for Iran, that is.” In their World Cup opener against Iran, the Atlas Lions scored an own goal in the 95th minute, losing the game. Still, the team earned the respect of the match viewers as they emerged from the game with dignity after they gave Portugal a hard time. It was a long, exhausting fight, but as many simply said: “luck was not on their side.” Portugal’s Coach Santos said: “They are a team which caused a lot of trouble. We knew how to suffer.” Before the game he had said that his team has “to show Morocco respect because they are an excellent team.” The France-based media service Euronews wrote: “Morocco have one final game against Spain in the group stage and, although they are out, don’t think that they will roll over, as they may well fancy a shock result even if just to show the rest of the world what they can do.” Man of the match !

Rabat – Saudi Arabia has lost its second game in a row, making the Gulf country the third nation, after Egypt and Morocco, that can practically say goodbye to the 2018 World Cup. But given the manner in which Saudi Arabia lost to Uruguay yesterday, fans gave them credit for “playing free flowing and entertaining football.” The Saudis’ improved performance even got some thinking whether Uruguay’s dull, “boring and Atletico-Madrid-inspired football” will get them any further in the tournament. Although Uruguay’s 1-0 win sent Saudi Arabia out of the tournament, the match was a consolidation of the pattern that has been forming at this World Cup. Underdogs now play with intensity, belief, and some sense of urgency, however slack and indecisive they tend to be in the crucial moments.  Saudi Arabia kept the ball but lacked a player who could step up to score and inspire his teammates to victory. Uruguay, for all their uninteresting performance, had Suarez’s 23rd minute goal to give them what they needed: a ticket into the next phase. Driven by Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani, the South Americans tried on numerous occasions to find the net, but the Saudis were more compact than they were against Russia, when they lost 5-0. They had a well-organized wall to deny their opponents the many goals that observers expected from this match. Saudis had probably come to the match to make a statement: showing glimpses of the playing quality and positive vibes that eluded them in their devastating opener against Russia.  They controlled the ball for much of the game with 53% possession, with Uruguay counting on long passes and counterattacks. Saudi Arabia had moments of inspirations on the wings and in the midfield, but they lacked character and precision in front of the South American goal. The second half looked like a dull and unattractive copy of the first: Saudi’s impotent possession and Uruguay’s display of complacent and boring football. Perhaps the South Americans did not intend to make an impression, knowing that they would win.  One should hope that they are keeping the energy and the brilliance of their cutting-edge playmakers for the next round, otherwise the round of 16 may be their barrier.   While Saudi Arabia had no interest in scoring, or perhaps did not know how to, Uruguay did what they do best: finding ways to end a dull performance with a crucial win.

Rabat – The Atlas Lions, their coach, and Moroccan fans have complained of unfair arbitration on the only goal of the match for Portugal (1-0), which could have been canceled due to a fault made by Cristiano Ronaldo. Nordin Amrabat, attacking winger, who was named Man of the Match by many supporters and media has taken issue with the referee’s behaviour in a game that will send Morocco out of the World Cup after the group stage.  On American referee Mark Geiger, Amrabat said: “On field, he was really impressed by Ronaldo.” “When I walked by [Portugal’s] Pepe, I heard him say that the referee has asked for Cristiano Ronaldo’s jersey during the first period.

Rabat- Morocco’s industrial manufacturing production has slightly increased in the first quarter of 2018, thanks to a rise in automotive industry production. The Moroccan High Commission for Planning (HCP), in charge of economic, demographic, and social statistics, displayed in its latest report growth indices for industrial manufacturing production, energy, and construction. Morocco’s automotive and beverage manufacturing industries have both increased production in the first quarter.  The report stated that the Capacity Utilization rate (UCS) in this industry stands at 75 percent and considered the level of order books at a normal rate in the same period. HCP noted a decrease in metal production, with the exception of machinery equipment, in addition to a drop of paperwork and pulp production. Another decrease in the first quarter is that of the energy industry, which includes electricity production and distribution. On the other hand, the extractive industry production remained stable at 21.0 percent. For the environmental industry, the HCP noted an 83 percent UCS rate and an increase in the number of entrepreneurs, due to sustained growth in the water capture, treatment, and distribution activity. With respect to employment, the workforce in the sector has remained stable during the same period. For the construction sector, the report noted both an increase and a decrease in activity; there was a decrease in civil engineering and an increase in specialized construction work.  Overall, the report emphasized that the construction sector was in a “stable” condition. Order books are also considered normal at 69 percent by all CEOs in the construction sector. For the second quarter, which ends in June, company heads in the manufacturing industry have forecasted an increase in the sector’s production. Production in the food and chemical industries is expected rise, but non-metallic mineral production is expected to decrease. With regard to the workforce, the sector heads predict that employment will remain stable. The energy industry, chiefly electric production and distribution, gas and air conditioning production, are expected to increase throughout the second quarter. Company heads in the energy sector are also positive that their workforce will remain stable.  On the other hand, the increase in phosphate production resulted in expectations that the extractive industry will grow sharply in the second quarter, despite an expected decline in the workforce. The environment industry anticipates a stable working environment and an increase in production, especially concerning the production and distribution of potable water. The CEOs of the construction sector expect that their production will increase, especially in the specialized construction area. Employment stability is also suggested.

By Karen Duarte  Rabat- Spain took a 1-0 lead against Iran in the 54th minute on a deflection off Spanish striker Diego Costa in the Kazan arena Wednesday.  Spain and Iran, both in Morocco’s Group B, faced each other for the first time ever.  During the first round of Group B games, Iran defeated Morocco thanks to a 95th minute own goal, 1-0. Spain tied in a thrilling match against Portugal, 3-3. Spain’s game against Iran came in the second round, after Morocco played an admirable game against Portugal, but lost 1-0. Maintaining 82 percent possession during the first half and attempting 10 shots, Spain failed to score in the first half against Iran.  Iran’s 49 completed passes in the first half is the second lowest figure in a World Cup game since 1966. Despite the low possession rate, Iran played defensively, and their strategy worked, ending the first half 0-0.  In the 54th minute, Spain finally took the lead. Spanish midfielder Iniesta nicely assisted Costa, scoring the first goal. Iranian defender Majid Hosseini kicked the ball, causing it to deflect off Diego Costa and into his own goal.  After parking the bus for so long, the Iranian team searched for an equalizer. About 10 minutes after Spain scored their first goal, Iran placed a free kick into the box and Iranian midfielder Saeid Ezatolahi scored. Unfortunately for Iran, he was ruled offside as the video assistant referee (VAR) concurred with the assistant referee’s call. With inches separating them from scoring their first goal of the tournament, Iranian midfielder Vahid Amiri nutmegged Pique and served a header for forward Mehdi Taremi at the edge of the six-yard-box, but it went over.  Although Spain dominated throughout the entire game, Iran kept them on their toes with a few close counter attacks in the second half, but were still not able to score the equalizer.  Morocco will play its final game against Spain on Monday, June 25th. With Spain and Portugal both having secured a win and a draw and Portugal expected to trounce Iran on Monday, both Iberian countries will almost certainly proceed to the knockout stage of the tournament, leaving Morocco and Iran out of the running.

Rabat – The remarkable Moroccan team did not make it against Portugal (1-0). Leaving the World Cup competition, the Atlas Lions had given their best to make Moroccan fans proud. Despite an outstanding performance in their second game, the national team have to go home after their last game in the group stage against Spain, June 25. Speaking after the Morocco-Portugal match, the captain of the national team, Mehdi Benatia, had a lot to say on some people who “turned their backs” on the team since they lost the first game against Iran. “People close to us have already turned their backs on us after the first game. I say it and I repeat it well, some people close to the team thought that we had become spoiled children since the qualification at the World Cup, that we did not deserve to be there,” he revealed to beIN Sports.  “These are not journalists or other people but close people who should not have that kind of words, yet they got it. We the players, we wanted to show to these puppets what we are capable of,” added the Juventus defender. “That we are a generation that has a lot of heart. We are not the best in the world but we have a lot of heart and today we saw it. We saw players like Boussoufa who is 1m50 take on guys who are two meters. We saw a team of men. I am sad to come out of this competition. But a big thank you to all our people,” he concluded. Just like his coach, Hervé Renard, Benatia, 31, was not happy with the referee’s decisions in the Portugal game.  “The difference between them [Portugal] and us [Morocco] is that they have Cristiano. He needs half a chance to score. But I invite you to review the goal. There is a huge fault of Pepe on Boutaïb. I went to see the referee and told him: ‘I know that there are some great players in front, but a little respect for our country!’” The French-Moroccan football player also praised the Moroccan fans and promised them better days, starting with the last game against Spain on Monday. “We will give everything against Spain and do everything to win or at least mark. The goal is to give pride to this country. There are talented young people in this team, I do not worry about this generation. “

Rabat- The British Ambassador to Morocco, Thomas Reilly, expressed distaste at the litter surrounding the Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah dam in Rabat. Reilly could not fully enjoy his stroll around the lake, as he wrote on his Twitter account on Monday: “We went this morning for a walk with our dogs near the dam lake [in Rabat], a very beautiful and peaceful place…but the place was ruined by plastic waste, sandwich leftover, bottles and garbage.” Reilly was pained that the people who went to the lake to spend the weekend had thrown their trash on the ground without a second thought. “It was honestly appalling, Morocco deserves better than that!” he said. 1/2: Nous sommes allés ce matin pour une promenade avec nos chiens à côté du lac du barrage près de #Rabat.

Authorities have warned of the dangers plastic bags pose to the environment. Despite the ban on plastic bag production in Morocco, some small factories continue to produce them, especially in Casablanca, according to Morocco’s Assabah newspaper. In March, authorities seized nearly 2.96 tons of banned plastic bags intended for sale in a warehouse in Tangier. In July 2016, Morocco launched a new legislation “zero mika” or “zero plastic bags,”  making it one of the first countries in Africa to impose a ban on plastic bags.

Rabat- Egypt has lost its second game to win the World Cup’s group stage to Russia, ending its hopes for 2018, while Senegal was the first African team to win a game at the tournament. Even after Russia’s thunderous 5-0 win against Saudi Arabia in the opener of the World Cup, very few—many Russians included—had any confidence in the hosts. Many guessed it was Saudi Arabia’s fault , roundly dismissing the Russians as unprepared to move to the next stage in a group that had Egypt and Uruguay in it. But on Tuesday night, when Dzuba scored Russia’s magnificent third goal against Egypt, it was clear, and shockingly so, that the underdog host had just ended the dream of Mohamed Sarah, football’s star of the year. The whirlwind of emotions was perceptible, and one could sense the Russians’ unprecedented ecstasy. That was that: Egypt resisted Uruguay’s wild attack until the last seconds, but ceremoniously surrendered to a star-less Russian side. A Salah-deprived Egypt had been compact and at times scintillating against football heavyweight Uruguay. With Salah in their midst, and against a host nation not famous for its football, it was easy enough for the African Pharaohs to expect to humiliate a team that everyone had written off. “At least Salah scored,” fans consoled themselves on social media, fumbling for a better explanation for the debacle. Perhaps Salah was thinking the same when he religiously looked up to the sky after the final whistle, or when he kissed the ball before sending his penalty kick inside the Russian goal. But Salah knew he did not need any grand explanations for Egypt’s loss at Russian hands, nor did he need to bombard himself with “what ifs.” It is football, stupid! Once one accepts that the game is essentially about extending the limits of implausibility, all else makes sense. Moments prior to the calamitous exit of the African Pharaohs, Senegal sent African fans into raptures by handing the continent its first victory at this World Cup. By the time the Teranga Lions faced Poland, all eyes were on Liverpool’s Sadio Mané to inspire a first African victory where Nigeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia had failed to manage even a draw. It was expected that Senegal’s “fast, lively, clinical, and ruthless” attacking line would prove effective against a Polish side that has been impressive of late. “We saw the other African teams lose their first games and it gave us power to play for Africa. Now, all of Africa is happy,” said striker Diafra Sakho, who did not even play a minute of the game, after the Teranga Lions secured a hard-won 2-1 victory. Just like many other games at this Russian tournament, the Senegal vs. Poland game had a lot of waiting to it, with much of the playing happening on the flanks and the midfield, leaving defenses and goalkeepers rather alone for minutes on end. Senegal’s first goal in the 37th minute came as a gift to a side that carried a whole continent on its shoulders. Senegal’s 2-1 triumph was not a resultant of ruthless sprints and marvelous technical show from its Mané-led front three, but it was tactically deserved, as the Teranga Lions’ tactical disposition prevented Poland from scoring. “We managed to control the game tactically and emotionally,” Senegal’s Coach Aliou Cissé said. “We won thanks to discipline. We had a very compact team, also very aggressive. We know that Poland can play two systems [4-4-2 and 3-4-3], which they did, and we knew exactly how they were going to move. We also knew that Lewandowski was the main element. We knew how to implement the right system.” Cissé, who captained the Senegalese side that created wonders at the 2002 World Cup, knows the importance of discipline in tournaments such as the World Cup. “We are not too euphoric because we know it will be difficult match against Japan. We need to question everything and prepare for the Japan match in the same way,” he said. To that mindset of discipline, focus, and level-headedness in the face of unexpected challenges, Napoli’s Kalidou Koulibaly added certainty. “It’s a difficult job but we know we can do it.”

By Chase Lacy Rabat- Early this morning Israeli airstrikes struck 25 targets reportedly linked to Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel claims the strikes were in response to a barrage of 45 rockets and mortals fired into Israeli territory.  The Israeli military reported that three of the Palestinian rockets prematurely landed in Gazan territory, and Israel’s Iron Dome missile defence system intercepted seven of the rockets.  Three Palestinians were allegedly injured in the Israeli airstrikes, but no Israeli casualties from the mortars and rockets have been reported.  The rocket fire came after the Israeli military announced it had targeted Hamas infrastructure in response to “arson balloons.” Palestinians over the past weeks have been lighting kites and balloons and flying them into Israeli territory aflame.  The tactic, according to Israeli sources, has started 450 fires and caused damages of USD 2 million.  In a statement, the Israeli military said, “the Hamas terror organization targeted Israeli civilians throughout the night with a severe rocket attack and is dragging the Gaza Strip and its civilians down a continually deteriorating path.”  Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said “bombing is met with bombing.” Continuing, he said, “It’s the Israeli occupation that started the escalation. The resistance has warned against continuing to target civilians.” He insisted that Israel must be held responsible for the consequences of their actions.  Hamas, however, has not claimed responsibility for the rocket and mortar attacks on Israel.  Israel has conducted air strikes over the past weeks, targeting Hamas. Palestinians have held frequent demonstrations since March 30 to protest Israeli occupation and to demand the right to return to the lands they were expelled from in 1948.  Since the beginning of the protests, 127 Palestinians have been killed and over 13,000 injured.

Rabat – Portugal’s head coach Fernando Santos recognized that the Moroccan football team pressured his team during Wednesday’s World Cup game, despite the Atlas Lions 1-0 defeat. According to the coach, “No World Cup match is easy even against teams that are theoretically weaker.” Speaking about Morocco’s solid performance against Portugal, Santos said: “They are a team which caused a lot of trouble. We knew how to suffer.” According to Reuters, the coach also expressed his dissatisfaction about his squad, emphasizing that the team “lost control of the game, we misplaced a lot of passes, we lost confidence.” “It was inexplicable. If in a match against players like they have, if you don’t have the ball, they will wear you down and you get into trouble,” he added. The Portuguese coach recognized that his team started the game well but lost some of their magic due to Morocco’s pressure. Santos said in a pre-World Cup press conference yesterday that his team has “to show Morocco respect because they are an excellent team.” With a broken heart and teary eyes, Herve Renard said he was proud of the Moroccan footballers who kept their promise and fought for a win against Portugal. The Atlas Lions’ performance has not gone unnoticed as many football fans expressed pride in their team. Morocco cannot move on to the second phase of the World Cup as it finished its second World Cup without a point. Morocco’s first defeat was to Iran with an own goal on Friday, June 15.

By Dana Leger Rabat – Nikki Haley, US ambassador to the UN, announced on Tuesday that the US withdrew from the United Nations’ top human rights body, the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC). “We take this step because our commitment does not allow us to remain a part of a hypocritical and self-serving organisation that makes a mockery of human rights,” she said alongside US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington, D.C. Pompeo accused the council of being “a protector of human rights abusers.” Both Haley and Pompeo said the decision had been made after a long year of efforts to shame the council into reform. Haley added that the decision “is not a retreat from human rights commitments,” and accused the council of being “a protector of human rights abusers and a cesspool of political bias.” “Look at the council membership, and you see an appalling disrespect for the most basic rights,” said Haley, naming Venezuela, China, Cuba, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The decision to withdraw comes after the council accused Israel of using excessive force last month and voted to investigate Israeli killings of Palestinian protesters in the Gaza Strip.  Since March 30, more than 120 Palestinian protesters have been killed and over 13,000 have been injured by Israeli forces. Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the UN high commissioner for human rights, called the announcement by US President Donald Trump’s administration “disappointing, if not really surprising,” adding, “Given the state of human rights in today’s world, the US should be stepping up, not stepping back.” “Disappointing, if not really surprising, news. Given the state of #HumanRights in today’s world, the US should be stepping up, not stepping back” — UN Human Rights Chief #Zeid following USA decision to withdraw from U.N. Human Rights Council.#StandUp4HumanRights — UN Human Rights (@UNHumanRights) June 19, 2018 The European Union said that the move “risks undermining the role of the US as a champion and supporter of democracy on the world stage.” Al Jazeera’s Rosiland Jordan, reporting from Washington, D.C., said the US exit “did not come as a shock” as it was something that Haley had talked about soon after becoming the US ambassador to the UN in early 2017. Israel, a major ally of the US, praised Washington’s “courageous” move. “The primary reason why the US is pulling out of the council now is because of its efforts to reduce or eliminate of the unfair criticism, in the US’ view, of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians,” Jordan said. The UN created the Human Rights Council in 2006 to replace the UN Commission on Human Rights, which at the time faced widespread criticism for allowing countries with poor human rights records to become members. A group of 47 elected countries from regions across the globe serve for three-year terms on the Geneva-based council. The UNHRC meets three times a year and reviews the human rights records of all UN members in a strategic process, known as the Universal Periodic Review. The council claims this gives countries a chance to explain what they have done to improve human rights. The council has set up commissions of inquiry to report on human rights violations in countries including Syria, North Korea, Burundi, Myanmar, and South Sudan. The US has a long history of conflicting relationships with the UN Human Rights Council.  The Bush Administration boycotted the council when it was created in 2006 for similar reasons as those cited by the Trump administration. At the time, the US ambassador to the UN was John Bolton, who is currently President Trump’s national security adviser and a strong critic of the UN. In 2009, the US re-joined the UNHRC under the Obama administration.

Rabat – “We need to congratulate the players, they were fantastic!” said a very emotional and proud Hervé Renard to beIN Sport after the remarkable performance of the national team against Portugal, despite its defeat (1-0). The Atlas Lions tried everything, but failed to score against Portugal and their football star Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored in the 4th minute of the match. However, the Moroccan team dominated the ball with 63 percent possession against 37 percent for Portugal. Moroccan striker Nordin Amrabat, who suffered a head injury during the Iran-Morocco game, was called the man of the game, and he well deserved it for his fabulous attacking skills, showing great determination to make history again. The Atlas Lions prevented the Portuguese team from scoring another goal with pressure, great defense, and strength. After the confrontation, with tears in his eyes, the coach of the national team did not hold back his opinion on the referee. “You have to look at number 3 (Pepe) in slow motion, I think everything is said.” Renard was referring to the hand of the Portuguese central defender, which was not called out by Referee Geiger or his assistants. According to Renard, Pepe’s move deserved a penalty in favor of Morocco in the 85th minute. Moreover, in a press conference, Hervé Renard expressed his pride in coaching the Moroccan team. “We are a team that plays football, we demonstrated it again.” He also wanted to thank the million Moroccans who supported the Atlas Lions during the competition, making it feel like Benatia and his teammates “were playing at Casablanca.” Despite their elimination from the World Cup competition, Renard’s Lions will face their last opponent Spain, on June 25.

By Intissar Faouzi Rabat-The 21st Gnaoua World Music Festival will kick off on Thursday, June 21, and run through Saturday, June 23,  in the Atlantic coastal city of Essaouira. If Essaouira becomes a leading tourism destination in Morocco, it will undoubtedly be thanks to the Gnaoua World Music Festival, which brings together a mixture of Moroccans, other Africans, and tourists from all over the world. Gnaoua music is a historic style of African spiritual music and rhythms; it is handed down from formerly enslaved black Africans who integrated into the Moroccan cultural community and created a special style to preserve the traditions and folkloric music of their ancestors. The music combines ritual poetry with traditional music and dancing; it is closely attached to a prayer whose lyrics tell stories about the sensitive subject of their past slavery. It is also believed that Gnaoua music can be used as a spiritual medicine to heal people possessed by a spirits. The name Gnaoua is derived from Guinea, a place known for its slave trade, especially in the 11th century. Gnaoua music is characterized by percussion and string instruments. The large iron castanets known as “krakeb” and the three-stringed lute called “gimbri” are the essence of Gnaoua music. The African heritage is clearly reflected in the dances and the garments the singers wear.
 This unique musical event in Morocco began in 1998. Its purpose is to connect people with music and to allow listeners to forget life’s reality for a moment and indulge in spirituality. “Since the birth of the festival, its unique character has given it a place of choice in cultural events that have confirmed to the world that Africa is more than ever a land of dialogue and creation,” said Neila Tazi, the director of the festival. The Gnaoua festival attracts an audience of 500,000 visitors each year. It offers a varied program to celebrate the Gnaoua heritage and to invite the best global jazz artists to come and perform in Essaouira. At the festival, the singers, called maâlems, begin to chant in Arabic or Gnaoui. The message is usually spiritual. According to a statement issued by the organizers, the opening ceremony will feature Snarky Puppy, a powerful Brooklyn jazz band known for combining jazz with rock. The band, led by guitarist Michael Leigh and pianist Bill Lawrence, will perform two concerts in the festival. Also performing at the opening ceremony will be celebrated Hamid El Kasri, the most famous Gnaoua singer, who has admirably made Gnaoua music a multidimensional musical world. In the festival’s 21st appearance, women and Africa will be in the spotlight. When Mâalem Hamid El Kasri will share the stage with the American group Snarky Puppy, Fatoumata Diawara and Asma Hamzaoui will also take the stage to dance. In addition to Dar Loubane,  Zaouia Sidna Bilal, and Issaoua, concerts will be held at the big stage of the square, which will welcome the group Hoba Hoba Spirit. The Borj Bab Marrakech opens its terrace to Mokhtar Gania, Africa Gnawa Soul, and  Mâalem Omar Hayat, as well as many other Moroccan and international artists. Morocco today is considered the epicenter of Gnaoua music, which preserves the heritage and culture of both Morocco and Africa.

Rabat – Members of the European Parliament have urged the European Union to take urgent actions to end the unbearable living conditions of women in the Tindouf camps in southern Algeria. The MEPs denounced the “unacceptable, “scandalous,” and “deplorable” situation of Sahrawi women in the camps, victims of Polisario abuses ‘“ with the complicity of Algeria.” The condemnation took place at the European Parliament on a petition presented by Spanish activist Elisa Pavon on behalf of the “Freedom is their right” campaign, a collective representing foster and adoptive families in Spain. The MEPs condemned forced marriages, deprivation of liberty, ill-treatment, and torture imposed on women in Tindouf camps in Algeria.  The MEPs are calling on the Algerian and Spanish government to take action to end the situation, given that several girls have Spanish citizenship. The representatives of the European External Action Service (EEAS) said the issue is of particular importance for the European executive, advocating a coordinated approach with Spain and the EU delegation in Algeria. Spanish MEP Beatriz Becerra Basterrechea denounced the “lies of the Polisario” who “defends the indefensible” by justifying the deprivation of freedom imposed on these girls under the guise of the traditions of the Sahrawi society. “Traditions should not take precedence over fundamental rights,” said Spanish MEP Ayala Sender, calling for pressure on the front to restore freedom to girls. MEP Rosa Estaràs reiterated her colleagues’ comments, emphasizing that these girls are held by force and deprived of their passports and freedom. Estaràs also warned against any attempt to justify the “ill-treatment” of the victims. MEP Josep-Maria Terricabras questioned the European Commission on what it intends to do to protect these girls, while demanding they clarify whether Algeria or Polisario is responsible. On May 20, Morocco urged the UN bodies to open an investigation into the situation in the ¨Polisario-run Tindouf camps in Algeria, where Moroccan nationals are ‘held against their will’ in an unbearable and ‘inhuman conditions.’” Last March Morocco’s Head of Affairs in Geneva, Hassan Boukili, condemned Algeria’s continued ignoring of the Sahrawi people living in Tindouf camps. Speaking at the 71st session of the Standing Committee of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Boukili also criticized Algeria and its reluctance to “oppose the implementation of all feasible solutions for the populations in the Tindouf camps.”

Rabat- Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has lead a discussion on how to integrate Tamazight (Berber) heritage, language, and creative expression into the country’s cultural and artistic activities. In a meeting at the house of councillors on Tuesday, El Othmani responded to a question about “the public policy concerning the development of national languages and cultural expressions.” He said the government gives high importance to developing and unifying Arabic and Tamazight and their diverse cultural expressions. El Othmani insisted that Tamazight be better integrated into the educational system, as a part of Morocco’s “rich national identity.” As a result, the government presented draft laws 26.16  and 04.16.  The first law relates to the integration of Tamazight into the national education and administrative institutions and the second to the National Council for the languages and culture of Morocco concerned with protecting and developing both Arabic and Tamazight. The draft laws strive to boost the status and usage of  Arabic and Tamazight in public administrations and services, and in all “priority areas of public life,” including documents such as ID cards, passports, drivers’ licenses, and banknotes. El Othmani also insisted on the use of Tamazight in books, media outlets, television channels, radio stations, newspapers, and magazines.  Morocco’s National Society of Radio and Television (SNRT) will increase the broadcasting of the Tamazight television channel from 14 hours a day to 24 hours, as is the case for other television channels in Morocco. In addition, El Othmani recalled Morocco’s 2015-2030 strategic vision of education reform in relation with the three common languages in the kingdom: Arabic and Tamazight as the official languages, and French as a means of “openness” to other cultures. He pointed out that teaching Arabic and Tamazight in primary schools is mandatory, adding that 4,200 educational institutions in Morocco teach Tamazight and more than 500,000 students study the language. He predicted that Tamazight will continue to increase its presence in schools in the upcoming years. Throughout the meeting, El Othmani referred to Morocco’s free trade agreements. He noted that the country’s global market share has increased from 0.11 percent in 2007 to 0.15 percent in 2017, as Morocco has doubled its market shares in Africa, the US and Asia, particularly in the aeronautics, food, and automotive industries. El Othmani reiterated that Morocco’s manufacturing industry and technological production has remarkably improved, reaching an export rate of 54.2 percent in 2017 compared to 30.6 percent in 2007, owing to its economic partnerships. According to El Othmani, Morocco’s free trade agreements with the European union grew by 6.10 percent. As for its free trade agreements with Turkey, the kingdom registered 30 percent growth, and 16.4 percent with the US. El Othmani informed that the country’s transactions rose to MAD 414 billion in 2017 in comparison to ten years ago (MAD 229 billion), adding that the import rate reached 66.4 percent in 2017, a slight increase from 2007, owing to the country’s exports to EU countries. El Othmani concluded that the government will follow a new approach to foreign negotiations, abiding by Law 91.14 of foreign trades to improve business investments, especially on the agricultural level.

All players delivered a solid performance throughout the game, but missed multiple opportunities to beat Ronaldo’s team. Moroccan striker Nordin Amrabat, who suffered a head injury during the Iran-Morocco game, was called the man of the game, and he well deserved it for his fabulous attacking skills, showing great determination to make history again.

Rabat – In less than an hour, football fans will watch Morocco face off with Portugal. Morocco’s head coach Hervé Renard and Moroccan footballer Nabil Dirar have said it: the battle will not be easy.  At a press conference yesterday in Moscow, Renard wore a mysterious expression and refused to talk about his lineup in today’s game against Portugal when asked if there would be a surprise in his 11. “Surprises. Do you mean changes in the lineup? You will see tomorrow. We are not here to unveil the players to be playing tomorrow. We are here to talk about the game in general,” Renard said. One reporter asked if Nordin Amrabat, who sustained an injury in Friday’s game, will play against Portugal today. With sparkling eyes, Renard said “All players participating in World Cup want to play, but we have to make a decision after our last training session.” When another journalist asked if Renard wants Amrabat to play, it did not take him long to say yes. “Yes, but we will make a decision; don’t worry,” he said. “We will see if the trauma disappeared or not tomorrow. I am kidding,” Renard said after one journalist asked him if Morocco’s team is over its defeat against Iran with an own goal in overtime. Team should look ahead Speaking about his selection, Renard said that the footballers “have lost a number of matches, such as this one. You got to get it and get back to your feet. Nobody should be complaining after the game. It happened to Tunisia as well after a good game. This is football.” Tunisia lost to England 2-1 at the last minute of the game after a good defensive performance. The secret for Renard is self-confidence. “You have to believe in yourself with your qualities and weaknesses.” Attending the conference with Renard, attacking midfielder Dirar commended Moroccan fans, and said “The only solution for us is to win this battle. We don’t want a draw. We want to win. We have a good team and players and we will do a good job.” Journalists also asked if the coach and his players have an anti-Ronaldo plan. For Renard, the Moroccan team is “lucky to compete against the European champions. It is exceptional.” Dirar not concerned about Ronaldo But for Dirar, Cristiano Ronaldo “should be respected” after his game against Spain, but “he is a player just like any other player.” “We cannot afford to make any mistake. Obviously, this is Cristiano. And if he has an opportunity, he will score a goal. He is a major player, but they have other players, like Silva, and other good players. We don’t have to leave any space for Ronaldo,” Dirar added. Renard said it is impossible to make a plan work against Ronaldo. “Even if you want to draw a plan against him, he always finds a way out. He will always make a different plan. He is absolutely exceptional and outstanding. But we need to make him less exceptional tomorrow.”

Rabat – “Bouhaddouz, Bouhaddouz, Bouhaddouz,” Moroccans chanted in Moscow. After his controversial own-goal against Morocco, Moroccan football player Aziz Bouhaddouz has had a rough couple of days but can count on the unconditional support of his fans.  Yesterday, as they prepared to go to their last training session in Moscow before their match against Portugal–with kick off in just an hour–the Atlas Lions were encouraged by fans at their exit from the hotel. It was Atlas Lion Aziz Bouhaddouz who was the most acclaimed by the crowd as the supporters kept shouting his name to give him motivation to take on the football giant of Portugal. Bouhaddouz, who left the first World Cup game in tears, was also supported by many celebrities and fans on social media with the hashtag #WeSupportBouhaddouz that went viral shortly after the end of the 0-1 match between Morocco and Iran. The Moroccan international footballer has also issued an apology to Moroccan football fans after scoring an own-goal on Friday. “I am an idiot, but I will handle this situation because I have been playing this sport for years,” he said. He added that the situation was difficult, stating, “It is something that can happen in football, and I am paying for it today. I apologize to the team, the fans and all 35 million Moroccans.”

Rabat – Pundits and football fans have praised Portugal’s display of intense, direct, and organized counterattacks in their impressive opener against Spain, but the Portuguese coach believes they need to improve their game to be sure to claim victory against Morocco. Reminding his team that the North Africans are a serious opponent, Coach Fernando Santos asked his players to play like they did at the 2016 European championships. “Morocco are an excellent team, one of the best in Africa, and they have an excellent coach in Hervé Renard. We have to be very focused and intense in our play, and if we play like we can do, we will win. We have to play like we did in the European Championships two years ago. “We thought about what we did in the first game against Spain and we tried to rectify in training what we did not do well, but there is no magic solution. Things do not work like this. Portugal have the capacity to do better than we played against Spain and I hope we can correct our mistakes.” Fernando Santos is also counting on his best player, Real Madrid’s talisman Cristiano Ronaldo, to be sharp, present, and clinical. “I hope that Cristiano will have just as good a game as he did against Spain and that is enough to win the game and collect three points.” But for all the morale boost and the finishing quality that a player like Ronaldo can bring to a team, Santos did not make any misplaced remarks before an unclaimed victory, in recognition that Morocco has the quality players and the tactical means to create an upset.  “We are at the World Cup and we have to show Morocco respect because they are an excellent team.” The two teams meet today at 1 p.m. (Moroccan time), with each squad hoping to prolong its World Cup dream. Morocco now sits at the bottom of group B with zero points, having lost their opener against Iran with an own goal. Portugal is second in the group with 1 point and comes to today’s game with both mathematical and mental advantage. While both teams need to do well to expect a qualifying spot for the next round, Morocco must win its remaining two matches to ensure qualification. “We must do everything to make it a less exceptional game for him tomorrow,” Morocco’s coach, Hervé Renard, said, suggesting that should his squad successfully tame Ronaldo’s thirst for goals, Morocco can expect to have things go its way. “Tomorrow will be a final for us, an important battle. We will give our life on the pitch,” Moroccan defender Nabil Dirar said in a press conference yesterday.

Rabat – Just hours before long-awaited game between Morocco and Portugal, the pressure is higher than ever for Moroccan fans who have high expectations for the Atlas Lions. Hervé Renard’s team will play against Fernando Santo’s team at 1 p.m (Moroccan time). After being defeated by Iran with an own-goal scored by Bouhaddouz in Morocco’s first World Cup match, Friday, June 15, the national team cannot afford to make mistakes today. Coach Renard needs to show the full extent of his players’ talent to beat the giant team of Portugal. If some of the Moroccan fans worldwide did not get the chance to go to Russia to support the Atlas Lions, they can always catch the game on beIN Sports or the Moroccan channel Arriyadia TNT, beIN SPORTS 1 (France), beIN SPORTS Max 1 (MENA region), BBC One (Kingdom United Kingdom), NPO 1 (Netherlands), Canal + Sport 1 (West Africa), Cuatro (Spain), ORF (Germany), Italia 1 (Italy), RTS Two (Switzerland), La Deux (Belgium) , TSN 1 (Canada), Sport TV 1 (Portugal), SVT 1 (Sweden), and TRT 1 (Turkey). “The team must be psychologically ready, but above all equipped to fight and believe in themselves,” said the Atlas Lions coach during a press conference yesterday. “Facing the European champion will allow us to evaluate our true level,” he said. “You need to be more compact and better than usual, do a lot more and a lot better.” To qualify for the next stage of the World Cup, Morocco will have to beat Portugal, hope Spain defeats Iran, and at least draw with la Roja. Morocco’s win against Portugal was their first win in the 1986 World Cup. The former team of the Atlas Lions defeated Portugal 3-1. Morocco’s performance during the famous clash stunned several international footballers, FIFA, and coaches, including the current head coach of Portugal, Fernando Santos.

By Chase Lacy Rabat – Time has not been kind to Palestinians since the establishment of Israel in 1948. Al-Nakba (the catastrophe) in May 1948 marked the expulsion of approximately 750,000 Palestinians from their homes. The disaster worsened with the events of al-Naksa (the setback) when Israel annexed the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967. Israel disregarded UN Resolution 242, ratified in 1967, which called for the “full withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories taken in the recent conflict.” Instead, Israel pursued policies from settlement building, persecution, arrests, and disproportionate violence, to even the restriction of water rights and mass punishments. Palestinians continue to make their voices heard and resist flagrant and nefarious Israeli violations of UN resolutions, international law, and human rights. However, their resistance is diminished when Arab and Muslim countries’ supportive rhetoric contradicts their actions. These countries often cooperate with Israel politically or economically, enabling Israel’s continued violations of human rights and funding their occupation. Even in the absence of Israeli collusion, Arab policies, such as Lebanon’s, often force Palestinians to live in unbearable conditions. Arab states have a precarious past with Israel, having fought multiple wars with their sworn enemy throughout the latter half of the 20th century. Attitudes regarding Israel are changing due to hegemonic ambitions, internal security concerns, and power. Sunni states also cooperate with Israel against the “Shia axis,” which includes Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, Shia militias, and other proxies. The solution for these states, at the expense of Palestinians, is alignment with Israel. Morocco has been one of the few countries that has not contradicted its pro-Palestinian rhetoric. The political climate has changed, and traditional allies have gradually moved away from their Palestinian brethren. Gravely, Palestinians’ pain, suffering, and blood is not just on the hands of Israel, but on the Arab states as well.   This is the first in a 5-part opinion series that will evaluate the conduct of MENA region states in upholding their commitments to Palestine, beginning with Egypt. The Egyptian case Egypt was once the most vital component of Arab resistance against the Israeli occupation of Palestine. Since 1948, Egypt, with the Arab coalition, fought four wars against Israel. At one time peace seemed inconceivable between the Egyptians and Israelis. The notion of a developing alliance seemed practically impossible.  The 1948 Arab-Israeli War pitted Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan against Israel. The only victory for the Arabs in this war was partial at best: Jordanian gains in Jerusalem and Egyptian control of Gaza.  Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser precipitated the 1956 Suez crisis by nationalizing the Suez Canal. In response Britain, France, and Israel attacked Egypt. Egypt suffered tremendous losses, however US pressure led to the withdrawal of the tripartite force. The war marked the ascendency of Nasser to hero status in the Arab world.   The 6-Day War of 1967 was a major pivotal point. An Israeli blitzkrieg devastated Egypt, Syria, and Jordan’s air forces in a matter of hours. Israel annexed the Golan Heights, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza, and the Sinai Peninsula. The 1973 war witnessed a joint Egyptian-Syrian attack on Israel during Yom Kippur, a Jewish holy day. The Arab forces were initially successful, but were nonetheless pushed back by the Israelis, who ultimately overcame the Arab alliance. Though Israel defeated Egypt and Syria, the war encouraged Israel to negotiate with Egypt. Egypt’s primary focus since 1967 was to recover the Sinai. This is evidenced by the fact that Egypt was willing to downgrade the Palestinian issue until the Sinai was returned. Egypt and Israel have maintained a ‘cold peace’ for decades after signing a peace agreement in 1979. Chokehold on Gaza The relationship between Egypt and Israel has become increasingly cooperative since the 2006 takeover of Hamas in Gaza. Egypt accuses Hamas of having links to the Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood seeks to transform Egypt into an Islamic state. The group for decades has maintained massive followings through community outreach programs and charitable operations. Over time their popularity has earned them power but also resulted in persecution.  The Brotherhood’s ideas of Islamic and democratic governance threaten the secular dictatorships that have successively ruled Egypt.  Since 2006, Egypt has taken punitive measures against Palestinians, justifying these actions as maneuvering against Hamas. Egypt continues to collude with Israel by enforcing a blockade on Gaza.  Israel, in response to the 2006 Hamas take over, cut off land, air, and sea access to Gaza. Egypt has a 12-kilometer border with the coastal enclave and has been pivotal in ensuring the siege. The restriction of people and goods has severely crippled Gaza, to the extent that the UN claims Gaza will be uninhabitable by 2020.   Egypt has followed the policy of economic deprivation, banning imports and exports to and from Gaza. As a result of the blockade, no medical supplies, construction materials, or other necessities may enter the coastal enclave without Israeli or Egyptian approval.  Smuggling tunnels under the Egypt-Gaza border became increasingly prevalent to bring in goods and necessities. To this day these routes remain vital to the survival of Palestinians in Gaza. Accordingly, Egypt, with US and Israeli financial assistance, erected a wall that extends deep underground along the 12-kilometer border. Egypt also floods tunnels with sea water, as it did in a crackdown in late 2015. Not only is this further deteriorating a Gazan lifeline, but it is spoiling the few and delicate Gazan fresh water sources. Egypt under President Mubarak (ousted during the 2011 Arab Spring) closed the Rafah border crossing in 2007, though it reopened for Mohammed Morsi’s brief rule in 2012-2013.   Since the coup d’état that brought Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to power in July 2013, the crossing has been closed with the exception of sporadic openings. 

The few Palestinians that Egypt allows to leave Gaza are permitted for humanitarian reasons, university, ornear-expired residency permits in third countries. However, these reasons do not guarantee permission to leave Gaza. 

El-Sisi conveniently announced that he would open the Rafah border for the Muslim month of prayer and fasting, Ramadan. The announcement came after international attention had refocused on Gaza. 

Since March 30th, Gazans have demonstrated at the Israeli border, demanding the right of return to their pre-1948 homes. At least 120 Gazans have been killed and more than 13,000 wounded since the protests began. 

Diplomatic resurgence and lucrative deals

Egyptian-Israeli relations have steadily improved during the El-Sisi years. In 2015, Israel reopened its embassy in Cairo. The same year Egypt voted in favor of Israel becoming a member of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space Affairs (notably the first time Egypt has ever voted in favor of Israel at the UN). 

Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry visited Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu’s personal home in Jerusalem in 2016. Shortly after, Egypt reinstated its ambassador to Tel Aviv. 

Last year, El-Sisi and Netanyahu reportedly met prior to the UN General Assembly in New York. El-Sisi claims it was to discuss reviving the Palestinian-Israeli talks. 
This year a deal worth USD 15 Billion was signed for the export of natural gas from Israel to Egypt. US-based Noble Energy and Israel’s Delek Drilling will supply 83 billion cubic yards of natural gas over a 10 year period from Israel’s Tamar and Leviathan fields to Egypt’s Dolphinus Holdings. 

Egypt, in turn, plans to liquify the natural gas and export it to Europe. Egypt, until 2014, was a net exporter of gas; however, domestic needs have outpaced supply. 

In the Sinai, Egypt has been battling insurgent groups with links to ISIS. Egypt has used these security issues as an excuse to further choke off Gaza. 

Israel, with similar security concerns, has allowed Egypt to bring more troops and weapons into the Sinai beyond the scope of the peace agreement. 

There have also been many unconfirmed reports of Israel carrying out drone strikes with Egyptian approval in the Sinai. US Senator Cardin declined to discuss details regarding Israeli military action in Egyptian territory, but said, “Israel does not want the bad stuff that is happening in the Egyptian Sinai to get into Israel.” In 2016, an anonymous former senior Israeli official noted that Israel has conducted strikes for years in the Sinai with the Egyptian government’s blessing.   Though the Egypt-Israel relationship does not pretend to be a friendship, it is seen as mutually beneficial. The military cooperation in the Sinai is indicative of how the ‘cold peace’ is evolving. Egypt, in the name of combatting Hamas or insurgent groups, strangles the people of Gaza. Egypt’s economic ties with Israel help fund Israeli oppression and the occupation of Palestine. Part 2 will investigate the nature of the Gulf states’ relationship with Israel.

Rabat- With games against Portugal and Spain waiting, Atlas Lions will need the sympathy of the gods of football and a perfect performance to make it out of the World Cup’s group stage. Will Coach Hervé Renard’s boys regain momentum after the disaster of their failed opener against Iran? Will they keep afloat the renaissance that Moroccan football has been enjoying? Moroccans started wondering as soon as the final whistle of the Iran game made it clear that the Atlas Lions had lost, with an own goal, to the squad that was expected to finish at the bottom of Group B.  Morocco dominated the game against Iran. The Atlas Lions kept possession, tried to organize, and attempted a number of shots on target. However, they lacked the finishes and character that marked their successful round of pre-World Cup warm-ups. In the Iran match, there was a woeful lack of communication between the midfield and the attack. The inaccuracy of passes and lack of harmony and inventiveness had nothing in common with the excellent team that Hervé Renard has built in his two years of tenure. Defeat against Iran, given the quality at Morocco’s disposal, was unbearable. “It was the worst thing that could have happened in injury time. We can only blame ourselves. We gave away a free-kick, and then we scored against our own team,” Renard said.  “Even a draw would have been disappointing,” Renard went on to say. His side’s recent performances had won the confidence and admiration of many; expectations were high for the team to deny either Portugal or Spain a qualifying spot. But they are not losing hope. “Moroccan football team is not dead,” attacking midfielder Fayçal Fajr said ahead of the match with Portugal. He added: “We know it will be difficult, but we will do everything to have a good result.” Watching the Sochi game between Spain and Portugal, one could see that the remaining group stage games will be excruciating for Morocco. The Atlas Lions are in trouble. “I’m glad he is Portuguese,” Portuguese coach Fernando Santos said after Ronaldo’s magnificent hat-trick against Spain. Fernando Hiero, Spain’s new coach, stunned by the man whose performance had taken away a crucial victory for his first match as La Roja’s manager, echoed that sentiment: “When there is someone like Ronaldo out there, these things can happen.” But in to Ronaldo, Portugal has a sharpness and decisiveness in its way of playing. The squad is a combination of direct attacking and a solid midfield. They do not keep the ball and their possession is not impressive, but they know how to be threatening once they have it.  Stopping that midfield-attack communication will be Morocco’s challenge against Portugal. And, of course, they will have to score, too. Against Portugal, Morocco will need to regain and reclaim everything that they lacked in their opener: confidence, decisiveness, organization, passing accuracy, and a sense of clinical efficacy in front of the goal. When playing against the likes of Ronaldo and Bernardo Silva, being good on the ball is not enough; playing well barely suffices. One has to be consistently excellent. “Superman is only in cartoons. Nobody is a superman. What can happen once in a while is that a group of people when united, they can create super stories… Our attitude is to make the impossible possible,” Iranian coach Carlos Queiroz boasted after their win on June 15. Queiroz explained that his strategy had been to “try to create a mental collapse in the Moroccan players… to frustrate and block their best players.” Perhaps Morocco needs to do the same thing, adopt the same philosophy: frustrate the torchbearers of Portugal’s counterattacking machine. In addition to the tactical wherewithal that Morocco’s squad surely has, they will have the same advantage that Iran had against them: they are an underdog that Portugal may underestimate.

Rabat – “Leila Hadioui is Hervé Renard’s new assistant,” joked a social media user. On social media, Moroccans have made fun of Moroccan actress and television host Leila Hadioui after she shared a picture of her meeting with the coach of the Moroccan football team, Hervé Renard. Since her participation in the song “Malhama”, considered by Moroccans as “a failed music tribute to support the Atlas Lions for the World Cup,” Hadioui has been criticized by Moroccan fans for “seeking attention” and wanting to always be in the spotlight. This time is no exception. “All behind the Atlas Lions,” wrote the designer, model, actress, and singer on her Instagram page, sharing her picture with Renard. Quickly, the picture—liked over 53,000 times—went viral on social media and provoked thousands of negative comments.  « Les rêves sont toujours des départs » Tous derrière les lions de L'atlas ????? @herve.renard.hr @nabillayachiofficiel #russia #moscow #GoMorocco A post shared by  Leilahadioui (@leilahadioui) on Jun 19, 2018 at 6:12am PDT  “Stay away from football,” “After being in our screens the whole month of Ramadan you also want to play for the Atlas Lions,” “ Leila Hadioui wants to take Hervé Renard’s place,” “Acting, modeling, singing and designing was not enough for you?” and “Because of you we are going to lose,” commented people on her picture.   In her career, the Moroccan model and fashion icon has always wanted to try new things. From modelling, hosting, and acting to designing, Hadioui is one of the most-followed Moroccan celebrities on social media, with 2.2 million followers. Hadioui, 34, responded to the backlash with humor, sharing in her Instagram story a widely-circulated meme of her trying to steal Hervé Renard’s job. Hadioui was born in Casablanca, Morocco, on January 16, 1985 and is the mother of a young girl. She is one of the most prominent models in Morocco and her kaftan shows have earned her the experience to work with nearly all fashion designers in the country. She has also participated in films, television series, soap operas, and sitcoms, and has hosted variety shows. The 34-year-old model is also the face of Diamantine and Flormar. She recently unveiled her own clothing line, called “Leila Hadioui.” Leila Hadioui is not the only Moroccan celebrity who was criticized for supporting the Atlas Lions. French-Moroccan rapper La Fouine has also faced the anger of social media users for “bringing bad luck” to the national team by wearing the Moroccan jersey. They have blamed him for Morocco’s defeat against Iran. It must be said that this is the third time the rapper has published a picture with the jersey of a sports team that loses.

Rabat – This does not sound good for Saad Lamjarred.  Despite his lawyer’s rejection of Laura Prioul’s request for a medical expert’s opinion in summary during his court date on June 4, the Moroccan singer of “Ghazali” will have to face the truth as his alleged victim will receive the medical examination. Last month, Prioul’s lawyer requested a medical expert in Paris, aiming to establish a link between the rape she allegedly suffered on October 26, 2016 at the Marriott Champs-Élysées hotel and the deterioration of her health since then. French authorities arrested Lamjarred on October 26, 2016. He was released and put under surveillance on April 13, 2017. According to Media Part, the Court of Great Instance in Paris (TGI) has decided after all to allow the medical expert to examine Prioul to find out if her right kidney stopped working because of stress following the assault. Media Part, who received a call from his relatives, reported that the Moroccan artist learned the bad news from his lawyers yesterday. Lamjarred is still spending time with his family in Morocco where he celebrated Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr and recorded a religious song called “Ya Allah.” Lamjarred is suing Prioul for defamation over her legal request for a medical exam and asking for EUR 15,000 in damages.  For her part, Laura Prioul, who is suing Lamjarred for aggravated rape and aggravated acts of violence, is still receiving a multitude of threats and reprisals from Lamjarred’s fans. The fans are accusing her of lying and criticizing her for filing the complaint against the singer. Popstar Saad Lamjarred could face 20 years in prison if convicted. However, no date for the hearing has yet been set. Lamjarred also faces sexual assault and rape charges in the US since 2010, when an Albanian-American woman accused him of rape and violence. He fled the country to avoid prosecution.

Rabat – Moroccan generations, from the oldest to the youngest, are still remembering Morocco’s epic 3-1 win against Portugal on June 11 in the 1986 World Cup. More than three decades may have passed since 1986’s historic win, but Morocco’s team are keeping their fingers crossed, determined to create history again against Portugal. The Atlas Lions will play a decisive game against Cristiano Ronaldo’s squad in Moscow on Wednesday, June 20, with speculations on the possible winner. Surprises, a win, and a historic performance: these are some of the aspirations that all Moroccans have in mind, even those who lost faith after Morocco’s defeat against Iran. Morocco’s win against Portugal was their first win in the 1986 World Cup. The former team of the Atlas Lions defeated Portugal 3-1. Morocco’s performance during the famous clash stunned several international footballers, FIFA, and coaches, including the current head coach of Portugal, Fernando Santos. During the game, Morocco was the first to open the scoring against Portugal when legendary Moroccan striker Abderrazak Khairi scored in the 19th minute of the game. The Portuguese net did not escape Khairi’s strongest kicks as the footballer sent another successful shot on target in the 27th minute. The winning goal came from Moroccan former superstar Abdelkarim Krimau, who was positioned as the center-back, in the 69th minute. FIFA reminded its followers of the famous win of Morocco on June 11. “#OnThisDay in 1986, Morocco beat Seleções de Portugal 3-1, becoming the first African team to reach the second round of the FIFA World Cup,” wrote FIFA.  The post generated 14,000 likes, with Arabs and Atlas Lions’ fans wishing the team good luck in Wednesday’s game. This will be the first time Morocco will face Portugal since the 1986 game. After Portugal, Morocco will play against La Roja (Spain) on June 25.

By Dana Leger Rabat – The 24th Fez Festival of World Sacred Music will be held Friday, June 22, to Saturday, June 30, under the theme “Ancestral Knowledge.” Some of the artists performing in this year’s festival include Jordi Savall, Dhafer Youssef, Soweto Gospel Choir, Goran Bregovic, and Ensemble Shams. Under the high patronage of King Mohammed VI, the festival and its forum come within the scholarly, artistic, and spiritual tradition of the city of Fez.
 The festival has contributed to maintaining dialogue with the sacred through its forum and by highlighting sacred arts and music. As an incarnating symbol of interfaith and intercultural dialogue and reflection, the festival calls for an exchange of traditions and conversation in a world that is going through economic, political, and social change. The festival is much like the city’s medina, as crossing its gates is a way to become immersed in millennia of traditions, tolerance, and spirituality. For centuries, Fez has been the political and intellectual capital of Morocco and has always remained a center of exchange for cultures and knowledge. Many thinkers, scholars, artists, and religious men and women have been welcomed by Fez.  The diverse array of artistic propositions, prestigious creations, and 60 concerts and shows take place in the old city. The artistic events are spread throughout the city at heritage sites worthy of being rediscovered and valued. The majestic Bab Al Makina square, where official ceremonies of the Royal Palace used to take place, and the medina riads are explored throughout three nights of shows, in addition to others. The forum, which will take place concurrently from June 23 to 25, will feature the participation of a number of scholars, writers, and philosophers who will highlight tolerance and  living together through the arts and music. For the first time since its creation, the festival will offer workshops on artistic initiation. Japanese and Arabic calligraphy, Central Asian diphonic singing, and musical meditation will enable festival-goers to learn artistic practices that allow for internal exploration. In partnership with the French Institute of Fez, these workshops will take place from June 26 to 29 throughout four morning sessions in the beautiful setting of the medina.

By Intissar Faouzi Rabat-On Tuesday morning, a police officer fired his gun to arrest six people for their alleged affiliation with a criminal network that specializes in violent theft. According to a statement from the Directorate General of National Security (DGSN), the suspects, who were escaping on a scooter, committed armed robbery with a knife, putting police and the public in imminent danger. To stop the suspects from escaping, a police officer from the motorcycle brigade of the Kenitra Police Prefecture used his service weapon to shoot and injure one of the suspects, a former convict. The suspect was transported to the hospital, where he died. After shooting, the policeman was able to arrest three other suspects and to seize the knife used in robberies as well as stolen handbags and other personal properties. The suspects were subjected to a judicial inquiry under the supervision of the prosecutor’s office, the DGSN said, indicating that several victims of the robberies were also interviewed. The statement concluded that the survey and investigation procedures continue to arrest other accomplices.

Rabat- The Atlas Lions’ doctor, Abderrazak Hifti, has defended the team’s medical staff after he received a letter from FIFA which disagreed with the staff’s handling of midfielder Nordin Amrabat’s head injury. President of FIFA Council Michel D’Hooghe recently wrote a letter to the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) to express his “shock” on how the team’s medical staff handled Amrabat’s concussion.  In response, Hifti said in a video statement: “we have received a letter from FIFA which reminds us of  the [medical] procedures it has provided us during the congress in Sochi…we have respected the procedures point-by-point and our intervention was correct.” Hifti added that he would have been granted the right to examine Amrabat for three minutes on the pitch based on the new FIFA law: “Since [Amrabat] was lying on the margin of the pitch we did not need the three minutes…I asked him five questions and he could only answer one, I saw clear symptoms of cerebral concussion.” He concluded: “We can never make a decision that would put a player’s health at risk.”

Hifti also commented on the health conditions of other players, such as Nabil Dirar and Manuel Da Costa, saying that Dirar is “ready a hundred percent” and Da Costa has a small injury which does not warrant concern. FIFA’s letter expressed similar views to a number of international newspapers and online commentators, such as Britain’s Telegraph and the Sun. In the 76th minute of the Moroccan national team’s opening game against Iran, Amrabat fell and slammed his head into the ground. He lost consciousness for several minutes, and the medical team rushed him to the sidelines where they repeatedly slapped and sprayed his face with water.  The London-based tabloid the Sun called it a “bizarre attempt” to treat the player who “apparently” suffered a concussion during Morocco’s 0-1 defeat to Iran on June 15. “After being led to the sidelines, viewers were left bemused as he was sprayed in the face with water…More bizarrely, Amrabat was then repeatedly slapped in the face for his troubles.” Meanwhile the Daily Telegraph said: “Morocco’s medics seemed to think slapping him round the face and squirting him with water would return him to full consciousness.” Some social media users commented: “A bit of a slap and a bag of ice on his head sitting on the sideline is not going to do the trick.” “Morocco’s physios trying to knock the concussion out of Amrabat.” “Safe to say Morocco’s concussion protocol needs a little work. Don’t think slapping Amrabat in the face and spraying him with water will do the trick,” another Twitter user wrote. Although Hifti said that Amrabat should still rest for a week, the Atlas Lion who left the hospital last Saturday will join his teammates for the match against Portugal on Wednesday.

Rabat- Morocco’s rate of reported rapes has increased from a prior average of 800 cases to 1,600 cases in 2017, according to an annual report issued by the King’s Attorney General, Mohamed Abdel Nabawi. Nabawi has revealed shocking rape statistics from 2017, stating that among the 35,000 cases related to crimes against the moral order, 1,600 were rape cases. In 2017, the number of corruption cases climbed to 14,102, adultery to 2,426, and prostitution to 4,000. A total of 17,280 people were arrested on corruption charges, 2,890 for adultery, 5,328 for prostitution, and 2,384 for rape. The report also recorded 40 cases of abortion and 51 cases of infanticide in 2017. Authorities also arrested 1,729 people on charges which include same-sex activities, since homosexuality is punishable by law in Morocco. Morocco adopted a new law in February against sexual harassment and gender-based violence after years of women’s rights campaigns calling on the government to adopt the law. Just one month after Parliament passed the law, authorities arrested a 21-year old man who sexually assaulted a young girl in public on the street in Benguerir city in central Morocco. The spine-chilling video of the incident, filmed by the culprit’s accomplice, sparked nationwide uproar among Moroccans on social media platforms, who called on authorities to immediately intervene. The incident occured in January, before the video was circulated online in March.

Rabat – Following several rounds of tension on the prices of fuel in Morocco, the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) has recognized that fuel prices increased by 9.1 percent since their deregulation in 2016. Moroccans supporting the major boycott which started on April 20 have heavily criticized gasoline prices, especially those of Afriquia gas, owned by Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch. Blaming international oil prices In a statement published by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), HCP justified the increase of gasoline prices due to the impact of international oil price changes. HCP said that fuel prices continued to rise, reaching MAD 10 per liter at the end of May 2018, compared to MAD 7 at the beginning of 2017. According to HCP, fuel distributors in the Moroccan market source 100 percent of their fuel from the international market, and importers tend to increase their purchases when prices fall and reduce them when prices rise again. HCP claimed that fuel prices depend on the dollar exchange rate and the cost of importers, distributors, storage, and commercial margins. HCP added that the changes in imported refined prices are passed on to internal pump prices, with a lag of about 15 days. The institution said price fluctuations for refined products do not exactly affect the prices at the pump. The high commissioner further explained that operators in the gasoline sector claimed that of what customers pay at the pump 50 percent goes to the gasoline, 35 percent to taxes, and 15 percent to commercial margins. The high prices of fuel has angered Moroccan citizens who are boycotting Afriquia gas, owned by Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch, for manipulating the Moroccan market. In May a government committee worked on two reports to investigate the distribution of fuels in Morocco. After being leaked to the public, the reports sparked uproar on social media. Fuel revenues are easy money Morocco deregulated fuel prices in December 2015, which saved the government MAD 35 billion each year that it “previously spent subsidizing fuel, and redirected the savings to social sectors and disadvantaged people,” said one of the leaked reports. The chairman of the parliamentary committee, Abdellah Bouanou, said that the difference between the government’s set prices and today’s prices is nearly MAD 1 per liter. He added that the Moroccan market annually “consumes some 6.5 million tons [of fuel]. So, we easily reach 7 billion dirhams in one year of additional profit.” Bouanou also claimed that some companies tripled their profits since deregulation. “Their profits went from 300 million dirhams to 900 million dirhams between 2015 and 2016 thanks to the liberalization of fuel prices.” The increase of prices angered consumers, who urged the government to intervene. Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi recognized on June 8 that the cabinet needs to solve the issue of gasoline prices. El Khalfi said the government “is aware of the problem of hydrocarbon prices and the need to find practical solutions to this issue.” El Khalfi also promised that the government has been following the issue and studying possibilities to solve it.

Rabat- Yesterday, the “Malian Spiderman” Mamoudou Gassama, accompanied by his father, met Mali President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. Gassama earned his nickname May 26 in Paris, when he scaled a tall fence and the side of an apartment building to save a four-year-old child dangling from the fourth floor balcony. The boy, left unattended, had apparently fallen from a higher balcony, and managed to grasp onto the railing below.  President Keita thanked Gassama for his heroic act, saying “At a moment when… only one person could make the decision, it was you who made it. Of that, we are very proud.  The 22-year-old Gassama left Mali in 2013, crossing the Sahara through Burkina Faso, Niger, and Libya, to eventually take one of the many boats from Libya that attempt to cross the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe.  He arrived to Italy in 2014 but continued his journey to reach his brother, who has been living in France for a number of years. Since his arrival, he had been living in France as an irregular immigrant.  Gassama had been living in shoddy migrant lodgings in Montreuil, an area in eastern Paris, with his brothers and cousins. That fateful day, however, has opened a new door of opportunity for the young migrant.  After the rescue, French President Emmanuel Macron, met the young man at Elysee Palace to discuss his heroics.  “I didn’t have to think, I ran across the road to go and save him,” Gassama said. “I just climbed up and thank God, God helped me. The more I climbed the more I had the courage to climb higher, that’s it.”  In reward for his selfless act, Macron gave Gassama an award for his service, made him a naturalized French citizen, and offered him a job with the French fire service.  Since he has returned to Mali to meet President Keita, Gassama has had a hero’s welcome. However on June 28, he is due back in France to sign his employment contract.  Gassama joins the ranks of another Malian migrant to France, Lassana Bithily, who saved 6 people during a terrorist attack in January 2015.  For years, migrants from Africa have been pouring into Europe to find better opportunities. This year, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 49,570 have arrived in Europe, and 792 have died attempting the perilous journey.

By Karen Duarte  Rabat- The 32-year-old Frenchman Manuel Da Costa opted to play for the Moroccan national team, the country of his mother’s birth, after playing on youth teams for his father’s homeland, Portugal.  Despite his partially Portuguese roots, Da Costa expressed in an exclusive FIFA.com interview that he is proud to represent Morocco at Russia 2018. He also revealed that there might be a little controversy within his family when the two teams face each other Wednesday in Moscow’s Luzhniki stadium.  “Participating in a World Cup is something huge for me, as I’m representing my country and my roots,” said the player, who was born in France. “It’s a big honor to wear the Moroccan jersey because, when you participate in this tournament you are showcasing your country and culture to the world.” Da Costa added, “I was first approached about playing for Morocco by assistant coach Mustapha Hadji. After a long discussion with him and the then coach Badou Ezzaki, I was convinced of Morocco’s plan and objectives, and since then have had the honor of representing the country.” Da Costa is familiar with the way Portugal plays, especially since some of the current squad were once his teammates.  “I played with most of the players when I was young. It would take too long to name them all! However, I remember playing alongside Ricardo Quaresma, Cristiano Ronaldo and Pepe and learned a great deal from them.” He is also aware of how strong a team Portugal is.  “They’re one of the best in the world, but we won’t focus only on Ronaldo,” he said. “We know he’s excellent and surrounded by good players. What’s more important for us, however, is to be focused, precise and have complete solidarity.” While unity will be the Atlas Lions’ motto on Wednesday when they attempt to overcome Portugal, feelings will be mixed in the Da Costa household.  “I expect half of my family will support Portugal and the other half Morocco, which will be kind of funny really,” he concluded. Da Costa seems to be eager and ready for tomorrow’s match as he posted a picture on Instagram wearing his Morocco jersey and captioned it “Come on guys.” J -1 ,allez les gars #maroc #russia #portugal #moscow #football #worldcup A post shared by  Manuel Marouan Da Costa ??

Rabat – Forget about Syria’s Michel Aflaq’s Arab socialist revivalism or Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser’s Arab nationalism  or even the increasingly self-congratulatory pan-Africanism, say Moroccan sports and political commentators as they chafe at the heavy defeat of Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup on June 13. When the 68th FIFA Congress convened last Wednesday in Moscow, it was clear that a prospective Moroccan triumph would be a dramatic ending to a competition in which the organizers, FIFA, had consistently and brazenly manifested their sympathy for the North American bid. In an era when big businesses and supranational corporations have invaded the sporting world, making games bereft of the passion that once characterized them, to beat geopolitical giants with great media power is not only revolutionary. it is impossible, as Morocco 2026 discovered in Moscow. But if Morocco’s failure to beat the North American trio did not surprise many, those in the marginalized parts of the world were shocked that Morocco’s appeal to “love, passion for football, and the opportunity to impact the lives of millions” of downtrodden people did not convince even one-third of the FIFA family. FIFA even brags about inclusiveness and fair-play. Failed African bloc In the June 13 vote, Morocco expected strong African and Muslim support, even in the inevitability of losing to what Trump had called a “strong bid.” For Morocco 2026 officials, the stakes were much more than money and mere geopolitics. It was about shared values, cultural and geographical proximity, and the sustenance of a passion-driven sport. It was, they had expected, a united league of the weak and marginalized against the strong and eternally privileged. However, 11 African countries defected, preferring North America’s United bid over a bid that had campaigned on representing pan-Africanism. That was relatively understandable to Moroccan media, as the Western Sahara issue has now become the middle finger that many states, mostly African ones with regional ambitions, quickly raise as soon as their interests diverge with Morocco’s. But if criticism towards specific African countries was mild, one thing that Moroccan fans found unfathomable, and even unforgivable, was the “betrayal of the Arab world,” which many commentators said came about as a result of Saudi Arabia’s “treacherous and shameless lobbying against Morocco’s bid.” “When the Arab World divorces over the organization of the World Cup,” Moroccan daily Telquel headlined a June 14 article about the last-minute theatrics of a disastrous defeat in a contest in which both bids were expected to have an equal chance of winning. The daily went on to cite a Moroccan social media user who took to Twitter to announce her Eureka moment: at least, she said, she now knows that “Arabs do not consider us [North Africans] to be Arabs.” She continued: “My heart goes out to those who have just discovered that the Arab World does not like North Africa, and that Arabs do not get involved with North Africans.” “Morocco 2026 was a lie as huge as the Arab world,”  Moroccan outlet Le 360 lightheartedly wrote, excoriating those who speak profusely about unity and brotherhood and yet turn their backs when called to support claims they themselves had made in the eyes of the world. “Can we still speak of the Arab World?” the daily defiantly asked, after pointing out that 7 Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, voted for the North Americans. Saudi betrayal Speaking of Saudi Arabia, other outlets went further than denouncing the “hypocrisy and the lack of solidarity” that characterized the votes of many who “should have voted for a fellow brother.” In its June 18 issue, Casablanca-based daily Akhbar Al Yaoum suggested that Morocco stop treating countries such as Saudi Arabia as strategic allies.  “It is time that Morocco retreats from the Saudi coalition in Yemen,” the daily wrote. To the Casablanca-based newspaper, the magnitude of the defeat, and the actors who made the margins so considerable (134 votes against 65), made the loss “feel like backstabbing.” As if the outpouring of protests were not enough, some commentators suggested that third-world ideals such as pan-Arabism and pan-Africanism are pure tokenism, “historical lies” that never truly existed. “I’m surprised to see that many Moroccans still associate themselves with Arab or Muslim solidarity. History has taught us that such ideals are vague chimeras in which no one actually believes. It is a pity that we are still speaking about this,” political scientist Abdelmajid Belaghzal said. Of course some countries joined Morocco in grieving values it once sanctified. There was public outrage in some countries that did not vote for their “brother.”  Some officials reacted: Guinea and Lebanon denied voting for the United bid. “It is impossible. Guinea cannot vote for the Americans. There was a mistake there. We have one unalterable principle in our international dealings, and that is to support an African brother before anyone else,” the Guinean Football Federation said in a statement. But such drama of public outcry and last-minute complaints about wounded pride will not change anything about the fact that Morocco lost and that some friends failed to support its bid, suggested a statement that the Royal Moroccan Football Federation issued after the June 13 fiasco, probably in an effort to tell Guinea and Lebanon to keep their brotherhood of convenience theatrics to themselves. “Now we know better,” Moroccans said on social media. The conclusion? Simple: only in tales and the Scriptures can you expect a little David to dare to challenge and win against three Goliaths. But in the geopolitics of chaos and blackmailing that the world is turning into, power delivers, and brazenly-postured naked power delivers even more effectively.

Rabat – Moroccan authorities recorded 85,000 cases of drug-related crimes in 2017, a report on the implementation of criminal policy said on Monday. The report noted that drug crimes increased between 2012 and 2017, from 37,985 cases. Drug cases resulted in the arrest of 74,573 suspects in 2012, while 88,179 suspects of drug-related crimes were arrested in 2016. Among the drugs seized during arrests were  17,190 cases of kif (a type of cannabis), 56,318 cases of chira (homemade hashish), 478 cases of cocaine, and 1,267 cases of psychotropic pills. The report underscored the lack of health infrastructure dedicated to the treatment of drug addiction. According to a study conducted by the Biochemistry, Nutrition and Cellular Biology Group in partnership with Casablanca’s Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy in 2017, approximately 600,000 Moroccans are addicted to drugs, with 16,000 addicted to hard drugs like heroin and cocaine. Drug addiction is especially prevalent among 18 to 28-year-olds. Recently, King Mohammed VI inaugurated a new center for addiction treatment in the Sidi Moumen suburb in Casablanca, initiated by the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity. The King also initiated the construction of a center to study addiction in the Benslimane Province. The anti-addiction projects are part of the 2010 national program to fight drug addiction and its effects, implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Ministry of the Interior.

Rabat- Saudi Arabia’s Almarai, the largest dairy company in the Middle East, will open a dairy factory in Morocco by 2019.  As Centrale Danone, a subsidiary of the giant French dairy company Danone, has begun to count its losses with the ongoing boycott against it, the Middle East’s leading food and beverage manufacturer and distributor, Almarai, has emerged as an attractive future investor in the country. The Saudi company is expected to open its first subsidiary by the end of 2018 or early in 2019.  The company has reportedly bought land belonging to the headquarters of Centrale Danone in the kingdom, according to Moroccan news site Hespress. For years, many Moroccans expressed their wish to have Almarai dairy product brands in Morocco due to their “high quality.” 
 
Founded in 1977 in Saudi Arabia, Almarai is a partnership between the Irish agri-foods pioneer, Alastair McGuckian, and Saudi prince Sultan bin Mohammed bin Saud Al Kabeer. Almarai is now the world’s largest vertically integrated dairy company. Almarai, headquartered in Riyadh, produces dairy, yoghurt, pastries, infant formula, and more than 1.2 billion liters of milk per year. It employs more than 4,700 workers. The decision may have been within the framework of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 to boost economic partnership with Morocco by increasing the volume of direct foreign investment. Almarai’s decision to invest in the dairy sector in Morocco coincides with the ongoing boycott targeting Centrale Danone, the leading dairy brand in Morocco. The decision also poses questions of whether it will be the end of an era for the dairy firm, formerly known as Centrale Laitière, which has extended its roots in the kingdom since 1949. On April 20, Moroccans launched a boycott against three major companies at once, Afriquia (gasoline), Sidi Ali (mineral and soda water), and Centrale Danone, in protest against the high prices set by these companies. The boycott campaign has caused major revenue loss for Centrale, as it recently announced that it had a net loss of MAD 150 million in the first half of 2018.

Washington D.C – Last Wednesday, June 13, Moroccans were disheartened to see their country lose the race to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Millions of Moroccans were aware that the Morocco 2026 bid could not compare to the joint proposal of the US, Canada, and Mexico, known as United 2026, in terms of existing infrastructure. However, they were hopeful Morocco would create a surprise and win a majority of votes.  The Moroccan people pinned their hopes on the organization of the World Cup as an opportunity to boost Morocco’s economy, resulting in the creation of more than 100,000 jobs. What Moroccans did not expect was that a country considered hitherto as a “brotherly” country and one of Morocco’s most strategic allies would betray them in the most brazen manner. Saudi Arabia left no stone unturned to prevent Morocco from organizing the World Cup. It not only announced support for the United 2026 bid, but intensified its efforts to persuade other countries to vote against Morocco. What happened in Moscow and the power play that has been taking place in Saudi Arabia since Mohammed bin Salman became crown prince last June indicates that the relations between Morocco and Saudi Arabia have taken a new turn. The time has come for Morocco to officially and unequivocally announce its withdrawal from the Saudi-led coalition to oust the Houthi rebels in Yemen. At first, Morocco’s involvement stemmed from its belief that the war would be limited to air strikes lasting a short period of time. Morocco’s participation was predicated on the premise that whatever harms the Saudis and Emiratis also harms Moroccans and vice-versa and that the strategic interests of the Saudis align with Morocco’s strategic interests. However, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were not only fighting the Houthi rebel group, but also devastating the country as a whole while committing war crimes against the Yemeni people. The two countries are playing a dangerous game in Yemen and in other countries; they have a subversive agenda and seek to destabilize all the countries that do not fall in line with it.  For example, after Morocco supported them in their war against the Houthis in Yemen, Saudi Arabia and the UAE expected Morocco to side with them in their brazen blockade of Qatar. But Morocco acted wisely and decided to remain neutral, offering to help the opposing parties overcome their crisis. Morocco’s decision to remain neutral was intentional. It reflects a new direction in Morocco’s foreign policy towards making decisions independently of Saudi Arabia. The votes of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain against the Moroccan World Cup bid were clearly meant to punish Morocco’s decision to remain neutral in the Gulf crisis and act independently.  The new orientation of Saudi Arabia’s foreign policy under Mohammed bin Salman’s leadership is worrisome and risks plunging the whole Middle East and North Africa region into chaos and turmoil. Morocco should by no means be associated with a country accused of committing war crimes in Yemen and of starving civilians there. Neither should Morocco be associated with the subversive agenda of the UAE and Saudi Arabia in the whole Arab world, be it in Qatar, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen, Lebanon, or Syria. To achieve this goal, the first step that Morocco should take is to withdraw completely from any alliance led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. No more Moroccan men should die to defend these countries. No more decision should be made to please the Saudis or Emiratis.  Morocco should never follow these two countries’ foreign policy agenda, which is mainly inspired and manipulated by the Washington-based right-wing research center “Foundation for the Defense of Democracies” (FDD). This is the same think tank that helped orchestrate the Saudi-Emirati media campaign against Qatar since 2011. The center recommends policies for Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to adopt in the Arab world. The think tank was also behind the frenetic media and political campaign to convince the American president and his entourage to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. This center and its financiers have one main goal: to achieve regime change in Iran and prevent Iran from acquiring the atomic bomb. One of the biggest financiers of the center is Sheldon Adelson, who serves first and foremost the Israeli agenda. Adelson was a major donor to President Trump’s presidential campaign, and was behind his decision to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  There are many reasons why Mohammed bin Salman considers Trump his first patron, which led him to betray Morocco. In addition to gaining U.S. support that helped Mohammed bin Salman seize power, Saudi Arabia’s goal is to convince the United States to overthrow the regime in Iran, which would be difficult and even impossible, given the strength of Iran. The decision to take a confrontational stance against Iran was not made in Riyadh or Abu Dhabi, but in Washington, D.C. It was made and promoted by the FDD whose backers and experts make the reckless Saudi and Emirati leaders believe that the right path to challenge Iran’s subversive agenda in the region is to provoke regime change. FDD’s ultimate goal is not to achieve the well-being and perennial stability of these two countries, but to eventually enable Israel to have the upper hand in the whole region. But the Saudis and the Emiratis take the bait. In addition, Saudi Arabia lavishes billions on Trump and on many research centers, and lobbies to distract Americans from the JASTA Law enacted by the US Congress less than two years ago. The law gives the families of American victims of 9/11 the possibility to sue the Saudi government for its involvement in the terrorist attacks.  Moreover, Morocco, for which one of Jerusalem’s gates holds the name of its people “Moroccans’ Gate,” should not be linked to any policies aiming at abandoning the Palestinian people and betraying them in order to help the 32-year-old Saudi prince consolidate his power.  However, this does not mean that Morocco should enter into a tug-of-war with these countries. Rather, it must deal with them in a wise and pragmatic way, making foreign policy decisions that serve its strategic interests and that preserve its dignity and the dignity of its people. Morocco’s bilateral relations with these countries should be built on mutual respect and mutual interest, rather than on empty slogans, blackmail, and provocations.

Rabat – Following the alleged sexual assault of Moroccan seasonal workers picking strawberries in the Huelva region in Spain, the parliamentary committee of the social sector has decided summoned Minister of Employment Mohamed Yatim. The PJD Parliamentary Group, the Constitutional Union Group, the Istiqlalian Group for Unity and Egalitarianism, the WFP Group and the Socialist Group, called for an urgent meeting with the Minister of Justice. According to Moroccan news outlet Telquel, Yatim is expected to answer some questions about the alleged sexual assault of Moroccan agricultural workers by the owners and supervisors of strawberry plantations in Huelva, Spain, in front of the Social Affairs Committee in the First Chamber on Tuesday. Two weeks ago, in a statement, Yatim denied the case of “sexual harassment” against seasonal Moroccan farmers in Huelva. However, he recognized that a suspect was questioned in Spain for alleged sexual assault. The ministry’s statement added that it will follow the case to ensure all the statements attributed to Moroccan seasonal farmers are acted upon appropriately with the outcomes of any judicial investigation opened in this case. The Spanish judiciary has opened an investigation into allegations of Moroccan women being subjected to harassment and sexual exploitation at the Huelva farms in Spain. Spanish news outlet El Mundo reported on June 4 that four Moroccan women lodged complaints against a supervisor on a Huelva farm. The 47-year old suspect was then arrested and questioned on May 25 and released on bail after questioning. Several international news outlets reported cases of Moroccan women who experienced sexual assaults by their supervisors. The German investigative journalism NGO Correctiv published a story on May 2 in collaboration with RTL Nachtjournal and Buzzfeed News on Moroccan women farmers in Spain and in Morocco’s Souss Massa region in the south. In the report, women claimed that they were harassed, insulted, and raped in the field.

Rabat – Russian President Vladimir Putin and former Head of FIFA Sepp Blatter are expected to attend Morocco’s 2018 World Cup game against Portugal on Wednesday. Spanish football news outlet Marca reported that Blatter will watch Morocco’s decisive game against Portugal at the invitation of the Russian president. To salvage its World Cup ambitions, Morocco’s football team has to make goals in its upcoming game against Cristiano Ronaldo’s squad after losing its first game with an own goal last Friday. Putin attended the World Cup opening game between Russia and Saudi Arabia, which ended 5-0 in Russia’s favor on Thursday, June 14. Before the 2018 World Cup vote, Blatter expressed support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. The 2026 World Cup will be hosted by the joint bid delivered by the US, Canada,  and Mexico after clinching the rights to host the tournament with 134 votes on June 13. Blatter took to his Twitter on April 5 to criticize FIFA’s task force, an evaluation committee hired by FIFA to evaluate the readiness of the two bids. “Just recall a fundamental principal [sic] in FIFA: Decision taken in 2011: the congress shall decide on the attribution of the World Cup 2026 – and not any sub-committee or task-force. Each candidate must have the right to make a presentation at the congress.” The FIFA 2018 World Cup game between the host country and Saudi Arabia also boasted the attendance of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and FIFA’s current president, Gianni Infantino. FIFA also invited King Mohammed VI to attend the opening of the 2018 World Cup, but the King did not attend. Morocco will play against Portugal at 1:00 p.m. (Moroccan time) on Wednesday, June 20, at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. Morocco’s last game will be against La Roja (Spain) on June 25. Thousands of Moroccans followed their team to Russia to support them. Despite their defeat against Iran, Morocco are determined to do their best in the tournament. Moroccan footballer Faycal Fajr said in a press conference on June 17 that the team will try to bring smiles to Moroccan fans.  “We know it will be difficult, but we will do everything to make a good result,” he said.

Rabat – While African football fans await Senegal’s first appearance in this World Cup against Poland today at 4 p.m. (Moroccan time), four African teams have so far lost their openers, with many conceding dramatic late goals when a draw seemed assured. Tunisia, ranked 21st in FIFA’s latest rankings, only showed glimpses of that quality in some 30 minutes of the first half against England. The North Africans chose to retreat and secure a draw against an English side that looked more tactically organized and more confident in the duels. England opened the score-line very early at the 12th minute, its Tottenham talisman striker Harry Kane scoring his first in the Russian campaign. That was not even very early after all, given that a super challenge from England’s Jesse Lingard was saved by Tunisian goalkeeper Mouez Hassen as early as the 3rd minute. There immediately followed a Dele Ali-Lingard-Sterling masterful triangular move to propel Sterling in the Tunisian box; but the referee quickly went for offside, taking the pressure off Sterling. Then came the 12th minute for Kane to deliver for England on a set-piece. Ashley Young’s fine corner was superbly headed by John Stones. But Hassen was again present, almost impeccable, except for this time, his otherwise excellent save fell to the feet of the Tottenham striker who happened to be at the right place at the right time. With 1-0 in the first fifteen minutes of the game, England was sure to now penetrate the Tunisian defensive wall. But for as long as the first half lasted, England’s tactical superiority proved impotent, unable to put in the creativity needed to transform domination into advantage. At minute 35, England’s tempo was dampened after Ferjani Sassi’s equalizer goal on a penalty. If the penalty seemed uncalled for, a case of referee generosity, it had some striking similarities to the controversial Swiss equalizer against Brazil on Sunday night. VAR (video assistant referee) has not made refereeing irreproachable just yet, and teams will have to count on performance and decisiveness alone to claim victory in this World Cup which has already suffered a considerable number of bad referee decisions. The second half picked up from where the slumbering first had left off, England determined to claim a victorious opener while Tunisia sat back and waited, suggesting that 1 point would be considered mission accomplie. England put on more pressure and more engagement in the second half, looking for a goal to comfort itself in its Russian adventure. But with the high number of mistakes that come with lack of focus and a certain rush to make a vivid impression on fans back home, England kept falling in the tactical trap of the Tunisian bloc.   One expected more from Africa’s best team—if FIFA rankings mean anything, that is.But somehow, in that inferiority complex that seems to be eating away African talents at international levels, Tunisia failed itself, excruciatingly unable to call upon the individual talents and cohesive team spirit that have given it the continental and global spot it is currently enjoying. Finally, England’s Harry Kane scored his second header on another corner. That goal, like his first, bore the unmistakable Kane trademark: sheer luck that comes with a pristine sense of placement inside opposition boxes. But when luck follows a series of trials and hard-fought attempts at goal, it becomes merit. England, however slack they may have appeared on some occasions on Monday night, deserved the two points they so painfully pulled off Tunisia’s grip. Meanwhile, like Egypt, Morocco, and Nigeria before them, Tunisians can count on the traditional African gospel of protracted hope, a certain belief in the boundlessness of possibilities, an exercise in convincing themselves that anything is possible in the game, even when future challenges are more worrisome than the past ones to which they so frustratingly  succumbed. To bounce back, however, to undo their languid and lackluster opening games, these African sides will need to show more focus, more determination, and ultimately more ruthlessness inside the boxes of opposing teams: you do not sit back and wait when you need goals.

Rabat- Moroccan and Spanish women rallied on Sunday, June 17, in Spain’s Huelva province in a march of solidarity with Moroccan seasonal workers who have been sexually assaulted. The Andalusian Workers’ Syndicate (SAT) organized Sunday’s march in Huelva to denounce the sexual abuse of Moroccan agricultural workers. The syndicate called on the Spanish government to intervene and restore the rights of these seasonal workers. A video of the demonstration captured women as they held banners saying “Work Without Sexual Slavery” and chanted in protest. Some women also ululated in Moroccan style. 
After a meeting between 18 representatives of agricultural firms and officials from the General Directorate for Migration in January, Spain agreed to hire 10,400 Moroccan agricultural workers to pick strawberries and other berries for the April to June harvest season. In May, the US-based online media company Buzzfeed recounted the stories of several Moroccan women farmers who complained of sexual assault by their employers. Later, four farmers working in Huelva filed complaints against the same supervisor for alleged sexual assault. Shortly after Spanish authorities arrested and questioned the suspect, he was released on bail.  Morocco’s Ministry of Employment carried out an investigation to inquire about the conditions of women farmers on Spanish farms. After a Moroccan-Spanish delegation visited the Spanish farms, the ministry maintained that “no specific case of abuse or violation against Moroccan workers was found.”  Several news outlets, including Buzzfeed News, Spain’s El Mundo, and El Pais have reported on the conditions of the Moroccan farmers in Heluva. The news outlets recently reported that a mother, seven months pregnant, who traveled to Spain to earn money for her sick son was sexually assaulted by her supervisor. “I will only return to Morocco when the truth breaks out, I want to go home with my head up,” she told El Pais. The workers were scheduled to return to their home country once the agricultural season ends. With the current controversy, it might take longer for them to go back to their families as they wait for justice to take its course.

Rabat – FIFA did not agree with the Moroccan medical staff’s handling of Nordin Amrabat’s injury and has decided to let it be known. According to Dutch outlet NOS, the President of the UEFA Medical Committee and member of the FIFA Council,  Michel D’Hooghe, has decided to send a letter to the FRMF to express his shock regarding Moroccan medical procedures.  During the June 15 match that pitted Morocco against Iran in a (1-0) loss, the Moroccan football player left play at the 76th minute after a shock to the head with an Iranian player that left him nearly unconscious. Quickly, the medical staff rushed to his assistance. Attempting to keep him awake, they slapped and sprinkled him with water. The actions displeased many on social media, and especially abroad several foreign medias were quick to denounce “the odd method of giving slaps.” Speaking with Dutch media, Michel D’Hooghe, expressed outrage when asked about Amrabat’s treatment. “We were shocked when we saw the images and have no understanding of the doctor’s attitude. During a team workshop prior to the World Cup, we gave extensive explanation to the team doctors how to treat a concussion. We immediately wrote a letter to the Moroccans.” Last Saturday, the doctor of the national team said that Amrabat should “stop training for a week”. However, as shown in pictures by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), it appears that the midfielder is feeling fine and continuing training. According to the national team doctor, Amrabat should still miss the next match of the Atlas Lions against Portugal Wednesday, June 24.

Rabat – Personal Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General for Western Sahara Horst Kohler is expected to visit Morocco in the coming days. Diplomatic sources told Moroccan news outlet Hespress. that the headquarters of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara (MINURSO) is preparing to receive the special envoy in the coming days. Kohler, according to the source, did not specify the date of his visit. The special envoy of the UN Secretary-General is expected to meet with Moroccan officials. The sources added that Kohler will also meet with Polisario representatives in the Tindouf camps, in southern Algeria. Kohler will also conduct inspection visits of the UN Mission sites in Western Sahara to monitor the ceasefire agreement, violated by the Polisario in recent months. The Polisario Front carried out destabilizing maneuvers on May 20 in Tifariti, east of Morocco’s defense wall to celebrate the “45th anniversary of its armed struggle.” The latest violations acted in defiance of the recently adopted Resolution 2414 of the United Nations Security Council. Both Morocco and the United Nations denounced Polisario’s actions, calling for an immediate withdrawal from the region. The resolution also expressed full support of Kohler’s efforts to find a mutually acceptable solution to end the conflict over Western Sahara.

Rabat – Following Morocco’s Royal Football Federation’s (FRMF) denial, the Parliament’s House of Representatives and House of Councillors have issued a joint statement to deny allegations that 50 Moroccan parliamentarians traveled to Russia at the expense of public funds. “No parliamentarian has traveled to attend the World Cup in Russia at the expense of the budget of both Houses of Parliament,” the statement said. On Sunday, Moroccan news outlet Hespress reported that at the expense of the state and taxpayers,50 members of Parliament were granted free tickets and hotel stays to support the Moroccan World Cup effort in Russia. The news sparked uproar as social media users criticized the government and FRMF. The parliament called on news sources  to “show professionalism and investigate the accuracy of this news before publishing it.”  The statement also urged news outlets to avoid fake information that “harms the institution of parliament and the image of the national sport in our country.” FRMF also denied the claims, publishing a statement on Sunday to denounce the allegations. Stating this information “is completely unfounded,”  and emphasized that the federation had only invited the family members of players, members of the federation, and former Moroccan football stars. The football association also invited news outlets to “check the accuracy of this kind of information that undermines the image of Moroccan football and its leaders.” Moroccan political party Justice and Development Party (PJD) also denounced the allegations through a statement published on Sunday.   The party President to the House of Representatives Idriss Azami said that none of his members traveled to Russia at the expense of the state. He said that he did not receive any offer, emphasizing that members of his party “cannot accept any such offers at the expense of public funds.”

Rabat- Morocco has granted licenses to UK-based mining exploration company Altus Strategies Plc to explore zinc, copper and other base metals in different locations in the kingdom, totaling 87.55 square kilometers. The company recently announced that the kingdom issued it six exploration permits to dig for tungsten, tin minerals, zinc, and copper at sites named “Takzim Est,” “Arfa”, and “Ammas” located 30 kilometers away from Marrakech. Altus received three exploration licenses for Takzim Est north of Marrakech, covering an area of 39.80 square kilometers, and two exploration licenses in the Ammas site covering 31.75 square kilometers. Morocco granted Altus one license for Arfa site in northern Morocco, constituting of 16 square kilometers. Altus’ explorations will take place with an initial three-year term, after which will be renewable for a further term of four years. Chief Executive of Altus, Steven Poulton, revealed that the company’s geologists discovered quartz stockworks and gossanous material at the Ammas site. Poulton added that once the explorations end in Ammas, the company will resume explorations in Takzim Est and Arfa sites. He said, “These strategically located exploration licenses in Morocco are an exciting addition to our exploration pipeline.” Founded in 2007, Altus Strategies is a British exploration project generator with a focus on the African continent. Altus discovers and develops natural resources such as gold, copper, iron, zinc and silver in African countries including Morocco, Ethiopia, Cameroon, and Liberia. Morocco’s mining sector is the most attractive market in the MENA region, according to BMI Research Group, which in April ranked it second after Saudi Arabia, owing to it being the leading global producer of phosphates, silver, zinc, copper and cobalt, in addition to modest volumes of gold.

Rabat – Amidst widening security and social concerns over the return of ISIS and other terrorist network-affiliated Moroccan nationals, Moroccan authorities are confident about the country’s preparedness to prevent future events of the magnitude of the 2003 Casablanca and 2011 Marrakesh bombings. Since the April 2011 Marrakesh terror strike, Morocco’s modernized and upgraded security system has established the kingdom as a bulwark against radicalization and organized crime, BCIJ (Central Bureau of Judiciary Investigations) director, Abdelhak Khiame, told French magazine Valeurs Actuelles in an interview published on June 14. The success of Morocco’s anti-terrorist model, Khiame elaborated, lies in an “anticipatory philosophy” that deals with terrorism at its very core. Despite separatist grievances in the south and some recent—though sporadic—political upheavals, the North African country still carries its so-called “exceptionalité Marocaine” (Moroccan exception) reputation: a bastion of security and peace in a troubled neighborhood.  Although the idea of the Moroccan exception is also said to entail  Morocco as a cultural bridge, home to striking social-cultural diversities, the notion has been slightly altered in recent years. The shift has placed a particular emphasis on the country’s brand of tolerant and difference-accommodating Islam, as a factor of stability and social cohesion during and after the events of the Arab Spring. But how did this come about? How, after being shaken to its core by the terrorist strikes in 2003 and 2011, has Morocco managed to establish itself as an inspiration for other nations fighting against terrorism and radical ideologies? Why is the Moroccan anti-terrorism experience an example worth emulating? The BCJI director claimed that Morocco did not just want to fight terrorism after the 2011 strikes; the country also had “to deconstruct radicalization” in order to both limit the appeal of ideology-linked violence but also identify those most susceptible to fall prey to it. “Although it is premature to claim victory now, radicalization has drastically declined in Morocco in recent months,” he said, explaining that there now is an established network of government-sponsored experts who identify and intervene in “high risk areas.” The experts include sociologists, psychologists, Islamic law specialists, and Ulemmas (Islamic scholars) who cooperate to promote a version of moderate and tolerant Islam.  “These experts also intervene in prisons to persuade terrorists to review their ideas on the meaning of jihad,” Khiame further said, hinting at another successful feature of Morocco’s robust anti-terrorism model: deradicalization. Successfully de-radicalized former terrorists are also sometimes relied upon to participate in awareness-raising campaigns in “fragile and vulnerable places.” The effective coupling of theological re-orientation and security reforms has thus been a crucial ingredient of Morocco’s anti-terrorist apparatus.  Investing in state-sponsored Islam On the religious front, the Rabita Mohammedia of Oulemas (Mohammedia House of Scholars) is leading a strenuous battle against radical and monolithic interpretations of the Quran and Islamic tenets. With more than 30 online platforms at its disposal, it disseminates books, video recordings, cassettes, and even animes whose main objective is to prevent the proliferation of radical Islamism. The body is made of experts from various academic backgrounds committed to “de-coding and deconstructing religious radicalism.” They first identify the ideological terrains that terrorist are most likely to exploit—Arab Unity, religious binarisms (Islamic world vs. others), name-calling piety, etc.  Once they identify the rhetoric and vulnerable populations most susceptible  to such appeals, they then devise a counter-rhetoric designed to “immunize” fragile populations not priorly exposed to radical rhetoric, in addition to “de-radicalizing” those with previous  exposure to “simplistic pan-Islamist narratives.” “There are no self-proclaimed imams in Morocco. That is illegal,” other governmental sources told Valeurs Actuelles, as they further explained that everything is done to ensure that the country’s 45,000 practicing imams uphold and echo the pluralist core of Morocco’s official Islam in their Friday sermons. “Mosques that deviate are rapidly identified, and steep punishment follows.”  A new generation of imams Equally crucial on the ideological and religious front is Morocco’s tutelage of a new generation of imams, trained both in traditional theological sciences and “modern” courses in social sciences and the humanities. At the Mohamed VI institute for Imams, courses include sociology, philosophy, psychology, communication sciences, etc., and imams are instructed to value debates and critical thinking. Since its inception in 2006, the institute has attracted candidates from other African countries, due to the  Moroccan government’s extension of scholarships to candidates from countries like Guinea, Niger, Mali, Ivory Coast, and Nigeria. Scholarships include everything, from on-site accommodations, free courses, and pocket money. “This is to prevent external influences,” said a religious instructor, well aware of the financial factor in feeding the ranks of radical Islamism. The success of the institute has also attracted the attention of some non-African governments, with France agreeing to a partnership in 2015. France now sends on a yearly basis dozens of Imam Students to be trained in the Moroccan tradition of Islam. This year, for example, the Institute hosted 50 French nationals, of whom 10 were girls. Of the inclusion of female students in the Institute’s program, one instructor said: “It is the best way to show our openness and effectively fight against extremists who are annoyed by such a model.” Modernized anti-terrorist units To supplement the ideological success of its anti-terrorism, Morocco has also heavily invested in its intelligence and elite police units, creating sophisticated networks of cooperation and intelligence sharing between the country’s top anti-terrorist specialized units.  The BCIJ, the perfect embodiment of Morocco’s specialized anti-terrorist units, has often been described as the “Moroccan FBI,” an indication of the body’s high standards and commendable achievements in dealing with terrorist threats. It a special police made up of 400 detectives and 700 field agents, highly trained and equipped to root out   the various forms of domestic and transnational terrorism.  The BCIJ works in collaboration with other sub-departments and security sub-divisions under the commands of the Interior Ministry, therefore creating a vast interconnected and independent hierarchy of anti-terrorist units. BCIJ operatives have neutralized 815 terrorist since 2015, in addition to dismantling 53 terrorist cells from 2015 to April 2018. “We anticipate terrorist strikes,” said BCIJ director Khiame, adding: “We receive intelligence from all agencies working under DGST (General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance). All tasks are divided and this gives us ample time to gather intelligence and intervene in time to stop potential terrorists.”

Rabat – While several Moroccan football fans predict a loss against Portugal on Wednesday’s 2018 World Cup game, Moroccan footballer Faycal Fajr is keeping his finger crossed, confident that the Atlas Lions can beat Cristiano Ronaldo’s squad on June 20. During a press conference held in Moscow yesterday, Fajr promised to bring the smile back to Moroccan football fans. “We know it will be difficult, but we will do everything to make a good result,” he said. Fajr expressed confidence, emphasizing that he played for “3 or 4 years against Cristiano.” “He is a phenomenal player but we can annoy him…. how? by defending well!” Fajr told reporters. “I am not going to talk about all Portuguese players. We also have good players and we will do everything to upset them! Achraf Hakimi knows Cristiano well, he will tell us about him,” he added. Fajr did not play in Morocco’s first 2018 World Cup game against Iran. Morocco lost to Iran 1-0 due to an own goal scored by Aziz Bouhaddouz during the extra time of the second half on Friday. Commenting on the game against Iran, Fajr said  “we have started the game well, but we did not seize the opportunities.”   When asked about Morocco’s chances to qualify for the next phase, Fajr said that “We believe it anyway! If I tell you that I do not believe it, what are you going to say? We are not dead, we only want to go back in this game!” He added that “We are a country that lives for football,” emphasizing that the team wants to bring happiness back to football fans. “We know it will be difficult, but we will do everything to make a good result!” he added. Group B, which is referred to as the deadliest group in the 2018 World Cup, opened up their games on Friday. The first game was played between Iran and Morocco, while the second game was between Spain and Portugal. The Spanish and Portuguese teams delivered a magnificent spectacle, finishing with a 3-3 tie. Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick for his team during the game. Morocco will play against Portugal on June 20, while the third game will be against Spain on June 25.

Rabat – According to Fifa’s statistics, Moroccan fans have flooded into Russia for the 2018 World Cup.  If they Win or lose, the Atlas Lions will always remember the unconditional love of the 42,000 Moroccan fans who supported their country at the match in St.Petersburg.  The Moroccan supporters who predominantly arrived two days before the meeting, according to Arabic outlet Al Akhbar, are the largest foreign audience present in Russia. They have fired up the country, chanting and raising the Moroccan flag on the streets. Through their love and support, Moroccans want to give the Atlas Lions the motivation to go far in the competition. Despite the defeat of the Atlas Lions in the first game to Iran (1-0), a new wave of Moroccans are expected to arrive in Moscow for the second decisive match against Portugal on Wednesday, June 20. Hundreds of offers issued by travel agencies have made Moroccan fans trip possible.  For example, Royal Air Maroc partnered with the Royal Moroccan Football Federation, and arranged a program of flights between Casablanca, Tangiers, Oujda, Marrakech and the Russian cities of Saint Petersburg, Moscow and Kaliningrad In addition to those from Morocco, a significant number of Moroccans living abroad have journeyed to  Russia to encourage the Atlas Lions. Moreover, the Moroccan Embassy in Moscow is facilitating a smoother experience at the World Cup. The embassy has published a comprehensive guide to help provide better conditions for the duration of supporters’ time in Russia.The embassy’s guide contains important information on the host cities, communication tools, transportation, cultural sites, and Russian laws.

By Karen Duarte Rabat – Morocco will have had to recover quickly from their painful loss against Iran as they prepare to face Portugal and superstar forward Cristiano Ronaldo.  Wednesday’s match will represent the second time these two teams have met on the international stage. The last match took place at the 1986 World Cup, which witnessed  Abdelrazze Khairi’s two goals help Morocco to a 3-1 victory. For many years, Portugal has been seen as underdogs, but they head into this major tournament as the reigning 2016 European Champions.  Their performance against Spain on Friday has further prompted the theory that they are likely to take the victory against Morocco this Wednesday.  The 33-year-old star player Ronaldo arrived to Russia knowing that time is running out, and his performance against Spain represents his desire to win the 2018 World Cup for Portugal.   The superstar took a sensational, late free-kick that tied the game against Spain on Friday. Ronaldo’s essential performance portrays that Portugal will potentially have a long-run in this year’s World Cup.  Morocco began the tournament knowing that they would probably need a victory over Iran to have any realistic chance of advancing past the group stage.  However, the 95th-minute self-inflicted goal from Aziz Bouhaddouz, who gifted Iran all three points from the match in St. Petersburg. Now,  Morocco is left having to pull off the seemingly improbable to earn a spot in the knockout stages. The African nation is staying positive and holds a desire to impress Portugal and Spain, but they must pull off two astonishing World Cup performances to remain in this competition.  In terms of possession, Morocco was dominant on Friday’s match against Iran, but Renard needs his team to execute more shots on goal.  Juventus centre-back, Medhi Benatia, played outstandingly against Iran and the 31-year-old will be called upon again to deliver a captain’s performance against Ronaldo. Meanwhile,  young full-back Achraf Hakimi will enjoy the chance to try to nullify the threat offered by his Real Madrid teammate. After losing the bid to host the 2026 World Cup, it has been a rough few days for Morocco, but this is a squad that still holds little hope of advancing past the group stage. There have already been predictions on the starting lineup for each team:  Portugal possible starting lineup: Patricio; Soares, Pepe, Fonte, Guerreiro; Carvalho, Moutinho, Mario; B.Silva, Guedes; Ronaldo Morocco possible starting lineup: Munir; S.Amrabat, Benatia, Saiss, Achraf; El Ahmadi; Belhanda, Harit, Boussoufa, Ziyech; El Kaabi FIFA World Cup predictions have been posted: 58 percent foresee a Portuguese victory, 16 percent with Morocco, and 26% have predicted that the match will end in a draw.  Morocco will face Portugal on Wednesday, June 20 in Moscow’s Luzhniki stadium.

By Dana Leger Rabat – Rescuers claim that Italy’s new populist government risks the lives of migrants by closing its ports to rescue ships, warning that simply closing its ports will not deter migrants from making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean Sea. More than 600 people aboard the MV Aquarius rescue vessel have arrived safely in Valencia, Spain following several exhausting days at sea after Italy’s refusal to allow the ship to dock at its ports. About a week later, two more rescue ships have been barred from entering Italian ports.  Over the past few years, a fleet of volunteer ships have committed to undergoing the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean Sea on a daily basis to deliver aid and rescue migrants attempting to safely reach Europe from North Africa’s shores. The rescuers’ mission to safely transport those at risk has become increasingly difficult in recent days as Matteo Salvini, Italy’s new interior minister and head of the far-right League party, accused rescue missions of “being complicit in the illegal immigration business.” Alex Steier, one of the cofounders of the Mission Lifeline rescue operation, told Al Jazeera, “We deny being involved in some kind of illegal immigration business,” adding that they are, “doing the job the countries should be doing.” Mission Lifeline has been operating in the Mediterranean sea since September 2017. Utilizing a 32 meter long vessel, they can host up to 800 people.  “We have rescue equipment to conduct rescue missions. We also have a hospital on board for small surgeries,” said Steier, “And we have a lawyer on board to make sure we adhere to all laws.” Italy has been the main point of entry for a large portion of the hundreds of thousands people attempting to reach Europe via the central Mediterranean route, but these numbers are drastically declining. According to Ruben Neugebauer, from the rescue mission Sea Watch, closing ports will not deter people from making the perilous crossing. “We had more than 900 crossings to Spain just yesterday,” Neugebauer told Al Jazeera on Sunday. As the Libyan-Italian route becomes more difficult due to Italy’s harshening immigration laws and a war torn Libya, an increasing number of sub-Saharan African migrants are trying to flee poverty and unrest in their countries by other means. Many are attempting to cross via Morocco either by land into Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish ports in the Moroccan territory, or by sea to the Spanish mainland.  Since 2014 Morocco has adopted a more open migration policy, providing windows for migrants to earn legal status in the country. The kingdom also organized two operations to regularize the status of these migrants in 2014 and 2016. In the first operation, over 23,000 were granted a legal status, most of them from sub-Saharan Africa. On Friday, 307 migrants were rescued from the Strait of Gibraltar, while the bodies of four dead were recovered.  According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), more than 9,315 migrants reached Spain by sea from January to June 10, compared to only 4,161 during the first half of 2017, and 8,100 during the whole year of 2016. “What we can see now is a shifting of routes as migration is a fact and can not be stopped by fences and walls,” Neugebauer added, warning that Italy’s stance will have a devastating impact. “The lack of rescue capacities we face now on the central Mediterranean route will make the journey more dangerous and increase mortality,” he said. Steier says that Mission Lifeline will continue regardless of Salvini’s comments. “We are saving people’s lives – and to say something negative about that says a lot about a person.”

Rabat – The brother-in-law of Felipe VI King of Spain, Inaki Urdangarin, was sentenced by the Spanish Supreme Court to five years and ten months in prison on corruption charges. He should be incarcerated in the next few days. The husband of Princess Cristina of Spain – banished from the royal family since 2013 and exiled in Switzerland – was sentenced Tuesday, June 12. Urdangarin’s imprisonment  is long overdue. In February 2017,  he was initially sentenced to six years and three months in prison and over 500,000 euros fine for misusing the prestige of the Crown to do business with the public administrations of the Balearic Islands and Valencia. The brother-in-law of Spain’s King Felipe Vi is convicted for charges ranging from embezzlement of public funds, tax evasion to trading in influence. Between 2004 and 2006, Urdangarin siphoned off grants awarded to the nonprofit foundation, Noos, of which he was the president. However, he was acquitted of the offense of forgery, which explains the reduction of his sentence. As for his partner, Diego Torres, his sentence was reduced from 8 years and 6 months to 5 years and 8 months. The Infanta Cristina,  sentenced in her civil proceedings as a beneficiary of the gains obtained by her husband, received a fine of 265,000 euros, However, her appeal led the court to reduce the fine  to 136,950 euros on Tuesday Urdangarin, 50,  and father of four children will soon be summoned by the Balearic Court to organize his entry into prison to serve his sentence. However, he has a possible recourse via the  Constitutional Court to ask for mercy.

Rabat- Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) revealed in the 2017 annual labour survey that 247,000 out of 7,049,000 children aged between seven and 17 face the burden of employment. Some of the children’s works are considered vastly too dangerous for their age. Every year on June 12 the world celebrates UN’s “World Day against Child Labour.” This year’s theme is “World Day for Safety and Health at Work,” aiming to improve the safety and health of young workers and end child labour. The UN campaign seeks to end all forms of child labour by 2025 and secure a safe working environment for the global workforce by 2030. According to UN statistics, around 73 million children, making up 4.6 percent of child population worldwide, perform dangerous works. With respect to Moroccan legislation, article 143 of the 2004 Code of Work dictates that it is illegal for a child under the age of 15 to work. Based on the national child labour statistics, of the current 247,000 working children in the country, 162,000 (2.3 percent)  carry out life-threatening day to day tasks, namely in fields of agriculture, construction, mining, forestry, handicrafts and fishing industry. Child labour in Morocco has experienced a sharp decrease from 517,000 children working in 1990 to 247,000 in 2017, according to HCP statistics. The HCP report states that 10.6 percent of children who perform risky tasks attend school, 81.4 percent are school dropouts, while 8 percent have never attended school. 76 percent of youngsters aged between 15 and 17 work in rural areas. 81 percent of this age category are males and amongst the most affected by the dangerous working environments. Furthermore, about 38,000 of the 4,026,000 children populated in cities are employed across Morocco. The region of Casablanca-Settat has the highest rate of child labour, employing 25 percent of children, followed by Marrakech-Sadi region constituting 20.3 percent, Rabat-Sale Kenitra region employing 12.7 percent, and the Fez-Meknes region with a rate of 11.7 percent. Last year, the non-profit Insaf Association saved 300 girls from domestic work in Morocco, and revealed that 80,000 children aged below 15 from poor and illiterate backgrounds, work in the country’s homes. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), child labour rates are currently 8.6 percent in Africa, 4 percent in Europe and Central Asia, 3.4 in Asia-Pacific region, and 1.4 percent in the Middle East. ILO maintains that there is a strong correlation between war and child labour. Refugee children are the closest example as they find themselves forced to work and help their families survive.

Rabat – Dozens of people gathered on June 16 to take part in a sit-in near the home of Polisario leader Ibrahim Ghali to protest against the separatist front’s violent crackdown on political dissidence and opposition.  Chanting anti-Polisario slogans, more than 60 protestors demanded an investigation into the hanging of a man whose body was found earlier this month, according to local sources. It appears that the June 16 event is the culmination of political tensions within the Tindouf Camps in recent months, particularly between pro and anti-Polisario activists. The man whose body was found in early June was an inmate at the Dheibya prison facility, where he was being detained for his political activism and overt criticism of the Polisario Front. According to friends and relatives, who organized the June 16 sit-in, he was a renowned anti-Polisario activist in the region and was one of the harshest critics of the movement in the Tindouf camps. While the separatist front’s official narrative claims the man’s death as a suicide, his circle of friends and family said they have evidence that suggest a political assassination. They believe the man was killed by secessionists inside the Dheibya prison, who then “masked the circumstances of his death” and made it look like a suicide. An anonymous source told Morocco World News that this is not an isolated incident, as some political dissidents, who have managed to escape the Tindouf camps, have also spoken about human rights abuses and violence towards dissidents. The same source said that this weekend’s event comes as further proof that the separatist front is not the legitimate and unanimous representative of the Sahrawis, as is widely believed in the international community. He explained that the Polisario’s constant silencing and imprisoning of dissidents and critics should convince international observers to consider the possibility that the Polisario is not the sole representative of the Sahrawi people. “The world should no longer be lured by the allegations of the Polisario and its supporters, who seize every opportunity to claim that the Polisario represents the wishes and hopes of all the Sahrawis.” Prior to last weekend’s sit-in, representatives of the Yagout tribe, of which the hanged victim was a member, had sent a written appeal to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, asking the international community to condemn the acts of violence and murders committed against political dissidents in the Tindouf Camps. Claiming in their letter that they know who the “murderers” are, they demanded that cases of political violence in the Tindouf Camps be taken to the International Criminal Court. “The United Nations and human rights watchdogs such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International must open an investigation to clarify the circumstances of this alleged murder and shed light into it,” the source concluded.

Rabat – Two days before Morocco’s second game against Portugal in the 2018 World Cup, the Moroccan national team needs as much support as it can muster. FIFA has, therefore, decided to invite former Atlas Lions icons to watch the much-anticipated confrontation with Portugal (June 20) and Spain (June 25) in VIP seating at the Luzhniki Stadium and Kaliningrad Stadium, respectively. According to the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), former Moroccan international football player Houssine Kharja and former goalkeeper and coach of the national team, Badou Zaki have responded to FIFA’s invitation and will be present to support Hervé Renard’s team. Kharja will attend the Morocco-Portugal game, while Zaki has been invited to the Morocco-Spain game, which will take place five days later. Former Atlas Lions footballer Noureddine Naybet was supposed to attend the first match with Iran (1-0) but did not make it.  FIFA reserves two VIP (VVIP) and eight regular VIP tickets for the Royal Moroccan Football Federation for each match , according to FRMF’s press release. In another statement, FRMF quoted its president Fouzi Lekjaa, who encouraged the Moroccan football team to keep their spirits up after losing their first 2018 World Cup game against Iran. Lekjaa emphasized that “until now, Moroccans have been proud of the performance of the Atlas Lions, who qualified for the final phase of the World Cup alongside thirty-two other teams after twenty years of absence.” The president of the FRMF also encouraged players to give Moroccan fans “moments of joy and happiness” during the competition.

Rabat – What if the Moroccan Government had dealt in a constructive manner with the wave of boycott that targeted the “Afriquia”, “Sidi Ali” and “Central Danone” brands over the last eight weeks, instead of attacking the boycotters and calling them names? What if the three companies tried to understand the demands of the boycotters, sympathized with their grievances and positively reacted to their expectations? If this had happened, the boycott movement (be it spontaneous in nature or inflamed by occult forces, as some claim) might have abated more quickly.  The negative effects of the movement on the national economy, on Morocco’s attractiveness as an investment destination, and on the lives of thousands of workers, farmers and families, as well as on the areas where the three companies’ industrial units are located would have been mitigated, if not avoided. If this had happened, government and private sector, alike, would have learned how to listen to the voice of the people and the whole country would have ushered in, in an intelligent and wise manner, a new phase of citizen engagement and involvement in decisions that affect their lives. Prime Minister Saad Eddine El Othmani should have spoken from day one and said: “The government understands the demands of the people and feels for the families who are severely affected by high prices. We will seriously study the issue and come up with a set of concrete measures to deal with rising prices and rocketing cost of living”.  The three boycotted companies should also have declared from the get-go that they understood the demands of the boycotters regarding high prices, that they would study the situation, review their price policies, and would look seriously into what can be done in consultation with the government and their stakeholders.  Hence, the first reaction of both Government and the three targeted businesses should have been to listen to public opinion by opening a dialogue with consumer watchdog groups, civil society organizations, media outlets, trade unions, parliament, political parties, milk producer cooperatives, farmers ‘associations etc.  Setting up web platforms and social media pages to receive and monitor citizens’ opinions and a toll-free telephone number to receive calls and grievances on the subject would have encouraged citizens to voice their grievances knowing that Government was listening. Once communication channels are open and grievance mechanisms are set and citizens are made aware that the government and other concerned parties are listening, a second equally important phase should be initiated. A series measures should have been announced by the government that would include:  On their part, companies would announce a series of measures that include a decrease in the profit margin and a reduction in production, transport and logistics costs. The measures would enable them to find ways to reduce prices without incurring big losses. Continuing to communicate with citizens, suppliers and the government to achieve a price policy that is appropriate to the purchasing power of all citizens is of utmost necessity. The government and the three targeted companies would continue to communicate and listen to the voice of citizens and respond to their complaints and grievances, and go back regularly to the public opinion to announce decisions taken to respond to the demands of the people. If all this were done, the boycott would not have lasted long, and the economy would not have reached a point where trust is at its lowest point since 2011. If the government had taken the crisis seriously and the boycotted companies had managed it well (except for Centrale Danone, which apologized and took some measures that, regrettably, were not enough and came too late), we would not have reached the current state of anxiety and quasi-political crisis.  A balanced and thoughtful approach to the crisis may have helped improve the popularity of an already weak government and would have helped in bettering the already negative image the public opinion has of the three boycotted brands. Unfortunately, I have not yet seen a more disastrous approach to a socio-economic and public relations crisis! Why has not the government taken any measure? And why did not the three companies react immediately and attempt to manage the crisis in a more effective and rational manner?  Firstly, the government lacks a unified and collective view of economic issues and, as such, cannot muster enough political courage to interact with and influence public opinion. Secondly, the government sees any action to respond to citizens’ issues as proof of weakness. Thirdly, responding to citizens’ issues is seen by the government as a sort of negative empowerment of citizens. You can almost hear the government saying: “If we respond to these demands, we do not know what other demands will come down the road and affect the political power structure as well as the national economy!” Fourthly, there is what is called “state reason”, meaning that the government is always right because it has the power, the legitimacy and the capacity to decide; the citizen’s role is to comply. The boycotted companies were not more effective than the government, nor did they show much of any skills in crisis management and communication. Instead, they considered the boycott as a political campaign covered in economic terms (which is possible, but it does not matter); therefore, they opted for confrontation rather than positive interaction (except for Centrale Danone, which dropped off the confrontation approach and opted for interaction and communication, but it was too late).  The boycotted companies managed the crisis in a primitive manner preferring not to learn from international practices in the field of crisis management. They were surprisingly stubborn in not attempting at all to interact even partially with the demands of the boycotters (Centrale Danone reduced the price during the month of Ramadan, but that was not enough). What neither the government nor the boycotted companies have understood is that international experience has shown that positive interaction with citizens’ issues does not pit them against public authority or the private sector; on the contrary, it ensures their positive participation in the management of public goods and services.  “Negative empowerment” is an obsolete notion, especially at times when governments and the private sector are seeking ways to know better, respond to, and encourage feedback from citizens. The more citizens feel they are involved in the decision-making process, the more the development process is appropriated by them and the more trust they have in the institutions. It is called Citizen Engagement.  The boycott was bad for business but was a rare opportunity to ensure greater participation and rebuilding of public confidence in politicians and the business community. But we missed this opportunity: the results of the boycott are yet to be understood and evaluated; but the big change needs to happen at the level of the political and economic élite: learning to engage with citizens is key to the success of public policies and the grand development programs.  Otherwise, public officials and private businesses’ fear will become a self-fulfilling prophecy: left alone and ignored, citizens will definitely be pitted against government and business. Engaged, they will become partners in development.

Rabat – Tunisian authorities prevented approximately 70 Moroccans from entering Tunisia via Algeria. The 70 passengers were stranded at Houari Boumediene International Airport in Algeria on Saturday, June 16. Algerian television channel Ennahar TV reported that the group of Moroccan men were heading to Tunisia via Tunisian airline Tunisair to renew their residence permits in Tunisia. The Algerian TV channel reported that Tunisian authorities informed the agency that organized the trip for the 70 Moroccans at the Algerian airport to not allow the group of Moroccans into Tunisia without giving further details. The group of Moroccans work in Algeria and typically go to Tunisia every three months to renew their residence papers. “We are traveling to Tunisia to renew our residence permit in Algeria, but we were surprised when the transit director told us that Moroccans are not welcome on a Tunisian plane,” a passenger told Ennahar TV. Algerian news outlet DIA said that at least 2,000 Moroccans live and work legally in Algeria, particularly in the housing sector. To date, Tunisian authorities have not explained why the Moroccans were prevented from entering Tunisia.

Rabat – Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) has refuted allegations that it granted free tickets to 50 Moroccan parliamentarians to travel to Russia to support the Atlas Lions in the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The Moroccan federation issued a statement on Sunday, saying that, “FRMF categorically denies these allegations and denounces vigorously the content of this article.”
 Moroccan news outlet Hespress claimed on Sunday that 50 members of Parliament were granted free tickets and hotel stays to support the Moroccan football team in Russia at the expense of the state and taxpayers.
 The news source added that the alleged generous offer resulted in a “war” between the parliamentarians a few days before the World Cup. The news report sparked an uproar on social media as many internet users criticized the government and FRMF. In response, FRMF said that this information “is completely unfounded,” emphasizing that the federation has only invited the Moroccan family members of football players. The football association also invited news outlets to “check the accuracy of this kind of information that undermines the image of Moroccan football and its leaders.” The Moroccan leading political party, Justice and Development Party (PJD), also denounced the rumors through a statement published on Sunday. The party President said to the House of Representatives that none of his members traveled to Russia at the expense of the state. He said that he did not receive any offer, emphasizing that members of his party “cannot accept any such offers at the expense of public funds.” More than 27,000 Moroccans traveled to Russia to cheer on their football team throughout the first round of the 2018 World Cup. Several celebrities, including journalist Meriem Said and Moroccan singers Hatim Ammor and Zouhair Bahaoui, were also in attendance. Morocco will play its second 2018 World Cup game against Portugal on June 20. The team lost their first match against Iran after Moroccan footballer Aziz Bouhaddouz scored on his own goal.

New York – Tariq Ramadan, the most prominent scholar of Islam in Europe, was incarcerated on February 2nd of this year, and placed in solitary confinement despite the presumption of innocence since he has not actually been convicted of any crime. Tariq Ramadan turned himself in, so there was no reason for the authorities to detain him claiming he posed a flight risk.  He was also denied access to his own judicial file and mail, which makes his defense more complicated than that of any other similar case. Ramadan has been treated in a way that is harsher than that of most convicted rapists and murderers all while there is no sufficient evidence to support any of the rape charges. Solitary confinement is reserved for the most dangerous and despicable criminals and yet, Ramadan, while innocent, was placed there for months. The systematic vilification of Tariq Ramadan is carried out in the cowardliest of manners: they prevent him from speaking and defending himself and continue to spread baseless accusations against his character. The evidence and testimony of the witnesses, who are coincidentally profiting enormously from their newfound fame and willingness to participate in the demonization of Muslims and Islam, has completely fallen apart. Countless falsehoods, holes and contradictions are found in the testimony of both Henda Ayari and “Christelle,” among which is the fact that they both claimed not to know each other when in fact they had been communicating and texting for years. Ayari had also been in contact with some with some of the most powerful Islamophobes in French media. The accusations of these two women are entirely insubstantial and the French judges know it quite well. As an attorney, I find it enormously problematic and shocking that the French legal system insists on keeping Tariq Ramadan incarcerated, and under the most inhumane of conditions at that, while having literally zero evidence to find him guilty. For two months, Tariq Ramadan was denied the right to receive visitations, including those of his wife and children. I repeat: Ramadan has not been convicted of any crime.  In the French legal system, theoretically, (although clearly not in practice if one happens to be a Muslim Arab man they happen to want to silence and destroy) a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty, just as in the American system. Because of the recent “Me Too” movement, with its onslaught of sexual misconduct and rape allegations against various famous personalities, it is simple to compare the treatment other similarly situated men have received. The torture Ramadan is being subjected to has not been inflicted upon anybody else accused of rape. This includes French President Macron’s two ministers Gérard Darmanin and Nicolas Hulot, who were accused of rape but not jailed or placed in “preventive” detention at any time. So why is Ramadan being dehumanized and treated in this manner? I have been terribly distressed, hurt and angry from the beginning of this affair. My heart and constant prayers go out to Tariq Ramadan, his family, loved ones, all his followers and supporters. I strongly urge the Muslim community globally, as well as everybody else who claims to believe in justice, basic dignity, and the human treatment of individuals, to pay attention. Please do not ignore the Tariq Ramadan case. Do some thinking, some thorough research and analysis. Do not jump to conclusions when a key Muslim scholar suddenly becomes accused of crimes he may or may not have committed. Never take accusations for granted as proof that a crime happened. I personally strongly believe he did not commit these crimes and is being framed. Tariq Ramadan is extremely inconvenient to the current global structures of power. He is a strong, powerful and charismatic figure that draws millions of followers in Europe, America and globally. This is the best way to silence him and in fact (God forbid and protect Tariq Ramadan and give him the strength to prevail) perhaps even kill him: While he was strong and in perfect health when he entered jail in February, he is now nearly unable to walk. His multiple sclerosis and neuropathy have been improperly treated. He has been subjected to the horrors of solitary confinement for months at an end, which is also destroying him mentally. While ignoring the results of 9 different medical records, which all resulted in the incontrovertible conclusion that his health is not compatible with jail, his lawyer’s request for further medical examinations, and of course, his release, have been refused by the greatly “just” French judges, who will be accountable for the suffering they are inflicting on him, his family and community. Tariq Ramadan’s treatment is unconscionable, shameful and a disgrace to France. It is transparently a complete pretext to devastate Tariq Ramadan’s career, destroy him physically, mentally and in the eyes of many of his followers, who, given the situation Muslims endure globally, subjected to the powerful Islamophobia machinery, the latter is fairly easy to do. Many Muslims feel insecure, are subject to constant or frequent abuse, oppression and discrimination, and while many fare remarkably well and keep their strength, others lose hope, and due to exhaustion and the penetration and internalization of this damaging rhetoric in all media nonstop, come to believe that “they must be right” and Tariq must have done something terrible like rape some “poor” and “innocent” women. Please: it is not so simple. We need to wake up. This is a strong message and we need to stand behind Tariq Ramadan and support him fully. Even if somebody makes the worst of mistakes (again, I am personally convinced he did not rape the women), he deserves human treatment, sympathy and the support of the community he contributed tremendously to for so many years. We also need to think in larger, structural ways and ask ourselves not only small questions such as if Tariq Ramadan is innocent or not, but, more importantly: who gains the most by eliminating him? Who is benfitting from all this? Why is he being treated so differently than other men accused of similar crimes?  We are not to presume and take for granted the accusations and conclusions of the very people who have a huge stake in destroying him. This is the worst possible thing to do. Back to facts: Defense counsel requested freeing Tariq Ramadan and placing him in house arrest, which would be more than sufficiently adequate for a person who is not guilty of anything, but merely being investigated, an investigation which is far from being carried out in a transparent and smooth way, by the way. These requests have been repeatedly denied. Petitions that he be placed in a communal house under arrest with police surveillance have been likewise denied. The reasons the courts give are completely ridiculous, such as “he may rape again” even under such exceptional circumstances. The man has not even been convicted of raping to begin with. The women accusing him have instead been shown to be liars. No matter how hard and diligently they try, they cannot make the evidence fit because there is none. All there is are baseless allegations attempting to serve as the proof of the point they are trying to make. No. In any “justice system” actual, substantial evidence is required to jail anybody for this length of time. Eight months after this painful ordeal began with Henda Ayari’s false accusations, she has, to this day, been unable to produce a single piece of evidence. However, she is greatly able to benefit from her repulsive actions, and keeps appearing in red-carpet events, writing books she has no business writing because she is frankly mentally incompetent by any standards one judges her. It is a disgrace how cheaply some people are willing to sell not only themselves, but willing to destroy the life of those who have, through painstakingly diligent effort, done so much for the Muslim community, devoting their lives to uplift others and spread knowledge. Even these brilliant characters are human and make mistakes. Perhaps they, God forbid, may even become occasionally attracted to women. This does not make them rapists. And this does not mean they should be tortured as Tariq Ramadan is being tortured. This entire situation is wrong no matter how one looks at it. As is the reaction of many in the Muslim community who have jumped to conclusions and summarily condemn Tariq Ramadan. The only proven crime to this day is the one that continues to be perpetrated by the French against Tariq Ramadan: the infliction of physical, mental, spiritual, emotional, and financial torture, defamation, etc etc. Henda Ayari’s computer and cell phones have been thoroughly searched by the police and technical experts have produced zero evidence. However, when she began her false campaign against Ramadan, she claimed she had plenty of evidence. Tariq Ramadan’s lawyer, however, produced incontestable evidence of the fact that while she claimed she had stopped contacting Ramadan in 2013, more than 300 emails from her to him were produced, dating August 2014, where Ayari was actually the one begging him to see her, not cut her off, meet her, etc. This is all after the alleged rape, and after she shamefully claimed in public, blatantly lying, that she was “terrified” of Ramadan to such an extent that even saying his name was difficult. Now, as women, we really need to be careful with what we say. There is a strong propaganda machine that “brainwashes” people to levels we may not be aware. Ayari is not a stable person mentally and it is clear and obvious to most competent people that becoming an Islamophobe is a profitable career choice these days, as is selling fake and shallow new-age spirituality under the guise of “Sufism,” coming from people who have no business guiding others since they cannot manage to even guide their own selves or families and know nothing whatsoever of the Islamic tradition. We need to wake up and re-assess our values and priorities. All of this is terribly wrong and will sooner or later have devastating consequences not just for those we harm or falsely guide, but for our own selves too. I am not asking for altruism, but for self-consciousness and a minimum degree of integrity, reflection and honesty. For a thorough analysis on the Tariq Ramadan case, please read Alain Gabon’s excellent analysis, which I used to write this article. I often have to stop myself from checking on Tariq Ramadan because my outrage and heartbreak become paralyzing. Also please read Peter Oborne’s article on Tariq Ramadan and the integrity of French “justice,” and finally, my own article for Morocco World News, which I happily discovered was republished by Arab America: On the Overlooked Stigmatization of Muslim, Arab, Latin Men. Tariq Ramadan would never have been treated in this cruelest of manners had he been a white prominent scholar, and we all know this. The standards used to judge an Arab man are entirely different than those used for European or American white men. This is so wrong. And needs to stop. Please sign the petition to support Tariq Ramadan’s immediate release.

Rabat – The recent failed treasure-hunting attempt in Serghina, 135 South East of Fez, is an example of Morocco’s infantile thought. Infantile thought makes the person admire myths because it feeds his imagination and allows him, according to psychoanalysis, to relieve his daily frustrations so that he always takes the role of a legendary hero. As he grows, the child gradually recognizes reality and realizes that all myths were a mere metaphor. In the beginning, the child believes the storyteller and considers him one of the mythical characters and that he is right. But when he grows up, he realizes that the storyteller is only telling stories, and their relationship becomes mature and rational. Believing in the personalities of jinn, angels, demons, the “zouhri” (children who find treasure), and magic and miracles as concrete and true facts attests to the infantile thought of Moroccans and Arabs. They do not differentiate between myths, metaphors, and reality, and they still believe storytellers. This is due to several reasons: When ancient religions emerged, man was illiterate and ignorant, and religion came to educate him and turn him into a mature man. Humanity was then at an infantile level, and hence religious texts identified several concepts in a material form, such as jinn, Satan, hell, paradise, and angels. In our time we should have realized that all these concepts were only metaphors! For example, the devil is only the animal aspect of the human form and angels are only the spiritual aspect, which should be developed by getting closer to God through religion. Paradise indicates only the degree of the soul’s growth as it approaches God, and hell indicates the soul’s distance from God. When religions emerged, it was not possible for humanity at an infantile level to recognize these metaphysical facts, and they had to be identified in a material form. Unfortunately, the spokesmen of religion still speak and narrate fictional things meticulously, making the Arabs believe in imagination in a magical way, especially as these stories are almost inspired by religious texts. Thus, imagination becomes an absolute reality. This is what makes Moroccans believe everything that is imaginary and magical. All religions recount a number of miracles, but these miracles were credible in their time and among the people who witnessed them. How could we believe what we did not see? But since miracles have a religious character, then they may become true. This is why the Moroccan believes everything that is imaginary and mysterious and thus believes in the zouhri hand, the hidden treasure, the extraordinary ability of Qur’an memorizers, exorcists, magic, sorcery, jinn possession, and the powers of incense. In any religious gathering, the talk of the preacher is full of fairy tales that dazzle the audience. We know that magical and fictional stories feed imagination and deactivate critical thought. Thus, there is no difference between the storyteller that tells magic tales and the preacher who also tells fictional stories of miracles, magic, demons, angels, jinn, paradise, and hell, and is believed by the mature audience with infantile thought as long as the stories have a religious character. All of the above proves that Moroccan thought is still infantile and can believe all religious superstitions. Since the Moroccans concretely believe in miracles and believe that the word of God is capable of transforming earth into gold, the storyteller (impostor) finds the conditions conducive for them to believe in his miracles especially when he uses sacred texts. If religion developed, the specialists of all sciences reviewed religious texts, and the religious discourse became a discourse that agreed with science and disposed of all myths, we would not unfortunately see hundreds of Moroccans in Serghina searching for hidden treasure! If education was compulsory with the indoctrination of critical thought, exorcists and sorcerers would disappear and we would see Morocco progress towards a mature and educated human civilization!

Rabat – Can you see the resemblance? With his lucky white shirt and smoldering eyes, Hervé Renard seems to have worked his charm worldwide. Despite Morocco losing to Iran by scoring on itself l during the first 2018 World Cup game, the coach of the national team can find solace in his “ridiculous[ly] good looks” that have attracted much attention on social media. The “Morocc[an team] is filled with decent-looking players, but no one comes close to Hervé Renard,” said one social media user.  The 49-year-old heartthrob was even compared to a Disney prince, Matthew McConaughey, and the handsome Game of Thrones’ character, Jamie Lannister.      The “Frenchman, with his long, blonde locks and chiseled jawline, is a dead ringer for [the] ruthless Game of Thrones knight,” wrote the British outlet, the Sun. “Morocco is managed by the notorious character, Herve Renard. The Frenchman has coached both the Ivory Coast and Zambia to African Nations Cup wins, as well as having a stint as head coach of Cambridge United in 2004. Pretty sure he was in Shrek too,” said a Twitter user, who shared a picture of the film’s prince charming.  However, Africa’s highest-paid coach was not concerned with praises of his charm, being more preoccupied by his team’s first loss. Speaking after the game, Renard expressed his disappointment with Morocco’s 1-0 loss, in which it scored on itself. In a post-match conference held in St. Petersburg, Renard said that he was very disappointed with the result, and adding that he would have “come to the conference disappointed” even if the game finished in a draw. The coach also expressed that he hoped his team would do better in its second match against Portugal on June 20.

Rabat – A Moroccan national was stabbed to death with a knife during a fight between migrants in northwestern Bosnia. Police in Bosnia reported that the 24-year old Moroccan man was killed when violence between migrants broke out in Velika Kladusa, a town located in Bosnia and Herzegovina on Friday. Police spokeswoman Sneza Galik told N1 television that the Moroccan national died due to the stab wound. Before his death, the man was transferred to the local hospital of Velika Kladusa on Friday at 11:00 p.m. The police spokeswoman did not give details about the perpetrators of the attack. Police opened an investigation to determine the circumstances of the incident. Official figures cited by Al-Shark Al Aawsat.com notes that Velika Kladusa is home to nearly 350 migrants. The same source added that Bosnia experiences a high influx of migrants, who cross Bosnia to reach Western Europe.  Since the start of 2018, more than 5,500 undocumented migrants entered the country.

BeIN Sports also called on FIFA to take measures against the channel, investing GBP 12,000 to stop BeOutQ from stealing broadcasts of sports events.

Rabat- A reportedly drunk Taxi driver has plowed into World Cup fans in central Moscow on Saturday afternoon, causing the injury of seven individuals. At least seven pedestrians including Mexico football team supporters who flocked to the Russian capital city to watch the World Cup 2018 games have been injured, reported Russian news agencies, TASS and Interfax. Russian police authorities informed the press that the driver had lost control of the vehicle before it hit the victims who are currently being hospitalized. Authorities said that the driver tried to escape the scene before officials detained him on the spot.

Rabat – A court in Finland sentenced Moroccan asylum seeker Abderrahman Bouanane, who stabbed two people to death in Turku, Finland in August 2017, to life in prison. French news agency AFP reported that the man was sentenced for terror-related murders and eight attempted murders by the southern Finland district court. Before the court decision, Finnish authorities described the stabbing attack as a “terrorist act.” After his arrest, the 23-year-old suspect denied having a terrorist motive and intentions to commit murder. Finnish media reported in August that the suspect claimed responsibility for the attack. According to Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), the suspect had given “false information” to the Finnish authorities when he arrived in Finland and requested asylum. Six other people have been arrested on suspicions of being involved in the attack. Three of them have since been released. The attack happened just a day after the terror attacks in Barcelona, where 14 people were killed and at least 100 people were injured.

Rabat – Daylight Saving Time (GMT+1) will begin on Sunday, June 17, at 2:00 a.m in Morocco. The decision is an implementation of Decree Number 2-13-781, from September 2013, modifying an earlier decree on changing time, according to the Ministry of Administration, Modernization and Civil Service. When Ramadan falls in the summer, Morocco switches to the standard time before the holy month. The country then returns to Daylight Saving Time days after Eid Al-Fitr, the Muslim holiday marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Morocco celebrated Eid Al-Fitr on Friday, June 15. The first day of Shawwal marks Eid Al-Fitr. The North African country also switches back to standard time in winter and turns the clocks forward again in summer for Daylight Saving Time. The decision to implement Daylight Saving Time in Morocco did not please many Moroccan citizens. In 2017, a group of activists launched a petition calling on Prime Minister Saad Eddine El Othmani and the Parliamentary Council to abolish the biannual time change and maintain Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The Cabinet, however, did not respond to the demand of the petition. A similar debate has been raised in Europe recently, as several member countries urged the EU to consider abolishing Daylight Saving Time. Daylight Saving Time was first adopted during World War I in the UK in order to give factories more daylight hours in which to operate, thereby aiding the war.

Rabat – Young Moroccans made their voices heard at the 2018 edition of Yo!Fest @ the European Youth Event. Yo!Fest @ the European Youth Event 2018 is an important festival that brings young people from all over Europe together to celebrate what it means to be a young European. This year’s festival brought 8,000 young people representing 104 youth organizations to Strasbourg, France from June 1-2. On the menu were debates, workshops, talks, exhibitions and performances celebrating what it means to be a young European.  The youths in attendance came from a wide variety of backgrounds, including several participants who trace their origins to Morocco.  One notable participant of Moroccan origin was Yasmine Ouirhrane, a 22-year-old Italian citizen of Moroccan origin. Ouirhrane is member of the 2018 Women Deliver Young Leaders cohort and works with the United Network of Young Peacebuilders on expanding the inclusion of youth in peace processes.  Ouirhrane contributed to the festival’s program with an event titled “Staying alive in turbulent times means staying united and elevating the European motto of ‘Unity in Diversity’ in a time where populisms and extremisms threaten the Union. If I had to describe this campaign in a few words, I would say, ‘Alive, Different and United.’” She also helped organize a second event titled “Generation Y: What Is Your Biggest Fear?” In this event, Ouirhrane shared her own experiences as the daughter of immigrants and offered her perspective on the political crises currently taking place in Italy. Thanks to the European Parliament’s sponsorship of the YO!Fest, Ouirhrane found a platform to share her experience with young people who share a similar family history. Many other young people of Moroccan origin participated in the festival. Nousseiba, a 16-year-old French citizen of Moroccan origin, was part of a plenary session in the European Parliament that discussed the topic of banning the burkini. Other European citizens of Moroccan origin were interviewed by France 3 about their experiences both in Europe and at the festival.  Yassine, a 26-year-old French citizen of Moroccan origin, stated, “We don’t learn about the European Union enough at school, we should learn more, because when I came here I realized how important the Union is and today I feel fully European.”  To learn more, check out the interview by France 3 and the official Yo!Fest 2018 video.

The nerve-racking match had both teams and the spectators on edge as the two persistent teams battled to score a goal against the other, which didn’t happen until late in the game.  Then came the added time and Morocco’s own goal scored by Aziz Bouhaddouz, making Iran the winner. Morocco has not yet recovered from the ill-fated loss against Iran in its World Cup opener. Midfielder Noureddine Amrabat, who fell and slammed his head into the ground during the match, is currently suffering from a concussion and will not be participating in the training session for the match against Portugal on June 20. During the after-match press conference in St. Petersburg, head coach Hervé Renard expressed extreme disappointment with the result, saying that he would have “come to the conference disappointed” even if the game finished with a draw.

Rabat- The Gallup Global Law and Order index, the world’s leading survey on social trust and safety, has published its latest report on the state of security and safety around the world. While most of the report’s findings support general beliefs and expectations, the numbers and data highlighted some rather surprising trends, most notably with many countries in the MENA region—viewed by many as the epicenter of instabilities and crises—ranking higher in safety than many countries in Europe and the Americas. With an overall score of 81 points out of 100 possible, Morocco’s Law and Order Index puts it fourth in Africa’s safest countries, just below Egypt (88), Rwanda (83), and Mauritius (82). Ethiopia and Algeria are next, both scoring 79.  This score also makes Morocco the third safest country in the Arab world, below Egypt (88) and Jordan (86). According to Gallup, over 148,000 adults took part in the survey, answering questions about how safe and secure they felt in their country or community. Also assessing the level of social trust, the survey asked people if they felt safe walking at night, whether they had been victims of theft or burglary in the past twelve months, and whether they trusted their local law enforcement authorities. Morocco’s score, which puts it near the total of countries like France and the USA (both at 84), could be an indication of the success of the North African country’s continuing efforts to enhance its security system.  Recent improvements in that regard include the creation of a new institute for investigations and intelligence-related operations.  Equally important is the provision of security by local police in big cities like Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakech, Agadir, etc., as well as tough border security measures to shield the country against North Africa’s prevailing market of illicit arms trafficking and other transnational criminal networks. Singapore topped the Global Law and Order Report with an impressive overall score of 97, while Venezuela came in last with a score of 44.  At the regional level, Latin America and the Caribbean scored lowest on security, while the MENA region outranked regions like Eastern Europe and South East Asia.  Despite improvements in sub-Saharan Africa, social trust is still a crucial issue. Four countries in the region—Botswana, South Africa, Liberia, and Gabon—remain in the top 10 of the countries where people are “least likely to feel safe.”  Rwanda scored highest on the continent regarding the number of people who feel safe walking at night. However, confidence in authorities also remains an issue in sub-Saharan Africa, with only 60% of respondents in the region reporting that they trust the police.  North Africa’s police trust average was found to be 68%, making the region Africa’s best performer in security and safety issues.

Rabat – Moroccan football star Nordin Amrabat is expected to join his fellow teammates in the training field within a week, according to his doctor, who said that Amrabat’s health condition is “stable.” Amrabat suffered a head injury in the 76th minute of the Moroccan national team’s first game of the 2018 World Cup. He lost consciousness for several minutes following the blow to his head. The team’s medical staff rushed Amrabat off the field, slapping him repeatedly and spraying his face with water once he was safely on the sidelines. The footballer then was transferred to a hospital in St. Petersburg for a medical examination. Scanner tests revealed that his condition was not critical. The footballer left the hospital this Saturday. “The health of the player is stable and does not cause concern. He will leave the hospital on Saturday,” national football team doctor Abderazzak Hifti. ????? ???? ??? ?????? ? . . . . . . . . #?????? ?? . . . . . . #celebrity #Maroc #morocco #shakira #saadlamjarred #ahlamalshamsi #nancyajam #kardashian #basmaboussel #uae #beauty #???? #ihabamir #salmarachid #usa #hananeelkhader #??? #????? #???? #?????? #????? #balqeesfathi A post shared by  ?????? ????????

Rabat- Yemen’s Hudaida airport has allegedly been captured by Saudi and UAE-led coalition forces, freeing it from Houthi control.  Yesterday, a Yemeni military Twitter account announced that the airport was now, “freed from the grip of the Houthi militia.” However, this claim has not yet been verified with Houthi sources. The airport is located just three miles south of Hudaida, a Yemeni port city whose southern outskirts have witnessed fierce fighting between the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels and the Saudi and Emirati-backed Yemeni military. On Wednesday, coalition forces launched an offensive on the strategic port city. 70 percent of Yemen’s imports pass through the city of 600,000 people. Given the ongoing fighting, the UN has warned that nearly half the city’s population – some 250,000 people – could lose everything, even their lives. Residents of Hudaida and those living in the vicinity of the airport are besieged, and the situation is becoming increasingly dire. As of Thursday, 280 people, including 30 Houthi rebels and nine coalition fighter,  have been killed in the offensive. The UN security council met twice this week to discuss the situation in Yemen. However, it stopped short of demanding an immediate ceasefire on the city, instead urging all combatants to exhibit restraint.  The destruction of infrastructure threatens to provoke a massive humanitarian catastrophe. Yemen is on the brink of famine and reeling from a massive cholera outbreak, and the food and supplies that pass through Hudaida are essential for the majority of Yemen’s already destitute populace. According to estimates, some 22.2 million people, or 75 percent of Yemen’s population, are in need of humanitarian assistance.

Marius Bordat  Rabat – Morocco’s national soccer team began the 2018 World Cup with a very disappointing game against Iran. They lost 0-1 in overtime thanks to an own-goal by Aziz Bouhaddouz in the 95th minute.  The second game of the Cup’s Group B pitted Portugal against Spain. Exciting and suspenseful, the game ended in a 3-3 tie after Cristiano Ronaldo, who had an amazing performance, scored his third goal. Late in the game, with Spain leading 3-2, Ronald evened the score with a perfect 88th-minute free kick. As a result of the tie between Spain and Portugal, Iran has now taken first place in Group B.   So, what are the chances of Morocco qualifying for the next round?  Even though Morocco lost their first match, they demonstrated a very good offensive game, dominating possession of the ball. The Lions had many occasions to score but weren’t able to take advantage of them. The Iranian soccer team can thank their goalkeeper for an excellent save against Hakim Ziyech’s shot on target.  Morocco’s loss was at least partly due to the team’s lack of experience in big tournaments. Throughout the game, the Moroccan team made numerous mistakes in their passes and in maintaining control of the ball.  In the later match opposing Portugal and Spain, we saw an extraordinary Cristiano Ronaldo leading his team. During the first half, Portugal’s aggressive defense disrupted the “tiki taka” tactic used by the Spanish team to maintain possession of the ball. However, this approach quickly exhausted the Portuguese team. The Spanish team’s strengths were on display in their match against Portugal, and the Moroccan team would be well advised to take these strengths into consideration when they face off against Spain on June 25th.   The Spanish are a collective in which no individual player dominates the others. Their unique playing style is characterized by rapid passes. Prior to the World Cup, there was some uncertainty surrounding their striker, Diego Costa. However, he had a very strong performance and managed to score two goals. On the other hand, David De Gea, the Spanish goalkeeper, made a huge mistake on the second goal conceded to Portugal, which may have rattled his confidence.    Despite this surprising first day, all is not lost for the Moroccan team. Qualifying for the next round is possible but will be difficult. There are still two more games to play: against Portugal next Wednesday and against Spain the following Monday. The Lions can go on to the next round if they manage to claim victory in both of these upcoming matches.  Against Portugal, Morocco will need a flawless performance from Mehdi Benatia to defend against Ronaldo – when Ronaldo is held in check, Portugal is not the same team. Morocco must make the most of all their scoring opportunities, especially because they will likely have far fewer of them in the next two games than they had against Iran.  On the 25th, the Lions will need to play an aggressive defense to disrupt Spain’s strategy, and they will need to focus on counterattacking to have a chance at a successful result.

Rabat – “Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose,” said Iranian football player Reza Ghoochannejhad on social media. Despite his controversial score against his own team, Aziz Bouhaddouz can count on the support of his fans, and moreover, on the surprising support of some members of Iran’s 2018 World Cup team. The Moroccan attacker, who called himself an “idiot” after scoring the own-goal that won the game for Iran, can find comfort in the reassuring messages of the Iranian national team.  @aziz_bouhaddouz I don’t know you personally but in life, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

The Portuguese team just eked out a victory against Spain with a late-in-the-game free kick. The team’s superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo, was responsible for all three of his team’s goals. Spain, who claimed three goals against the Portuguese team, will be Morocco’s final opponent in the first round, on June 25.

Rabat – Moroccan international footballer Aziz Bouhaddouz issued an apology to Moroccan football fans after scoring an own-goal at Morocco’s first 2018 World Cup game against Iran on Friday. Bouhaddouz entered the game in the 76th minute after Morocco’s head coach Hervé Renard called for an exchange. In the stoppage time, Bouhaddouz mistakenly scored against his team, which made him leave the St. Petersburg stadium in tears. Apologizing to his fans, Bouhaddouz said, “I am an idiot, but I will handle this situation because I have been playing this sport for years.” He told French news outlet L’Equipe that the game “was difficult for all players. We started the game well, but we did not seize the opportunities.” He added that the situation was difficult, stating, “It is something that can happen in football, and I am paying for it today. I apologize to the team, the fans and all 35 million Moroccans.”  Many football fans – among them a number of Moroccan celebrities – showed support for Bouhaddouz after the game. One such supportive fan was the diva Latifa Raafat, who took to Facebook, where she published the following message for Bouhaddouz:    “Keep your head up my brother, Moroccan men’s tears are very expensive. Mistakes happen. It is enough that you prove to the world that you have played well.”  Football fans, footballers and Renard all felt disappointed following the loss in Morocco’s first game of the 2018 World Cup, especially as they were expecting a win against Iran. However, the coach expressed hope in a post-match conference, saying that the team will focus on their second game with Portugal. Moroccan midfielder Amine Harit, who was called the man of the game, also said that the Moroccan football team should forget the defeat and focus on its two upcoming games against Portugal and Spain. Morocco will play its second game against Portugal on June 20 in Moscow’s Luzhniki stadium. The team’s last game of this round will be against Spain on June 25 in Kaliningrad Stadium.

By Karen Duarte  Rabat – Spain and Portugal tied in their first 2018 World Cup game 3-3 in Sochi’s Fisht stadium on Friday.   With Spain being the 2010 World Champions and Portugal holding the 2016 European Champion title, this was not going to be an easy game.  Portugal began the first half strong, scoring two goals; Spain only scored one.  Three minutes into the game, star Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo scored a penalty kick. Predicting poorly, Spain goalie David de Gea dove to the opposite side, giving Ronaldo a chance to score and lead his team.  Twenty minutes later, Spanish forward Diego Costa beat two Portuguese defenders, striking the ball into the right corner of the goal.  Hungry to score another goal, Spanish forward Isco strikes the ball from outside the box and it unluckily hit the top bar, making the ball bounce right above the goal line. Goal technology called it a “no goal.”  In the 44th minute, Ronaldo powerfully kicked the ball, which bounced off De Gea and entered the net,ending the first half Portugal 2-1.  Starting the second half strong, Spain gained the opportunity to score 2 early goals back to back.  Costa took advantage of a free kick given to Spain by sliding past a Portugal defender and getting his foot on the ball, scoring in the 55th minute.  Wasting no time, Spanish defender Nacho ran down the field and took a shot from the edge of the box, getting the ball behind the net 3 minutes later.  Ronaldo completed his hat-trick with a sensational free-kick goal. The ball had enough curve and curl to go overtop Spanish players Pique and Ramos, leaving De Gea with no chance in the 88th minute.  Although Spain dominated the match with 67 percent possession over the ball against 33 percent for Portugal, the match ended with a 3-3 tie.  Spain and Portugal, like Morocco and Iran, are in the World Cup’s Group B. Morocco plays its next game against Portugal Wednesday, June 20.

Rabat – The head coach of Morocco’s national football team, Hervé Renard, expressed his disappointment after Morocco’s 1-0 own goal loss to Iran in its first 2018 World Cup game. In a post-match conference held in St. Petersburg, Renard said that he is very disappointed with the result, saying that he would have“come to the conference disappointed” even if the game finished with a draw. He added that people “can imagine what the defeat means” as Morocco missed “lots of opportunities. I think it is the worst thing that could have happened in an additional time.” The coach also expressed hope to see his team achieve a better result in the second match against Portugal on June 20. Moroccan midfielder Amine Harit, who accompanied Renard in the press conference, told reporters: “I would have preferred not to be called the man of the match and win the match. I think it would have been the same for any other player.”  Harit showed an excellent performance, but missed several opportunities to disappoint the Iranian team.  Harit agreed with his coach, saying that the team had a lot of opportunities to win the game. “I think we have a lots of opportunities, but we were not efficient and I am the first in line and I think we should have done better,” Harit added. The Moroccan footballer also expressed disappointment over not being able to win the first game in the World Cup’s group stage, recognizing that there are two other difficult matches against Portugal and Spain. “Now we have to forget the defeat of today” to focus on the other games, he added. When a reporter asked Renard about what was needed to win the match, Renard said:  “We were missing a lot of technical justice,” said the coach. He added that his team lost several balls, which they did not in other games. Renard also congratulated Iran for today’s win. Morocco will play its second game against Portugal on June 20 in Moscow’s Luzhniki stadium. The last game will be against Spain on June 25 in Kaliningrad Stadium.

Rabat – Morocco’s Atlas Lions lost their first 2018 World Cup game against Iran 1-0 in Saint Petersburg on Friday. Aziz Bouhaddouz, who entered the game in the 76th minute, scored against his team after a free kick granted to Iran in the extra time of the second half. Morocco’s football team had been the better side throughout the game as the team dominated the first half with 69 percent of ball possession against 31 percent for Iran. Moroccan midfielders Amine Harit and Younes Belhanda delivered an excellent defensive role, with both Ayoub El Kaabi and Harit ready to score against their first rival. Morocco missed several golden opportunities to make a goal in the first half but they were stopped by Iran’s competent goalie, which led them to increase their efforts in the second half. Iran relied on counter attacks during the game, but finally won in over-time with Bouhaddouz’ accidental header. Moroccan star Nordin Amrabat left the field in the 73rd minute, to be replaced by his brother Sofyan Amrabat.  Morocco’s coach Hervé Renard also made a change in the 76th minute of the game, exchanging forward El Kaabi with Aziz Bouhaddouz, a choice that will long haunt him. Manuel de Costa was the final change for Morocco when midfielder Harit left the green arena. The game was attended by hundreds of Moroccan football fans, who followed their team to Russia. Before the game, Morocco’s football fans sang along with Moroccan footballers the national anthem passionately. Morocco and Iran opened the 2018 World Cup’s deadly group, Group B, of the 2018. The second game of the group will between Spain and Portugal at 6:00 p.m (Moroccan time). Morocco plays its next game against Portugal Wednesday, June 20.

Rabat – After host nation Russia’s delirious thrashing of an uninspiring Saudi side in yesterday’s opening game of the FIFA 2018 World Cup, Uruguay eked out a 1-0 win against Egypt on the second day of the tournament. Although the game lacked the fluidity of modern football, it featured some of the game’s best—take Cavani and Suarez, for example. It was clear that the quality was there, that both teams had sufficient arguments for a beautiful show. However, perhaps in a bid to minimize the damage that the other team could cause them, both teams performed a rather slow and languid first half. For 45 minutes, one had the feeling that that this is what football is becoming: a game where teams sit back and wait to be provoked, not attacking until challenged. Egypt, playing without its talisman Liverpool striker and aware of Uruguay’s slightly higher preparedness, was content with putting on an almost spotless defensive wall. Waiting for something unlikely to take place can be agonizing, but it can also create suspense while waiting for the actual intensity. The waiting did prove useful, for some tactical changes on both sides brought determination and pace in the second half. There was a perfect one-two moment between Uruguay’s Cavani and Suarez at the 46th minute, but Egypt’s substitute goalie El Shenawy thwarted Uruguay’s first truly attacking tempo. The game then slowed down again. When asked before the match whether Egypt had the same confidence with or without “Mo” Salah, Coach Hector Cuper said that his team had not come to just play the group stage and subsequently bid farewell to the World Cup. “We have not come to play three games and then say ‘thank you Russia’” the Argentinian tactician said. Despite Salah’s absence, the Egyptians did have some good vibes, with Trezeguet trying to fill Salah’s shoes from time to time, and Fathi, who bore the armband in veteran goalie El Hadary’s absence, sending a fantastic shoot in the South American box at the 71st minute. But Fernando Muslera was there to stop Egyptian fans from getting ahead of themselves. At minute 80, however, as if having received some kind of miraculously regenerative breath from the gods of football, the game dramatically changed. Both teams showed more composure, more willingness to take risks, more runs, and more crosses. Cavani’s 82 nd minute half-flying volley was the culmination of such regained inspiration. But the Paris boy’s beautiful volley found an equally excellent El Shenawy in the Egyptian box. At that point Egypt started pushing less and less, counting instead on a morale-boosting draw before taking on Russia and Saudi in their next games. They could have had a draw; they deserved to have one after 90 minutes of solid teamwork. But, again, the gods of the game can be ruthless. At minute 90, unmarked in the box on a free kick, Atletico Madrid’s José Gimenez smashed in a superb header for Uruguay. 1-0 for Uruguay just before stoppage time. Mo Salah’s facial expression said it all: having dropped three points in the first game makes their Russian adventure difficult to salvage. As for Uruguay, the goal was an absolute deliverance, and its effects were palpable. “Overconfidence will be our greatest enemy,” Cavani said before the match when asked whether coming in the tournament as group favorites made any difference to the team’s spirit and playing philosophy. Cavani had a point. Uruguay may not have crushed Egypt, as the North African Pharaohs were decently present in the game—defensively compact and tactically spotless. One-zero was not the expected outcome, but it was enough to hand Uruguay the needed points to ensure a good start to their tournament.

Rabat- Paint company Colorado’s new ad has been called derogatory to women, not long after Nestlé’s sexist ad scandal. Moroccans are not surprised to witness yet another “sexist” ad broadcast on national television channels. The Colorado company’s new ad to promote new paint hues features a hajj (older man) with four young wives, who each want a different colour for their house. The hajj appears to be losing his mind to fulfil each of his wives’ wants and consults a Colorado employee, who suggests the new colour collection. Similar to Nestlé’s ad, the women are featured in a competition-like atmosphere. Viewers threw colourful insults at the company and condemned its ad for promoting “polygamy” and insulting women: “It’s a shame that a brand like Colorado could not learn from the errors of other brands,” said a commenter on Twitter.  “Scandalous! A misogynist webserie. The Moroccan society is no longer what you think of it. It has developed since the Harem era,” another one wrote on Facebook.
 C’est dommage de voir une marque comme #Colorado n’apprend pas des erreurs d’autres marques ….
Les mêmes erreurs … — Rim Kaanane (@RimKaanane) June 14, 2018  In April, Nestlé launched an ad and mini web-series called #BghitNtezewaj (“I want to get married”) that  featured a mother looking for a wife for her son. To find the best match, the mother tests a group of girls in cooking and house management skills to choose who will marry her son. Viewers were furious as it depicted women as “desperate,” and said that it was similar to a harem, where women competed for one trophy, the man.  The company later apologized to viewers and consumers and canceled the project.

Rabat – Lebanon and Guinea’s claims about FIFA’s electronic voting system have not convinced Morocco’s 2026 World Cup Committee. According to Morocco 2026, the countries deliberately voted against its bid on Wednesday’s vote in Moscow. A source within the Moroccan committee told Morocco’s sports news outlet Hesport that statements from Guinea and Lebanon denying they voted for the North American bid are attempts to cover up their change of heart at the last minute. “We were surprised by Guinea and Lebanon in the list of voters for the [North] American file after they promised to vote for us … we realize that there is no mistake, and they chose to let us down at the last moment after succumbing to the pressures of Americans and Saudi Arabia,” said the source. The anonymous  member of the committee added that Morocco “has refused” the apology from the two football federations “because the vote for the [North] American file was not made by mistake.” They said the justification “was not convincing at all.” The source added that the voting procedure was simple and easy, and both football federations have not filed a complaint to FIFA about the voting system. “The pressure was terrible before the vote and the  hours before the voting date saw high level collusion, so we can understand the position of those who disappointed us.” After the vote on June 13, the Lebanese and Guinan football federations claimed that they had not voted for the North American bid, United 2026. President of the Guinean Football Federation Antonio Souaré blamed the electronic voting system. Secretary General of the Lebanon Football Association Jihad El Shahf told Football Lebanon that his country voted for Morocco’s bid. Saudi Arabia launched a last-minute campaign  on June 11 and 12, pressuring countries to vote for United 2026. On Wednesday, several Arab and African countries voted for United 2026, including Kuwait, Bahrain, Namibia, South Africa, and Liberia. Morocco’s bid received 65 votes, while the joint bid of North America received a majority of 134.

Rabat – A United Arab Emirates-backed attempted military coup in Tunisia has been thwarted thanks to Algerian, French, and German intelligence, according to French outlet Le Monde Afrique.  The aim of the alleged UAE-sponsored intervention was to depose the democratically-elected Ennahda incumbent party via “a medical coup,” as happened when Tunisia’s General Ben Ali toppled President Habib Bourguiba on November 7, 1987. According to the same source, Tunisia’s former Minister of the Interior Lotfi Brahem was the main insider contact of the coup masterminds. His role was to act from the inside to ensure “a very successful plot against President Caid Essebsi,” Le Monde afrique reported. Earlier this month, Tunisia sacked its Lotfi Brahem after 79 migrants drowned in a shipwreck on the Tunisian coast between June 2 and 3. The government officially said that the interior ministry’s “errors in ensuring the security of national coasts” was the reason it sacked Minister Brahem. According to Le Monde afrique, however, the decision was motivated by “a late night meeting that former Interior Minister Lotfi Brahem recently held with the chief of UAE’s secret services” in late May. It is believed that the May meeting took place on Djerba island off the coast of Tunisia around May 29, and was the inception of a plan to remove the incumbent government and enact a “complete authority overhaul” in the country. The “authority overhaul” was set to first persuade President Beji Caid Essebsi to sack Prime Minister Youssef Chahed and appoint former Defense Minister Kamel Morjane as new prime minister. With Morjane as prime minister, the next step was to “re-edit the Bourguiba scenario” by using health reasons and declare current President Essebsi to be “medically unfit” to rule the country. Thanks to information provided by French, Algerian, and German intelligence, however, President Essebsi, informed of the UEA-backed plot, refused the proposal to appoint a new prime minister, leading eventually to the sacking of Lotfi Brahem.

Rabat – We are just an hour away from Morocco’s first game in Russia 2018 World. Playing against Iran, the pressure is higher than ever for the Atlas Lions. Placed in Group B, “the group of death,” (composed of Iran, Spain, and Portugal) the national team wants to make the Moroccan people proud, as there will be millions of them watching the game. If some of the Moroccan fans did not get the chance to go to Russia to support the Atlas Lions, they can always catch the game on beIN Sports or the Moroccan channel Arriyadia at 3 p.m. (Moroccan time), according to the Moroccan channel’s Twitter account.  After an agreement with beIN Sports, the National Broadcasting and Television Company (SNRT) has gained the rights to broadcast 22 games of the World Cup. For the people who cannot watch it on TV, SNRT’s Arriyadia is providing a live-streaming link on its website. Yesterday, the national team’s coach Hervé Renard and captain Mehdi Benatia shared their first impressions on this long-awaited game at a press conference Thursday in St. Petersburg. “It’s such an honor for us to be in the World Cup. We are going to live it as intensely as possible,” said Hervé Renard, adding that they are not in Russia to “take pictures of monuments.”  Speaking on behalf of all his teammates, Benatia talked about the passion of the national team. “We like to play, to have fun. We feel the pressure but it wasn’t easy for us, we have worked very hard to be here. We will prove that we are a well-respected country with a lot of assets.”  Good luck to our Lions!

Rabat – Argentina’s former football legend Diego Maradona has criticized the North American win of hosting rights to the 2026 World Cup, decrying the lack of football passion in Canada and the United States. Maradona also expressed disappointment over Mexico’s joint bid. “Mexico doesn’t deserve it,” Maradona told television channel Telesur. “The Mexicans come up against Brazil or Germany…and ‘boom’ they’re out,” he said. 2026 will be the third time for Mexico to host the World Cup. According to Maradona, “Canadians may be good skiers, and the Americans wanted to have four periods of 25 [minutes] for the advertising.” FIFA’s 68th Congress decided on Wednesday that the North American countries will host the 23rd World Cup in 2026. United 2026, the North American bid, received 134 votes from all corners of the continent, including the Middle East, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In April, Maradona appeared in a photo with Brazilian footballer Rivaldo Vitor Borba Ferreira, in which both are wearing Morocco’s national football team jersey. Maradona is known for his love for Morocco and King Mohammed VI. During his visit to Morocco on November 2015, the star was filmed dancing to Moroccan rhythms on the 40th anniversary of the Moroccan Green March, when he performed a gala match in Laayoune. During Morocco’s 2026 campaign, Maradona said that “Morocco’s infrastructure has developed strongly.”

Rabat – Saudi Arabia’s loss in its first World Cup game has lead the head of Saudi Arabia’s General Sports Authority Federation, Turki Al Sheikh, to blame Qatari-owned sports network beIN Sports. Al Sheikh took to his Twitter account today, announcing that Saudi Arabia will undertake “necessary legal action” against beIN Sports. “Necessary legal action will be taken in relation to BeIN wrongdoings against K.S.A, its sports &amp; officials, and for exploiting sports to achieve political goals. This proves Saudi authorities’ true stance when banning this network from airing on its soil.” After the game, internet users shared videos, accusing beIN sports of being biased for Russia during the game. Saudi Arabia lost 5-0 to the host country. The World Cup’s opening game was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, FIFA President Gianni Infantino, and Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed Bin Salman. Al Sheikh was angry over Saudi Arabia’s weak performance against Russia. After the game, Al Sheikh shared a video on his Twitter, saying that he took “full responsibility for this score in front of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and sports fans. We paid all their [the players’] dues, and they came to the game without exerting even five percent of the effort needed.” Last month, beIN Sports, which owns the broadcast rights to the World Cup, accused a Saudi-based piracy network called “BeOutQ” of pirating the transmission of the 64 games of the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The Saudi channel is “geo-locked,” so internet users across Saudi Arabia can access the channel for GBP 80. BeIN Sports also urged FIFA to take measures against the channel, investing GBP 12,000 to stop BeOutQ from stealing broadcasts of sports events.

Rabat- As the number of travellers increases during the Eid al-Fitr holiday, bus ticket prices have nearly doubled, despite the government’s efforts to counter price gouging in Morocco. Every Eid, the cost of bus tickets, and other transportation options, skyrocket forcing customers across the kingdom to choose between paying the higher price or not visiting their families.  According to a report by Moroccan news outlet Al Massae, ticket prices this Eid have increased by 30 to 50 percent. Typically, the longer the distance, the more prices escalate. Passengers heading for southern provinces have to pay MAD 200 for a bus ticket that normally costs MAD 100. Another issue is that of ticket fraud; some individuals in bus stations take advantage of travelers searching for cheap tickets during the Eid season and sell fake tickets to them at the usual traveling price. Moroccan citizens have battled with price increases on fuel, commodities, and even fish. On April 20, Moroccans launched a boycott against the high prices of three major companies in the country: Centrale Danone (dairy products), Sidi Ali (mineral and soda water), and Afriquia (gasoline), which is owned by Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch. Late in May, citizens across the country complained about the price hikes of fish, saying that the increase in fish prices was not justifiable as Moroccans have more than 1,000 miles of coastline. People took to social media to express their anger with hashtags, #Letitrot and #Letitswim (in Arabic) calling for a fish boycott.  Although calls for the fish boycott have not echoed as far as the boycott of the three companies, Moroccan are still calling on the government to take strict measures against those who do not take into consideration, the purchasing power of consumers. Throughout the ongoing boycott, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has lead considerable initiatives to end corruption and manipulation of consumer products, such as the new consumer complaint hotline (57 57), dedicated to countering market monopolization and corrupt business.

Rabat – Morocco is celebrating Eid al-Fitr today, Friday, June 15. On this occasion, US President Donald Trump gave greetings and congratulations to King Mohammed VI. In his message, Donald Trump expressed, on behalf of the American people and himself, his best wishes to the King and the Moroccan people, noting that “as we celebrate the end of Ramadan, we are meditating on the sacred tradition of helping neighbors and breaking fast with people from all horizons, a tradition based on Islam’s tradition of justice and compassion.” “Eid is a reminder of the responsibility to comfort one another in the spirit of friendship and to create a society in which everyone can reach their full potential,” said the US president. Moreover, Donald Trump wished health and prosperity to Muslims all over the world, highlighting the “essential contributions” made by American Muslims who have “served honorably” in the country’s armed forces, which brings together many religions. Meanwhile, King Mohammed VI will perform the Eid al-Fitr prayers at the Ahl Fes Mosque in Mechouar in Rabat, announced the Ministry of the Royal House, Protocol, and Chancery.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Culture and Communication Mohamed Laaraj will not take part in the meeting of communication ministers in the Coalition Supporting Legitimacy in Yemen on June 23 in Saudi Arabia. A statement from the ministry said that Morocco’s decision is due to its busy agenda.  A civil war, which began in 2015, is devastating Yemen. This week, Saudi Arabia’s coalition forces launched a massive ground and air offensive to force the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels out of Yemen’s third largest city Hudaida.  Morocco has sent troops to contribute to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. However, Moroccan analysts have been urging the country to withdraw its troops from Yemen since Saudi Arabia’s vote for Morocco’s rival to host the 2026 World Cup. There is also tension between the two countries because Morocco has remained neutral in the Gulf crisis, when the Saudi-led Gulf coalition stood against Qatar and accused it of financing terrorist groups. The ministry’s decision not to attend the Yemen meeting came a day after United 2026, the North American bid, won the rights to host the 23rd FIFA World Cup. Saudi Arabia’s support for the North American bid instead of Morocco received acidic backlash from Moroccan and Arab football fans. Saudi Arabia convinced other Muslim majority countries to vote for the North American bid to offer its “strongest ally” the World Cup as a gift. Saudi Arabia’s persuasion led to the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Lebanon, Jordan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan voting for United 2026 at the vote, which took place on June at the 68th FIFA Congress. The lobby against Morocco from another Arab country “felt like being stabbed in your back by a brother,” Moroccan sources said after the vote. Saudi Arabia launched a last-minute campaign hosting parties on June 11 and 12 to convince countries to vote for United 2026. After the vote, some countries that changed their heart and voted for United 2026 on June 13, denied having voted for North America, blaming the electronic voting system. Lebanon and Guinea alike denied voting for North America. President of the Guinean Football Federation Antonio Souare told Guinee7 that there must be something wrong with the voting system. “Guinea did not vote for the Americans. It is not possible. There is total confusion here with electronic voting.” For his part, Secretary General of the Lebanese Football Association Jihad El Shahf told Football Lebanon that his country voted for Morocco’s bid. Morocco’s bid received 65 votes, while the joint bid of North America received a majority (134). Eleven African countries voted against Morocco, including Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa, and Liberia. Botswana, which had pledged support for Morocco, also changed its heart during the vote to back United 2026.

Rabat – He did not take well the defeat of his team. After being booed and insulted by Moroccan fans in Russia, Turki Al Sheikh received another hard blow: Russia crushed Saudi Arabia’s dream (5-0) in the first World Cup game, Thursday, June 15. The councilor of the Royal Palace and president of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation wanted to justify himself by recording a video in which he blamed the players and asked for the Saudi Prince Mohammed Ben Salman’s forgiveness. “I’m sorry your highness. The players have dishonored us. I take full responsibility. I beg your pardon for this humiliation,” he said. “They made me ashamed in front of the Prince … but we can’t do something about it, that’s what they’re worth, we gave them everything.”  “It’s the karma coming to bite him right on his face,” Moroccan fans gloated on social media as they shared his apologies, recalling his campaign for Morocco’s rival to host the 2026 World Cup.  It will be hard for Saudi Arabians to go back up the slope. In their second game in Group A, they will have to face Uruguay June 20, and Egypt June 25 with the sensational Mohamed Salah. As for today’s games, Egypt and Morocco will open the feast for the African continent.  Egypt plays Uruguay at 12 noon (Moroccan time), whereas Morocco opens with Iran at 3 p.m. in the least intensive encounter of what has been called the “group of death.” Spain will then take on Portugal at 6 p.m., topping off the day with a much-awaited European clash.

Rabat- After Brazil 2014, the much-awaited World Cup kicked off today in Moscow. Following an amazing opening ceremony, the host nation took on Saudi Arabia in Group A’s opening game. While a Russia vs. Saudi Arabia is not the typical fixture to garner the excitement and thrill of the footballing word, the fact that it is a World Cup game makes it interesting enough. And the Russian squad, starting their home adventure with a spectacular display of attacking skills, did justice to the fabulous event that the World Cup is. “We could not have hoped for better start,” fans enthused on social media as they shared pictures of the footballing agony that the Russian squad inflicted on the Saudi team. 5-0 as an introductory game to a tournament that has been mired in geopolitical turmoil, nothing can be a starker reminder that once on the pitch, once the momentum has been greenlighted by the referee, there are a few things to take away the joie de vivre that comes with watching or living a World Cup. Saudis entered the game with confidence, armed with their impressive performance in their final pre-World Cup friendly with Germany. But their hopes were soon dashed by an early goal at the 12 minute, with Yuri Gazinsky transforming Russia’s first shot on target into a phenomenally clinical header. Looking for inspiration to keep their World Cup adventure safe from early humiliation, Saudi Arabia made a compact defensive bloc during the first half and sought an equalizer. But try as they might, the Russian rage, sustained by the never-fading winning spirit of playing on home soil with the rapturous support of thunderous fans, got the best of the Saudis at the 43rd minute. Having singled-handedly crossed the opposing defense, Cheryshev lodged home an incredible shoot, giving a 2-0 lead to the host. The second half, despite the nonchalance of assured victory, did feature some of Russia’s strongest moves. And the third goal was an illustration of that: Russia is most lethal when it is allowed time to send in crosses from its constantly inspired men on the flanks. With Dzuba’s goal at the 71st minute, the third for Russia, it was game over for Saudi Arabia, their only mission now to contain the humiliation. Pushed on by a lively and excited public, however, Russia looked to garner more momentum, escalating the agony of an already reeling opposing side. And then came the showpiece of the evening, the glorious outside-of-foot strike from Cheryshev at the beginning of added time. Scoring two goals in the opening, Cheryshev’s masterpiece put in the sure-to-be fun scramble for Golden boot. Golovin’s final goal for Russia was easily obtained, as Saudi’s morale was dead by then, crucified by ferocious attacking attempts. As a score line in the first match of the most prestigious football tournament, 5-0 is, if anything, a delicious prelude to a month-long contest that promises an avalanche of dramatic occurrences. Many legends—Messi, Ronaldo, Iniesta, to name only the most outstanding—are probably playing their last World Cup. But Russia’s perfect star was not all too perfect—they lost Alan Dzagoev with a hamstring, depriving the team of one its most monumental assets. The momentum comes back tomorrow, with Egypt and Morocco opening the feast for the African continent. Egypt plays Uruguay at 12 noon (Moroccan time), whereas Morocco opens with Iran at 3 p.m. in the least intensive encounter of what has been dubbed the “group of death.” Spain will then take on Portugal at 6 p.m., topping off the day with a much-awaited European clash.

Rabat – The first day of Eid al-Fitr celebrations will officially start on Friday, June 15, announced Morocco’s Ministry of Religious Endowments and Islamic Affairs on Thursday night. The ministry announced that the crescent moon for the Islamic month Shawwal was sighted in Morocco on Thursday evening. Eid al-Fitr marks the first day of Shawwal, which follows the holy month of Ramadan. Several Arab and European countries will also celebrate Eid al-Fitr tomorrow, including France, Belgium, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Other countries, including Pakistan and India, will celebrate Eid on Saturday. Moroccan astronomer and researcher Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al Ifrani, whose previous predictions for Ramadan and other religious celebrations this year were all correct,  told Morocco World News earlier this month that the country will celebrate Eid on Friday. He predicted that the crescent of the month of  Shawwal will be seen in most Arab and Islamic countries. Celebrations will start with Eid prayers in the very early morning, when Muslims around the world head to the mosques to perform the morning prayers. Eid al – Fitr is also an opportunity for families to visit each other and share a delicious breakfast. Some families also invite each other for lunch, where tasty meals are served, including Moroccan pastries, cakes, and chicken for lunch. However, the specific dishes vary by family and region. Tomorrow might be an exception to traditional holiday foods as Eid alFitr comes on a Friday, when  Moroccans traditionally serve the seven-vegetable or tfaya (caramelized onions) couscous. Ramadan began in Morocco on Thursday, May 17, marking a unified first fasting day throughout all Muslim countries, including North Africa and Saudi Arabia.

Rabat- Eid al-Fitr (the feast of breaking fast) comes on the first day of the tenth Islamic month, Shawwal, marking the end of Ramadan. This year, Eid al-Fitr will likely fall on Friday in Morocco, the best day of the week for Muslims. Ramadan began this year on a Thursday and will likely end on a Thursday in Morocco and other Muslim countries. The observation ceremony of the crescent moon, signaling the beginning of the new month in Islamic calendar, will take place Thursday evening. Meanwhile Saudi Arabia, which is three hours ahead of Morocco, has already confirmed the moon sighting and announced that Eid al-Fitr will be on Friday. Many astronomers have predicted that most Muslim countries will bid farewell to Ramadan on Thursday and celebrate Eid on the same day, Friday June 15, just as they began the Ramadan fast in unison on Thursday, May 17. The renowned Moroccan astronomer Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al Ifrani told Morocco World News last week that the crescent of Shawwal will be clearly visible tonight from countries in the western hemisphere, including Morocco. Eid al-Fitr is celebrated differently in each culture in the world, however its significance remains the same in Islam. The Eid brings joy to the hearts of Muslims who successfully completed a full month of fasting; as Ramadan is the holiest month in Islam. On Eid al-Fitr, Muslims put on their best traditional clothes, kaftans for women and djellabas for men, who attend mosques in crowds to perform the special Eid prayers between sunrise and noon. If Eid comes on Friday, Muslims usually perform the Eid prayers soon after sunrise to attend the regular Friday prayers in the afternoon. It is also on this day that Muslims who promised themselves to end habits such as gambling, smoking, or drinking during the fasting month prove to themselves that they have successfully accomplished their goals. Just like in other Muslim countries, in Morocco, families do “silaturrahim,” which is the act of visiting family members or reconciling with them on the occasion. Afterwards, families give Zakat Al Fitr (Eid charity) to the poor, a mandatory practice, since the Prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him) ordered his Muslim followers to give it. In Morocco, the working holiday for Eid al-Fitr lasts for two days. Typically, during these days, families travel across the country to pay each other visits, which is why traffic jams are a given. Recently, the National Motorway Company of Morocco (ADM) warned road travelers that they should take precaution and plan their trips ahead, especially as the Eid holiday coincides with the weekend when many will return to their homes at the end of Ramadan.  The National Office of Railways (ONCF) has adjusted its schedule especially for Eid. It has recently revised rail schedule to accommodate expected increases in passenger numbers. It will increase the number of trains on the main axes of the railway network (Casablanca- Rabat-Fès-Marrakech-Tangier-Oujda and Nador). Railway police forces will also be strengthened to ensure the safety of travelers.

Rabat – Today is the last day of Ramadan in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Supreme Court has announced that Eid al-Fitr will be Friday, June 15, after the moon was sighted, the Saudi Press Agency reported. Most Muslim countries will celebrate the Eid al-Fitr holiday on the same day, including Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Egypt, and Kuwait. Eid al-Fitr or the “Feast of Breaking the Fast” in English, comes on the first day of Shawwal, the tenth month of the Islamic calendar, signaling the end of Ramadan. Mosques throughout the country will hold Eid al-Fitr prayers on Friday. As a major public holiday, Eid al-Fitr will allow people to rest from work more in Saudi Arabia, as King Salman issued a directive to extend this year’s Eid break until Sunday, June 24. Moroccans, according to the calculations of astronomer Hicham El Aissaoui, will celebrate the Eid al-Fitr feast on Friday. “Ramadan 2018 has only 29 days, consequently, Eid Al-Fitr will be celebrated on Friday, June 15,” he said. El Aissaoui also predicted Eid al-Adha to be celebrated on Wednesday, August 22. Even if the astronomical calculations all predict that Eid al-Fitr will be tomorrow, Moroccan authorities prefer to wait to observe the moon to officially declare the holiday. For this special day, families gather around a table full of various Moroccan pastries, cakes, and breads, accompanied by mint tea, milk, and coffee.

Rabat- Official preparations are taking place in Rabat to celebrate Eid Al Fitr, signaling the end of Ramadan. King Mohammed VI will perform Eid al-Fitr prayers in Ahl Fes Mosque in the capital city. The sovereign’s brother, Prince Moulay Rachid, and his son, Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan, will accompany the King to perform Salat Al Eid (Eid prayers) Friday morning, if the moon sighting is officially confirmed Thursday evening.  Following the Eid prayers, the sovereign will receive Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, senior officials, and members of the Royal Armed Forces (FAR), who will extend their congratulations on the occasion to the King at the Royal Palace of Rabat. Usually during the Eid al-Fitr feast, King Mohammed VI extends his congratulations to Muslim countries on the auspicious day which marks the beginning of Shawwal, the tenth month in the Islamic calendar. The observation of the crescent moon of Shawwal in Morocco will take place on Thursday, Ramadan 29, 1439 (June 14, 2018). During the religious feast, families gather around the breakfast table in the morning after Eid prayers, then visit and call to congratulate each other.

Rabat- After the shock and disillusion of yesterday’s defeat at the FIFA Congress, the country is aiming high as the officials prepare to put in a “more prepared bid” for the 2030 FIFA World Cup. Morocco 2026 lost yesterday by a sizable and unexpected margin of 69 votes, making the United bid, the North American trio of Canada, Mexico, and the US, the comfortable winner of a competition many had thought would be tight.  Minister of Youth and Sports Rachid Talbi Alami announced this Thursday that the country would recollect its forces and fighting spirit and bid again to win the hosting rights of the 2030 FIFA World Cup.  Talbi further said that Morocco will continue the 2026 projects as planned, suggesting that the construction and innovation plans will be financed and completed as explained in the Morocco 2026 project. The expectation is that realizing the Morocco 20226 projects will make Morocco a stronger and more serious bidder by 2030. “All Moroccans are ready to mobilize for the success” of the prospective Morocco 2030 project, the statement added. It further explained that the decision was based on “royal instructions,” with King Mohammed urging authorities to keep alive the national dream of organizing a World Cup. Joined by a national Arabophone news outlet, the sports and youth minister, who is now in Russia to supervise Morocco’s Atlas Lions’ World Cup performance, said that the king’s instructions were to go ahead with the 2026 plans and put in a more cogent campaign next time. Qatar was among the countries that voted for Morocco’s bid on Wednesday in Moscow. Qatar had pledged its commitment to its “fellow Muslim brother,” promising the North African country that it would put in “all Qatari might and resources to lobby in Morocco’s favor.” Following Morocco’s failure to win the trust of the majority of the FIFA family, the Emir of Qatar Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani had a phone call with King Mohammed VI. The Qatari leader congratulated the King for the effort Morocco invested in the entire campaign. He also vowed that “Qatar will lend its full support to Morocco should the kingdom bid to earn the hosting rights of the 2030 FIFA World Cup.” To many Moroccan officials, yesterday’s defeat to the North American trio is a source of motivation to bounce back stronger and more “technically fit.” Bidding against a trio that had the world’s largest economy was in itself “an act of bravery and ambition,” some in the Moroccan delegation in Moscow said after the results. “We wanted to realize a national dream, and also wanted to show to the world that Morocco is capable of hosting an international event,” a Morocco 2026 team member told French outlet Le Monde in the immediate aftermath of the 2026 bid results. But, he added: [Morocco 2026] “is a long-term project.” “The investments are not all lost,” the official continued, dismissing claims in some circles that Morocco had wasted its time and energy engaging in a campaign that was already lost, considering that FIFA had been forthcoming all along that the hosting rights should go to the “more technically fit bidder.” For all the discernible disappointment within the Morocco 2026 circles, including the loss of 11 African votes, the mood is uplifted by a firm belief in Morocco’s future chances. The overwhelming belief among Morocco 2026 officials is that the 2026 campaign was a useful experience for Morocco. “We talked to almost all national federations; we traveled, and presented our country’s assets and merits to a large part of the world,” another official told Le Monde. Suggesting that Morocco can take on any opposing bidder in 2030, he added: “The state-of-the-art stadiums, the modernized infrastructure—will all be Moroccan assets.” As Morocco now prepares its 2030 bid “upon royal instructions,” the country has a relatively clear idea about the meaning of endorsements and diplomatic clout in securing the hosting rights under FIFA’s new regulations. Moroccans took to social media to vent their anger at the “incomprehensible treason” of some African and Muslim countries. Saudi Arabia, however, took the brunt of Moroccans’ wrath, with some even urging the North African country to reconsider its diplomatic ties with the Gulf country. But there was also an aura of gratitude towards the relatively steadfast African and Muslim blocs that lent their “unconditional and fraternal” support to the Moroccan dream of securing another African World Cup after South Africa in 2010. That only 11 African countries defected is also seen by many on the Moroccan side as an encouraging signal, an indication that next time, with the completion of the Morocco 2026 construction and renovation plans and with the experience the country gained in this year’s campaign, Morocco’s chances will be much higher.

Rabat – President of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Ahmad Ahmad has given some explanations for the “betrayal” of some African countries that voted for United 2026, letting Morocco lose the 2026 World Cup hosting rights. The President of the Guinean Football Federation, Antonio Souaré, blamed his “accidental” vote on the electronic voting system at the FIFA Congress. He claimed that the country had voted for Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup and not for United 2026, the North American bid. But the president of CAF has another version of the story. In an interview with beIN Sports after the majority vote for United 2026, Ahmad Ahmad revealed that the African countries were under direct pressure to vote for the US-Mexico-Canada trio and that he himself was under pressure from FIFA.  He said he was even interviewed by a commission of the organization, an “illegal” act according to him. “We did our best. Apparently, 45 countries in Africa voted (for Morocco), I think it’s honorable. To have 100% now is very difficult and then, given the strong political pressure of some heads of state in Africa it was not easy,” he said. Out of 52 African football federations present at the vote in Moscow, a majority of 40 countries voted in favor of Morocco. However, United 2026 scored the support of 11 African countries: Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia, Lesotho, Benin, Cape Verde, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Botswana, which had pledged support for Morocco, changed its heart during the vote to back United 2026.

By Karen Duarte  Rabat- Awaiting the kick-off of the Russia 2018 World Cup match, the opening ceremony brought out a short and sweet performance by British pop star Robbie Williams and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina.  Standing on a giant half-football in the middle of the Luzhniki Stadium, dressed in a burgundy leopard skin suit and surrounded by dancers in shiny red costumes Robbie Williams welcomed fans and footballers alike.  Following a rousing presentation of Let Me Entertain You, Williams was joined by Russian soprano Aida Garifullina, a vision in white for a duet of Robbie’s chart-topping single “Angels.” With 20-minutes till kick off, the opening ceremony ended with Ronaldo (the original, Brazilian version) joining Robbie and Aida. Ronaldo passed the ball to the Russian World Cup mascot Zabivaka, which might have been a symbolic “first kick.” About 80,000 people are expected to be in attendance at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium as the host team Russia faces Saudi Arabia in the first match of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.  Tomorrow Morocco’s kick-off game against Iran will take place in the St. Petersburg Stadium at 3:00 p.m. (Moroccan time).

By Karen Duarte  Rabat- African delegates are determined for FIFA to reintroduce a rotating system for World Cup hosting after Morocco failed to host the 2026 World Cup.  Morocco lost out to the triple bid of the United States, Canada, and Mexico on Wednesday.  “Rotation would be a solution,” said football Association of Malawi President Walter Nyamilandu. “We should ask for an amendment to the bidding process that would allow rotation to come back,” added Liberia Football Association President Musa Bility. By the time the 2026 World Cup takes place, Africa will have hosted just one of 23 World Cups, while Mexico will have staged three separate tournaments. The only reason the 2010 World Cup was held in South Africa was that FIFA specifically introduced a rotation system in 2001.   The system was pushed through by former FIFA President Sepp Blatter in response to South Africa’s narrow defeat to stage the 2006 World Cup, which Germany won. Liberia’s Bility believes FIFA could be tempted to reintroduce the system, which was abandoned in 2007, after Africa had been awarded the 2010 finals.  “I think this would be acceptable to Fifa because the World Cup is about taking football to the people,” Bility told BBC Sport. “There is inequality in the status of countries around the world so you need laws that will allow the tournament to rotate. You saw the margin of the vote – there was no way Morocco was going to win.” Morocco’s defeat left several African delegates wondering when, if ever, the continent will stage football’s greatest event again. For there to be a sense of fairness, FIFA should reconsider bringing back the rotation system, especially to aid African nations to host more World Cups.  A total of 41 African nations backed the Moroccan bid, meaning the North Africans picked up just 24 non-African votes from a possible 147 outside the continent. “It might take a lot of years and a lot of convincing for the rest of the world to come and vote for Africa again. We had an opportunity and the final vote was a clear testimony that Africa will not get support from the rest of the world,” said Nyamilandu. Many African delegates believe Morocco lost because its projected tournament profit of USD 5 billion fell considerably short of the USD 11 billion pledged by the North American bid. Morocco has now bid five times for the World Cup without success.  Nonetheless, the African nation was still able to pledge a profit of USD 5 billion, which was double the amount that FIFA made from Brazil 2014. If the United bid was capable of covering three different countries, then maybe Africa should propose a bid with the entire continent.  Football Association of Zambia President Andrew Kamanga stated, “If you take Africa a whole, we have enough capacity from South Africa to Morocco in the north, so it’s question of ensuring you put together one composite bid that can address all the challenges.”

By Lameese Madi Rabat – Approximately 40 Moroccan students shared a final iftar dinner with US Embassy staff at Dar America in Casablanca, before beginning their summer exchange programs in the US.  On June 8th, Chargé d’Affaires Stephanie Miley and U.S. Consul General Jennifer Rasamimanana invited Moroccan high school and university students to share a meal together. The students have been selected to travel to the United States this summer through highly competitive youth exchange programs. The exchange programs include Middle East Partnership Institute (MEPI) Student Leaders, Study of the U.S. Institute (SUSI) for Student Leaders on Women’s Leadership, SUSI for Student Leaders on Social Entrepreneurship, the Global Undergraduate Exchange Program (Global UGRAD), TechGirls, Between the Lines, and Space Camp programs.  These students must meet criteria such as “academic excellence, cross-cultural interest, personal leadership ability as well as a commitment to Morocco to share their new skills and expertise with others” according to the U.S. embassy and consulate website. Cross-cultural exchange allows students to improve their English skills and create connections all over America and around the world.  Sharing a traditional Moroccan iftar with the embassy at Dar America was part of the pre-departure orientation for these students who will study in America this summer. “It’s always wonderful to meet young Moroccan leaders who are seeking new experiences and opportunities.  I am proud that the U.S. Embassy is unlocking potential by supporting 40 young Moroccans to go to the U.S. because of their leadership skills and commitment to giving back in their communities when they return,” Chargé d’Affaires Stephanie Miley said during the iftar. Morocco has the oldest relationship with America as Morocco was the first country to recognize America as a nation state following its declaration of independence and their relations have only prospered and continued on until today.

Rabat- The observation of the crescent moon of Shawwal will take place on Thursday, Ramadan 29, 1439 (June 14, 2018). The month of Ramadan is almost over in Morocco. According to the calculations of astronomer Hicham El Aissaoui, Moroccans will celebrate the Eid al-Fitr feast on Friday. “Ramadan 2018 has only 29 days, consequently, Eid Al-Fitr will be celebrated on Friday, June 15,” he said. El Aissaoui also predicted Eid al-Adha to be celebrated on Wednesday, August 22. Even if the astronomical calculations all predict that Eid al Fitr will be tomorrow, Moroccan authorities prefer to wait to observe the moon to officially declare the holiday. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs invited astronomers, and its delegates to inform the department if they observe the lunar crescent or do not see it by contacting them at the following phone numbers: 0537761145, 0537760932, 0537760549, and 0537768954 or fax number 0537761721.  Eid al-Fitr was originated by the Prophet Mohammed. It is observed on the first day of the Islamic month of Shawwal, which follows the month of Ramadan, when Muslims undergo a period of fasting. In Islam, a specific prayer is nominated for Eid al-Fitr. The holiday is celebrated for one, two or three days, and it is also forbidden to fast on the day of Eid. Before performing the Eid prayer, money is paid to the poor and the needy as an obligatory act of charity. Families also give money to their children in celebration. In Morocco, families often visit each other in the morning, especially just after the Eid prayer. People often wear traditional Moroccan clothes and gather to drink tea with Moroccan pastries, listening to Andalusi music.

By Chase Lacy Rabat – The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is meeting for the second time this week for emergency talks regarding the Saudi-backed offensive on the Yemeni port city of Hudaida. On Wednesday, coalition forces Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Yemen launched a massive ground and air offensive to wrestle Yemen’s third largest city from the control of Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The offensive is seen as the largest battle of the past three years. Heavy clashes have been reported near the Hudaida airport and al-Durayhmi, a rural area south of the city. For days, the Houthis have been alerting residents on the outskirts to flee to the city center. The Yemeni government said that UN negotiations have failed, and the peace effort has concluded. UN Special Envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths said he is continuing to negotiate to keep Hudaida open and urged all combatants to exercise restraint. Hudaida is the lifeline of Yemen, providing 70 percent of its imports, such as food and supplies, especially,important since Yemen is on the brink of famine. Saudi Arabia and the UAE claim the port city is used to smuggle weapons for Houthis. As many as 600,000 people live in or around Hudaida, of which the UN claims “as many as 250,000 people may lose everything – even their lives.” A total of 22.2 million people,75 percent of Yemen’s population, is in need of humanitarian assistance. Of those, 17.8 million are food insecure, and 8.4 million are considered at risk of starvation. Around 400,000 children under the age of five years old suffer from acute malnutrition. Only half of Yemen’s medical facilities are fully functioning, leaving 16.4 million without access to basic healthcare. Yemen’s medical crisis has been exacerbated by a massive cholera outbreak that has affected a suspected one million people and killed 2,248 since April 2017. Houthi rebels took control of the majority of Yemen’s populated areas, including the capital, Sanaa, in 2014 and early 2015. In 2015 Saudi, Emirati, and Yemeni forces, with Western logistical support, launched strikes and offensives to drive out the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.   Yemen is strategically important to control. Yemen’s location places it at the Bab al-Mandab strait, the waterway that links the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. A large percentage of the world’s oil shipments pass through the strait.

By Dana Leger Rabat – Two worshippers were killed and several others wounded in a stabbing attack at a mosque in Malmesbury, South Africa, in the early morning on Thursday. Western Cape police have confirmed that the attacker was shot dead. Fellow worshippers said there was no warning that the suspect was about to commit the violent crime. “A couple of hours ago – about 03:00 – as people got themselves ready to pray, the suspect just got up and started stabbing the people. He was praying with them,” Malmesbury Police Constable Henry Durant told News24. “The suspect, believed to be in his thirties and armed with a knife, charged at the police who tried to persuade him to hand himself over,” said Noloyiso Rwexana, spokeswoman for the Western Cape police.  “He ignored the calls and tried to attack police. He was shot and killed in the process. His death will be investigated by IPID,” provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut said. Rwexana added that police are now “combing the scene for clues.” Local media reported that the suspect was Somali, but police have not confirmed this. “We don’t know anything. There is no information, there is no motive, there’s nothing like that,” said Durant. “It’s way too soon to speculate as to a possible motive – or link with any other incident in the country,” Traut told the eNCA broadcaster. The Muslim Judicial Council (MJC), which represents the Muslim community in South Africa, said it was “shocked to the core” over the incident, which came at the end of the holy month of Ramadan. The MJC urged the community not to jump to conclusions about the attacker’s motives and said its top leadership would travel to the area to assist the community. #MosqueAttack The full statement by the Muslim Judicial Council following the #MalmesburyMosque attack. pic.twitter.com/5wRid5E8o4 — Jacaranda News (@JacaNews) June 14, 2018 Thursday’s attack comes about a month after an attack at a mosque in the town of Verulam, on the outskirts of the eastern port city of Durban. The unidentified assailants killed a mosque leader by slitting his throat and injured two others after midday prayers.  The assailants from that attack also set off a petrol bomb inside the mosque, escaped in a car, and still remain at large.  Morocco has also experienced violence at mosques recently. Just a few weeks before the Verulam attack, a man attempted to stab an imam at Hassan Mosque in Rabat on May 4, although no injuries were recorded. An oddly similar incident followed at Al Hamd Mosque in Casablanca on May 16, where a worshipper was stabbed in the abdomen and immediately taken to a nearby hospital.

Rabat- French Football Federation (FFF) President Noel Le Graet said on Thursday that money played a big role in the vote against Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid at the 68th FIFA Congress on Wednesday. According to Belgian Sport news site RTBF, Graet said that Morocco came face to face with a “beast,” referring to the 2026 World Cup hosting trio (Canada, the US, and Mexico) who won votes from 134 countries against Morocco’s 65. “When we see little Morocco’s facing a beast made of three united countries, that is not a fair competition in terms of economic capabilities.” He emphasized that almost everyone knew who would win before the FIFA Congress vote. Graet further stressed that Africa has only hosted the World Cup once, which is not enough: “Africa will get to host the World Cup once again in a hundred years.” When South Africa won the bid to host the 2010 World Cup against Egypt and Morocco, it became the first African nation to host. France was the first country to announce support for the Moroccan World Cup bid, and remained true to its word until the end. Among the 65 countries that voted in Morocco’s favor were Belgium, Algeria, Albania, Turkey, Congo, Egypt, Brazil, and Qatar. Among the countries that voted against Morocco were Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The Arab countries were severely criticized by Moroccans and other countries, such as Egypt, for “lobbying” against their “brother country.” Saudi Arabia did not only vote for United 2026 over Morocco, it took advantage of its financial resources to convince other Muslim countries to back the North American bid.

Among the Dutch fans are former coach Patrick Kluivert, midfielder Wesley Sneijder, retired footballer Ruud van Nistelrooij, team manager Luis van Gaal, and actor Johnny de Mol. “Dear brothers, I wish you good luck and success in the World Cup. Let’s go Moroccan team!” said de Mol in Darija, wearing the national team’s red and green kit, signifying the Moroccan flag. Sneijder sang the popular song “Ya Zina” (Hey, Zina) by Algerian band Babylone, chanting “Hey, Morocco” instead, and gave his thumbs up. Referring to the World Cup, Kluivert cheered: “Jibouha, Jibouha!” (bring it), as he held a large Moroccan flag.

The Atlas Lions are adorned with Moroccan-Dutch football stars, including Karim Al Ahmadi; Hakim Ziyech; and the Amrabat brothers, Nordin and Sofyan, who helped Morocco qualify for the World Cup. In addition to the support of their fans, the Atlas Lions also have the full support of Morocco’s King Mohammed VI who wished them “full success” on a phone call with the team’s captain, Mehdi Benatia, and coach, Hervé Renard, according to a Royal Cabinet press statement. The Atlas Lions, placed in Group B, will play their first match against Iran at 3 p.m. (GMT) on Friday.

Rabat – Moroccan fans in Russia did not hide their anger towards Saudi fans in St. Petersburg, Russia. Saudi Arabia not only voted for United 2026, but also campaigned against Morocco in the vote for the host of the 2026 World Cup. Besides setting the mood, chanting, and dancing to support Morocco for its first game against Iran, Friday, June 15, at 3 p.m. (Moroccan time), Moroccan fans did not forget to remind Saudi Arabians, especially the president of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation, Turki Al Sheikh, of their betrayal by booing and insulting them. The fans perfectly represent the mood of millions of Moroccans taken aback by Saudi Arabia’s decision to vote for the trio bid of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, to organize the 2026 World Cup. While Moroccans were hoping all Arab countries would vote for Morocco’s bid, they were surprised to see that seven Arab countries voted for the United 2026 bid. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq all voted against the Moroccan bid. Upon the announcement of the final results of the vote, Moroccans took massively to social media to lash out at Saudi Arabia for “betraying” Morocco and “stabbing it” in the back. Saudi Arabia did not only vote for the United 2026, but it also embarked on a last minute campaign to pressure many Muslim and Asian countries to vote for the North American bid.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI had a telephone conversation tonight with Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Emir of Qatar, said a statement from the Royal Cabinet. Qatar was among the countries that voted today in favor of the Moroccan candidacy in the vote of designation of the organizing country of the World 2026 held today in Moscow, the statement said. During this telephone conversation Shaykh Tamim informed the Sovereign of the full support of Qatar in Morocco in the event that the Kingdom presents its candidacy for the organization of the World 2030, notes the same source. Betrayal of the Saudis Millions of Moroccans were taken aback by Saudi Arabia’s decision to vote for the United 2026 bid of the United States, Canada and Mexico. While Moroccans were hoping all Arab countries would vote for the Moroccan bid, seven Arab countries voted in favor of the United 2026 bid. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq all voted against the Moroccan bid. Upon the announcement of the final results of the vote, Moroccans took massively to social media to lash out at Saudi Arabia for their “betraying” Morocco and “stabbing it” in the back. Saudi Araba did not only vote for the United 2026, but it also embarked on last minute campaign to pressure many Muslim and Asian countries to vote for the American-led vid. According to several media reports, Saudi officials hosted on Tuesday night an Iftar in honor of the 204 delegations present in Moscow to participate in the vote. Many analysts view the Saudi decision to turn its back to Morocco as retaliation against the latter’s decision to take a position of neutrality in the Gulf crisis that broke out on June 5, 2017. While the Saudis, Emiratis and Bahrainis were expecting Morocco to back them in their feud with Qatar, King Mohammed decided to remain neutral and offered his good offices to help iron the differences between Qatar and a self-styled quartet composed of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt.

Rabat – After El Mundo, Buzzfeed News, and  Spanish news outlet El Pais reported that a pregnant Moroccan seasonal worker in Spain’s Huelva farms was allegedly sexually assaulted. El Pais said that the Moroccan farmer was seven months pregnants when she was sexually assaulted by one of the supervisors working on a farm in Heluva. She told Spanish newspaper El Pais that the attacker followed her to the shower, asking her for “sexual activities.” She said that she resisted, and “he left only when some women intervened,” expressing regret for not filing a complaint against him. “Because I was afraid,” she said. The alleged victim said that she then refused to go back to Morocco, fearing the reaction of her family and her husband. “I will only return to Morocco when the truth breaks out, I want to go home with my head up,” she said. The alleged victim is also a mother of two children. She said that she traveled to Spain in order to earn some money for her sick son. Several Moroccan women have filed complaints against supervisors in charges of rape, sexual harassment, and assaults in Huelva farms. Morocco’s Ministry of Employment twice denied that sexual assaults against Moroccan seasonal workers have been recorded in Spain. In its second statement, published last Friday, the ministry only recognized that a suspect was questioned for alleged sexual assault, adding that the delegations from Spain and Morocco inspected the conditions of Moroccan farmers in Spain throughout the month of May. The ministry said that “no cases of sexual harassment” were recorded, with the exception of a 47-year old suspect being subjected to a judicial inquiry in Spain. The ministry said that Moroccan seasonal farmers began returning to Morocco on May 25 and will continue until the beginning of July. The statement added that it brought back 400 workers on June 5, coinciding with the end of the fruit harvesting period in the farm concerned by the harassment allegations.

Rabat – United 2026 was chosen over Morocco to host FIFA’s 2026 World Cup with 67% of the vote, Wednesday at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow. The ceremony was trending on Twitter with the hashtag #Morocco2026. 134 countries decided to go for the trio bid of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, breaking millions of hearts in Morocco. However, Morocco has remained dignified in the defeat by congratulating its opponent. “At the 68th @FIFAcom Congress, Member Associations have voted in favor of the North American United bid, which will now organize the 2026 @FIFAWorldCup #Morocco2026 congratulates @United2026 for their victory,” the Moroccan organizing committee wrote on Twitter.  Having a lot to say regarding the bid, Moroccan supporters did not miss any aspect of the congress, talking about deception, schemes, treats, and treasons. Moroccans’ deception: The long-awaited dream to host the 2026 World Cup will not happen for Morocco. After four disappointing unsuccessful attempts in 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2010, this year hope was restored for Moroccans as their love and passion for their country and football gave them faith again. Unfortunately it was the powerful trio of the United States, Canada, and Mexico who crushed Morocco’s dream, as it was recalled by the Moroccan fans on social media.    Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani reacted on Facebook, paying tribute to the “serious and professional” work done by Morocco’s bid committee. “Thank you for this shared dream. We continue to work to achieve its perfection: sustainable development and social justice. And good luck to the Atlas Lions,” concluded the head of government.  Arab and African Countries Treasons: Moroccan supporters were not expecting some changes of minds. In the last minutes, Morocco lost some votes, provoking anger among citizens who felt betrayed, especially by close African and Arab countries. Out of 52 African football federations present at the vote in Moscow, a majority of 41 countries voted in favor of Morocco. However, United 2026 scored the support of 11 African countries: Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia, Lesotho, Benin, Cape Verde, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. “Can anyone explain to me the vote of Guinea in favor of #United2026? Morocco hosted the national Syli [football team] during the Ebola outbreak and Guinean Federation President Antonio Souaré was “ambassador” of #Morocco2026. What happened?” said French journalist Patrick Juilliard.  In the Arab world, there were many surprises. Lebanon, which had positioned itself as Morocco’s ally, voted, at the last moment, for the North Americans, joining Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Iraq, and Bahrain.  Morocco, however, was able to count on the support of Algeria, Tunisia, Qatar, Syria, Egypt, Palestine, Yemen, and Oman. Beyond practical considerations, the vote was also a political one. In April, US President Donald Trump threatened countries voting for Morocco: “It would be a shame if the countries we have always supported campaign against the North American bid. Why would we support these countries when they do not support us (including at the UN)?” he tweeted. Donald Trump has once again gotten what he wants.  Saudi Arabia’s backlash: Saudi Arabia’s lobbying for United 2026 did not please the Moroccans who feel betrayed by a supposedly “friend country.” Saudi Arabia had been arranging meetings between the United 2026 bid committee and other Gulf countries. Prior to the official decision, Turki Al Sheikh, president of the Saudi Sports Commission and the Arab Football Union made it clear that his country would vote for Saudi Arabia’s “strongest ally.” Is Saudi Arabia to blame? People seem to think so, as it has played a role in Morocco’s failing.  “Saudi Arabia voted for #United2026 … I imagine Morocco’s disillusionment. There are no friends in this kind of situation just economic interests … It’s largely a geopolitical vote. #Mondial2026,” said a France Football journalist.  “Morocco has always supported Saudi Arabia in its positions; war against yemen, Bashar Assad’s departure, Syria’s dismissal from the Arab league dismissal and the Iranian ambassador departure and for what? For us to do everything to see Morocco fail in # CDM2026,” said one Twitter user.  Lakjaa and Elalamy praised: After campaigning for Morocco 2026 all over the world, President of Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) Fouzi Lekjaa and Chairman of Morocco’s 2026 bid committee Moulay Hafid Elalamy  gave their last speeches. Taking the stage first, Elalamy highlighted Morocco’s many assets. The chairman noted the kingdom’s wealth and infrastructure, saying that 97 percent of the population supported Morocco hosting the World Cup in a recent survey. Elalamy recalled the values ??of the kingdom, saying that weapons are banned in the North African country. He guaranteed the event would be financially profitable for FIFA and did not forget to talk about the importance of tourism. For his part, Fouzi Lekjaa said that Africa has only organized the prestigious competition once before, in 2010 in South Africa, when Morocco was also bidding to host. The FRMF president also pointed out that Morocco is running for the fifth time. Moroccan supporters were grateful for Lekjaa and Elalamy’s work, thanking them for taking Morocco all the way to the end.

Rabat- Gianni Infantino announced on Wednesday at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow that he will run for re-election as FIFA president in 2019. Infantino takes pride in the work he does for the world’s football governing body, he said in a speech following the 2026 World Cup bid vote: “I want another four years of it because I believe in what I do […] I believe in what I can do for FIFA and for football.”  Infantino recalled FIFA’s “clinically dead” condition before his election in February, 2016. Former FIFA President Sepp Blatter was haunted by corruption allegations leading Swiss prosecutors to subject him to criminal investigations. Blatter’s 17-year presidency over FIFA was jeopardized after he was accused of receiving bribes from Russia and Qatar to allow them to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments. The allegations lead FIFA to drastically reform its host selection process.  The FIFA Congress for the president’s election will take place June 2019 in Paris. Earlier on Wednesday, the joint North American bid, United 2026, won 134 votes from national football federations to host the 2026 World Cup, against Morocco’s 65.

Rabat- On June 8, South Africa was elected to a seat at the UN Security Council, making the African country one of the 10 non-permanent members. South Africa will represent the East and Southern African group in its two-year term which starts on January 1, 2019. Expressing satisfaction at the huge continental support for its UN Security Council membership, South Africa’s government promised to represent the values and voice of the continent by remaining faithful to the lasting legacy of Nelson Mandela. “As you will know, this will be South Africa’s third term [as a UNSC non-permanent member]. Our tenure in the Security Council will be dedicated to the legacy of President Nelson Mandela and his commitment to peace.”. The South African government official also said South Africa is “humbled and honored by this gesture of confidence.” Calling the election a “landmark event,” the country’s International Relations and Cooperation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said that South Africa is a “giant” whose “reputation has been tarnished in recent years.” Sisulu recognized her country’s small efforts in peace and security matters, while promising that the seat at the UNSC is an opportunity to reclaim the country’s lost prestige and make it a major and credible player at the global and continental levels. While South African officials are effusive about winning a seat at the UNSC, analysts and security specialists are taking a more cautionary approach, saying that South Africa’s success will depend on its “continental leadership vision” and “strategic clarity” on matters of utmost importance for intra-African relations. South Africa joins two Africa countries—Equatorial Guinea and Ivory Coast—to form the A3, the three rotating African members of the Security Council, for the 2019-2020 term. Analysts have suggested that it is imperative to refrain from old ideological divides and push towards more “intra-African coherence and consistency.” There is a palpable risk of having a divided Africa on important strategic matters, said Liesl Louw-Vaudran, a senior fellow at the Pretoria-based Institute for Security Studies (ISS). Louw-Vaudran identified the Western Sahara question as one the most pressing security matters at the continental level.  However, she added, South Africa’s well-known sympathy for the self-styled Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in Western Sahara is at odds with the position of many African states, including the two other members of the A3. Such lack of coherence and unity may undermine Africa’s standing at the UN, while also creating more divisions and ambivalent feelings within the AU. “South Africa’s political support of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), a partially recognized state that controls a thin strip of area in the Western Sahara region and claims sovereignty over the entire territory, puts it at odds with over half of the AU’s member states—including Côte d’Ivoire,” Louw-Voudran told the Mail and Guardian on June 12. In the long-standing strategic stalemate between Rabat and Pretoria over Western Sahara, Francophone countries like Côte D’Ivoire are generally sympathetic towards Morocco’s position. As a result, she suggested, South Africa’s “capacity to affect change will therefore rely on its ability to enact soft power” and strategic negotiation, rather than inflexible ideological positions and “show of military force.”  As a major regional power, South Africa’s challenge during its tenure will be to “unite the AU and the UN.” “South Africa will be judged on how it responds to Africa’s various conflicts,” said Gustavo de Carvalho, a Peace Operations and Peacebuilding senior researcher at the ISS. In the current conjuncture of political transition and efforts to reclaim lost prestige, South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa’s success will rely on mitigating geopolitical  divides to opt for “effective multilateralism and inclusive dialogue,” he explained. When it comes to successful crisis management and troop deployment to conflict zones, both the African continent and the UN should sideline old misgivings, suggested Security Council analyst Richard Gowan. He said the common objective should be to “bridge divides [and escape] the current trap of worsening distrust.” Recognizing that having a single voice is a relatively impractical goal in such contexts of old grievances, veiled regional rivalries, and long-standing mutual suspicions, Louw-Vaudran concluded in her: “[African countries] are not obliged to speak with one voice, [but] South Africa’s challenge will be to try and find consensus.”

Rabat – Following an uproar among Moroccans condemning the alleged use of powder milk to make milk, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has said that the use of powdered milk to produce any kind of food “does not represent any health issue.” According to the ministry, powdered milk and dairy products are regularly imported into Morocco by agribusiness operators and are used in the manufacture of various products, including chocolate, biscuits, confections, and melted cheese. The statement added that by the end of May 2018, imports of milk powder and powdered milk preparations stood at 14,700 tonnes. According to the ministry, milk powder is even used in the manufacture of pasteurized milk and UHT milk. Moroccan law has banned and even criminalizes the use of milk powder in fresh and pasteurized milk, but allows milk powder to be used in making UHT milk, biscuits, and yoghurt. In recent months, Copag has been suspected of using powdered milk in its dairy products. Critics have also accused Copag of taking advantage of the boycott of  the dairy company Centrale Danone, to increase its sales using synthetic, rather than fresh, milk to produce its dairy products.

Rabat – The President of the Guinean Football Federation, Antonio Souaré, blamed the electronic voting system at the FIFA Congress, claiming that the country had voted for Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup and not for United 2026, the North American bid. The chief of the Guinean federation told Guinee7.com “Guinea did not vote for the Americans. It is not possible. There is total confusion here with electronic voting.” He added that it was impossible to vote against Morocco. Morocco’s bid received 65 votes during the vote. Eleven African countries, including Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique, Lesotho, Botswana, Benin, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Cape Verde, voted for United 2026. Botswana, which had pledged support for Morocco, changed its heart during the vote to back United 2026.

Rabat – Following claims of low-quality milk production, Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum has released a new 200-page report allegedly leaked from Morocco’s Court of Auditors. The report blamed Morocco’s National Office of Food Safety (ONSSA) for not monitoring food production. The report also pointed fingers at the Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture for its “dereliction.” ONSSA was created within the framework of Morocco’s new system to control food safety in 2009. ONSSA is also part of Morocco’s Green Plan. The report, obtained by Akhbar Al Yaoum exclusively, criticizes Morocco’s Ministry of Agriculture, led by Minister Aziz Akhannouch. It claims that several food products, including tea, meats, and dairy products, are not subjected to health monitoring. The experts of the Court of Auditors, led by  Driss Jettou, “unveils in their report serious conclusions, which concern the status of basic products…including meats, milk and its derivatives, vegetables and tea,” wrote Akhbar Al Yaoum. The newspaper, which was the only outlet to write about the content of the leaked report, added that “Moroccans consume these products without them being the subject to the minimum necessary health controls before consumption.” Meat, milk, and vegetables out of control The judges of the court mentioned that the ONSSA did not monitor the wholesale marketing of fruits and vegetables “because they consider them as uncategorized and could not trace the path of fruits and vegetables from the farm to the wholesale market.” The report allegedly said that the ONSSA did not establish a tracking and control system, as is the case for products for export, unveiling a lack of monitoring of the quantities of pesticides in vegetables and fruits for the domestic market. “Unlike export-oriented products, the domestic markets’ products remain out of control.” The report says that there is only a “single scheme on pesticide residues in fruits, vegetables and deciduous plants carried out by the regional stakeholders for the control of plant and plant-based products. “This scheme only included the sale in markets, including Friday markets and major areas, but it remains insufficient in regard to the number of samples taken, which does not cover the entire national territory.” The report gave examples from the Tangier-Tetouan, Marrakech-Tensift, Beni Mellal, and Meknes-Fez regions, which were not subject to monitoring between 2014 and 2016. “Even the samples taken in 2016 were limited to deciduous plants and did not include vegetables and fruits,” the report said. The report of the court also claimed that in 2015 and 2016 ONSSA only took dairy samples from production factories, but not from sale points. The report added that dairy products sold in Morocco were not subjected to any monitoring operations in 2017. “Only three out of 2,700 milk collection centers match heath standards,” said the report. ONSSA denied the claims in a statement published on June 11, emphasizing that all products were subjected to a monitoring process. The report also criticized Morocco’s slaughterhouses, saying that of the 900 slaughter houses across the country, only 4 meet health standards. Akhannouch not happy Al Jarida 24, a news outlet affiliated with Akhbar Al Yaoum, reported on Tuesday that Akhannouch denounced the leaking of the report, emphasizing that it could possibly lead to further crisis. Since April 20, Morocco has been witnessing a major boycott targeting three giant companies: Sidi Ali, Centrale Danone, and Akhannouch’s gasoline company, Afriquia gas. “I don’t know how this came out … today we discovered that some newspapers published it without respect for confidentiality. Data must be published only after obtaining management answers,” said Akhannouch who said. He added that the ministry “did not respond to the comments yet.” He further said “this is unreasonable. I held the office responsible and asked them this morning to open an investigation.”

Rabat- The Moroccan Atlas Lion Nabil Dirar has recovered from his injury and is back to training for the team’s opening World Cup match against Iran on Friday, June 15. Weeks ahead of the World Cup competition, the national team’s winger from the right side, Dirar, had a calf injury in the middle of training and had to miss the friendly match against Slovakia in Geneva on June 4. To avoid the risk of losing Dirar’s assets during the competition, the team’s coach, Hervé Renard, spared him from playing in the friendly match, saying:“It’s just a precaution to be in possession of all our strength… It’s better to leave him a few days off, and not let him play tomorrow to make sure he can get back in shape pretty quickly.” Renard had already made a back-up plan in case Dirar’s injury did not heal in time: “There is no point in taking unnecessary risks… On Wednesday, Dirar fan account wrote on a Twitter post, “2 days until the match against Iran,” followed by a “training” hashtag. 2J pour le match contre l’Iran.#training #dirar #nabildirar #maroc — Nabil Dirar (@Dirar7Nabil) June 13, 2018  Nabil Dirar is finally back in full training! Should our consistent right-back start against Iran on Friday, despite missing all three preparation games? #MAR pic.twitter.com/UtipVBkRyK — Maghrib Foot (@MaghribFoot) June 13, 2018  The post has given hope to the team’s fans who have been anxious to see Dirar play along with the team on its big day in St.Petersburg. This gives Moroccan fans yet another reason to celebrate in addition to the World Cup beginning and Eid Al Fitr (marking the end of Ramadan). Reasons to celebrate are needed to counteract Wednesday’s disappointing loss of the vote to host the 2026 World Cup to the North American trio (the US, Canada, and Mexico). The Atlas Lions will play their second match against the Portuguese on June 20 at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow. The Lions will close their first-round experience on June 25 with a game against Spain in Kaliningrad.

Rabat – The National Motorway Company of Morocco (ADM) recommends drivers plan their trip in advance to avoid traffic jams during Eid al-Fitr. The National Motorway Company said they expect heavy traffic on all roads for Eid al-Fitr, especially in the following times: -Thursday, June 14, 2018 between 3 p.m. and 10 p.m. -Sunday, June 17, 2018 between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. On Sunday, drivers must be careful about the traffic, because it will coincide with the return of families from Eid holidays. For more safety and comfort, ADM recommends drivers download the ADM traffic application in order to learn more about the traffic situation. ADM also advises drivers to use the Tag Jawaz to quickly pay the highway toll at paying stations. Morocco is investing approximately EUR 23 billion in road construction. Increasing safety is an important goal for the ADM, which believes that extending the expressway network will increase overall safety as the through-going (and often high-speed) traffic is moved away from the national roads.

By Karen Duarte  Rabat – The Morocco 2026 World Cup bid chairman claims that the country intends to continue with planned projects despite missing out on hosting the tournament.  Morocco lost today’s vote on the 2026 World Cup host at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow to a joint bid from the United States, Canada, and Mexico with 65 votes to 134.  The African country had plans to build new transport infrastructure, many hotels, hospitals, and other leisure facilities.  In addition, it outlined a proposal to greatly increase its number of football stadiums, pledging to build nine new arenas and rebuild three others.  Despite the defeat, bid chairman Moulay Hafid Elalamy said in a statement, “Morocco is proud to have led a campaign that was committed, ethical and totally in keeping to the rules imposed by FIFA.” “Under the enlightened leadership of His Majesty The King, the Kingdom of Morocco is determined to continue on its current trajectory. The projects that we have presented in the Bid Book will be realised. We managed this Bid with a sporting spirit and we will continue our path in the same vein.” The president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), Fouzi Lekjaa, stated, “Morocco is pleased to have presented a solid bid where football is at the centre of an authentic, profitable FIFA World Cup with a strong legacy.” He congratulated his rivals, saying “On behalf of the FRMF I wish to congratulate my colleagues, the presidents of the USA, Mexico, and Canada Football Associations, and I wish them all the best in organizing the FIFA World Cup and furthering the path of development of football. “I also wish to congratulate FIFA for the conduct of this bid process and FIFA president Gianni Infantino for all that has been done to make things move towards more transparency and inclusion and I want to reaffirm the commitment of my country to continue to work for football.”

By Karen Duarte Rabat – Although Morocco counted on the strong support of its neighboring African countries, eleven refused to vote for Morocco to host the 2026 World Cup. South Africa, Guinea, Liberia, Benin, Sierra Leone, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Cape Verde, and Zimbabwe were the eleven African countries who paved the way for the joint United States-Canada-Mexico bid to win.   The United 2026 bid was selected today by FIFA federations at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow. There were 65 votes (33%) for Morocco’s bid. The United (North American) bid received 134 votes (67%), and Iran was the only country that voted for “none of the bids.”  With its fifth attempt to host, Morocco was hoping to be the second African country to host this far-reaching tournament. The 2026 tournament will be the biggest World Cup ever with 48 teams playing 80 matches over 34 days. Both Mexico (1970 and 1986) and the United States (1994) have previously hosted World Cups. Canada staged the Women’s World Cup in 2015. Perhaps US President Donald Trump’s tweet in April stating, “It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against against the U.S bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us,” had a major effect on the eleven African countries that refused to vote for Morocco’s bid.  Now, in future football events the eleven countries who voted against Morocco’s bid will be unlikely to receive the support of the rest of Africa if they tried to host.  Despite its fifth failure, Morocco has vowed to continue its campaign to host the World Cup.  Following the poll results, Fouzi Lekjaa, head of the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF), emphasized “the determination of my country to continue to work for football…and to realize our dream some day of hosting the World Cup”.

Rabat – “It is a bid for a whole people:” this was Morocco’s aim while bidding to host the 2026 World Cup. Morocco made its last attempt to try to convince football federations to vote for its bid, before disappointingly losing to United 2026. Minutes before the vote, members of Morocco’s committee stepped on to the stage to present its bid briefly to the voting football federations. Chairman of Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid Moulay Hafid Elalamy said before the event, which convened hundreds of football representatives from all over the world, that “Morocco’s bid is not only for Morocco, but it is a bid for a whole people.” Elalamy touted Morocco’s stability, which was recognized by international powers, as well as Morocco’s strict law against the use of weapons. The chairman of the bid committee expressed his pride and Morocco’s satisfaction over leading a competitive campaign. He said that Morocco’s bid demonstrated its capacity to host the tournament, which was validated by FIFA. He mentioned Morocco’s strategic projects throughout the years, including the high-speed train, a solar power plan, and investments. Elalamy also discussed Morocco’s stability, which is recognized by international powers. He also added that the country receives thousands of tourists, and Morocco would sell game tickets for reasonable prices. Lekjaa President of the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF) then talked about the significance of Morocco’s values, its strategic position on the map, and Morocco’s passion for football to celebrate Africa. According to Lekjaa, it is legitimate for Africa to host the tournament a second time to demonstrate Morocco’s assets and to develop football on the continent. “Long live football, long live the values of football,” concluded Lekjaa. After the vote, which gave the hosting rights to United 2026 with a vote of 134 federations, the Moroccan committee congratulated the North American bid. Morocco’s committee also expressed its determination to submit a bid again to host the tournament. The chairman of the bid said Morocco’s bid “was committed, ethical and totally in keeping to the rules imposed by FIFA World Cup, which in 2026 for the first time will see the participation of 48 teams, meeting the new demanding specifications of FIFA.” Lekjaa also voiced his satisfaction with the Moroccan bid, describing it as a “solid bid, where football is at the center of an authentic, profitable FIFA World Cup with a strong legacy.” He also congratulated FIFA President Gianni Infantino for “all that has been done to make things move towards more transparency and inclusion and I want to reaffirm the commitment of my country to continue to work for football.”

Rabat – The competition to host the 2026 World Cup has ended. The United 2026 (North American) bid won the race, but Morocco’s passion for football will remain despite failing a fifth time in its aim to be the second African country to host the world’s premier tournament. During the 68th FIFA Congress, 200 federations voted, with one federation (Iran) voting for neither bid. Iran’s decision can be explained through the political crisis with both bidders. Spain, which decided yesterday how it would vote, abstained from voting along with Slovenia and Cuba. United 2026 received 134 votes, including several from Arab countries: Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates. The complete lists of countries voting against Morocco is as follows:    Saudi Arabia received wide backlash from Moroccans worldwide for lobbying against Morocco in the final days of the bid and for collecting votes for Morocco’s rival. Morocco received 65 votes. Surprisingly, several countries changed their heart in the last minutes to the vote. While they pledged support for Morocco throughout the bidding process, these countries, including Russia, Botswana, and Saint Lucia voted for United 2026 instead. FIFA’s unprecedented voting system published the votes of countries. Confused between voting and not voting, the countries had only 15 seconds to cast their vote. Some countries, including African countries, chose not to vote for Morocco, possibly influenced by pressure from the US to choose between their interests or friendship ties. US President Donald Trump made his stance clear when he tweeted his threat: “It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid.” 11 Africans against Africa The statement of Hicham El Amrani, CEO of the Moroccan bid, rings true. “Even if Africa has always acted in unity, unity does not mean 100% of all the member associations, this is part of the democratic process,”  El Amrani told BBC. South Africa voted for United 2026, as expected. President of the South African Football Association Danny Jordaan said he would vote for Morocco, but South Africa’s Ministry of Youth and Sports politicized the decision, emphasizing that “supporting Morocco’s bid is not included in its political agenda.” Like South Africa, Namibia decided not to vote for Morocco because of its stance on the Western Sahara conflict. Liberia, Benin, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia, and Lesotho also voted for United 2016, failing the African dream to host the tournament a second time. And the last African country that chose to vote against Morocco was Botswana, which had pledged support for Morocco, but changed its heart during the vote. The following list voted for Morocco 2026.

Rabat – In a bid to upgrade terrorism prevention and alleviate the threats of radicalization, French and Belgian authorities announced yesterday in Paris a “quadripartite ministerial” unit with Morocco and Spain to lead their anti-terrorism agenda. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and his Belgian counterpart Charles Michel announced the two countries’ plans to  establish a common front with Morocco and Spain to “materialize and upgrade our governments’ engagements in terms of solidarity in the fight against radical terrorism.” Expressing their determination to “work closely with our partners,” the two officials said that the joint anti-terrorism front will begin operating by the end of this year.  They said that they expect the new Euro-Moroccan security platform to bring their common security system to the next level, including comprehensive intelligence sharing and the “harmonization of identification criteria.” This will facilitate DNA testing, arrests of suspects, and allow for rapid field interventions in the event of a terrorist attack. The “quadripartite unit” is set to bring together the justice ministries of Belgium, France, Morocco, and Spain to improve response coordination and intelligence sharing.  Expanding on the existing ties between the four countries, the new platform is expected to build a more solid system to reinforce border security and closely follow radicalization targets. The joint press release suggested that the four countries create a common platform to share their experiences on target monitoring, prevention, deradicalization, and rehabilitation programs. Much less was said about their plans to set specific measures and security frameworks to ease coordination between investigation agents and field operatives, although the authorities promised to push toward more integration and interdependence. The press release finally noted the need for tougher measures on youth online activities and the circulation of explosive materials. Also needed are tighter security checks at EU borders to better monitor the movement of potential threats, while at the same time trying to contain, foresee, and prevent violent radicalization.

Rabat- New videos have circulated on social media lately of a saddened woman calling for the punishment of a veterinarian who killed her pet cat. Many Moroccan people mocked the woman online and called her “crazy.” Some people share strong bonds with animals, namely pets. The lady in the videos is one of them. She posted two videos online to share her story about her cat’s death at the hands of an inexperienced veterinarian. On the first video she said that her cat suffered the inability to urinate and when she took it to the vet, he said that it suffered from a cyst in the abdomen. When the vet operated on the cat he could not find a cyst and when the woman and her daughter called him, he said that the pet had died from an hemorrhage: “We kept calling him, but he kept always hanging up on us…this man is a murderer! whoever has a cat and an ounce of humanity, share this video, to expose him. I want him to be punished,” she said on the verge of tears. In the second video, recorded near the vet’s office, the woman and her daughter seemed near to an emotional breakdown: “I handed him the cat safe and sound and he killed her,” the woman screamed while her daughter wept. Meanwhile social media users could almost be seen shaking their heads at the videos: “She’s complaining about the vet killing her cat…I thought he killed her mother or some family members…This [woman] is over the top.” ; Another Facebook user commented on the video:”Have you held a funeral yet? Just bring four priests to pray for her. May she rest in peace, she was good to other cats.” Others expressed understanding and sympathy with the woman: “This is the best example of humanity,” one commenter wrote.

Rabat– The Spanish Football Association (RFEF) has ousted Spanish football Coach Julen Lopetegui, after he confirmed he will replace Zinedine zidane as Real Madrid coach. Spain will play its opening World Cup match against Portugal on Friday without Coach Julen Lopetegui. RFEF was extremely upset at Lopetegui’s sudden decision, which it was not informed of until a few minutes before the press release, just one day ahead of the World Cup. RFEF President Luis Rubiales said that he missed the World Cup 2026 host vote in Russia on Wednesday and went back to Spain to handle the situation: “I took a plane, came back from Moscow, missed the vote on the next World Cup to be here. We had to react.” However, RFEF wasted no time. Immediately after the federation fired Lopetegui this morning, it appointed a new coach for the team, former defender of Real Madrid, Fernando Hierro.  OFICIAL | Fernando Hierro asumirá el cargo de seleccionador nacional durante el Campeonato del Mundo de Rusia. https://t.co/g576TRpp3D — Selección Española de Fútbol (@SeFutbol) June 13, 2018  Spain will play its second match against Iran on June, 20. Its third match will be against Morocco on June, 25. The much-anticipated FIFA 2026 World Cup vote came to an end Wednesday morning (GMT time) with the winning of the joint bid by the US, Canada, and Mexico (United 2026) against Morocco.  Much to Morocco’s disappointment, United 2026 received 134 votes compared to its 65 votes.

Rabat – After adjusting its timetable for Ramadan, the National Office of Railways (ONCF) has changed its schedule for Eid Al Fitr, expected to be celebrated in Morocco Friday June 15. ONCF has announced a “special Eid” transport plan, in effect from June 12 to 17,  in anticipation of the high numbers of travelers that usually take the train this period. The plan increases the number of trains on the main axes of the railway network (Casablanca- Rabat-Fès-Marrakech-Tangier-Oujda and Nador), said the ONCF in a statement to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). ONCF will also increase the number of employees responsible for the reception and orientation of travelers in train stations and on board trains and add ticket sales counters, ticket vending machines, and the option of buying tickets online at  “www.oncf-voyages.ma.” In addition, the railway police force will be strengthened to maintain the safety and security of travelers both at railway stations and on trains. For some travelers, such as families, young people, seniors, and students, ONCF is offering a range of low prices, according to the release. ONCF asked customers to check schedules ahead of time, buy tickets in advance, and take the trains whose number is on the ticket.

Rabat- United 2026 has won the rights to host the 2026 World Cup with 67% percent of the vote on Wednesday at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow. Morocco’s bid was knocked out from the race with 65 votes, amounting to 33% of the vote.  Before the vote, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that FIFA will ensure transparency and share the data regarding the 2026 World Cup. He added that some news outlets have not reported on how FIFA made efforts to ensure this, but they rather reported on the mistakes FIFA made. Infantino was criticized by Moroccan football fans for his alleged bias against the Moroccan bid. He also emphasized FIFA’s program to develop football around the world as the football governing body invested four times in previous years to develop football globally. In his address to the FIFA Congress, he explained that what is important to the football organization is “the development of football.” He also promised that there will be more achievements to come, thanking the FIFA council and the football associations in attendance. The vote started after the bidding nations introduced their bids in front of FIFA delegates and football association representatives. The Secretary General of FIFA Council Fatma Samoura talked about the assessments of the FIFA task force, which evaluated the two bids. The task force gave Morocco’s bid 2.7 out of 5, while the US bid received 4 out of 5. Since the creation of FIFA 100 years ago, Africa has only hosted the tournament once in South Africa in 2010. Morocco had expressed its hopes to be the second African country to host the tournament four times before. “It’s a bid for a whole nation,” said Chairman of the Moroccan bid committee Moulay Hafid Elalamy in front of the Congress. He touted Morocco’s strategic projects throughout the years, including the high speed train, a solar power plan and investments. Elalamy also discussed Morocco’s stability, which is recognized by international powers. He also noted that it is illegal to use firearms in Morocco. He also added that the country receives thousands of tourists, and Morocco would sell game tickets for reasonable prices. More Americans to show interest in football Americans have not always been obsessed with football. However, in recent years there has been an increased interest in the game, called soccer in the US. In the past few years, more and more Americans have taken up football as their favorite sport.  At the same time, the sport is becoming more accessible to Americans. With the hosting of the FIFA 2026 World Cup, it is expected that millions of Americans will turn towards football. Sports websites, such as Power Sports Memorabilia, are expecting to see a surge of visitors looking to buy football equipment.

Rabat – As national federations convene for the 68th FIFA Congress, politics and geostrategic calculations are quickly transforming the sporting experience into an exercise of usurpation and heavy politicking. Not satisfied with casting its own ballot for the United Bid, the US-led North American trio, Saudi Arabia is now using its financial resources and spiritual authority to convince some other Muslim-majority countries to back North America at the expense of Morocco 2026. What was started as a competition between two bids promising to serve the interests of the game and fans has become a venue for permanent extortion and backstage diplomatic tricks, exposing the toxic politicization of sport. No easy victory in sight If anything, none of the two bids will have it easy today. Whereas Latin American federations decided that they did not have time to listen to Morocco’s arguments on June 11 and 12, the African bloc, in its crushing majority, showed almost the same disinterest during the North American presentation on June 12. African federations mildly and “politely” applauded the United (North American) bid after its presentation, according to the Associated Press. The American outlet underlined that the show was just a formal display of respect, as many African federations seemed already resolved to favor the continent’s representative. Before the presentation, CAF president Ahmad Ahmad put in final efforts to rally a considerable African bloc in favor of Morocco, urging Africa to “show cohesion.” “There is a moral obligation to remain within our family,” Ahmad declared, conceding however that “of course it is an individual choice.” Europe for its part seemed divided. There is no bloc voting in sight, although French Football Federation president Noel Le Graet declared he is “confident that half of UEFA” will vote in Morocco’s favor. Saudi Arabia’s never ending United 2026 lobbying “This feels like being stabbed in your back by a brother,” some diplomatic sources have been quoted as saying, referring to news that the Gulf king actively lobbied for the United bid on June 11 and 12. The goal was to convert many Muslim countries to commit to the North American bid. Bristling with Riyadh’s intense efforts to undermine the Moroccan bid in Muslim circles, some Moroccan officials have explained that although the Saudis are entitled to their decision to endorse the United bid, it is much less comprehensible that “a fellow brother” could go to such lengths to turn other Muslim countries against a bid representing shared values and traditions. “The muscular Saudi lobbying” has already succeeded in changing the position of about ten national federations who were either wavering or considering a Morocco 2026 vote at the FIFA congress to be held within few hours, others reported. Arabophone outlet Goud, for example, quoted Moroccan diplomatic sources and representatives in Moscow as saying that Saudi lobbying for the North American bid was far more significant than Canada’s entire campaigning efforts. Tension between Saudi Arabia and Morocco Though Riyadh is known for being America’s most strategic ally in the Muslim world, it is now a known secret that that the Gulf country’s anti-Morocco 2026 agenda has much to do with Rabat’s position in the conflict between Saudi Arabia and Qatar. It is understood that Saudi Arabia is frustrated with Rabat’s “objective neutrality” in the Gulf crisis. Others have also pointed out Morocco’s reluctance to send troops to Yemen despite numerous requests from Saudi authorities. As a result, they argue, Riyadh has chosen to vent its frustration on the North African’s dream to host the footballing world’s most prestigious tournament. On social media, the outrage caused by the Saudi Arabia Football Federation’s last-minute intrusion into the pre-voting procedures cannot be overstated. Many Moroccans appeared to have had it with the Saudis’ disregard for their “national cause.” Some went as far as asking Moroccan authorities to review the country’s diplomacy towards a “circumstantial ally.” “It is just a matter of time. Rabat is taking its time to know the intention and priorities of the new Saudi authorities. In the end, Morocco’s national interests will always prevail,” a source at the foreign affairs ministry said under conditions of anonymity. Afghanistan and Pakistan are believed to be among the ten Muslim countries whose change of heart is said to have come about as a result of Saudi Arabia’s pro-United 2026 lobbying. And since FIFA will make public the vote of each national federation, it remains to be seen the full extent of the Saudi damage to Morocco 2026.

Rabat- Morocco’s Ministry of Interior prohibited some religious rights activists from hosting an interreligious ftour (breaking fast) and reciting maghrib (sunset) prayer calls tonight at St. Peter’s Cathedral in Rabat. The Moroccan Association for Religious Rights and Freedoms announced earlier that it will host a number of religious personalities from the three Abrahamic faiths— Christianity, Judaism, and Islam—for ftour inside the Catholic church in Rabat, to promote tolerance and interfaith dialogue. Members of the three religions were intending to lead speeches or sermons the Tuesday evening following Laylat Al Qadr (the night of decree), celebrated on the 27th day in Ramadan. The program included raising the azan (prayer call) before breaking the fast in the church. The announcement caused widespread online controversy in recent days, as some Moroccans criticized the unprecedented initiative and deemed it “suspicious.” Christian rights activist Mohammed Said told Moroccan news outlet Hespress that such events are “superficial” with hidden agendas: ““We [Christians] want to practise our religion freely just like the rest of Moroccans…such events would only serve in creating media hype rather than serve the cause of Moroccan Christians.” Recently, rumors that the religious rights association intends to hold protests near the Parliament when Pope Francis arrives in the country have been circulated by Moroccan press. A Moroccan Christian convert couple were also reported to be waiting for Pope Francis’s official visit to Morocco to get married. Moroccan Christians are a religious minority in Morocco. According to US State Department, Christian leaders in Morocco estimate there are 2,000 to 6,000 Christian converts in Morocco who try to keep a low profile, fearing social judgement.

Rabat- Following several meetings with Minister of General Affairs and Governance Lahcen Daoudi, fuel companies in Morocco have agreed to lower fuel prices for six months. The National Federation of Traders and Managers of Service Stations issued a statement on Tuesday, denying that fuel companies have increased their profit margins to 70 centimes per liter. The federation said fuel operators attended seven meetings with Daoudi to negotiate with the government, and decided to narrow their profit margins. The federation further noted that the six-month period will enable fuel companies to continue to negotiate on new prices that will suit consumers’ purchasing power. Some companies doubled their profits following fuel deregulation, which allowed the price to vary with market trends. The government requested that companies narrow their profit margin, after a major boycott of Morocco’s largest fuel distributor, Afriquia gas, began April 20. According to the chairman of the House of Representatives’ Finance Committee, Abdellah Bouanou, the difference between the government’s regulated fuel prices and the unregulated prices is nearly MAD 1 per liter. Daoudi was the first government minister to accuse oil companies of doubling fuel prices. In 2017, he pledged to convince all distributors to revise their margins down. The minister, who also defended the boycotted dairy company Centrale Danone, handed in his resignation after joining a protest with Danone employees to the boycotters’ disgust. His resignation has not yet been approved by King Mohammed VI, but Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has taken charge of the fuel negotiations in Rabat.

Rabat- Moroccan fans of the Atlas Lions are hyped up in Moscow, one day before the start of the World Cup 2018 tournament and two days before Morocco’s first World Cup match against Iran on June 15. The Moroccan mile-race Olympic champion and world record holder Hicham El Guerrouj shared on his Twitter account a video of Moroccan fans chanting “I love a red flag,” from a popular Moroccan song. The Atlas Lions are playing in the World Cup for the first time since 1998. El Guerrouj’s 17-second clip captured the fans as they held the Moroccan flag together and jumped up and down in sheer enthusiasm in Moscow, where a few Russian passersby got to witness the jovial cheering.

Rabat- Irish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Simon Coveney announced on Monday that his country will open a new embassy in Rabat to develop trade and business opportunities between Morocco and Ireland. “Ireland is so far one of the few European Union member states without presence in North Africa…a new embassy in Rabat will allow us to develop trading opportunities, especially in the fields of agri-food, agricultural machinery and renewable energy,” Coveney said in a statement to Moroccan state owned press, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The decision comes in line with the Global Ireland 2025 strategy to strengthen Ireland’s presence globally. The country plans to open other embassies and consulates in Cardiff, Wales; Frankfurt, Germany; Los Angeles, US; and Kiev, Ukraine, starting from 2019. Morocco’s ambitious visions for the economy’s future, such as its goal to achieve 42 percent of renewable energy capacity by 2020 and 52 percent by 2030 make it an eligible candidate for potential international investors. The country’s principal renewable energies are solar energy and wind energy.

By Marius Bordat Rabat – On June 13, FIFA will announce the host country for the 23rd men’s World Cup to be held in 2026. Only two hosts are under consideration to organize the biggest soccer competition in the world, one of which is United 2026, a bid by Canada, Mexico, and United States. The other candidate is Morocco.   As a French-American born in Morocco and an avid soccer fan and player, I, along with my friends, will be 24 years old in 2026. We are eagerly awaiting FIFA’s upcoming decision and hope it will be favorable to Morocco, for many reasons.  We think that Morocco should finally be given the opportunity to organize the World Cup, after four previous disappointing, unsuccessful attempts in 1994, 1998, 2006, and 2010. In contrast, as Mehdi, aged 16, pointed out, the United States has already organized the World Cup once in 1994, and Mexico has been the host country twice, in 1970 and 1986. It is more than time for Morocco to be given its chance. Second, in Morocco soccer is very popular, and emotional attachments to the sport prevail over economic motivations. Across the country, soccer can be and is played everywhere, on beaches, on empty rural fields in the countryside, and in city streets. “Americans tend to organize these competitions with a lucrative purpose,” said Yassine, age 16. “Whereas in Morocco the passion of soccer is more important than making profits.”  Another point that FIFA should take into account is that when a country hosts the World Cup they are automatically qualified. The problem with the United 2026 candidacy is that there are three countries in the same bid. If all three of them get to participate, that will remove two available spots for the World Cup from other countries.    Certain critics have expressed their concern that the infrastructure in Morocco is not yet prepared to host the World Cup. “Morocco has already hosted many international sporting events and music festivals,” responds Yassine. If Morocco is lucky enough to be chosen by FIFA, it will be a welcome opportunity for the economic development of the country. Infrastructure and transport will improve in preparation for the World Cup and in anticipation of the tourists that will come to Morocco to support their national teams. Additionally, as Sofia, aged 16, points out, “one advantage of the Moroccan bid is its geography and the proximity between cities. Spectators can travel from one site to another more easily in Morocco than they can across Canada, Mexico, and the United States.” In contrast, distances between stadiums are very far with the United bid.  Only wealthier soccer fans would be able to afford the plane tickets across the North American continent to follow their national team.  A Morocco-hosted World Cup would open up the games to people from other socio-economic classes. Morocco has proposed 12 cities to host the 2026 World Cup. Given the diversity of the sites, combining the ocean, the sea, the mountains, and the desert, Morocco’s bid actually contains numerous countries in one.     Given its unique geographic position at the crossroads between Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, Morocco is the ideal country to host a World Cup that would unite all civilizations. If Morocco wins the bid, my friends and I, as well as youth across Morocco, will feel a sense of joy and pride. Choosing Morocco to host the 2026 World Cup will be a vote for fairness, for soccer passion, and for hope for the future.

Rabat – Nearly eight weeks into a major boycott, Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch is hoping for a quick end to the boycott of the Centrale Danone dairy company as the sector “supports 1.4 million people.” The minister, who owns boycotted gasoline company Afriquia gas, denounced the boycott of three prominent companies in the early days of the campaign, which began April 20. Akhannouch’s latest plea was made during the oral questions session held on Tuesday at the House of Councilors. According to Akhannouch these efforts to preserve the sector are made to support people working in this field. “We hope to see the end of the tunnel at the end of Ramadan,” he said. In a statement published on June 4, Centrale Danone announced that it had suffered a net loss of MAD 150 million in the first half of 2018. A recent study by global leader in data investment management Kantar revealed that the dairy company’s market share fell from 46.7 percent in April to its current level of 18.3 percent.
Earlier this month, Moroccan interprofessional federation of milk (FIMALATI) urged Akhannouch to intervene to end the boycott on Centrale Danone products on Friday.

In a meeting with the minister, FIMALATI representatives of Moroccan farmers expressed “strong concerns and their distress” following Centrale Danone’s decision to reduce their milk order from farmers by 30 percent. A post-meeting statement from the Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture expressed concerns over the consequences of the boycott, saying that the professionals of the dairy sector exposed the “difficulties experienced by farmers, peasants, and milk producers” due to the boycott.

The meeting also discussed the “devastating impact of the disruption of the production chain on pastoralists, compromising their income, their ability to repay their debts and maintain their investments.” During the 13th annual International Agricultural Fair (SIAM) held in April in Meknes, Akhannouch was one of the first government minister who said that the online campaign cannot stop 470,000 employees in the dairy sector. He added that the public “should be thankful for the fact that there are no milk shortages and the product is available throughout the year.”

Rabat- Claims of plagiarism and “ingratitude” have led two of Morocco’s most famous sexologists to exchange fiery messages and question each other’s academic credibility. Abdessamad Dialmy is one of Morocco’s leading sexologists, and his 1985 book Women and Sexuality in Morocco is considered by many as the first fully-fledged academic exploration of sexuality and related topics in Morocco. On June 10, Dialmy took to Facebook to denounce the “ingratitude” and “lack of academic rigor” in the emerging sexologist Sana El Aji’s work. Sanaa El Aji has made a name for herself challenging established norms and rules about sex and sexuality in Morocco. Her books and op-ed pieces on virginity and married women have attracted public attention from passionate admirers and heavy critics. Dialmy particularly attacked El Aji’s PhD thesis, which he said is filled with unacknowledged borrowed ideas and theories. While Dialmy’s fury is primarily grounded in his claim that El Aji appropriated his ideas, he also explained that he once gave her an unpublished book for her to promote when El Aji was a well-known journalist. Instead of promoting the book, he explained, she read and took advantage of the ideas in the book. “That is pure opportunism,” Dialmy fumed. He further accused her of not mentioning his name in her PhD thesis while deliberately borrowing his ideas. Dialmy wrote: “It pains me to now consider you as a person unworthy of my friendship and respect, as you lack both religious and civic morals, in addition to lacking professional and academic ethics.” Dialmy’s lengthy Facebook post, which is organized in five acts, further slams El Aji as “a pure opportunist.” His post accused Sanaa El Aji of appropriating his concepts and theories, such as “sexual frustration” or “sexual transition,” in the Moroccan social context. Dialmy also accused El Aji of wrongly attributing the “bricolage sexuel” (sexual tinkering) concept to another sociologist, Mounia Bennani Chraibi. The term was coined to explain the detours which single Moroccan men and women use to circumvent society’s rigid and marriage-focused rules on sexuality. Sanaa El Aji’s reply came just an hour later on Facebook. She said that her work on “sexual transition” was inspired by Michel Foucault’s work on sexuality and violence. El Aji argued that Dialmy is only furious at her because of “an obsession to see his name” and be quoted, and to be recognized as the “father or precursor” of concepts and ideas which he himself borrowed from other researchers and thinkers.  “Or is he insinuating that Foucault plagiarized him, too?” she asked sarcastically, dismissing Dialmy’s arguments as “baseless and unsubstantiated.” The origin of the phrase “bricolage sexuel” cannot be ascribed to Abdessamad Dialmy, she said, explaining: “Mounia Bennani’s 1994 book Between submission and rebellion: Youth in Morocco explored the topic three years prior to the source that Dialmy suggested.” In the emerging market for ideas and books, topics such as sexuality or sexual misery in the Muslim world are popular among thousands of readers. While the exploration of such hot button topics had been exclusively left to artists—cinema, novels, music, etc.—there is a widening of interests among academics, especially sociologists, and journalists. However, the clash between two of Morocco’s leading figures in the emerging field of the “sociology of intimate lives” did not sit well with readers and followers. While acknowledging his status as “one of the precursors” of the sociological study of sexuality in Morocco, most of the followers who commented on Dialmy’s post called it “uncalled for,” “impetuous,” and “unworthy of a respected academic.”  Others saw in his gesture the “uneasiness and jealousy that successful” emerging voices cause among those who consider themselves established and more experienced.

Rabat – The Palestinian people have praised Morocco’s “humanitarian and solidarity support” for Palestine, said Palestinian Information Ministry delegate Salama Maârouf. Morocco’s support for Palestine after the May 14 Gaza massacre proves that the Palestinian cause is priority of Moroccans, the King, and the government a, Palestinian official told MAP. “We welcomed with great satisfaction and gratitude the news of humanitarian aid announced by King Mohammed VI,” he said, noting that the sovereign, in his capacity as chairman of the Al-Quds Committee, “has always been on the side of the Palestinian people.” For him, the “noble” Moroccan initiative will help meet the medical needs in the Gaza Strip, given the large number of wounded and sick people requiring surgical interventions and regular medical monitoring. The official spoke with MAP shortly before the opening of the field hospital from the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces (FAR) in the Gaza Strip. Moreover, Maârouf expressed his hope for other Arab countries to follow Morocco’s example of and provide other support to the Palestinian people. The Moroccan humanitarian operation includes the deployment of a FAR field hospital and the distribution of a batch of medicines, blankets, and foodstuffs. The field hospital will care for the wounded and civilian casualties of recent events in the Gaza Strip. It will offer consultations in various specialties, including general medicine, dentistry, emergency medicine, cardiology, ophthalmology, ENT, gynecology-obstetrics, trauma, pediatrics, and radiology. The humanitarian aid included 113 tons of foodstuffs (56.5 tons for the Gaza Strip and 56.5 tons for Ramallah and Al-Quds, Jerusalem) to consume during the holy month of Ramadan. The aid also includes 5,000 blankets. On May 30, King Mohammed VI personally supervised the humanitarian aid transport at the Casablanca airport. The operation is a symbol of the historical and humanitarian solidarity of King Mohammed VI towards Palestinians.

Rabat – “Sport is our second religion,” said Mustapha Hadji, the Atlas Lions assistant coach. Two days before the final vote, the former Atlas Lion icon has affirmed his unconditional support for Morocco’s bid to host the World Cup 2026, in an interview shared on Twitter by the bid, Monday, June 11. #Soutien ? « Organiser une #CoupeduMonde au #Maroc bénéficierait, en terme de développement, au continent africain entier ». Mustapha Hadji, ballon d’or africain 1998 et adjoint d’@Herve_Renard_HR de l’@EnMaroc, évoque son soutien pour la candidature #Maroc2026 pic.twitter.com/eKfXOdgqId — Morocco 2026 (@Morocco2026_FR) 11 juin 2018  “Organizing the World Cup in 2026 will be a great opportunity to develop our country. It will benefit to the whole continent,” said Hadji. “Sport is our second religion, our opium, a wonderful opportunity to our youth, to give them hope.” The former 1998 African gold ball who describes football as “a passion and a tradition” is convinced that Morocco can give to the world “a great sporting competition.” “We are a big football ground, the World Cup can only be exceptional at home. I believe that 99% of Moroccans live football every day. When there is a great match of any team, all the cafes are full,” said Hervé Renard’s assistant. The vote to decide which bid will be given the hosting rights of the 2026 World Cup will be held in Moscow during the 68th FIFA Congress on Wednesday, June 13. According to the agenda, the symposium will begin in Moscow at 9:00 a.m. Moscow time, 6:00 a.m. in Morocco. The kingdom will is facing fierce competition for the rights from the three North American countries: Canad, the US, and Mexico. The bidding nations—Morocco and the three North Americans—cannot vote. Morocco will need to receive 104 votes to host the tournament. The North African country has at least 20 votes from several European and African countries in its pocket. But Morocco has more than a slim chance to win as 207 federations are set to vote.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Office of Food Safety (ONSSA) denied claims that it did not perform any health standard monitoring on Morocco’s dairy products in 2017. ONSSA published a statement today reviewing the controls in the 2017 financial year. According to the statement, “ONSSA  inspectors carried out 74,800 inspection visits” in local markets. Of these, 28,350 were carried out in provincial and prefectural commissions. The statement further explained that the monitoring operation resulted in the control of 1,21,000 tons of food products, the seizure and destruction of 4,730 tons of unsuitable products, and the transmission of 2,566 files to the courts for prosecution. The statements came three days after Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum wrote that it had received a report alleging that the dairy products were not subject to any health monitoring in 2017. ONSSA said it has conducted the control of 8,133,000 tons of various imported food products. This operation resulted in the admission of 48,314 certificates, while 2,130 tons of food products were rejected for non-compliance with the regulatory requirements. The statement, however, did not mention the issue related to Copag, which is being suspected of using synthetic milk in the making of its dairy products. Moroccan law criminalizes the use of milk powder to produce milk. Critics are adamant that Copag should be held accountable.  An anonymous source reportedly told Moroccan news outlet Medias 24,  “While Copag’s purchase of fresh milk should have increased given its current sales level, the company has kept the same quantity during the same period.” The issue has come to the fore since a major boycott of Centrale Danone affected the sale of its dairy products, increasing Copag’s market share.  “Why are they raising this issue just now while everyone knows that it was wide currency, especially during Ramadan periods?” Copag asked, denying the claims. “We do not work in the dark,” said Copag’s director M’hammed Loultiti when asked about the company’s position on the prevailing controversy. Loultiti added that the company is open to any inspection missions by relevant authorities.

Rabat – The Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) has announced that it will vote for Morocco’s bid to win the hosting rights to the 2026 World Cup on Wednesday, June 13, at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow. The Netherlands announced its decision to back Morocco’s bid on the eve of the vote. The news was confirmed by Dutch news outlet AD today. “We want to do something for all the good things Africa and Morocco have brought to Dutch football in recent years,’ said van Praag, President of the KNVB. He added that the Dutch federation chose the Moroccan bid to show loyalty “to an important part of our Dutch society, namely to the community that is rooted in Morocco. This loyalty is a logical consequence of the KNVB’s aim for diversity on all fronts in our society. We therefore see it as a moral obligation to vote for Morocco.” Several Moroccan footballers play on Dutch football teams, making their footprints notable in Dutch football fields, including Nordin Amrabat, Ibrahim Affelay, Karim EL Ahmadi, Mbark Boussoufa, Hakim Ziyech, and Sofyan Amrabat. Several European countries announced their support for Morocco 2026, including France, Serbia, Russia, Belgium and Luxembourg.

Rabat- The Moroccan Royal Armed Forces (FAR) field hospital, recently deployed in Gaza, has opened its doors to receive Gazan patients. On Friday, June 8, King Mohammed VI’s humanitarian aid transport arrived in the Gaza strip, loaded with 113 tons of aid, including 25 tons of medicine and 5,000 blankets. FAR’s 97 medical staff, including 14 doctors and 21 nurses, also arrived to prepare themselves to assist injured Palestinians who suffered the May 14 massacre and other Palestinians suffering from illnesses. Soldiers of the Royal Armed Forces began to set up the hospital from Sunday, June 10, until Monday, enabling it to launch medical services and operate with all of its equipment. The hospital is equipped to handle emergencies, pediatrics, traumatology, ENT, ophthalmology, cardiology, and provide vascular and abdominal surgeries among other medical needs. The medical officer in charge of the field hospital, Ahmed Bounaim, informed the press that the hospital also has radiology equipment and a laboratory for medical analysis, which will mitigate the medical equipment shortage in the region. “Our objective is to guarantee the success of this humanitarian mission in every way possible, in accordance with the high royal instructions,” Bounaim said in a statement. Before arriving in Gaza, the aid stopped in Cairo’s West Air Base Airport where Morocco’s Ambassador to Egypt Ahmad Tazi supervised its transferring from the military airplanes to trucks that shipped it to its destination. King Mohammed VI personally supervised the aid transport leaving the Casablanca airport on May 29.

Rabat – National security police have arrested a 72-year-old French citizen of Togolese origin in possession of three kilograms of cocaine at Casablanca’s Mohammed V International Airport, according to the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). The suspect was arrested Monday when he arrived on a flight from Sao Paulo (Brazil) before attempting to make a connecting flight to Cotonou (Benin). The DGSN’s statement said that the searches carried out by the security police at the airport indicated the cocaine hidden in the suspect’s baggage. The suspect was placed in police custody pending investigation by the competent prosecutor’s office. The operation is an example of the intense efforts made by the DGSN to fight international drug trafficking. Morocco spends one of the highest proportions of its budget on security among African countries.  Today, the kingdom dedicates about 15 percent of its annual state budget on the military.

Rabat – President of the French Football Federation (FFF) Noel le Garet campaigned for the Morocco 2026 World Cup bid with the UEFA  members in Moscow. Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid committee had its last chance to present their bid in front of the UEFA (European) football federations on Tuesday morning in Moscow. The committee received help from Le Garet. “I raised my hand to speak and I was the only one to do it,” said Le Garet in front of the federations.  He continued to say: “I once again presented the position of France and the friendly relations we have with Morocco, as with most African countries, saying that this may be the time to give back to Africa what it has given to European football.” According to the Frenchman, Morocco can count on “about half” of the 55 associations affiliated with the European group. “People do not reveal themselves totally but that is the trend,” he added. “I cannot imagine not supporting a country so near to us. Africa has only ever hosted one World Cup in all of FIFA’s history (in South Africa in 2010)—that is not a lot. Morocco is ready, even if it does not have some of the resources that it’s adversaries do. France is only one voice, but maybe it can inspire others to also support the Moroccan bid,” said the chief of FFF. France became the first European country to announce its support for Morocco 2026 in April. Former French President Francois Hollande  said during his visit to Morocco in April: “I have every confidence in this bid and France will be on your side.” Morocco asserted that the meeting with the UEFA associations was successful. Voting will take place tomorrow at the 68th FIFA Congress. “Excellent meeting this morning with the UEFA,” wrote member of the Moroccan bid committee Moncef Belkhayat on Twitter.

Rabat – Although the first vaporizer prototype was introduced in the 1960s, the cigarette alternative did not gain a widespread commercial following until the early 2000s, when Chinese inventor Hon Lik invented the modern e-cigarette. What so special about vaporizers? Variety of Vaporizers One important fact about vaporizers is that, unlike other smoking stuff, there are several different types of vaporizers in the market right now. They come in different shapes, sizes, colors, and flavors. They may look like the conventional type of smoking cigarettes, but in actual they are far different from them.

The user can smoke nicotine and marijuana with just one vaporizer, saving costs. Safety of Use Vaporizers are very safe for use as compared to any other type of smoking tool.

Vaporizers are completely different from other smoking tools because the high level of technology is used for making them. Their attractive designs, beautiful colors, and variety of functions are attracting every smoker all around the globe.  The use is quite simple and straightforward. The vaporizer is filled with the juice and then attached to the socket. As the coils inside of the vaporizer start to heat up, the juice converts into vapors.  Also, there is a LED light fixed at the front of the vaporizer that makes the person feel at home while smoking.  What does the law say about the use of vaporizers?  As the use of vaporizers or e-cigarettes is increasing with each passing day, all around the globe. The government and law enforcing bodies are also looking into the matter to decide upon the laws related to vaporizers.  In the past crackdowns in some major cities were observed, but now the use of vaporizers is completely legal. Even people have the license of using it rightfully in public, and also it is allowed that there could be vaporizer selling stores in a country.   Where to find vaporizer if you want one? You can find them everywhere, from supermarkets to the online stores. Before buying, obviously, search for the credible source.

Rabat – He wanted to go treasure hunting. A 30-year-old man has called the public to gather in the Atlas mountains, in Serghina near Ifrane on Monday, claiming that there is a hidden treasure. The treasure hunter claimed that he had a dream that there was wealth in the region, 30 kilometers east of Boulemane and 90 kilometers east of Ifrane. According to the man, an individual revealed to him that the value of the treasure was considerably higher than that of gold.    Several videos have been circulating on social media in which the man has asked a gathering of people to chant “Allah Akbar.” The individual promised to share all the wealth equitably to all those present and change their destiny, according to him. To give more credibility to his speech, the individual explained that “today, which is the 26th day of the month of Ramadan, the day of the sacred night, the evil demons are captured and it will be easy to extract the treasure.” However, he explained to the people who went to the mountains that it was up to him to go down with his family to extract the treasure. Then he tried to escape, but the crowd began to pursue him until the Royal Gendarmerie intervened and arrested him.

Rabat – The Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has decided who it will vote for on Wednesday’s 2026 World Cup host ballot in Moscow. Spain has not revealed its decision yet. However, it has recognized that choosing was not easy. “We made the decision… but it was not easy. With both candidates we unite close cultural ties and in some geographical ties, besides our Latin roots,” said President of the RFEF Luis Rubiales. The Spaniard made his remarks at the end of a meeting of the UEFA associations in Moscow. According to EFE, Rubiales said that RFEF will consider “only and exclusively the interests of Spain and the Spanish football.” The Spanish official also described both bids as “fabulous” despite their differences. Several European countries announced their support for Morocco 2026, including France, Serbia, Russia, Belgium and Luxembourg. Morocco’s bid committee took advantage of the proximity between the North African country and European countries as the gateway to Europe and Africa. Additionally, the flights between European countries and Morocco are much shorter than to North America, and the time zone proximity is also an argument that Morocco relies on to clinch more votes. In April,  President of the African Football Confederation (CAF) Ahmad Ahmad called on European football associations to vote for Morocco’s bid. The CAF chief told AFP that a Moroccan bid serves the interest of Europe. “Time zones, distance, fans, it is a question of interest for Europe.” He also noted that Europeans “do not need a visa” to travel to Morocco. “For all that, it is estimated that Europe must vote for Morocco,” Ahmad concluded. The vote to decide which bid will be given hosting rights of the 2026 World Cup will be held in Moscow during the 68th  FIFA Congress on Wednesday, June 13.

Rabat – The eve of the 2018 World Cup will be as important as the tournament itself. Wednesday, June 13, is the day when football associations will decide the future host of the 23rd FIFA World Cup in 2026. Only several hours remain until the world knows the 2026 World Cup host. Morocco is optimistic about being the second World Cup host in Africa after South Africa in 2010. According to the agenda of FIFA’s 68th Congress, the symposium will begin in Moscow at 9:00 a.m. Moscow time,  6:00 a.m in Morocco. However, the vote to designate the 2026 host association is the 13th agenda item on a long list of FIFA’s administrative activities, coming just before the two last actions: planning the next FIFA Congress in Paris and remarks from FIFA President Gianni Infantino. The Vote The bidding nations—Morocco and the three North Americans—cannot vote. Morocco will need to receive 104 votes to host the tournament. The North African country has at least 20 votes from several European and African countries in its pocket. But Morocco has more than a slim chance to win as 207 federations are set to vote. However, in case no bid secures enough votes to host the tournament, FIFA will launch a new bidding procedure by inviting all member football associations to submit a bid to host the 206 FIFA World Cup. The nations already bidding, however, cannot submit their files if they lose their chance on June 13. The question which will be addressed to the 207 associations is: “Do you want to award the right to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup final competition to the bid submitted by the Moroccan Football Association, to the joint bid submitted by the CSA, FEMEXFUT and the USSF (“United Bid”), or to none of them (thus reopening the bidding process, excluding the four-member associations having already submitted a bid)?”  The result of the ballot will be published by FIFA.com after the conclusion of the Congress. If none of the bids received a simple majority of the vote, the bids will be rejected, which will allow FIFA to open a new procedure to receive new bids. Flashbacks The fierce competition between the two bids will end tomorrow after a long round of speculations and predictions. Before announcing their eligibility to go to the ballot, FIFA established an unprecedented process, the “task force” evaluation of the bids. Ahead of its assessments, some feared the task force would disqualify the Moroccan bid before the vote due to its lack of infrastructure and stadiums.  The Moroccan bid, however, received a score of 2.7 out of 5, passing the 2.0 cut-off. The high score received by the United 2026, however, is not a matter of concern for Morocco. According to the Moroccan bid committee, a FIFA World Cup is meant to serve countries which seek more development. Morocco announced its decision to host the tournament in August 2017. Morocco submitted its bid book in the first week of March 2018. FIFA unveiled the 2026 World Cup bid books on March 26. Morocco’s bid book touted the importance of football in Africa and Morocco and explained its readiness for the event. The file says that the country will offer football fans and footballers an unprecedented experience. The bid book also underscored the importance of stability in the country and the time zone and location of Morocco, which will guarantee commercial success with ideal live-broadcasting times.

Rabat – Iran’s best scorer, Mehdi Taremi, may miss his first World Cup game against Morocco, Friday June 15, on the second day of the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Al Gharafa’s striker is considered as one of the best assets of the Iranian team. The football player was injured in Iran’s last friendly game against Lithuania on June 8, according to the Iranian federation. Since his injury, the 25-year-old footballer has not joined in any training with his teammates and Portuguese coach Carlos Queiroz. If his condition does not improve, Queiroz is seriously thinking of replacing him with Reza Ghoochannejhad, the striker of SC Heerenveen.

Rabat – To perpetuate the tradition of Spanish diplomacy, Morocco will be the first country that the new prime minister of Spain, Pedro Sànchez, will visit since his election on June 2. According to several Spanish outlets, Madrid is already working with Rabat to find an ideal date for a meeting between the Spanish Prime Minister and his Moroccan counterpart Saad Eddine El Othmani. “It is Ramadan now in Morocco and with the king travelling to the US, it may not be the best time, but we want to maintain the tradition for Morocco to be the first country to officially be visited by the president,” explained a close member to El Espanol. The visit will probably take place after the return of King Felipe and his wife Letizia from the United States, where they will meet Donald Trump later this month, or after the European summit in Brussels June 28 and 29 where Sànchez must be present. Some diplomatic sources regret that Sànchez does not innovate this year, saying that Morocco should not be the first international stop of the prime minister. However, relations with the neighboring country are essential for key issues such as the fight against terrorism or the control of migratory flows, areas in which both governments have collaborated successfully for years. In previous years, Felipe González, José María Aznar, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, and Mariano Rajoy traveled to the kingdom on their first official visit as heads of government.

Rabat – The European Commission announced today that the College of Commissioners adopted the proposal which includes Western Sahara in the Morocco-European Union agricultural agreement. An unidentified  European source told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP)  that this forms an “important step that has been taken since the beginning of negotiations for the adaptation of the agriculture agreement to the decision of the EU Court of Justice.” The source confirmed that products from Western Sahara will be included in the agreement without any hindrance. The source, quoted by MAP, said that the consultations between the concerned parties resulted in an agreement to include products from Western Sahara in the EU-Morocco deal, due to the socio-economic benefits to the region’s population and economy. At the end of the College of Commissioners meeting, the European Commission said that the approved documents will be sent to the EU Council and the European Parliament for adoption. The EU Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled on December 21, 2016, that the agreement between EU and Morocco, signed in 2012, on the mutual liberalization of the trade of agricultural and fishing products did not apply to the territory of Western Sahara. Representatives are still negotiating the new fisheries deal to include the waters of the Western Sahara. In February 2018, the ECJ decided that the EU and Morocco deal “is valid in so far as it is not applicable to Western Sahara and to its adjacent waters.” However, Morocco contested the ruling, saying it would never accept an agreement without the inclusion of Western Sahara. Morocco also stressed that it “will not hesitate to abandon the Fisheries Agreement if it affects the sovereignty of Morocco over its southern provinces.” Arguing the verdict of the ECJ, the European Commission introduced in March a proposal for the renewal of the fisheries deal with Morocco with a mandate for the inclusion of the Western Sahara. In its March statement, the EU Commission said that the goal is to maintain and develop the fisheries partnership between the EU and Morocco, “by concluding an agreement and protocol that are environmentally sustainable, economically, profitable and fully in line with international and EU law.”

By Chase Lacy Rabat – Tonight is a special night for Morocco and a majority of the Muslim world. Muslims will come out in droves to celebrate Laylat al-Qadr (Night of the Decree), one of the holiest days during Ramadan. The tradition dates back to when the Prophet Muhammad would spend a month in solitude, performing prayer and fasting at the Cave at Hira in Mecca. On that day the Angel Gabriel revealed the first verse of the Quran, Al-Alaq (Quran 96:1-5). Although there is debate regarding the exact date of Laylat al-Qadr, there is a relative consensus on the 27th day of Ramadan. There is an atmospheric electricity that stimulates the spirit on a night that bears fruit to the perfection of God’s love and forgiveness for the individual’s sins. Children who have not reached puberty are not required to participate in the fast for Ramadan. However, during Laylat al-Qadr, children will fast for the very first time. The f’tour on this night especially has bounties of food and sweets for everyone’s enjoyment. Girls go to a negafa (stylist) who will dress them up with makeup, traditional clothing of the finest quality, and gold adornments. Boys will typically dress in a djellaba (Moroccan tuni), crown their heads with a fez, and wear a special shoe called balgha. The style of dress that children wear during Laylat al-Qadr are similar to what brides and grooms wear for a wedding. Families will often take their children to photo booths to commemorate the special day and give them presents. Adults will put henna on girls’ hands, and they will be paraded in an ammaria, a special sedan chair. Both boys and girls, accompanied by their parents, will ride horses as well. One witnesses vivid colors while the ears reverberate with the sounds of drums and joyful shrills.  Parents express how proud they are of their children. For both girls and boys, Laylat al-Qadr is seen as an important milestone in their lives.

Rabat – Recent allegations by British lawyer Rodney Dickson have brought the controversial Taoufik Bouachrine affair back to the public’s attention, after it was gradually fading from interest. Bouachrine, a Moroccan journalist, was arrested in March 2018 on charges of rape, human trafficking, and other behaviors related to sexual misconduct. Fifteen women, all of them workers or former colleagues, accused the journalist. If some observers saw in the arrest of the prolific journalist the possibility of a Moroccan “Me too” movement and the emergence of courageous voices to challenge patriarchal practices, such as sexual misconduct said to be pervasive in Moroccan workplaces, others thought it was a defamatory campaign to tarnish the reputation of a dissident and truth-telling investigative journalist. In his latest public statement, British lawyer Rodney Dickson, international legal advisor to the defendant, appealed to the international community to intervene in Morocco’s alleged disregard for his client’s most basic rights. Dickson’s statements accused the Moroccan judiciary system of carrying out the desire of “some powerful people” in high offices who are nervous about Taoufik Bouachrine’s reputation for objective journalism. Explaining that his client had been “framed,” the lawyer submitted “urgent correspondence to the UN,”pleading for them to intervene and “end this arbitrary arrest based on fabricated evidence” and “unfounded charges.” However, a judiciary source closely following the case said such comments are “surprising and shocking” as they come from a lawyer  who should know how an “ordinary criminal case” works. Dickson’s “urgent correspondence” may have raised doubts among many now entertaining the thought that Bouachrine is perhaps a victim of his critical comments about some government officials. Aware of this, the source sent Morocco World News a “detailed account of the due process regarding criminal arrest in Moroccan law” to “show that Moroccan authorities have never violated Bouachrine’s rights.” All legal procedures were diligently followed From Bouachrine’s arrest to his ongoing trial, everything has been done in diligent regard of Morocco’s legal procedures and “total respect of international conventions on human rights.” “The statement is surprising and full of inaccuracies and lies,” the source continued, as he argued that the lawyer’s only concern is to undermine Morocco’s improving records of human rights and respect for rule of law. And in addition to “offending Morocco’s positive achievements and gains” in the legal field, Dickson’s latest position also “offends his client who, as a Moroccan national, should be proud of his country’s national institutions and judiciary system,” especially the attainment of judicial independence since the 2011 constitution. The source insisted that Morocco’s judiciary is independent now, and only those who believe themselves above the law can question the legality of a procedure that has done its best to respect judicial provisions pertaining to the “serious charges of rape, violence, and human trafficking” levied against Taoufik Bouachrine. “This affair was carried out on the basis of a judicial order made in accordance with the constitutional regulations stipulated by law, and in full respect of international law and human rights instruments ratified by the Kingdom of Morocco, and which are an integral part of the Moroccan legal system.”. Play to affect the court’s decision The judicial source is emphatically dismissive of reports of fabricated charges and evidence “concocted by powerful people trying to silence Taoufik.”He explained that those thinking it was a conspiracy orchestrated by “some powerful people” have been affected by the defense’s resort to painting the country’s legal authorities as having ulterior motives. Taoufik Bouacrhine’s legal team are putting together a “transparent ploy whose sole purpose is to influence the course of the ongoing trial against him [Bouachrine] and the decisions of the judiciary that is considering his case,” the source further argued. The Casablanca Bar has validated the authenticity of part of the evidence regarding many of the heavy charges facing Bouachrine, denouncing the “rabid behavior” of many of the defendants. For this, the source remained convinced that the video and audio recordings presented as evidence are authentic, “reliable and credible.” “Media propaganda” He also said that many of the female journalists who are Bouachrine’s presumed victims attested to sexual exploitation and other “criminal acts” in their hearings. Rather than a place of free speech and objective journalism, Bouachrine’s office was “a place to enslave female workers.” Maintaining that all of Bouachrine’s rights have been respected and “guaranteed throughout the ongoing fair, equitable, and impartial trial,” the source said that a British lawyer with “obviously no knowledge of Morocco’s legal procedures and criminal law” does not have the right to show such a blatantly condescending tone towards Moroccan justice. “This is a media propaganda and a helpless attempt to internationalize an ordinary criminal case by a legal advisor who promotes false and escapist claims,” he concluded.

Rabat- “Laylat Al Qadr is a night better than a thousand months,” reads verse 37:3 of the Qur’anic Surah, Al-Qadr. If Laylat Al Qadr (Night of Decree or Destiny) falls in Ramadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, why is it better than a thousand months? Laylat Al Qadr holds great significance in Islam and the Surah Al-Qadr is named after it, referring to the night on one of the last ten days in Ramadan when the holy Qur’an was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The very first verses of the Quran were sent down to the prophet on Laylat Al Qadr; therefore virtuous deeds and prayers on this night are worth more than a thousand months or a lifetime of worship, making it the most auspicious in Ramadan and the whole year. Although the exact date of the night was not mentioned in the Qur’an, Muslims across the world traditionally commemorate it on the 27th night of Ramadan, except for Shia Muslims, who celebrate it on the 23rd night. Since Laylat Al Qadr’s exact day is not marked, some Muslims pray zealously throughout those days, following the prophet’s saying in Hadith (reports of the prophet’s sayings and actions): “Seek out Laylat al-Qadr in the odd nights during the last ten nights of Ramadan,” according to Al Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. According to the Qur’an, during the night of destiny, heaven’s gates are destined to open for the forgiveness of all sins that Muslims committed previously: “The night of decree is better than a thousand months, the angels and the Spirit descend therein by permission of their Lord for every matter. Peace it is until the emergence of dawn.” Worshippers stay awake until dawn, reading from the Qur’an, praising God, and performing voluntary prayers, as the prophet (PBUH) used to spend it in worship: “During the last ten nights of Ramadan, the Prophet (peace be upon him) would tighten his waist belt and spend the night in worship. He would also wake up his family,” narrated by Al Bukhari. Laylat Al Qadr is an opportunity for Muslim believers to put aside mundane indulgences and concerns and instead indulge their way to spiritual meditation and approach God through not only prayer but also good deeds, which are also a form of worship. Muslims this Ramadan will honor Laylat Al Qadr on Monday, June 11. During the special night, most families in Morocco give sadaqa (voluntary charity) to mosques and the poor and get together after taraweeh Ramadan prayers following isha (night-time daily prayer) for dinner. Especially in the Draa-Tafilalet regions, families serve couscous or barbecued meat. Moroccan Muslim families also celebrate their children’s first day of fasting, traditionally reserved for Laylat Al Qadr.Young people who haven’t reached puberty yet do not fast in Ramadan.

Rabat – Following the publication of the FIFA task force’s final evaluation of the preparedness of the two bids in competition to host the 2026 World Cup, FIFA president Gianni Infantino took upon himself the critical task of reassuring voters and the bids’ representatives of FIFA’s ethical standards throughout the whole voting process. “FIFA will have no problems with a Moroccan World Cup,” Infantino said last week in an interview, despite reports that he had been trying to undermine Morocco’s bid. But the undertone of Infantino’s remark suggested—unsurprisingly—something else altogether: fully aware that vitriolic comments have made the rounds in recent months about his alleged “dirty plot” to disqualify Morocco 2026, the FIFA president clearly wanted to take a final opportunity to distance himself from partisanship. As the president of football’s supreme governing body, Infantino seemed to argue his only mandate is to enforce the game’s cardinal rule of fair play: inclusiveness, fairness, objectivity, neutrality, and honesty. For all their importance for FIFA’s survival, money and big business interests do not and should not constitute the most essential components of football, to keep the game safe from the lure of hyper-capitalistic post-modern sports. The North American trio is FIFA’s preference But Infantino’s FIFA had already let Moroccan fans down. They did not understand the task force’s ambivalent theatre when it visited Morocco, changing its plans and making last minute readjustments without informing Moroccan authorities beforehand. Moroccans never understood why Infantino urged Morocco 2026’s supporters to abstain from subjective public comments, and yet he himself kept saying in interviews that the United bid would bring higher financial returns than any other host before, and that FIFA’s coffers are in dire need of such funding. They were outraged when FIFA singly bullied and lectured Morocco’s bid under the guise of “objectivity instructions,” explaining attitudes they must have during the entirety of the bidding, campaigning, and voting process. And how could anyone explain the fact that the FIFA 2026 television rights went to US-based media corporations without being put out to tender? So for Moroccan fans, there already was a discernible Americanophile pattern in Infantino’s previous comments, which is why last week’s words were no music at all to the ears of Morocco 2026 supporters. Morocco’s merits are underrated “The cost of organizing the event of the World Cup is well supported by Moroccan government, and there is no question about that,” a source in the inner circle of the Morocco 2026 team, who requested anonymity, told Morocco World News by email.  Suggesting that Infantino’s claims that Morocco 2026 would be far more costly to FIFA is somewhat exaggerated. The source explained how Morocco has made considerable headway in its infrastructure, with a “high speed train that will connect three major host cities like Tangier, Rabat, and Casablanca in a very short time.” “The FIFA president and his task force should know that Morocco is a welcoming country. Morocco has passed the task force’s examination. It is now up to voters to make their honest decision without any outside pressure,” the source concluded, hinting at a slight bias in Infantino’s appeal last week to national federations not to base their votes on “subjective criteria.” Victory for Morocco 2026 Others just cannot understand why the US and Canada are intent on organizing an event which the majority of their populations have no interest in. “They even annoyingly call the beautiful game ‘soccer,’ ” Hassan told Morocco World News this weekend as he nonchalantly sipped at his Moroccan tea in Campus Café in the Al Irfane neighborhood in Rabat, watching Brazil crush Austria 3-0 in their final pre-World Cup warm up. That was after Morocco hammered Estonia with an impressive 3-1 win. “This summer, I will support Morocco, other African teams, and Brazil,” he added, pausing for emphasis with the theatrical look that football fans like to wear when discussing their favorite teams and players. “These are the places that play and live football. These are places where football is a vibrant culture impacting and changing so many lives. Does FIFA really think that many Americans care about football? I wish people voting this summer could understand that we need and value the World Cup more than the US. “They should for once give us the opportunity to show the world what we can offer. The excitement and love we can bring to this tournament will be magical and much more memorable than a match somewhere in Canada or in an NBA and NFA fans-packed stadium in America, no matter how huge the stadium or how impressive the infrastructure.” Asked about Infantino’s neutrality and objectivity comments ahead of the Wednesday vote at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow, Hassan calmly replied: “He really said that? Well, that’s finally nice of him. But we really don’t need that now. The damage his previous comments and pro-America position inflicted on us is big enough already. That cannot just miraculously evaporate with a well-meaning statement that should have come much earlier. Infantino should have known better than this.” Amine Messaoudi, a passionate Liverpool and Casablanca Wydad fan, is even more unapologetic about his love and support for a Moroccan World Cup. “This is a national cause,” he says. “I’m well aware of the power and resources of the US. And I honestly think that it will be really hard to beat a bid that has the US with it. But this is Morocco. And does America really need to host a World Cup? First, we will win this 2018 World Cup, and then in 2026 we’ll organize one of the best tournaments ever.” Sensing the disbelief and the shocking but friendly and supportive reaction that his 2018 World Cup comments caused, he said: “Why not? Are we not allowed to dream of triumph? What is the point of joining a contest if you do not think you can win it?”

Rabat – Head of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) Fouzi Lekjaa  believes that after Morocco’s four failed attempts to win hosting rights for the World Cup, it is “legitimate for Africa to host the competition for the second time in history.” The chief of the Moroccan football association shared his opinion in an interview with Maghreb TV regarding Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. “Everyone knows that Morocco is applying on behalf of the continent,” Lekjaa said. Touting Morocco’s assets, Lekjaa mentioned Morocco’s stability in a region that has experienced several crises. “The stability offers a lot of visibility and allows you to move forward.” He also saluted Morocco’s geographical position, recalling that the 12 cities selected to host the games are within a 550-kilometer radius from Casablanca. “We promise a real football party, an opportunity to advance in a noble civilization process, one of the peculiarities of football,” he said. The president of the football federation also touted the significance of football and how Moroccans are passionate about the game. Lekjaa also discussed Morocco’s goal and how the World Cup will develop the country. “Organizing the World Cup will allow us to achieve several goals, including improving health, sports, and football infrastructure,” said Lekjaa. The vote will be held at FIFA’s 68th Congress on Wednesday in Moscow. The congress will allow football federations from around the globe to choose the bid that will best host the tournament. Morocco’s bid committee landed in many countries to introduce its bid in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.

El Othmani described the relationship between Morocco and Nigeria as “historic.”  The head of government said that these relations cover cooperation at all levels, including politics, religion, agriculture, and industry.

Rabat – Morocco has some valuable players. The national team is the 21st most expensive team out of the 32 that will compete in the 2018 World Cup, according to the International Center for Sports Studies (CIES) Football Observatory. It is actually the attacking midfielder Amine Harit, who plays in the German club Schalke 04, who costs the most in the national team, representing 18% of the estimated value of the Atlas Lions, with EUR 138 million. CIES estimated ranking according to players’ transfer value. “The sports performances of both players and their home clubs are included in the algorithm.

At the bottom of the rankings are three non-European countries with very few players employed in the most competitive leagues:  Iran (30), Saudi Arabia (31) and Panama (32). As for the top countries, France came first, estimated at EUR 1.141 billion, thanks to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) striker, Kylian Mbappé. Mbappé’s cost alone constitutes 13% of the total value of the team. England follows very closely with an estimated value of EUR 1.39 billion. Third place went to the Brazilians led by Neymar, who alone accounts for 15% of the team’s value, estimated at EUR 1.27 billion. Morocco’s rival Spain takes the fourth spot with Atletico’s Madrid player Saul Niguez worth EUR 965 million. Argentina’s Lionel Messi ranks 5th with EUR 925 million, and Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo 8th with EUR 656 million. “The transfer value of all the players who will take part in the World Cup is EUR 12.6 billion,” explains the statement.

Rabat – Libya has officially announced its decision to back Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid in the countdown to Wednesday’s poll to choose the 2026 host. President of the Libyan Football Federation Jamal Al-Jaafari will represent Libya during the FIFA vote. To date, more than 17 countries have pledged support for Morocco 2026, including France, Botswana, Qatar, Russia and Serbia. On June 10, CGTN aired a video of a press report showcasing the African nations which “ignored” US President Donald Trump’s threat to the countries that vote for Morocco 2026. The press report interviewed the presidents of the football associations of Niger, Uganda, and Kenya. All chairmen of the football federations mentioned in the report agreed on one point: supporting the Moroccan bid for Africa, according to Libya Observer. “When an African country is competing [against] another country from another continent, it becomes self-evident that African nations will support this destination. Niger is very interested in Morocco’s bid, ” said Issa Yanfore, Deputy Secretary-General of Nigerien Football Federation. Morocco’s bid is a “bid from Africa,” he said. Moses Magogo, President of Uganda’s Football Association also commended Morocco’s bid, emphasizing that Morocco has the ability to host the tournament. He said of Morocco “they speak football.” “The King loves and respect football. I believe that they have the capacities and I believe that they will put up a World Cup better than South Africa.” However, Uganda has not yet supported the Moroccan bid officially. Mogogo told Uganda Radio in May that he “personally” support the Moroccan bid, but he is not the sole decision maker, saying the federation will meet “as an executive and make the final decision on who to vote for.” Mogogo added that he believes the continent is ready to host the second African World Cup after South Africa hosted in 2010. President of the Football Kenya Federation Nick Mwendwa said “why not” have a World Cup “in Africa.”  In response to Trump’s threatening message, Lamin Kaba Bajo, President of the Gambia Football Federation,  said: “We are not scared to say that we are fully behind the Moroccan bid.”

By: Karen Duarte  Rabat – Currently, more than 50 African voting federations are being urged to show unity as a continent and back Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup. Below is the latest on World Cup preparations and meetings of football leaders ahead of the tournament in Russia today (all Morocco local times):  9:10 a.m. According to American television channel Fox Sports, El Hadji Diouf, the former Senegal and Liverpool forward, urged African football leaders to “hold hands” on June 13 when Morocco competes with the North American bid. Liberia, Namibia, and Zimbabwe have pledged support in recent weeks for the joint United States-Canada-Mexico candidate. The North Americans have targeted voters in the southern African group known as COSAFA. Confederation of African Football President Ahmad asked voters to “show cohesion within our continent.” The Madagascar official says, “I think there is an obligation to remain within our family. But of course, it is an individual choice.” The Morocco and North American bid leaders are meeting voters from five of FIFA’s six continental bodies today. The bid leaders will meet Europe’s UEFA on Tuesday. 8:40 a.m. Morocco football leader Fouzi Lekjaa says he doubts the financial promises made by the rival North American bid to host the 2026 World Cup. Lekjaa told more than 50 African football federations that “there is lots of uncertainty” in the cash projections of the joint United States-Canada-Mexico bid According to Fox Sports, the North American bid predicts $14.3 billion in revenue for FIFA from the 48-team tournament. FIFA’s evaluation panel noted that was “significantly higher” than Morocco’s predicted income of $7.2 billion. Lekjaa says in French, “That doesn’t correspond either to historical facts or future extrapolation; it’s an exercise that goes beyond that.” African countries have 53 of the 206 expected votes in Wednesday’s ballot of FIFA member federations. 7:50 a.m. Under investigation in Ghana for alleged corruption, FIFA Council member Kwesi Nyantakyi has resigned from the world soccer body. Confederation of African Football president Ahmad says Nyantakyi also offered his resignation as first vice president of the continental body. Ahmad tells more than 50 African football federations that a special election meeting will be held on September 30 in Egypt for them to fill the vacancies. Candidates will come from the English-speaking group in Confederation of African Football (CAF), the president says. A television documentary last week showed Nyantakyi taking $65,000 in cash from undercover reporters posing as businessmen to secure favor with Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo and other government officials. FIFA’s ethics committee suspended the Ghanaian official for 90 days during its investigation. 7:25 a.m. Leaders of North American and Moroccan bids to host the 2026 World Cup are casting their plans to FIFA voters. Both candidates on Wednesday’s vote are spending Monday on a busy tour of meetings with continental football bodies. FIFA president Gianni Infantino and Secretary General Fatma Samoura are also attending. More than 50 African football federations are hearing from the bidders at a Moscow hotel. A few federations, including Liberia, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, have pledged to support the  joint United States-Canada-Mexico candidacy instead of their CAF ally Morocco. Voters from North American regional body CONCACAF, Asia, and Oceania also have their regional meetings Monday, ahead of the election Wednesday. European football body UEFA hosts the candidates Tuesday morning in Moscow.

Rabat- Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (Pegida) disrespected Muslims during Ramadan. The anti-Islam movement recently roasted pigs in front of Laleli mosque in Holland’s Rotterdam city at the time of breaking fast. Pegida took advantage of Islam’s restriction on the consumption of pork, as it is regarded as “impure,” to provoke Muslims not only in the Dutch province but worldwide. Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Omer Celik strongly condemned the act, severely criticizing Rotterdam’s mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb, especially because he a Moroccan Muslim, calling his decision to grant permission for the action “immoral.” This is so far the most immoral attempt ever in the history of hate crimes. Granting legal permission to such an immoral activity is also another deficiency of morality. — Ömer Çelik (@omerrcelik) June 6, 2018   Mr Abutalib, from a Muslim family, says that organizing a demonstration is a fundamental legal right. Since when disrespect to mosques has become legal right? Any disrespect to mosques, churches, synagogues is a hate crime. There cannot be any law which would allow hate crime — Ömer Çelik (@omerrcelik) June 6, 2018  Other municipalities in the Netherlands did not allow Pegida to roast pigs in front of mosques at the fast-breaking time. However, Ahmet Abutalib, Mayor of Rotterdam, who is of Moroccan origin, thinks that this activity of Pegida is not against the law. Such a gross tragedy! — Ömer Çelik (@omerrcelik) June 6, 2018  Celik compared Aboutaleb with other mayors such as the Hague’s mayor, Pauline Krikke, who banned Pegida’s barbeque party at the As-Soennah mosque in the city.  Turkish Muslim organizations in Rotterdam lay flowers around the mosque as a symbol of peace against hate crimes.  Celik stated on his Twitter account prior to the peace demonstrations that “flowers against the odour of hate” would be “a true lesson of humanity.” Turkish and Muslim organisations in Rotterdam will hold an activity at the same hour to lay flowers around the mosque and will erect a wall of love with flowers against the odour of hate. This is a true lesson of humanity. — Ömer Çelik (@omerrcelik) June 6, 2018  Rotterdam newspaper Algemeen Dagblad reported that Pegida had planned to roast the pigs in front of various mosques in the Netherlands, in Arnhem, Gouda, Utrecht, and the Hague, and Rotterdam during the Ramadan iftar (the breaking fast time) until the evening prayer.  Earlier in June, Pegida shared a series of posts on Facebook, encouraging its followers to participate in the notorious barbeque in front of many mosques.  One post reads: “We have good surprises for mosque Utrecht…behold!”

“The barbecues will start every evening at 8:30 p.m. Anyone who brings their own plate and cutlery and a good anti-Islam mood is welcome,” a previous post read, according to Netherlands news outlet NL Times.

Rabat – Hervé Renard has a back-up plan. Nabil Dirar has not recovered yet from his injury. The Atlas Lion who missed Morocco’s friendly games against Slovakia and Estonia has been suffering from a knee injury for several weeks. According to AFP, the Moroccan football player, who landed yesterday in Russia with his teammates, may miss the World Cup games. Hervé Renard has already taken precautions for Dirar’s possible absence. He appealed to Amiens defender Oualid El Hajjam to replace the Fenerbahçe player if his condition does not improve. El Hajjam, 27, made his debut with Morocco in a friendly game against Uzbekistan (2-0) in March. A reservist, he is, however, not one of the 23 players retained by Hervé Renard for the World Cup. The Moroccan national football team arrived in Russia on Sunday morning to begin the final round of training for the 2018 World Cup, which will kick off on June 14. The Atlas Lions’ airplane took off from Tallinn after their final pre-World Cup friendly game against Estonia. They will now start their training sessions. Morocco, whoich is returning to the World Cup for the first time since 1998, has been placed in Group B of the World Cup. The national team  will face Iran on June 15, Portugal on June 20, and Spain on June 25.

Rabat – With the vote scheduled in three days, the heart rates increase with the emotions of winning or losing. Speculations and rumours are rife. Vote promises and words were given, but all will become clear on June 13, when 207 football associations will vote for the host of the FIFA World Cup 2026. United 2026, the joint bid of North America, is expected to receive a lot of support as the US pressured countries and President Trump threatened to withhold aid from countries supporting Morocco. The North African bid, however, is resisting pressure and standing strong to achieve its “together for one goal” aim. Last week, the New York Times posted a vote tracker, showing countries that pledged support to either bid as well as uncommitted nations. The tracker shows United 2026 in the lead, with 23 countries committed to the North American bid against 17 for Morocco. Most committed countries to United 2026 are from the Americas, including Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and Argentina. However, there are a few outsiders that showed support for United 2026 to protect their interests, including Saudi Arabia, Liberia, Zimbabwe, and Afghanistan. Surprisingly, the tracker showed South Africa in the list of countries leaning toward Morocco. South Africa, however, has politicized the competition, emphasizing that supporting the North African bid is not part of its political agenda. The New York Times also listed several countries, which have already expressed support for Morocco 2026, in the list of “leaning toward Morocco.” The list includes: Botswana, Saint Lucia, Tunisia, and Nigeria. Promise made, promise not kept? Counting on Africa to vote for Africa is an obvious feeling for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup committee. The country has also claimed that a World Cup in Morocco will also feed the interests of European countries, owing to the proximity between the continents and potential investment. Nevertheless, several African countries shunned Morocco, including Namibia and South Africa, backing their decisions with politics. While there is hope that some of the 54 African football federations set to vote on June 13 will vote for Morocco, the North African bid is not excluding the possibility to see African nations following the path of Namibia, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Liberia. “Even if Africa has always acted in unity, unity does not mean 100% of all the member associations, this is part of the democratic process,” CEO of Morocco’s bid committee Hicham El Amrani told BBC. African development or US aid? Morocco’s 2026 World Cup dossier is considering the World Cup as a catalyst for more development to improve the sporting climate and leverage resources for economic growth. The country has pledged billions of dirhams to prepare for the tournament, in terms of infrastructure, rails, and stadiums. The country also accepted FIFA’s new regulation to expand the tournament from 32 to 48 teams, announcing its plans to expand and rebuild its stadiums to stage games that meet international standards. However, it remains to be seen whether Morocco’s efforts and promises to improve Africa’s football better will be cherished at the FIFA vote. Cameroon, Algeria, and Seychelles have pledged to support Morocco, but many countries have not spoken yet. The infamous tweet of US President Donald Trump might influence more African countries which receive US aid. Trump warned that “it would be a shame if countries we always support were to lobby against the US bid.” A passion for football  In Morocco, football is more than just a sport. Morocco’s passion for football is plain to see when Barcelona and Real Madrid fans meet at cafes featuring the game, or when the Atlas Lions win an important match. Before the end of the game, fans storm streets to express pride of belonging and victory. Supporters of local teams, even children, can tell you about the history of their teams, when they won their first cup and who scored the best goal throughout the history of their football club. Morocco’s bid committee was not mistaken when it described Morocco as a land of football where the game’s passion “runs through every vein”. Many Moroccans would agree with the Moroccan football team’s assistant coach and former international footballer Mustapha Hadji, who said football is Morocco’s “second religion after Islam.” He added in an interview given to the Guardian in 2017 that only football fans can explain how exciting it is to support their favorite football teams. “Football is magic. It can do things that no other sport can,” Hadji told the Guardian. “It can make you cry in one second and make you feel in love the next. Politics cannot do that.” In every Moroccan house, you will find two siblings supporting the same team or supporting different ones and challenging each other to prove to the other that his/ her team is the best. In every house in Morocco, you will find a mother who has never watched a game of football before,  but is always supportive when the Atlas Lions are playing a game. Morocco is indeed a home of football.

Rabat – Head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) Abdelhak Khiame has spoken about his concerns on the alleged Polisario-Hezbollah collusion and the alarming situation in the Sahel. In the second part of his interview with Le Site Info, Khiame said that the collusion between Polisario and Hezbollah is proven despite the continuous denials of Iran and Algeria. According to Khiame, Hezbollah took advantage of the situation in the region, which has experienced drug trafficking, terrorism, and human trafficking for decades. During the interview, Khiame was asked if Hezbollah helped Polisario due to Morocco’s decision to arrest top Hezbollah financier Kassim Tajideen in 2017. Khiame answered “No one can intimidate or prevent us from enforcing the law. If this was Hezbollah’s reaction to Morocco’s decision then it is their business.” Khiame also recalled that both Polisario and Hezbollah are terrorist groups, which aim to undermine the security of the region. He added that it is impossible for anyone to influence Morocco’s decisions or undermine its sovereignty. The BCIJ chief said Morocco is ready to deter any escalation or move to threaten its internal security. Speaking on the consequences of the lack of cooperation between Morocco and Algeria, Khiame denounced the alarming situation in the Sahel and Libya. According to Khiame, many gangs and criminal networks consider the Sahel region a safe zone for terror cells. Terrorists, according to Khiame, were able to bring firearms from Libya to Morocco through Algeria because of Algeria’s lack of cooperation. Khiame also discussed the overlap between terrorist groups and drug trafficking criminals due to poverty. In a similar statement, Khiame told Le Reporter in April that illegal activities serve as a means of escaping poverty for many separatists living in the Tindouf camps in southern Algeria. Khiame also said that cooperation and exchanging information may save the region from terrorist groups. On May 1, Morocco cut diplomatic ties with Iran and accused its ally Hezbollah of delivering military equipment to and training the members of the Polisario Front in the Tindouf camps, Algeria. Algeria, Hezbollah, and Polisario denied this collusion, with Iran claiming that Morocco has never presented evidence to prove this collusion. Commenting on this denial, Khiame told Le Site Info that Morocco would not make up something like this, adding that the country has all the proof to demonstrate collusion.

Rabat – Algerian journalist Lila Haddad has recorded a new video to slam Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and his brother, and advisor Said Bouteflika. In a five-minute video, Haddad acidly criticized the regime.“Mr. Bouteflika, good morning. I am Leila Haddad and I am speaking to you on my own behalf. Life taught me that daring is the shortest way to reach the truth, and the message I sent you last week was the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.” She continued: “I had asked your brother Said to show compassion and to release you. A feeling tells me that you wish to withdraw and that you are waiting for a favorable moment.” Slamming the Algerian regime, Haddad said that “reality is an intense darkness for Algerian people because of a group of criminals who became decision-makers after your illness,” referring to Bouteflika’s debilitating stroke in 2013.  In a similar video recorded  at the European Parliament’s studio in Brussels earlier this month, Haddad described Bouteflika as a “heap of flesh.” The former correspondent for the Algerian television channel ENTV also accused Bouteflika’s brother of “thinking that he is the only one who is entitled to dispose of him.” “The dignity of an entire people is scorned (…) Algerians have become the laughing stock of the world. Their dignity has succumbed to their own humanity to form a mountain of shame,” she had said. The Algerian embassy in Brussels denounced the statements, saying that the journalist was dismissed from Algerian television channel ENTV because of her “incivism” (lack of patriotism) and “bipolar behavior.” The embassy also labeled Haddad as a “pseudo journalist” who “attacked  the honor and dignity of the institutions of the Algerian Republic.”

Rabat – The Royal Marine rescued 472 undocumented migrants Friday night, according to a statement from the Royal Armed Forces (FAR). The list of migrants includes 28 women and 27 teenagers and 3 children, but most were men. “All the migrants and the nautical means used were brought back safely,” the statement added. The statement did not mention the migrants’ nationalities. The 472 passengers are among the latest in a growing number of men, women and children making the risky sea journey in hopes of reaching Europe. Earlier this month, at least 35 migrants, including Moroccans, were killed after a boat capsized off Tunisia’s southern coast. Tunisian coastguards managed to rescue 67 others, including two Moroccans. Thousands of migrants die every year in attempts to cross the Mediterranean for Europe. The precarious sea voyage claimed the lives of 90 migrants in February after a migrant boat capsized off the Libyan coast near the city of Zuara. Libya has become the home of thousands of migrants, including Moroccans, stranded in detention centers after failed attempts to cross the Mediterranean.  Tripoli’s Illegal Immigration Agency announced on June 5 that the repatriation of undocumented Moroccan migrants trapped in Libya has started, with an operation to bring back home 14 Moroccan nationals. The agency added that the operation will be carried out via daily flights to Morocco. In May, 60 undocumented Moroccan migrants began a hunger strike to protest delays in their repatriation to Morocco. The number of irregular migrants in Libya reached 700,000 by the end of 2017.

Rabat – Minister of Governance and General Affairs Lahcen Daoudi has finally spoken about what pushed him to submit his resignation request after he joined a sit-in against the major boycott campaign on June 5. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Daoudi said that he decided to resign from the government to reduce the damage to his party, the Justice and Development Party (PJD). He explained his “unplanned” participation in the sit-in in front of Parliament, saying that the sit-in coincided with his arrival in the Parliament for a parliamentary committee meeting. He added that he participated for fear that a crowd of protesters would surround him. The sit-in was organized by employees of Centrale Danone, which has been under boycott by Moroccan consumers since April 20. Danone fired many of its employees due to the effects of the boycott.   In his interview, which was published Saturday, Daoudi recognized that he may have made a “hasty decision.” The minister, who angered boycotters, added that his participation was to defend employees rather than Centrale Danone. Since the sit-in last Tuesday, the PJD released a series of statements denouncing Daoudi’s participation in the sit-in. In the first statement released Wednesday night after an extraordinary meeting, the party considered the action “unreasonable” and “inappropriate.” The party has also appreciated Daoudi’s decision to resign from the government. On June 8, the party released another statement, denying it had received a resignation request from Daoudi. The statement notes that it learned about his intention to resign and “hailed his courageous decision,” but never received his resignation request. Since the launch of the boycott on April 20, Daoudi has angered boycotters by defending Centrale Danone and the national economy. In May, Daoudi said that the boycott is going on for “no reason.” King Mohammed VI has not yet approved Daoudi’s resignation request, as required by the Moroccan constitution. Subsequently, Daoudi participated in the Government Council of Thursday, June 7.

Washington D.C – An unprecedented boycott campaign of consumer goods, like dairy by French giant Danone, Gasoline by Afriquia Gas, and water by Oulmes has taken everyone by surprise in Morocco. Most of all those who were unprepared for the popular onslaught were Moroccan politicians. The soft and, nonetheless, infectious power of the internet through which protesters have been organizing themselves, synchronizing their actions, and communicating with each other has left the politicians dumbfounded. This new tactic for voicing social grievances has proven impervious to the state’s intervention and street intimidations. There are no clashes, no bullets, no blood, simply a new insurgent tactic that left the politicians utterly baffled; they did not know what has hit them; they have been unable to quash the revolt by simply dispatching, like they had in the past, anti-riot police. The internet has come to the rescue and immunized Moroccan protesters from the wrath of their own government. As in the Arab spring, social network venues, in this case Facebook, provided the protesters with a Hadrian’s wall-like shield behind which a barrage of cynicism, caricature, and grotesque social discontent comes flowing without fear of repression and reprisals. However, unlike the Arab spring, the protesters did not take to the streets. There are no protesters to be beaten nor charges to be levelled against anyone for disorderly conduct. If the protesters usurped one of the state’s most favored weapons of choice, repression, the government still has one more weapon in its hand, the floor of the parliament building, a privileged pantheon in democratic societies for debating the affairs of the nation and attending to its urgent matters. At least, it would have been convenient to the gravity of the social crisis to lend one’s attention to the protesters’ demands instead of ignoring them first before dismissing them outright from within the parliament itself, a move that the government deplored when it was too late to turn back the clock and undo the damage its own rhetoric had caused. The ineptitude of some elected officials and business tycoons was exposed in broad daylight when they labeled the protesters “foolish” and “unpatriotic”. The accusations drew even more anger and widened the sphere of the unrest. Every day, more people are joining in; even those who lost their job to the boycott sided with the protesters. The divide that ensued speaks volumes; it points to the social gap, separating the silent majority that has been indifferent to the political process and the elected officials who found themselves in positions of power by default. It is a world divided across fault lines of social class, economic opportunity, and family privilege. That world has put the haves on one side and the have nots, on the other; i.e. the less than 5 percent of Moroccans who sit comfortably in their ivory tower and the large majority wailing its misery in the streets of Morocco.  To call the protesters “foolish,” to threaten them with jail for supposedly sharing fake news, and to label them unpatriotic are proofs of a counter-insurgency that no longer has a place in the 21st century. It turned out the “foolish” were not foolish after all. The fallout of this episode should remind the elite in Morocco that their time is up; the country is in need of new faces and a new class of political representatives instead of the same faces swapping positions of power and giving the general populace the semblance of political change. Morocco has changed and, by contrast, the state practices that secured power and prestige, and monopolized the wealth in the hands of the few to the detriment of the poor majority have not. The great awakening has finally come, not through political parties and the work of trade-unionists but thanks to social networking sites, a sign of the depth of Moroccans’ distrust in the very same institutions that are supposed to help them. Like every revolt or revolution in the Arab world, there has always been a concomitant current that jumps on the bandwagon in order to steer the revolt toward dogma, religious ideology, and eventually violence. The call to boycott cultural events, like music festivals, are the latest victim of the perversion that strikes any meaningful attempt to change the status quo in the Arab world. Moving forward and espousing what the boycott stands for should lead to more space for freedoms and cultural diversity, not to regression in the name of religious ideology. Morocco is capable of hosting Mawazine or the World Cup as well as providing jobs, housing, and social services for its poor. The human capital and economic potential are all there to meet the needs of a country in transition. What is not yet there is the willingness to make room for everyone in decision-making, wealth management and creation, and social and political inclusion. When that happens and the barriers to equal opportunity crumble, the added value of culture to the process of social and economic development will also be clearly visible to the disgruntled masses. Amidst all of this, the internet has emerged as one of the most powerful tools for bringing about social change and making the haughty politicians cave in to the demands of the popular masses. It is the new party that functions without a leader or a secretary-general. It has no physical space, no budget, no slogan, no charter, no meetings. It levels the field of political engagement. Perhaps the silent majority in Morocco has found in the internet the “party” to enable it to speak and be heard for a change.

Rabat – Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari arrived in Morocco on Sunday for an official visit at the invitation of King Mohammed VI. King Mohammed VI,  who was accompanied by Crown prince Moulay El Hassan and Prince Moulay Rachid,  welcomed Buhari upon his arrival at the Rabat-Sale airport.  A statement published by the Ministry of Household, Protocol, and Chancellery said on Saturday that the Nigerian president will pay a two-day visit on Sunday and Monday. During the meeting, the two leaders will hold official talks and will co-chair a signing ceremony of several agreements. The king will also offer an official iftar in honor of the Nigerian president and his delegation at the Royal Palace in Rabat. The King and Buhari are also expected to hold talks on the Atlantic project, a pipeline which is set to link Nigeria and Morocco and may extend up to Europe. The agreement to construct the pipeline project was signed in December 2016 during the King’s first official visit to Nigeria.

Rabat – FIFA Council officially approved Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid and the joint US-Mexico-Canada candidature on Sunday at a meeting held in Moscow, FIFA said in a statement. “The FIFA Council designated the two bids – the one jointly submitted by the Canadian Soccer Association, the Mexican Football Association and the United States Soccer Federation, as well as the one submitted by the Moroccan Football Association – to be voted on by the 68th FIFA Congress,” the statement said. On Wednesday, the FIFA Congress will vote to give the hosting rights to one of the bids on the table. FIFA added that it will launch a new bidding procedure if its 68th Congress decided not to choose one of the bids. However, the four associations will not be eligible to submit their applications in case of disqualification. The decision came ten days after the assessment of the 2026 bid evaluation task force. The task force validated the Moroccan bid with a score of 2.7 out of 5 on June 1. The United 2026 bid got a score of 4 out of 5. Despite the low score obtained by the Moroccan bid, the country’s bid committee sounds optimistic about Morocco’s chances to host the 2026 World Cup.  The score “is not a matter of concern. Obviously, the main goal was to ensure that we are above the minimum score of 2 out of 5. Today, we have far exceeded this minimum score. We are almost at 3,” CEO of the Moroccan bid committee Hicham El Amrani told French-based Radio France International (RFI) earlier this week. He also added that the United 2026 score was not surprising as the US has sports facilities ready for the tournament, adding that the goal of a World Cup is to serve as a catalyst for the development of sports.

Rabat – The Moroccan national football team arrived in Russia on Sunday morning to begin the final round of preparations for 2018 World Cup in Russia, which will kick off on June 14. The Atlas Lions’ airplane took off from Tallinn to Russia after their final pre-World Cup friendly game against Estonia. Upon their arrival in Voronezh, a city 446 kilometer south of Moscow, the Moroccan team was welcomed by Moroccan Ambassador to Russia Abdelkader Lachheb. The Atlas Lions will now start their training sessions to face the hardest group in this year’s tournament: Group B, which includes Iean, Portugal and Spain.  In a post-match conference following yesterday match against Estonia, Coach of the Moroccan team, Herve Renard, expressed his dissatisfaction with the performance of some players during the second half.  “I am happy for the first half, but we could not keep the pace, we had a bad second half. I also preferred to give a few players a chance. I am not satisfied with the performance of some of them,” said Renard. Despite his dissatisfaction, Renard stressed that his team is ready for the World Cup in Russia. It will be the team’s fifth World Cup appearance after 20 years of absence. Morocco will face Iran on June 15 in St. Petersburg. The Atlas Lions’ second game will be against Portugal on June 20 in Moscow. Morocco will play the last game in the first round of the World Cup against Spain on June 25 in Kaliningrad.

Rabat- Four days prior to the vote at the FIFA congress—which is made up of 211 national football federations, each with an equal vote—the competition between Morocco’s bid and the North American bid is tighter than most had thought. Morocco, which took the world by surprise in August 2017 when it declared its willingness to challenge United 2026, the North American trio bid (Canada, the US, and Mexico), appeared to most observers like a lone underdog with a very slim, perhaps nonexistent chance of unsettling the confidence, technical superiority, and financial clout of the North Americans. Indeed, Morocco’s bid seemed like a lost cause, if only for the fact that with giant American media corporations, the North American trio would have more visibility than its challenger, and therefore higher chances of attracting more support. It all looked as though Morocco’s bid was a stillborn romance with football’s most highly respected tournament. Some thought Morocco’s campaigning efforts would be mildly convincing at best, but could not help the North African bid even get a sniff of its World Cup-hosting dream. After almost ten months of intense rivalry between the two bids, however, nothing could be more miscalculated. Morocco no longer looks like an underdog. The once unattractive bidder has emerged as a serious competitor with a good chance of beating the once “solid” North American opposition on June 13, according to current estimates. On Wednesday next week, 204 national federations—the 4 contending countries are not eligible to vote—will cast their ballots for one of the two contending bids, and everything is pointing towards a tight, possibly dramatic contest. Of the 204 voting federations, 23 have committed to the US-led trio, and 1 (Guatemala) is “leaning towards” the North American bloc. In contrast, Morocco has garnered commitment from 17 federations, and 9 are “leaning towards” the kingdom. That leaves a huge bundle of 157 “uncommitted” federations whose intentions are not clear yet, though it is expected that geographical and cultural proximity (the African and Muslim blocs for Morocco) and geostrategic ties (the European and other allies of the US for United 2026) will impact countries’ ballots. Add to that the fact that even those said to be “committed” have just made non-binding public statements which they can alter on the D-Day, and the picture could get blurrier: uncertainty is the most certain prediction at this point. Or, as the New York Times analysis put it, June 13 will be Morocco vs. North America, and anything can happen.

Rabat- A man committed suicide Friday by jumping from the third floor inside the Great Mosque of Mecca, just meters away from the Kaaba, Islam’s holy site. The site’s camera footage captured the man throwing himself off the third floor of the mosque, called Masjid al-Haram in Arabic, and fell to the worshipping crowds. WARNING: DISTURBING FOOTAGE
Man commits suicide inside the Grand Mosque of Mecca housing the Kaaba, Islam’s holiest site, by jumping from the third floor pic.twitter.com/wzIdJ8jdL3 — DAILY SABAH (@DailySabah) June 9, 2018  The disturbing video circulated Saturday on social media networks, garnering reactions of shock and disbelief since the suicide, which is a sin in Islam, occured in the holiest Islamic site during the Umrah pilgrimage of Ramadan. Saudi authorities said that the man was a 26-year-old Muslim convert of French origin. Authorities are investigating the motives behind the man’s suicide. The incident was not the first of its kind. In 2017, a Saudi man attempted to set himself on fire in front of the Kaaba before security forces intervened.

Rabat – The North American bid to host the 2026 World Cup may have looked more convincing to FIFA’s task force, which gave it a higher score than the Moroccan bid. But that does not mean United 2026 is set to win hosting rights: Trump’s isolationism and brazenly undiplomatic messages may sink America’s superior-looking bid. United 2026, which is campaigning with the catchy “Unity, Certainty, Opportunity” slogan, may have more opportunities with its “technical superiority” to host the 2026 World, but it seems to lack certainty and unity, according to Bloomberg. America’s declining influence Despite securing the support of Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Latin American countries, the North American bid may suffer serious repercussions from Trump’s “America First” agenda. Commenting on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s response to Trump’s tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Canada, Mexico, and the European Union, Bloomberg wrote: “In the real world, the governments of the three partners have been anything but United. First there was Trump’s border wall, then visa restrictions and now tariffs that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed as ‘frankly insulting.’” Trump’s statement that America would impose tariffs on US partners has sparked fierce reproach in the traditionally American-led Western Bloc. For example, France’s Emmanuel Macron urged the European Union to carve a new path for itself and undermine America’s leadership. Expected impact of politics For these reasons and more, hosts of commentators have suggested that politics will have a defining impact on the June 13 vote and that the outcome will be more surprising than expected. Internally divided and gradually garnering the contempt of much of the world for President Trump’s unvarnished sense of superiority, America’s global aspirations—many see the North American bid as a de facto US bid—may suffer an unexpected blow in Moscow on Wednesday next week. “The final decision will be down to politics as much as merit,” Petros Iosifidis, a professor at City University in London who is an expert in the political economy of television sports rights, told Bloomberg. Iosifidis went on to explain that the fact that the June 13 vote will be decided by national federations is a sure recipe for surprises. He added, however: “What Trump has done in recent weeks has been to alienate his partners. How can these three countries go together for a solid bid right now? Whether we want it or not football always relates to politics.” Others have maintained that Morocco 2026 was already strong enough in its own rights. They suggested that “the Trump factor,” as some have dubbed President Trump’s possible influence on the vote’s outcome, may just be a small surplus in Morocco’s already acquired fan base. Many people in the third world feel that Morocco would bring more passion and excitement to football’s most celebrated tournament. While Trudeau pilloried Trump for his “unacceptable… and insulting” tariffs, the Mexico Football Federation chairman, Decio de Maria, is applying a soothing balm to an obvious sense of uncertainty and ambivalence in the North American trio. De Maria suggested that United 2026 focus on the bright side and shield its bid against the fragility that politics can bring. “In the past we had differences, today we have differences and tomorrow we will have differences. But we are here for football.” But it remains to be seen whether such pronounced rhetoric of sticking together in spite of everything will have an impact when national federations convene in Moscow in four days time.

Rabat- After stopping by Cairo’s West Air Base Airport, King Mohammed VI’s humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza finally reached its destination on Friday night. Earlier this week, four Moroccan aircraft carrying 113 tons of aid, including 25 tons of medicine and 5,000 blankets, landed in Cairo.  Morocco’s Ambassador to Egypt Ahmad Tazi received and supervised the transferring of the goods to twelve trucks, which transported the aid to the Gaza strip on Friday. Medical staff from the Royal Armed Forces (FAR) also arrived in Gaza by buses to join the field hospital, built at the request of the sovereign. The King personally supervised the aid transport on May 29 at the Casablanca airport. The hospital is equipped to handle vascular surgery, abdominal surgery, pediatrics, traumatology, ENT, and ophthalmology. Its medical unit has 97 staff, including 21 nurses and 13 doctors.  The King’s initiative is intended for the medical assistance of Gazans who suffered the May 14 massacre amid protests against the US embassy move to Jerusalem.

The Palestinian Grand Mufti of Al-Quds, Muhammad Ahmad Hussein, expressed his heartfelt appreciation for the King’s initiative, describing it as a brotherly gesture that will “mend the Palestinian wounds.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Embassy in Moscow, Russia, is making Atlas Lions fans trip to the World Cup easier. The embassy has published a guide for fans to ensure their stay in Russia in the best possible conditions. The embassy’s guide contains important information on the host cities, communication tools, transportation, cultural sites, and laws on the stay in Russia.  Moreover, mobile consulates will be established in the cities that will host the games of the national team “to assist our fellow citizens when needed,” the document said. However, the document underlines that the embassy will not intervene in certain cases such as “to repatriate at the expense of the State, to help to enter Russia or to intervene with the justice to obtain release if there is involvement in a court case in the territory of the host country.”  Supporters must obtain a FAN ID to access Russian territory during the World Cup, which allows a fan to stay 10 days before the world competition and 10 days after the final, a total of 50 days. Exceeding the authorized stay is illegal. Obtaining the fan ID “is subject to the acquisition of an entry ticket to the stadium and this document entitles its holder to use public transport, including trains between cities, and to attend FIFA supporter festivals.” Also, the guide informs travelers that they will receive an immigration card upon arrival which must be kept until departure from Russia. The document recommends fans plan their accommodation well in advance. For transport, Russian cities have metro, bus, trolleybus, and tram, which are available throughout the day, and each FAN ID holder can travel for free between host cities by train. The document also provides supporters with a list of numbers to contact in case of emergencies, including that of the ambassador of Morocco.

Rabat – Morocco has successfully finished their 2018 World Cup friendly round. The Atlas Lions have beaten Estonia in a 2018 pre-World Cup friendly game with 3-1 on Saturday, less than a week before the world premier tournament begins. The team scored two goals against Estonia in the first half of the game, when they had up to 75  percent possession of the ball. Morocco’s first goal was scored by midfielder Younes Belhanda in the first 11 minutes of the friendly game. The second goal came from Moroccan young football star Hakim Ziyech, who scored a penalty for the Moroccan team. At minute 72, Moroccan star Ayoub El Kaabi provided an excellent assist to his fellow Youssef En-Nsyri. Estonia was quick to respond to Morocco’s 3rd goal. Ats Purje scored the first goal for his team in the 76th minute of the match. Throughout the game, Morocco made 18 shots, eight of which were on target. The Atlas Lions also missed several opportunities to leverage the scoring. This is the last friendly game Morocco played before the tournament starts on June 14. The Atlas Lions, including captain Mehdi Benatia and Ayoub El Kaabi,  showed a notable determination during their last friendly game. The team proved to the world that they have been preparing for the tournament. Recently, Spanish sports news outlets have informed the other Group B teams of what they should expect from the Atlas Lions. Marca and Mundo Deportivo commended the team, who confirmed that they know what they are going to Russia for. When the tournament begins, Morocco will face Iran on June 15 in St. Petersburg. Their second game will be against Portugal on June 20 in Moscow. Morocco will play the last game in the first round of the World Cup against Spain on June 25 in Kaliningrad. Moroccans hold hope to see their team achieving the best results during the  2018 World Cup. Go Atlas Lions!

Rabat – Siham Meftahi, a 22-year old Moroccan entrepreneur and an engineering student, has received the Maghreb Engineering Student Award as part of the Ingénieuses 2018 operation, aimed to develop the engineering skills of young girls. Ingénieuses 2018 was organized by the Conference of Directors of the French Schools of Engineers (CDEFI) in partnership with the Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF). According to a statement obtained by Morocco World News from Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie, the Maghreb Engineering Student Award recognizes the commitment of students enrolled in engineering studies at AUF member institutions in Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria. Siham was rewarded for her academic career, professional ambitions, and commitment to empowering housewives through her project, Safe Eat. Meftahi founded Safe Eat in 2016. The project encourages women to prepare healthy homemade dishes, which are then marketed online. In an interview with MWN, Meftahi said that she had always wanted to create her own startup that would make a positive impact on the lives of Moroccan women. In 2014, Meftahi joined École Nationale Supérieure des Arts et Métiers in Casablanca (ENSAM), where she studied industrial engineering. During her first year at the school, she joined ENSAM’s Enactus club for young business leaders. Her project, Safe Eat, made it to the top nine projects in the world at the 2017 Google Search Stories competition organized by Google Business Group (GBG). Meftahi was then the only Moroccan, African, and Arab finalist in the competition.

Rabat- The countdown to the last day of Ramadan has begun and today the global Muslim population are anticipating Eid Al Fitr. Saudi Arabia expects to celebrate the end of Ramadan on Friday, June 15. Eid Al Fitr or the “Feast of Breaking the Fast” in English, comes on the first day Shawwal, the tenth month of the Islamic calendar, signaling the end of Ramadan. According to the International Astronomical Centre (IAC), most Muslim countries will celebrate the Eid Al Fitr holiday on the same day, including Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Egypt, and Kuwait.  The countries will observe the crescent moon, indicating the start of the new month on the eve of June 14, either with a telescope or the naked eye. The IAC predicts that the crescent will rise on that day but the moon sighting will be difficult with the naked eye, except in the far west.  IAC’s predictions are similar to those of Moroccan astronomer Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al-Ifrani’s predictions for Ramadan and Eid Al Fitr, which he presented to Morocco World News. The astronomer forecasts that the crescent moon will be clearly observed from countries in the Western Hemisphere which includes Morocco, saying that the majority of Muslim countries will celebrate Eid Al Fitr on the same day, June 15 just as they began fasting in unison on Thursday, May 17. Many Muslim countries take two to four days off from work during Eid Al Fitr feast.   This year, Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz extended the religious holiday to a full working week off. Meanwhile in Morocco, the office holiday for Eid Al Fitr will last for two days, as usual in the country. On Eid Al Fitr, Muslim families get together, perform Salat al-Eid (Eid prayer), and give Zakat Al Fitr (Eid charity) to the poor. Some Muslims observe six days of fasting during the month of Shawwal after Eid Al Fitr, as it is prohibited to fast on the Eid which falls on the first day of Shawwal. In Islam, the Ramadan fast coupled with six days’ fasting in Shawwal are equivalent to fasting through an entire year or a lifetime, as the Prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him) said: “Whoever fasts in Ramadan and follows it with six days of Shawwal, it will be as if he fasted for a lifetime,” (as narrated by Al-Tirmidhi). A short overview of Eid Al Fitr:

Rabat – Lartiste wants the world to know that he is supporting his home country Morocco in the upcoming World Cup. Invited to sing on the set of the French show “Chanson de l’année 2018” (Song of the Year 2018), the Moroccan rapper surprised everyone by wearing a pro-Moroccan t-shirt, supporting the Atlas Lions for the football competition. Singing his hit song “Mafiosa” with Brazilian rapper Carolina, Youssef Akdim, who is called Lartiste, sported a “Keep Calm and Support Morocco” t-shirt during his performance to show that he is all in for the Atlas Lions who will soon compete in the 2018 World Cup in Russia.  Mafiosa #lartiste A post shared by  Fan De Lartiste (@lartiste_king_) on Jun 8, 2018 at 2:06pm PDT  Despite not winning the “Song of the Year 2018” award, the singer of “Chocolat” has won the hearts of Moroccan fans who have not failed to show their enthusiasm on social networks. However, the year has started roughly for the native of Marrakech. In March, he was beaten up and forced to cancel concerts, tours, and interviews. In spite of everything, Lartiste managed to make a gold record with his album Grandestino, and this “without promo and without cheating,” as he said it on Instagram. Lartiste is a rap singer born July 4, 1985 in a village near Marrakech in Morocco. Raised with music, including raï (Algerican folk music), he moved with his family to Aulnay-Sous-Bois in Paris at the age of six. After several albums that allowed him to evolve his style and become known, he released his third opus “Maestro” in 2016 with the label of Master Gims, which is a hit. At the end of 2016, Lartiste started his own label, Purple Money, and released “Clandestino” in December, which he performed throughout 2017 on the roads of France. The record is certified platinum, thanks to his two hits “Clandestina” and “Chocolat,” featuring Awa Imani. This year, the Moroccan sensation has achieved new success with his hit “Mafiosa,” in collaboration with Carolina. He received a platinum single but also a gold record for his latest opus “Grandestino.”

Rabat – It is official: Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari will arrive in Morocco on Sunday at the request of King Mohammed VI. The Ministry of Household, Protocol, and Chancellery announced on Saturday that “Mr. Muhammadu Buhari, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria will make a friendship and official visit to the Kingdom of Morocco, on Sunday, and Monday, 25 and 26 Ramadan 1439 corresponding to June 10 and 11, 2018.” King Mohammed VI will hold official talks with the Nigerian president, with whom he will co-chair a signing ceremony of conventions. The King will also offer the Nigerian president and his delegation an official iftar in Buhari’s honor at the Royal Palace in Rabat. The statement concluded that the visit demonstrates the “depth and quality of bilateral relations based on a strong and lasting friendship, owing to the common desire to consolidate the multidimensional relations existing between the two countries.” The African leaders are also expected to discuss the Atlantic project, a pipeline which is set to link Nigeria and Morocco and may extend up towards Europe. The agreement to construct the pipeline project was signed in December 2016 during the King’s first official visit to Nigeria. With such projects the King aims to diversify Morocco’s partnerships in Africa and to extend the South-South activities that the country has initiated with its traditional partners in the continent.

Rabat – The Ministry of Employment said in a statement on Friday that no cases of “sexual harassment” against seasonal Moroccan farmers in Huelva, Spain, were recorded. The ministry, however, recognized that a suspect was questioned for alleged sexual assault. The statement recalled that delegations from the ministry, the National Agency for the Promotion of Employment and Skills (ANAPEC), the Spanish embassy in Morocco and the Ministry in charge of Moroccans Living Abroad and Migration Affairs inspected the conditions of Moroccan farmers in Spain throughout the month of May. The inspection, according to the statement, unveiled no cases of “sexual harassment… with the exception of a case of a 47-year old suspect, who is the subject of a judicial inquiry in Spain.” Spanish news outlet El Mundo reported on June 4 that four Moroccan women lodged complaints against a supervisor on a Huelva farm. The 47-year old suspect was then arrested and questioned on May 25 and released on bail after questioning. The ministry’s recent statement added that it will follow the case to ensure all the statements attributed to Moroccan seasonal farmers are acted upon appropriately with the outcomes of any judicial investigation opened in this case. The ministry said that Moroccan seasonal farmers will begin returning to Morocco on May 25 and will continue until the beginning of July. The statement added that it brought back 400 workers on June 5, coinciding with the end of the fruit harvesting period in the farm concerned by the harassment allegations. Employees are under contracts that do not allow them to leave before the end of the harvest, because of the lack of a local workforce. In May, Morocco’s Ministry of Employment released a statement, announcing that it opened an investigation into the sexual assault claims. The ministry appointed a Spanish-Moroccan delegation to visit Huelva and to inquire about the working conditions of Moroccan farmers working in strawberry fields. Following the visit, the ministry published a statement denying claims that Moroccan farmers are being assaulted. Several international news outlets reported several cases of Moroccan women who experienced sexual assaults by their supervisors.  The German investigative journalism NGO Correctiv published a story on May 2 in collaboration with RTL Nachtjournal and Buzzfeed News on Moroccan women farmers in Spain and in Morocco’s Souss Massa region in the south. In the report, women claimed that they were harassed, insulted, and raped in the field.

Rabat – The last days, if anything, have been unpleasantly shocking for Morocco 2026: Namibia and Liberia joined South Africa as the only African countries that have officially chosen to support the North American bid to host the FIFA World Cup in 2026 instead of Morocco. The recent moves have reduced the African momentum that has strengthened the North African bid in the past months, while Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan shattered Morocco’s certainty that the Trump administration’s anti-Muslim agenda would prompt the Muslim world to overwhelmingly endorse Morocco 2026. But if losing the support of some African and Middle Eastern countries has dealt a severe blow to Morocco’s hopes of hosting the World Cup in 2026, Morocco 2026’s dimming light has been rekindled by some good news from the Gulf and Africa, Moroccan outlet Al Massae reported earlier today. The source wrote that Qatar’s ambassador to Rabat, Abdallah Velah Edousri, has announced his country’s total support for Morocco’s bid. But in addition to the assurance that Qatar’s vote will go to Morocco, the Gulf country “also plans to use all its might to lobby for Morocco’s bid,” Al Massae noted. If this sounds familiar, it is: since Morocco joined—rather unexpectedly—the FIFA 2026 contest in August of last year, Qatar has been unapologetically forthcoming about its unremitting support for “fellow Muslim brothers.”  Despite Trump’s recent tweet threatening to withdraw American aid from countries who will not vote for United 2026 (the North American bid) Ambassador Edousri is inflexible about his country’s position on Wednesday’s vote. Edousri hinted, without naming names, that Muslim countries should support Morocco. As for the breath of fresh air from Africa, it was delivered to Morocco 2026 by Seychelles. The island country, which is a member of the COSAFA (Council of Southern Africa Football Associations), has chosen to smash South Africa’s alleged agenda of persuading the COSAFA bloc to endorse the North American trio at the expense of Morocco’s bid. In a public statement, the president of the Seychelles Football Federation, George Pepel, declared his country’s full support for Morocco 2026.  Pepel said that the executive board of the federation has unanimously decided to vote for the continent’s representative on June 13.

Rabat – The Ministry of Health has activated the national plan for monitoring for Ebola in response to its reappearance in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), by establishing a cell to evaluate the risks on a regular basis and monitor the virus’s spread. According to a statement from the ministry, the possibility of Ebola coming into the Kingdom remains weak in light of current data. In cooperation with its partners, the ministry has taken a series of preventive and proactive measures, by monitoring the situation in the DRC, assessing the systematic risk, following up on World Health Organization recommendations, medically observing flights from the DRC, and distributing flyers to travelers coming from the DRC. At Casablanca’s Mohammed V Airport, thermal imaging cameras were installed and an ambulance provided. The ministry also strengthened the diagnosis methods and management procedures for suspected cases by giving the Institut Pasteur’s reference laboratory  diagnostic equipment. On May 8, the Congolese government announced the re-emergence of the Ebola virus in the northwest Equateur province where 62 cases of hemorrhagic fever, including 27 deaths, were recorded up until June 6.

Rabat – Amid a major boycott of three prominent companies against high prices and low-quality products, an alleged report received by Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum notes that Morocco’s dairy products were not subject to any health standard monitoring. The newspaper said that contrary to what is posted on the website of  Morocco’s National Office of Food Safety (ONSSA) Health Safety office, dairy products were not subjected to any monitoring operations in 2017. Akhbar Al Yaoum further added that in 2015 and 2016, monitoring committees only took samples from production factories, but not from sale points. The information comes on the heels of the ongoing boycott, which has been targeting the high prices and “low quality” of  Centrale Danone’s dairy products. People supporting the boycott have been questioning the quality of Centrale Danone products since the launch of the boycott on April 20. The company, however, denied low quality allegations, sharing details on its products publicly on May 23. “Centrale milk, like all other products of the company, is closely monitored during the production process.”  The company added that the production of milk is subjected to the strictest observance of international health safety standards. Centrale Danone has also said that its products are being regularly controlled by ONSSA. To date, ONSSA and leading milk companies, including Centrale Danone and Jaouda, have not responded to the information released by Akhbar Al Yaoum in its weekend edition. Dairy products, especially raw milk and cottage cheese are commonly sold across Morocco in souqs (traditional markets). Raw dairy products, however, can constitute a danger for containing microorganisms that can cause major health issues.

Rabat- Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has received a delegation of the national trade unions who requested the government expand its health insurance for to include craftsmen with poor prospects of health insurance. During the meeting, trade unions explained the impact of mediators on price negotiations, the importance of social dialogue, trading integrity, tax fairness and fair employment opportunities, and the importance of strengthening the traders’ image in the country. Trade unions demanded that craftsmen and workers in the domestic trade industry be included in the government’s health coverage which would concern a large number of Moroccans, especially those with low income. El Othmani updated the unions on the government’s goals, a “universal health coverage” that will cover about 90 percent of the Moroccan population by 2021. Recently, Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO),Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus pledged to support Morocco’s ambition to extend the national health insurance to low-income and disadvantaged people. The current System of Medical Assistance (RAMED) which has been in place for six years extended health coverage to 60 percent of the Moroccan population. Morocco’s Minister of Health, Anas Doukkali previously said that while the results are “honorable,” there is still a long way to go for health care to be more effective and inclusive of all the poor and disadvantaged people, as it is “a universal right.” Despite the government’s new plan, “Universal Health Coverage” or “Health for All,” Doukkali pledged to sustain and rekindle RAMED and its 2018-2021 program for the prevention and control of diseases. The program aims to increase the availability of health facilities by 20 percent by 2021 to prevent heart disease-related deaths.

Rabat – The High Council of Ulemas estimated the cash value of Zakat Al Fitr, the charity that every Muslim has to pay at the end of Ramadan, at MAD 13 per person this year. This amount was set taking into consideration the general interest of Moroccan Muslims, the statement said. While the amount of zakat in Morocco decreased by MAD 2 compared to last year, the Muslim Theological Council of France (CMTF) raised zakat in France from EUR 5 to 7 per person in 2018. However, any person can pay a higher amount or quantity if they can afford it. Zakat will have to be given on Eid, expected to come Friday, June 15, or before. Zakat (regular charity) is one of the five pillars of Islam. Literally, it means “growing” and “purification” of the individual soul. It is described as a “tax,” but is sometimes distinguished from a tax because zakat is related to religion and has fixed rates, whereas a tax is related to government and has certain rules for setting rates. Zakat requires wealthier people to give a portion of their annual revenue to poor people: everyone must contribute 2.5 percent of their annual income to help the poor to achieve a life of dignity and a higher quality of life.

Rabat – The Ministry in charge of Moroccans Living Abroad and Migration has said it will transfer the bodies of two Moroccans who died in an illegal firework warehouse blast in the Spanish province of Pontevedra. The ministry said in a statement yesterday that the man and his wife died on May 23 and will be transferred in coordination with Morocco’s consulate general in Bilbao, Spain. The ministry decided to conduct the operation following the identification of the two victims as Abdelkhalek El Bouabi and his wife Zahra Bouadel, conducted by Spanish authorities. The ministry has mobilized two ambulances to transfer the bodies from Casablanca Mohammed V International Airport to the city of Khouribga, where they will be buried. The funerals will take place on Saturday in the presence of a delegation of the ministry in charge of Moroccans Living Abroad and Migration Affairs. According to Spanish website ThinkSpain, the couple had been living in Spain for 11 years and had two young sons, aged 13 and 9, now orphaned. The incident caused major consequences, damaging nearly 50 houses. No major injuries were sustained among other residents as they managed to escape houses, which crumbled to dust. ThinkSpain also reported that the owner of the firework stash was arrested and charged with negligent homicide, but was released on bail.

Rabat – Moroccans will turn their clocks forward by one hour (GMT+1) on Sunday, June 17, at 2:00 a.m., the Ministry of Administration, Modernization, and Civil Service has announced today. The decision is an implementation of Decree Number 2-13-781, from September 2013, modifying an earlier decree on changing time. Every year when Ramadan falls in the summer, Morocco switches to standard time before the holy month of Ramadan. The country then returns to  Daylight Saving Time days after Eid Al Fitr, the Muslim holiday marking the end of the fast of Ramadan. Astronomers speculate that Eid Al Fitr will be celebrated on Friday, June 15. Astronomer and researcher Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al-Ifrani told Morocco World News today that the Shawwal (the tenth month of the lunar Islamic calendar) moon will be clearly observed on Friday from most Arab countries, including Morocco.  The first day of Shawwal marks Eid Al Fitr. Morocco also switches back to standard time in winter and turns the clocks forward again in summer for Daylight Saving Time. In 2017, a group of activists launched a petition calling on Prime Minister Saad Eddine El Othmani and the Parliamentary Council to abolish the biannual time change and maintain Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The signatories wanted the government to issue a law indefinitely suspending Daylight Saving Time in Morocco. They deemed remaining on GMT “appropriate with the country’s geographical location throughout the year.” A similar debate has been raised in Europe recently, as several member countries urged the EU to consider abolishing Daylight Saving Time. Daylight Saving Time was first adopted during the first World War in the UK to give factories more daylight hours in which to operate, thereby aiding the war.

Rabat – Morocco will celebrate Eid Al Fitr on Friday, June 15, astronomer and researcher Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al Ifrani told Morocco World News today. The astronomer said that June 15 will mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Al Ifrani said that the crescent of the month of Shawwal (the tenth month in the Islamic calendar) will be seen in most Arab and Islamic countries except in the east, where it will be difficult to see. Celebrated among Muslims worldwide, Eid Al Fitr is translated as the “Feast of Breaking the Fast” in English. Kharbouch, whose previous predictions for Ramadan and other religious celebrations were all correct, said that the observation of the moon will be clear across the country on the evening of Thursday, or Ramadan 29, 1439 by the Islamic calendar. Ramadan began in Morocco on Thursday, May 17, marking a unified first fasting day throughout all Muslim countries, including North Africa and Saudi Arabia. The UAE-based news outlet the National reported on June 7 that Eid Al Fitr is expected to be on Friday, June 15, in most Islamic countries. Muslims worldwide begin the celebration with Eid prayers at dawn in mosques across the country. Morocco usually gives a three-day holiday for the celebration, it is a time when families visit each other. After the prayer, families gather around a table full of various Moroccan pastries, cakes ,and breads, accompanied by mint tea, milk, and coffee.

Rabat – The Regional Academy of Education and Training (AREF) recorded 224 cases of cheating during the 2018 baccalaureate exams in the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region, compared to 298 cases a year ago. The number represents a 24.8 percent decrease, possibly owing to the awareness campaigns and administrative measures undertaken by the region. The regional academy added that this year’s examination took place in “normal conditions” of transparency and fairness, in accordance with the law on the suppression of cheating in school exams. According to the regional academy, a total of 58,537 students in 7 provincial directorates sat for the exams. The number of students of literature was 16,113, students of science was 19,924, and students from technical branches was 4,704. AREF also underscored the efforts of educational managers and teachers overseeing the exams and school administrations. In Morocco, 329,395 students took the baccalaureate final exam. The ministry stated that it recorded 1,267 cases of cheating across the country; 86 percent of which occurred through the use of mobile phones. During the weekly cabinet meeting Thursday, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani explained that the baccalaureate cheating rate has dropped by 20 percent compared to 2017, when it fell by 60 percent compared to 2016.

Rabat – The North American trio does not deserve to win the right to host football’s showpiece in 2026. That is the opinion of US veteran women’s goalkeeper Hope Solo. Solo, who won both the Olympics and World Cup with the US women’s’ football team, is the most decorated football player in the US. She also ran in the recent election for the presidency of the United States Soccer Federation in February. The legendary goalkeeper came fifth in the eight-candidate contest, with victory going to Carlos Cordeiro, now a co-chair of the North American bid with his Canadian and Mexican counterparts. Solo pointed out that the game has failed fans and people from poor backgrounds in the US. America’s football, known as soccer, has become an elite club which alienates anyone not in the deeply entrenched power and money circles “running everything.” Speaking to CNN, Solo said that the US Soccer Federation does not deserve to win the vote. She argued that she prefers the bid whose victory can genuinely impact lives, bring palpable change, and have a meaning for people from deprived backgrounds. Arguing that the US Soccer Federation serves the interest of a restricted circle of powerful members at the expense of children and fans, she said: “I do have a problem with an organization like that being awarded something so big and I would like to think that there’s another country out there who is more deserving of than the United States.” She also noted that the federation has “neglected so many people” and that instead of investing in promising young talent from poor communities, the ruling body ensures that “everything goes back to the power structure.” Solo suggests that this elevation of power over talent and passion has turned football in America into a sport of “rich white kids.” But for all her dismay at her country’s football federation, her feelings are rather mixed. “I can’t say it should be awarded to Morocco. But I don’t think it should go to the United States, and that’s hard to say,” Solo reportedly told the Associated Press. While Solo has made clear that she is not endorsing Morocco, the only other contender in the fierce scramble to win the hosting rights of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, her opinion is an unwitting nod to the North African bid. Morocco’s bid officials have constantly argued that a tournament as exciting as the World Cup should start acknowledging those left behind, the parts of the world where the sport has a visible impact on people’s lives. “The World Cup is not attributed only to the number of seats you offer in stadiums or who makes more money…. The power of sport is also to help develop certain areas of the world,” El Amrani, a Morocco 2026 representative, told reporters last month at a promotion event in Brussels.

Rabat – The Ministry of Education, Professional Training, and Higher Learning has warned a number of private universities against the growing practice of advertising for unaccredited university curricula. In a press statement released earlier this week, the ministry called on private institutes of higher education to refrain from using manipulated or fake data to attract students to their faculties or departments that have not received the ministry’s approval. Arguing that a number of universities have resorted to attracting students with attractive-looking curricula and international partnerships for which they have no authorization from the ministry, the press release reminded universities to “uphold the principles of transparency, loyal competition, and equity of opportunities which constitute the bedrock of Morocco’s educational system.” The press statement emphasized the importance of credibility and social trust as pillars of academic practice. The search for more customers should not be used as bait, the ministry said. “It is forbidden to open enrollment for departments that have not been recognized by the ministry,” said the statement. It added that there are also private universities which have not even been accredited. The ministry concluded that certificates and all other documents obtained in such conditions are null and void. It provided a website where information regarding universities’ status can be found and urged parents and university candidates to do so to avoid falling prey to such scams.

Rabat – Among the dramatic changes that Morocco’s waves of protests and customer boycotts that have brought about in the market of dairy products is the remarkable decline in Central Danone’s sales.  However, Copag, the principal beneficiary of Central Danone’ downfall, is being suspected of using synthetic milk in the making of its dairy products. In its latest statement following seven weeks of boycott, Central Danone declared a sharp decrease of 50 percent in its market share, a major consequence being the rise to prominence of the company’s hitherto minor competitors. Of all the competitors, however, Copag has been declared the most visible winner, with the company reported to have increased its market share by more than 20 percent. According to a recent study conducted by Kantar, a global leader in Data Investment Management, Central Danone’s market share experienced a marked fall, decreasing from 46.7 percent in late April to its current level of 18.3 percent.  Meanwhile, Copag’s sales spectacularly increased from 24.1 percent to 33 percent over the same period. The study noted that there were even times when Copag’s share hit 38 percent. Most of these changes, the Kantar study added, occurred particularly at the peak of the boycott campaigns in the first weeks of May. Other brands of dairy products such Jibal and Colaimo have also improved their sales, the study also found; but it maintained that the figures show that Copag is the unrivalled emerging leader currently occupying Central Danone’s position. And whereas Copag’s adaptability through quick and effective strategies to claim Central Danone’s place have been identified by some as the primary factor for its rise, others—the majority, in fact—are questioning the company’s sales and production strategies, Moroccan outlet Medias 24 reported earlier this week.  Accusing Copag of suing “illegal and unethical” practices, critics have explained that the company’s stock of fresh milk cannot account for  its current sales level, especially given figures that indicate unparalleled improvements in the company’s market share.  Using Milk Powder For Copag’s critics, the only explanation for the producer’s recent rise is the use of unconventional and unauthorized means to meet the market’s demand. They cite reports that reports of Central Danone’s decision to reduce its purchase of fresh milk.  This has considerably made breeders worse off, with the national association of breeder said to have publicly complained about the sharp fall in the purchase of fresh milk. For all these reasons, critics have claimed, the sole conclusion is that Copag has resorted to using synthetic rather than fresh milk to produce the dairy products it has been selling since it claimed Central Danone’s position in the market. Kantar’s study further revealed that Moroccan milk producers annually purchase about 1.4 billion liters of fresh milk, with 650 million for Danone and 200 million for Copag.  Based on these findings, an anonymous source reportedly told Medias 24 that “While Copag’s purchase of fresh milk should have increased given its current sales level, the company has kept the same quantity during the same period”. What is more, the same source added, “They [Copag] even declined the offer to purchase the unclaimed quantity that would have normally gone to Central Danone.” While Moroccan law accepts milk powder as an ingredient for making products such as biscuits and Yogurt for example, it criminalizes the use of the same product to produce milk. And so, critics are adamant that Copag should be held accountable.  Some critics noted that although the “illegal practice” of resorting to milk powder was scantily used by all milk producers, it has become a tradition since Copag rose to prominence. During a radio broadcast on Chada FM on June 6, ABdellah Mekkaoui, president breeders’ association of Tadla, a region in central Morocco, said that the “illegal practice” has “unfortunately been used by many producers in the past three years.”  Although refraining from naming names, Mekkaoui appeared to be arguing that Copag is the principal culprit in the use of milk powder to produce milk. He said that “one company in particular,” which is the leading importer of milk powder, has also been the leader of the “criminal practice.” Given that it takes 1 kg of milk powder to produce 10 liters of milk, Mekkaoui reminded, “these companies” are making huge financial benefits off of Moroccan consumers. Defamation Campaign Asked about the possibility of selling Central Danone’s part of the stock of fresh milk to Copag, the vice-president of Morocco’s national association of breeders (Fenepol) allegedly claimed that such a move “is not something that you decide overnight,” as there are scores of steps and procedures to follow, not to mention legal and administrative hurdles. For those sympathetic with Copag , however, this is all a defamation campaign by some powerful and members who are not happy with the company’s new status as the leader of a market which has for so long been dominated others. “Why are they raising this issue just now while everyone knows that it was wide currency, especially during Ramadan periods? Why Copag?” have been reported to have asked. “We do not work in the dark,” said Copag’s director M’hammed Loultiti when asked about the company’s position on the prevailing controversy. Loultiti added that the company is open to any inspection missions by relevant authorities. He concluded that his company’s recent level of “extraordinary results” is due to efforts and “a jihad” that have been going on for the past three decades.

Rabat – Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to pay an official visit to Morocco on Sunday. At the request of King Mohammed VI, the president will spend a three-day visit in Morocco along with a Nigerian delegation, an unidentified source told Moroccan news outlet Le360. The source added that the King and Buhari “regularly” consult on topics of common interest regarding Africa. The Atlantic pipeline project, set to link Nigeria and Morocco and may extend up towards Europe, will be at the heart of the meetings between the two leaders. Morocco and Nigeria inked the pipeline agreement in December 2016 during the King’s first official visit to Nigeria. The King’s visit aimed to diversify Morocco’s partnerships in Africa and to extend the model of South-South cooperation that the country has developed with its traditional partners in the continent. King Mohammed VI received the special envoy of the Nigerian president, Ahmed Abubakar Rufai, on May 19, conveying a written message to the monarch.

By Intissar Faouzi Rabat – In Tangier, King Mohammed VI initiated a new fishing port and marina, two leader projects under the MAD 6.2 billion Tangier port area rehabilitation program. The two projects reflect the King’s desire to make Tangier a preferred destination for cruises and pleasure tourism and to improve the working conditions of fishermen with modern equipment. The new fishing port will cost MAD 1.189 billion and will allow better development of the fishing industry, boost investment, and create additional jobs while it is being constructed. The new fishing port will have 1,167 meters of protective structures, 2,537 meters of ferry docks, 11 hectares of bay, and 12 hectares of land. The project will contain various essential structures, including ice factories, cold stores, a standard fund management unit, stores for ship owners and wholesalers, shops for artisanal fishermen, a shipyard, ship repair shops, and administrative buildings. The port will also contain a fish market for coastal and offshore fisheries and will be built on 5,000 square meters. The fish market will have a refrigerated sales area, cold storage rooms, and a veterinary office. The purpose of the market is to improve product quality, ensure the smoothness and transparency of commercial transactions, and develop fishing-related activities within the region. In regards to socio-economic impact, the new fishing port will help fishermen advertise their products in addition to improving their working conditions. The King also launched an MAD 635 million structural project on Thursday called “Tanja Marina Bay.” The project is dedicated to recreational boaters who  seek to discover the magic of the city of Bogaz. The marina will offer 800 docking rings for boats ranging in length from 7 to 90 meters and 600 rings for boats from 7 to 30 meters, planned for the second phase. The marina will offer the largest number of docking rings in the kingdom and a multitude of services fulfilling international standards. The marina will include entertainment areas, fuel stations, shops, national clubs and a parking lot with 435 spaces. It is to be hoped the two projects will bring new life to the Tangier port, boost tourist attractions, and inject a new dynamism into the fishing sector.

His remarks angered a large number of social media users who condemned his Facebook post. “Stoning to death is one of God’s punishments that Islam brought to fight eroticism and profanity,” he wrote again on a second post which fueled more controversy. The teacher, from Tetouan, went as far as publicly sharing his residential address on Facebook as a challenge to those who criticized him. Local authorities called him for investigation when his remarks were still drawing frowns a week later. As for the woman and van driver, they were tried Monday on charges of adultery after admitting the speculations. Their attackers have pleaded guilty and were prosecuted for robbery, attempted murder, and vandalism on the same day, following the viral video showing them beating the two individuals.

Rabat – The CEO of Morocco’s bid committee, Hicham El Amrani, assessed the country’s chances to win the hosting rights of the 2026 World Cup in a recent interview with French-based Radio France International (RFI) in the countdown to the June 13 vote. The Moroccan official refused to comment on US President Donald Trump’s May tweet threatening countries that pledged support for Morocco 2026. “I would rather not share my feelings about this. I simply hope that the global football family will be able to focus on football rather than politics, because if we take football into consideration, Morocco is the ideal choice for this 2026 World Cup.” Morocco has all the assets to host World Cup The CEO of the bid committee touted Morocco’s assets to host the tournament.  “Our country is compact enough considering the cities we promise, in relation to the distances that should be made by players and fans.” El Amrani also touted Morocco’s proximity to Europe and other countries by time zone, the “exceptional” passion that Morocco has for football, and its “tolerance and openness that makes building bridges between people possible.” Introducing Morocco’s assets to RFI, the CEO said that the 12 cities selected to stage the games of the 2026 World Cup are located within a 550-kilometer radius of Casablanca. Task force scoring does not disturb Morocco 2026 RFI also asked El Amrani whether the task force’s grade for the Moroccan bid is worrying for the future. The task force validated the Moroccan bid with a score of 2.7 out of 5 on June 1. The United 2026 (North American) bid got a score of 4 out of 5. But for Morocco the scoring is not a major issue. “It is not disturbing. Of course, first and foremost, the goal was to ensure that we are above the minimum score of 2 out of 5. Today, we have far exceeded his minimum score. We are almost 3,” said El Amrani. He explained that it was not surprising to Morocco “that our competitors have higher scores in terms of sports facilities. We know that the United States has sports facilities that are ready and available, but it is also the goal of a World Cup to be able to serve as a catalyst for the development of sports. He added that the legacy of a World Cup is essential for both Morocco and Africa to “consolidate this development at different levels.” For Morocco to win the hosting rights, it needs 104 votes. Morocco is counting on African countries to support the Moroccan bid at the 68th FIFA Congress, where the decision will be made on the 2026 World Cup host. “As a member of the African Confederation, we count on the largest number of member federations on the African continent. But of course it will not be enough to reach the required majority to win the vote,” said El Amrani. He added that the committee has been campaigning for the bid in several countries before the vote.

Rabar- After nearly a decade of work on a project that was projected to take two years, Terminal 1 of Casablanca’s Mohammed V International Airport is finally ready and should be operational by early July according to authorities. The new facility is set to double the airport’s reception capacity—up to 14 million passengers per year, from 7 million currently—and transform Casablanca into a continental and global hub of business and air travel. Although a specific date for the inauguration has yet to be announced, several important stakeholders, including the National Office of Airports (ONDA) and sources from Royal Air Maroc (RAM) are confident that service at the new facility will open in the next few weeks. “Finally ready to welcome [its first] passengers, Terminal 1 should start operating by late June or early July,” said a source at the Ministry of Tourism and Transportation, explaining that the previous opening had been postponed due to “a long period of tests which started in early March.” The terminal consists of 84 check-in counters and 17 boarding gates. It will be the exclusive preserve of RAM flights, though some of “RAM’s strategic partner airlines such as Qatar Airways” are also expected to use the new facility. While expanding the airport’s capacities, the new terminal will also offer great opportunities for travelers and partner airways, including direct and connecting flights to more destinations, “a large and commercial walk through,” and a large space for duty free shops. Moroccan tourism giant Atlas Hospitality is also planning to build two world class hotels—a 5-star and a 3-star—at a walking distance from the new terminal. That project is set to last 12 months from Terminal 1’s inauguration day. As RAM flights will operate from the new facility, it is expected that the vacated counters in the old terminal will create more space and opportunities for foreign airlines to use. This will considerably improve check-in and passport control, making time spent at the airport more relaxing than before, said the source at the ministry. “RAM, which was using 41 counters in T2, will transfer all its activities to the new T1 where it will be operating with 52 counters,” the source declared. The facility will be equipped with state-of-the-art technology, as the plan is to both expand the airport’s traffic capacity and render it a modernized airport.

Rabat- After Lahcen Daoudi handed in his resignation from his government position as Minister of General Affairs and Governance, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has taken charge of the case concerning the profit margins of fuel distributors following the deregulation of fuel prices.  Prior to resignation, which is still pending the King’s approval, Daoudi met with fuel companies on June 1 to discuss the government’s request that companies narrow their profit margin, as some companies doubled their profits at the expense of consumers. Former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane initiated the deregulation of the fuel sector. The liberalization allows the per-liter cost to vary with market trends. Throughout the earlier meeting, Daoudi asked companies to cooperate with the government and revise their profit margins down to solve the problem of oil and gas price increases. Price increases lead to the boycott against the largest gasoline company in the country, Afriquia, owned by Minister of Agriculture, Aziz Akhannouch. Daoudi scheduled a second meeting for Wednesday, June 6, but it was postponed for Friday, after Daoudi announced his intention to resign from his ministerial duties on the same day. Daoudi’s move came after he joined a sit-in before the Parliament with protesters calling for the boycott against Centrale Danone to end, angering boycotters. On June 6, 2017, Daoudi accused oil companies in Morocco of increasing fuel prices: “It is indeed inconceivable that an operator doubles their profits from one year to another by taking advantage of liberalization.” At the time, he assured consumers that his ministry would work with all distributors to revise their margins down “so that the consumer no longer pays the price of liberalization to distributors.” El Othmani will replace Daoudi in the meeting with fuel companies in Rabat to negotiate and make agreements, according to Moroccan news outlet Medias 24.

Typically, the number of gas stations a fuel distributor owns signifies the extent of the owner’s investments. Afriquia owns more gas stations than any other gas distributor across the country, numbered at 38 gas stations in different regions. According to the chairman of the House of Representatives’ Finance Committee, Abdellah Bouanou: the number of gas stations in the country has increased by 12 percent since liberalization.  “Afriquia has nearly 22% of the stations followed by Vivo Energy (Shell) with 14% and Total with 12.5%. Petrom, Ziz, Winxo and Libya Oil follow with shares between 7.5% and 8.7%.”  He explained that some companies’ “profits went from 300 million dirhams to 900 million dirhams between 2015 and 2016 thanks to the liberalization of fuel prices.”

Rabat – The coach of Togo’s national football team, Claude Le Roy, has high hopes for the African teams competing in the 2018 World Cup in Russia, especially for Morocco and Senegal. The coach of Togo since April 2016, Claude Le Roy is an important voice in African football. The 70-year-old French technician—who once coached Cameroon, Senegal, Ghana and Congo—is confident about the two African teams. “I’m betting on Morocco and Senegal” said Le Roy during an interview with French outlet l’Equipe, adding that he sees Morocco winning against Portugal. “Effectively, I see Morocco because Hervé Renard is training them. More seriously, they will give a lot of trouble to many people, with their block very well organized, I see them finish in front of Portugal,” he added. After 20 years away, Morocco will be making an appearance in the 2018 World Cup. The odds are against them since they have been placed in a group with tough teams, Spain and Portugal.  However, the team may surprise the world as it started off strong by winning the pre-World Cup friendly game against Slovakia (2-1). The next friendly game of the Atlas Lions will take place on June 9 against Estonia on their home turf, six days before Morocco’s first World Cup match against Iran on June 15. The Atlas Lions will play against Portugal in their second game on June 20 and against Spain on June 25 in Morocco’s final first-round match.

By Mary Ann Callahan New York – Since its inception in August 2017 in the wake of the fork, Bitcoin Cash has gained momentum in popularity. With a market cap of nearly USD 17.3 billion, the cryptocurrency is rising steadily. The BCH price reached an all-time high of around USD 4,000 in December 2017 but has come down to USD 1,000 as of May 30. There are many triggers for such meteoric rises and falls of BCH. Market predictions indicate Bitcoin Cash has decent investment potential. Why, where and how can investors buy BCH safely? Formed as a spin off from the original Bitcoin (BTC) in 2017, Bitcoin Cash eliminated the drawbacks in BTC, like its scalability, which resulted in slower and more expensive transactions. Because of the decentralized format of the BTC network, the cryptocurrency faced several barriers to increasing its block size. This resulted in a historical fork in the road, leading to the launch of BCH. BCH sped up transactions by increasing the size of the blocks to 8 MB initially and 32 MB in 2018.  The key difference between BTC and BCH is the size of individual blocks.  While BTC has a block size limit of 1 MB, it first increased to 8 MB and was further extended to 32MB. The larger block leads to easier mining capability for BCH. BCH transactions are faster, cheaper, and smoother than those of BTC. Thus Bitcoin Cash is a more efficient cryptocurrency for customers who want to move, sell, or buy funds. In short, it is functional while Bitcoin is more collectible. Another important difference between the two is that the mining difficulty varies based on the number of miners mining the cryptocurrency. A large number of miners mining Bitcoin Cash will be paid a lower amount as opposed to fewer miners doing the same work who will be paid higher. This mechanism keeps inflationary forces in check and lowers transaction fees while the processing times are faster.  Thus BCH has potential for scalability and adaptability, fueling interest in Bitcoin Cash and increasing its prices. Because the Bitcoin Cash community aims to make it reliable, scalable, and with minimal transaction fees through protocol upgrades, its future prospects as an investment seem bright. Now that you have seen the inherent value of BCH and may wish to purchase it, below are some of the ways you can do so: If you own other cryptocurrencies or even Bitcoin, there are many services which allow you to trade BCH instantly with cryptocurrencies. Purchasing the cryptocurrencies supported by these services in fiat currency, such as USD, is also possible.  With BCH, several exchanges permit payments via credit cards, PayPal, or debit cards. These options are possible only with a few platforms, but the entire process takes minutes. You can buy Bitcoin Cash with cash via peer-to-peer marketplaces. You place an order and can even make use of escrow services. Ensure that you deal with a reputable platform and steer clear of fraudulent or scam sites. You should check certain factors before you choose this option: Some exchanges allow wire transfers for depositing money to purchase Bitcoin Cash. This system is slower than the rest and might sometimes take up to several days. While deciding on cryptocurrency exchanges, make sure you use reliable sites. Below are the top 3 exchanges you should consider: This reputable exchange has several years of experience in cryptocurrency and was among the first to introduce BCH. CEX.IO accepts multiple payment methods for purchasing Bitcoin Cash: cryptocurrencies, wire transfers (SEPA/SWIFT allowed), credit cards, or debit cards. The exchange supports GBP, USD, and EUR. Pros Cons Coinbase has over 13 million customers, so it can rightly be called one of the largest exchanges. Coinbase was not the pioneer exchange listing Bitcoin Cash after the fork, but it was added to the platform in December 2017. Users can benefit from the following payment methods: bank account, credit card, or debit card.  Pros  Cons This exchange has a long-standing reputation, operating since 2011. On Kraken, BCH can be traded against BTC, USD and EUR. Fiat deposits are made through bank transfers with SEPA and SWIFT enabled. Unlike CEX.IO and Coinbase, Kraken supports a large number of altcoins along with Bitcoin Cash. Pros  Cons Bitcoin Cash is still evolving, building on its strengths and gearing up to face new challenges put forth by other emerging altcoins. While it is comparatively advantageous over Bitcoin in terms of cheap and fast transactions, the investment potential of the cryptocurrency depends on its future performance. In general, the cryptocurrency market is a highly volatile one. With more regulation and speculation dominating the market, it is up to individual preference whether BCH is a viable alternative currency. Sponsored Content

Rabat – The Justice and Development Party (PJD) has denied receiving the resignation of Minister General Affairs Minister Lahcen Daoudi during its extraordinary meeting held on Wednesday night. A statement published by PJD on Friday notes that it learned about his intention to resign and “hailed his courageous decision,” but never received his resignation request. Since the launch of the boycott against three prominent companies in April, Daoudi angered boycotters by defending Centrale Danone and saying in May that the boycott is going on for “no reason.” On Tuesday, Daoudi joined Centrale Danone employees in a sit-in protesting the boycott in front of Parliament. His show of solidarity caused outrage as Moroccans expressed extreme anger for his stance against citizens’ demands and his rejection of claims of unjustified increases in prices. The uproar lead to Daoudi’s resignation. The PJD denied that Daoudi participated in the meeting of the General Secretariat of the party on Wednesday and that Daoudi’s resignation was discussed, saying it “was not part of the party’s meeting agenda.”  However, the PJD’s statement of the PJD contradicts a press release published by the party on Wednesday night after the extraordinary meeting. On Wednesdays’ statement, the party denounced Daoudi’s participation in the sit-in as “unreasonable and inappropriate.” The party also “appreciated” that the minister asked to be dismissed from his ministerial responsibility. To date, King Mohammed VI has not approved Daoudi’s resignation request, as required by the Moroccan constitution. Accordingly, Daoudi participated in the Government Council of Thursday in Rabat.

Rabat – The Italian club AS Roma has reached out to its former defender Benatia to get intelligence on his teammate Hakim Ziyech. After the club’s failure to recruit the Ajax attacking midfielder during the winter transfer, AS Roma hopes to reach a preliminary agreement with Ajax to acquire Ziyech, who expressed his wish to leave Ajax this summer. According to Corriere dello Sport, AS Roma’s director Monchi has called the Captain of the national team Mehdi Benatia who played for the Italian club from 2013-2014 to ask about Ziyech’s skills, as the two footballers will play together in the national team during the World Cup. “Good technically, comfortable on the left side, able to change pace and precise passer,” said the Juventus defender, comforting the leader of the Serie A club about his choice of recruiting the 25-year-old. AS Roma wants to recruit Ziyech and his teammate Kluivert for 40 million. According to the latest news, Ziyech should soon be signing. The Italian club has been in negotiation with Ajax since the fourth quarter of 2016. The club will have to face feirce competition as the Atlas Lion is courted by more than 6 clubs including Inter Milan, Atlético Madrid, Dortmund, and Marseille. Hakim Ziyech has repeated his hopes of leaving his current club, Ajax Amsterdam, prior to the summer mercato (transfer window). The Moroccan football player has also announced that he will probably not be staying in the Netherlands. In an interview with the local media Algemeen Dagblad, Ziyech—voted best player in Ajax in the 2015-16 season—explained that he had maximized his opportunity to develop in the Netherlands. “I need a new challenge. At some point, it’s time to go. Of course, I wasn’t at by best sometimes, but I feel that I need [something to] click by changing my environment,” said the Moroccan international. The Mercato (trade) aside, Ziyech will be busy this summer playing alongside Hervé Renard’s Atlas Lions during the the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

Rabat – With the incredible advances in technology and the unprecedented pace at which Morocco’s companies are adapting to the fast-moving world of global exchanges and interconnections, cyber criminality is rapidly becoming a major concern for Morocco’s giants in IT-related fields, including sectors like industry, services, and communication. According to a recent study, Moroccan firms are now allocating 11 percent of their budgets to the fight against cyber attacks. The study, which explored the “Global State of information security survey,” indicates that Morocco, now a rapidly industrializing country, is no longer on the fringe of the constant and worrying reality of internet-based frauds and crimes. Faced with a rampant surge of cyber attacks that targeted their counterparts in other parts of the world, the majority of Moroccan respondents are reported to have listed the fight against cyber criminality as one of the major priorities of their security plans.  The study found that Moroccan giants’ concern with cyber warfare is most vivid in the amount of money they’ve been investing in the fight against cyber criminality since 2017. In effect, whereas Moroccan firms now spend 11 percent of their budgets on countering internet-based threats, the world’s average is just 4 percent, a figure significantly lower than Morocco’s. For all of their efforts, however, Moroccan companies still consider themselves utterly exposed and defenseless against high-level and very sophisticated software used by highly trained hackers. More than 70 per cent of respondents acknowledged that their current security mechanisms are not up to the standards of the constantly shifting cyber warfare ecosystem, the study revealed.  “Moroccan firms are facing new challenges coming from an important pressure due to an increasing digitization. Despite a security budget relatively more significant [than that of other countries], the multiplicity of stakes in a short pan give the impression of an insufficient budget,” said Nabil Kettani, Associate Digital Manager at PwC Morocco.  On Kettani’s account, the sophistication of threats and the never-ending emergence of new factors and players render Moroccan giants constantly exposed, easy prey of a ruthlessly competitive IT world. For him, the 11 percent of budget currently allocated to fighting against cyber attacks is considerably insignificant given the nature and context of attacks. The survey further noted the lack of “proactivity” and “maturity” in the governance and defense mechanisms of Morocco’s IT groups. While threats are ubiquitous, companies have developed few or no strategies to counter or even detect whether they’ve been attacked or not. For example, while 70 percent of respondents reported detecting less than 50 attacks in the past twelve months, 10 percent declared zero attack. More worrying, 39 percent declared not being strategically or technically able to identify whether or not they’ve been targeted by cyber criminals.  “If the number of detected cyber attacks is less significant in Morocco compared to the rest of the world, it is mainly because the majority of companies can’t detect attacks even when they’ve been targeted,” Nabil Kettani noted, explaining that Moroccan stakeholders in the IT domain have to show more resolve in coming to terms with this rampant but slightly ignored worrying phenomenon. “In general, Moroccan companies only react after incidents have already occurred. They are rarely proactive, and have a long way to go to attain an acceptable level of [strategic] maturity in light of the threats to be countered.”

Rabat – Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi recognized on Thursday that the cabinet needs to tackle the issue of gasoline prices, which have been heavily criticized since the launch of the major boycott against the exorbitant prices of products on April 20. El Khalfi said following Thursday’s government council that the cabinet “is aware of the problem of hydrocarbon prices and the need to find practical solutions to this issue.” El Khalfi also promised that the government has been following the issue and studying possibilities to solve it. The minister asserted  that the issue was discussed at the level of the government majority and “everyone is convinced of the need to provide practical answers.” Moroccan citizens supporting the boycott have heavily criticized gasoline prices, especially those of Afriquia gas, owned by Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch. Moroccans raised their eyebrows when a leaked confidential parliamentary report about fuel distribution in Morocco showed the revenue generated by fuel companies. The President of the parliamentary group of the Justice and Development Party (PJD), Abdellah Bouanou, claimed that the difference between the government’s set prices and today’s prices is nearly MAD 1 per liter. He added, “The Moroccan market annually consumes some 6.5 million tons [of fuel]. So, we easily reach 7 billion dirhams in one year of additional profit.” He said that some companies expanded their revenue since the liberalization of fuel pricing. “Their profits went from 300 million dirhams to 900 million dirhams between 2015 and 2016 thanks to the liberalization of fuel prices.” El Khalfi comments on boycott El Khalfi said that the government is working to protect and support the purchasing power of Moroccans, including farmers and small farmers. On May 10, El Khalfi denounced the boycott campaign in a press briefing after the government council.  El Khalfi defended the boycotted company of Centrale Danone, emphasizing that the company’s prices are “reasonable” and their profit margin “does not exceed 20 centimes [per liter].” El Khalfi then said that online activists are “circulating false information.” “Spreading false allegations is an illegal practice that does not fall under the freedom of expression,” he added.

Rabat – Namibia has announced its intention to vote against Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid, becoming the third African country to shun the Moroccan candidate, after South Africa and Liberia. Although FIFA pledges no political interference in its tournaments, several African countries backed their decision to vote for the North American bid due to politics. Namibian news sources linked the country’s decision to its stance on the Western Sahara conflict. The country has supported the independence claims of the separatist group, Polisario Front. While the Western Sahara could be the reason for Namibia’s stance against Morocco 2026, Donald Trump’s threatening tweet could also be a key factor behind Namibia’s pledged support for United 2026, the bid put forward by Canada, the US, and Mexico. Politics and charities before unity Politicizing sports has become a trend. South Africa, which had pledged support for Morocco 2026 in April, changed its vote a few days after US President Trump tweeted a threatening message to countries that support the African bid. “It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the US bid,” he tweeted. Trump also threatened to cut support for countries that will not support the US bid. “Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)?” Trump asked in his infamous tweet on April 26. Morocco, however, is mobilizing its bid committee to promote its bid until the last day. CEO of the Moroccan bid Hicham El Amrani told the BBC on May 11 that no one is “forced” to back the Moroccan bid “if he believes that it doesn’t serve the country or the country’s football interest.” “Even if Africa has always acted in unity, unity does not mean 100% of all the member associations, this is part of the democratic process.” US Pressure Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported today that US ambassadors in several countries have been conveying Trump’s threatening message to withhold aid. Trump’s tweet may have also influenced Saudi Arabia, which publicly announced its support for the United 2026 bid on June 5, to protect its national interests. Liberia also announced its support for the US 2026 World Cup on May 25, while Uganda said it is not sure to which bid it should give its vote. The FIFA task force that evaluated the bids gave Morocco the green light to move to the ballot on June 1. Football federations from all corners of the world will meet in Moscow on June 13 to cast their vote for one of the two bids.

Rabat – Morocco has made a lot of progress to maintain peace. The Kingdom is one of the most peaceful countries in North Africa and the Middle East, according to the Global Peace Index 2018. Morocco has moved up 4 places since 2017 and 19 places since 2016. With a score of 1,979, Morocco ranks 71st out of 163, in the report published June 6 by the Institute of Economics and Peace. The country is more peaceful than its neighbors Tunisia (78), Algeria (109), Mauritania (127), and Libya, which ranks 157th, among the countries with the lowest level of peace. As for the MENA region, Morocco is fourth, behind Qatar (56), the United Arab Emirates (45), and Kuwait (42). Each year the acts of violence perpetrated on the national territory cost nearly 6 percent of the GDP in Morocco, 8 percent in Tunisia, and 11 percent in Algeria. Mauritania has reached 12 percent, and Libya has the highest percentage with 26 percent of GDP. The report notes slight improvement in the Middle East and North Africa region’s overall score. “However, despite ongoing armed conflict and instability in the region, it did become marginally more peaceful over the last year. The bulk of the improvement occurred on the safety and security domain, particularly in terrorism impact and the number of refugees fleeing conflict.” “The scores in both Iraq and Syria improved: although the conflict is no less bitter, the diminishing geographic reach of ISIL and other rebel groups means that overall levels of violence have diminished,” added the report. Internationally speaking, Iceland is still the most peaceful country in the world, followed by New Zealand and Austria. States at the bottom of the ranks are ravaged by war. Thus, Syria is considered the least peaceful country in the world (163), preceded by Afghanistan (162) and South Sudan (161). The ranking of regions was unchanged from 2017, with Europe as the most peaceful region and the Middle East and North Africa as the least peaceful.

Rabat- In Thursday’s Government Council meeting, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi revealed that 329,395 students took the baccalaureate final exam, which began June 5 and ends Friday, June 8. Quoting a statement by Minister of Education Said Amzazi, El Khalfi said that out of the 440,000 students enrolled in the baccalaureate 2017-2018 school year, 329,395 sat for the examination, which represented an increase compared to 2017 when approximately 325,000 students took the exam. He added that the Ministry recorded an absence rate of 3 percent and that the number of “free” baccalaureate candidates who showed up for the exam reached 49,571. “Free” baccalaureate candidates are those who do not attend classes during school year due to health reasons, work, or a prison sentence. Despite the Ministry of Education’s firm measures to prevent cheating during baccalaureate exams, including the installation of cameras in classrooms, the ministry stated that it recorded 1,267 cases of cheating across the country, 86 percent of which occurred through the use of mobile phones. During the meeting, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani warned that there are some non-student entities who are experts in cheating and take pride in it as their profession. El Othmani also explained that the baccalaureate cheating rate has dropped by 20 percent compared to last year when it fell by 60 percent compared to 2016. He said that additional efforts should be made to further decrease the rate. In 2016, the Ministry of Education prosecuted more than 3,048 cases of baccalaureate cheating. El Othmani applauded efforts to raise awareness about cheating and to reduce it, emphasizing that the Moroccan baccalaureate diploma has great value both nationally and internationally and should be granted only to those who truly deserve it. Failure to do so could harm Morocco’s reputation. On the first day of the exam, photos of exam questions in science, physics, and Arabic were leaked on social media. Students have also been active on Whatsapp groups that provide answers to the baccalaureate exam questions, according to the Ministry of Education, which has tracked the people who leaked the photos.

Rabat – Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan, indicted for sexual assault of several women, confessed to having five extramarital affairs, including one with the complainant Mounia R, during his hearing with the judges, Tuesday, June 5.  Mounia R. was the third woman to accuse the Islamic scholar of raping her. The former escort-girl claimed the theologian raped her nine times between 2013 and 2014, in France, London, and Brussels. “Yes, I happened to have had extramarital affairs. There are two types of things in my life, it was a lot of virtual relationships and proven extramarital relationships,” Ramadan said.  Asked about the contradiction between these relations and the religious morality he preaches, he replied: “I had ups and downs, times where I was totally consistent with my principles and others where I was more fragile,” reports French outlet France Inter radio. According to France Inter, which received access to his statements, the Islamic Scholar asserted that he is the one who has been harassed. When questioned by the investigating judges on Tuesday, Ramadan claimed that women are the ones “who are coming to get me.” “I go to Le Bourget [French commune] for a conference, and the police must take three women out of the bathroom because I come in.” He explained that he was “not only solicited as an intellectual, but also as a man,” as much by women as by men. To date, three women have accused Ramadan of rape. Ramadan denied all charges against him, but admitted to having relations with one of the complainants. Ramadan has been held by authorities since his arrest in January, pending his trial. The defense team presented the court with several release requests. The latest application was rejected before the court on May 4. The scholar’s defense team also requested a new medical expert to examine Ramadan, claiming that his client’s health was incompatible with remaining in prison. The defense added that Ramadan was not receiving the necessary treatment in custody. If the charges are confirmed, the scholar will face up to 15 years in prison on the charge of rape, and up to 20 years on the separate charge of rape of a vulnerable person, since the second complainant is disabled.

Rabat- It turned out that the use of smartphones was not the only modern cheating method. A baccalaureate exam candidate from the southern city of Agadir was caught cheating, using a pen equipped with a mini camera and headset, with which he wrote the exam answers dictated by his accomplice outside the classroom. Caught red handed, the student threw a tantrum and broke the classroom windows, causing himself severe injuries. Administrators of his high school immediately transferred him to the emergency room of a local hospital in Agadir. Meanwhile the police are conducting an investigation to detect the origins of the controversial pen. The Ministry of National Education stated that 68 percent of the 1,267 cases of cheating this year occurred through mobile phones, although the ministry took strong measures to combat the problem of cheating, such as installing cameras in the classroom.

Rabat – Hamza Derhem is a free man. Better known as “Moul LFerrari” (owner of the Ferrari), the young boy was released on Tuesday, June 5, after spending a year and 14 days in the local jail of Sale. Derhem was acquitted by The Rabat court. At first instance, the court sentenced him to two years in prison. The court also acquitted all those prosecuted in the wake of this case, including his brother, and two police officers. The five suspects were charged with attempting to manipulate the accident scene, giving fraudulent statements, and removing seized physical evidence related to the investigation.  The Ferrari owner was arrested in April 2017 after uploading a video of himself driving under the influence of alcohol, taking selfies near his smashed Ferrari after crashing into three cars, while singing and making fun of police officers and other officials. His reckless behavior was condemned by Moroccan social media users, who called for a fair enforcement of the law to all citizens regardless of their wealth or social status. The intense public reaction prompted the General Directorate for National Security to arrest two police officers, the driver and two of his companions. Derham, a member of one of Morocco’s richest families, was found guilty by a Rabat court for falsifying an accident report, manipulating and fleeing an accident scene, and public intoxication. In addition to a two years jail sentence, Derham was fined MAD 20,000.

Rabat – The Moroccan air force is planning to reinforce its air fleet by acquiring twelve new-build single seat F-16 Vipers. The aircrafts will be added to the twenty-four F-16s delivered in 2011 and 2012 based at the sixth Air Base of Benguerir with hunting squadron “Falcon,” “Spark,” and ” Viper.” According to the Far-Maroc website, the Royal Moroccan Air Force (RMAF) currently has fifteen F-16C Block 52s and eight F-16D Block 52s in service.  One F-16C crashed on 10 May 2015 during combat operations conducted by the Moroccan Airforce while participating in the ‘Decisive Storm’ Operation led by the Saudi Arabia Coalition in Yemen.  Most types of aircraft, helicopters, tanks, and military materials acquired by the Moroccan Army are built in the United States.  The F-16V was introduced to the public during the Singapore Air Show in 2012. The first flight took place on 16 October 2015.

By Karen Duarte  Rabat – A week away, four years of anticipation is finally coming to an end as Russia gets ready to host the 2018 World Cup. The World Cup is bringing together 32 nations and fans have been trying to predict which team will finish where.  Thus far, Group B’s predictions have consisted of Spain in first, Portugal in second, Morocco in third, and Iran in fourth place. Spain  Fifa Ranking: 10  World Cup Appearance: 15th  Previous Best: Champions 2010 World Cup 2014: Group Stage  Prediction: First Place  As one of the most well-known football nations, Spain will enter the tournament as a favorite and defend its title as a two-time world champion. However, this year we will see a different side to the Spanish team.   The popular former Barcelona midfielder Xavi, former Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas, and former Barcelona and Atletico Madrid striker David Villa will not be participating in this year’s World Cup. Instead new players will be introduced such as, current Real Madrid attacking midfielders Isco and Marco Asensio and Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea. This squad has shown much potential and skill, and it would not be surprising to see them take first place in this group. Their first game against Portugal on June 15 will most likely determine the group’s winner.  Portugal  Fifa Ranking: 4 World Cup Appearance: 7th Previous Best: Third Place (1966) 2014: Group Stage Prediction: Second Place  Could this be the year Portugal wins its first ever World Cup? Portugal’s star player Cristiano Ronaldo immediately comes to mind. With his individual performance and successful titles with his club team, Real Madrid, the Portuguese will look up to him for inspiration in hopes of winning the tournament.  Portugal has several high-quality players and should have no trouble making it out of the group comfortably. Being crowned European Champions two years ago in France, Portugal’s only real threat is Spain.  Morocco   Fifa Ranking: 41 World Cup Appearance: 5th Previous Best: Round of 16 (1986) 2014: Did not qualify  Prediction: Third Place After 20 years, Morocco will be making an appearance in the 2018 World Cup. The odds are against them since they have been placed in a group with tough teams, Spain and Portugal. However, this team may surprise us as it started off strong by winning the pre-World Cup game against Slovakia (2-1). Iran   In hopes of getting the team to at least third place, there are a few recognizable players on the squad that may create a major impact such as national team captain and Juventus F.C. center back Mehdi Benatia and Hakim Ziyech, who plays as an attacking midfielder for Ajax Amsterdam. In order to advance to the next stage, Morocco’s squad will have to beat either Spain or Portugal.  Fifa Ranking: 37 World Cup Appearance: 5th Previous Best: Group Stage  2014: Group Stage   Prediction: Fourth Place Iran is making its second World Cup appearance in a row, but like Morocco the odds are against them progressing out of the group stage. This team, however, is well-disciplined and may have a few tricks up its sleeve.  Iran is not an attacking team, as shown by their last 10 goals in their 10 qualifying matches. However, their defense is one that is hard to breakdown. With the help of their experienced manager, Carlos Queiroz, they may give the other teams a difficult time scoring, though that may not be enough to stop Spain and Portugal.

Rabat – Even though life is generally hard for marriageable single women in the Arab world, Morocco’s number of “single independent women” is rapidly increasing, making the phenomenon a norm in Moroccan cities, especially Casablanca and Rabat. There are more than eight million Moroccan women who lead a single life, Ouest-France reported earlier this week, explaining that education level is the primary reason for the marked increase in the number of unmarried women. “I totally invest myself in my job, and I’m financially independent. I feel free now and I’d rather stay alone. Why would I need a man?” asked Aicha, a divorcee in her forties who reports to have found fulfillment and purpose in her professional achievements. Marriage, for Aicha, is a luxury rather than an imperative. She has been living with her parents since her divorce. “Solitude is a burden sometimes,” she recognizes, but hastened to add that married life is no way to achieve success or happiness. Her parents think otherwise. “We are very worried for her,” says Mbarka, Aicha’s mother. Ouest-France goes on to report that Aicha’s situation is not a one-off. In fact, the outlet maintains, it is increasingly becoming a norm, with 60 per cent or so of Moroccan women said to be single or planning to marry late. As they become more educated, women have chosen to downplay the almost religious deference that society confers upon marriage and married women. And when they do decide to marry, they tend to do it comparatively late—between their late twenties and early thirties. According to official estimates, Morocco’s average marriage age for women is now 28. In addition to this, Ouest-France reports, women with more education also tend to have higher standards when in relationships, the source added. Hanane is in her thirties and works in Tangier, where she lives alone in her apartment. She explained to the source that her family was at first reluctant to let her live alone in a different city. “They sometimes talk to me about getting married,” she said, adding that “this rather bothers me.” Despite the “patronizing gaze of society,” or the established patriarchal norms in the collective subconscience, Hanane says she’s happy with her life. When it comes to finding the “right man,” financial autonomy makes women more assertive and “more exigent.” But what about sexual frustration? How do these “old girls,” as they are called in popular parlance in Moroccan circles, cope with sexuality in a society that generally associates sexual life with marriage? “My neighbors know that I host male friends at my place,” says Hanane, acknowledging, however, that “it was complicated in the beginning.” Even men are sometimes faced with the same dilemma, explained Jobrane, a 29-year old single man. Moroccan men and women have ways of expressing their sexuality, of living a fulfilled sexual life. “We grew up with these codes.”

Rabat – Who will succeed Abderrafie Zouiten as head of the Moroccan National Tourist Office (ONMT)? That’s a question that will soon be answered, according to the Moroccan Minister Delegate in Charge of Tourism, Lamia Boutaleb. Among the favored candidates is Jamal Kilito, Marketing Director of the Office. The council of government will ultimately make the final appointment, however, of the new director of ONMT. In total, more than twenty people responded to the call for applications announced by the Ministry of Tourism. At the moment, ONMT is still is still headed by an interim worker whose legal mandate of 6 months ended on May 30th. “The call for applications has been successful and we are going to announce the name of the new Director General of the ONMT shortly. It is not impossible that it will be made public at the end of the Council of the Government of tomorrow (Thursday, June 7) but if this is not the case, the announcement is imminent,” said Boutaleb to Media24. In 2017, the Moroccan Ministry of Tourism abruptly announced the departure of Abderrafie Zouiten, who until November 30 had been the director of ONMT. “The Tourism Department appointed Rachid Hamzaoui, Finance and Administrative Director at ONMT on November 30, 2017, to act as interim Director General of the ONMT since the post of Director General of the Office had become vacant since the retirement of Abderrafie Zouiten,” said the Ministry in a statement. After being stripped of his signing authority one month ago, his departure has been controversial and handled without preparation or anticipation. According to Média24, the content of the 2017-2021 roadmap is still a mystery.  The secretary of state says that the ministry prepares tourism bases to communicate to the profession and the media. Boutaleb has assured that ti is set to be public on September. “We are going to fix a date with the private sector operators who have been involved in its design and have given us their priority recommendations to revive the tourism activity.The official announcement of the content of our strategy for the coming years will be within the framework of a great event titled, the foundations of tourism, that will take place after the summer season,” explained Boutaleb to Media24.

Rabat- Rabat authorities have conducted medical checks on the Hassan Mosque imam attacker, revealing that the culprit, who displayed signs of mental illness, was sane and sound the whole time, in contrast with the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN)’s previous assessment. The 29-year-old knifeman who attacked an imam inside Rabat’s Hassan Mosque in May and has been described by DGSN as mentally deranged, is free of any mental illness, according to Moroccan authorities after a mental health assessment. The culprit will appear before the public prosecutor at the Rabat Court of Appeals on charges of attempted murder, in accordance with the recent medical diagnosis. On May 4, the perpetrator rushed the minbar (pulpit) of the mosque during Friday prayer, wielding two knives and uttering incomprehensible words, before a group of worshippers disarmed him. A scene of the attack aired on Moroccan television channels, Al Oula and 2M. However, both channels muted the sound and quickly showed images of the outside of the mosque. Although no injuries were recorded, the incident sparked nationwide shock and outrage since it took place within a sacred space. Perplexingly similar to the incident in Rabat, a man who displayed signs of mental disorder attacked a random worshipper at Al Hamd Mosque in Casablanca in the same month. In the Casablanca case, the attacker managed to stab his victim.

Rabat – The Kingdom is receiving another prestigious distinction. Morocco has been named in the top five of the best countries in the world for excellent service by TripAdvisor’s most recent awards. The Kingdom’s ranking follows Greece (4), UK (3), Ireland (2), and Iceland (1), and comes ahead of France (6), the Netherlands (7), Italy (8), Portugal (9), and Belgium (10).

Morocco seems to be a destination on the rise, enticing visitors from abroad. Last week, Australians named the Kingdom the 5th best adventure travel destination, according to the new Adventure Travel Index compiled by Intrepid. “Camel rides through the Sahara, the stunning Atlas Mountains and the pulsating energy of Marrakech are just a few highlights of mint-tea filled Morocco. From the medieval old town of Fes to the spice markets of Marrakech, the rich history and natural beauty of Morocco await,” wrote the website.

Rabat- Not long after Benatia’s photo sheltering a little girl from rain warmed hearts, a new inspiring photo-video of a Moroccan teacher who has changed the lives of his rural students has emerged. After the young teacher moved to teach in a rural douar (village), the school’s poor condition did not discourage him from doing the job he loves. The young man took the initiative to create a fun and comfortable environment for his students who had never left their douar before. The video which recently circulated online and garnered more than two million views on Facebook, features photos capturing the bonding moments between teacher and students and how he transformed their lives with small but impactful gestures. He painted the classroom with vivid colours to make school more exciting, organized excursions around the region, taught the students how to brush their teeth, bought them clothes, and hosted occasional classroom parties and educational activities that were unfamiliar to the students before.

The teacher’s gentle heart has won over many social media users who deemed him an “exemplary” teacher who loves his job. They were also reminded of the Atlas Lions captain Mehdi Benatia’s recent photo capturing the moment he sheltered a little girl’s head from the rain with his pennant, before the pre-World Cup friendly between Morocco and Slovakia. Benatia’s photo has not only warmed the hearts of people, but also inspired the photoshop skills of Moroccan trolls who made a meme of the photo with the former Minister of General Affairs and Governance, Lahcen Daoudi, who resigned amid criticism after he joined Tuesday’s sit-in against the Centrale Danone boycott.

Rabat- Morocco’s National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) signed 15 agreements on Tuesday with the Council of the Oriental Region of Oujda, in the eastern city of Jerada to revive the socio-economic integration of youths in the region. The agreements seek to provide income opportunities for young people working in various sectors, such as agriculture and handicrafts, to employ and improve their socioeconomic status.  Along with the Oriental council, INDH allocated a total of MAD 430,000 to help young people with small business projects and integrate them into the economy. Other donating entities have increased the project’s budget to MAD 150 million, which will support them for three years. Moroccan news outlet L’economiste informed that so far the council and INDH received a total of 1,600 applications from potential youth beneficiaries. In addition to the initiative, Jerada authorities launched the construction of a formwork factory which will create approximately 500 sustainable jobs and attract investments of approximately MAD 200 million. The initiatives are aligned with King Mohammed VI’s call for the government to give special attention to social disparities, and with Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Aziz Akhannouch’s program to improve the incomes and living standards of the Jerada population through job creation. Jerada was primarily a mining area until the government closed the mines in the late 1990s. However, the locals continued to live off of mining, illegally, until two brothers died in a coal pit accident in December 2017. The deaths lead to a series of protests in recent months decrying social disparity.

Rabat- King Mohammed VI’s humanitarian aid transport dedicated to Gaza arrived at Cairo’s West Air Base Airport on Tuesday to be shipped by road to Gaza. Four Moroccan military aircraft, loaded with 113 tons of aid, including 25 tons of medicine and 5,000 blankets, landed in the Egyptian capital. Food aid will be sent to Gaza as well as to Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and Ramallah through Jordan. Morocco’s Ambassador to Egypt Ahmad Tazi received and supervised the transferring of the goods to land transports which will take them to the Gaza strip. At the sovereign’s request, a Moroccan field hospital will be built to assist the people of Gaza who witnessed and suffered the massacre of May 14 that left thousands injured and dozens killed amid protests, on the same day of the US Embassy’s inauguration celebrations in Jerusalem. The hospital is equipped to handle vascular surgery, abdominal surgery, pediatrics, traumatology, ENT, and ophthalmology. It has 97 staff, including 21 nurses and 13 doctors of the Royal Armed Forces (FAR) medical unit. Recently, the Palestinian Grand Mufti of Al-Quds, Muhammad Ahmad Hussein expressed immense appreciation for the king’s initiative, describing it as a brotherly gesture that will “mend the Palestinian wounds.” The Grand Mufti emphasized that Morocco has always stood by Palestine in hardships and that the sovereign’s act of solidarity is no surprise to Palestinians. “The wound of Palestinians is bleeding. The [King’s] assistance came to mend the wounds of Palestinians and make them realize that they are not alone but have brothers in the far Maghreb region who want to extend a hand of help,” the Mufti expressed at the press house of Tangier, during his visit to Morocco to attend the King’s Ramadan lectures.

Rabat- Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani’s office is under fire after Minister of Governance and General Affairs Lahcen Daoudi joined Centrale Danone’s sit on Tuesday. Daoudi has resigned, but his colleagues’ statements against the boycott have angered boycotting Moroccans. Moroccan boycotters have acidly criticized the government ever since the launch of the boycott campaign against three giants in the market for high prices. Boycotters seem to be losing trust in the government, considering some officials as their “enemies” for their harsh comments against the boycott. The government’s stubbornness not to hear the demands of boycotters has convinced boycotters that it represents the interests of companies more than it does of citizens. Since the launch of the boycott on April 20, seven weeks ago, the government and its officials have been urging citizens to end the boycott, fearing the consequences for the national economy. The boycotters resisted all requests and apologies, making their goal of lower prices ahead of everything. No statements could convince boycotters to end the boycott as Centrale Danone has not considered the idea that lowering its prices could avoid further damages and crisis. Instead, the government and the boycotted company denied any increase of prices since 2013, expressing reluctance to accept the public’s demands. The tension risen between boycotters and officials came after Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch, whose Afriquia gas firm is one of the boycotted companies, showed his support for Centrale Danone.  The comments of Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Boussaid fanned the flames after he called people supporting the boycott “madawikh,” translated as “morons” in English. While boycotters were expecting the government to intervene to prevent the situation from worsening, officials  singled out Centrale Danone and defended the company during interviews and press conferences. The latest action came from resigned Minister of Governance and General Affairs Lahcen Daoudi, who participated in a Tuesday night sit-in held by employees of Centrale Danone in front of the government. Daoudi’s action generated outrage nationwide, with boycotters expressing anger over his protest against the demands of citizens. The reaction of boycotters forced the Head of Government and leader of the Justice and Development Party El Othmani to harshly denounce Daoudi’s participation in the sit in, decrying it as “unreasonable and inappropriate” during an extraordinary of the party held on Wednesday night. Despite its opposition to to the boycott, the ruling PJD led by El Othmani turned its back on Daoudi.  El Othmani’s coalition said that it “appreciated” Daoudi’s resignation request to be dismissed from his ministerial responsibility. The party accepted Daoudi’s resignation, pending the approval of King Mohammed VI, in accordance with the Moroccan constitution. Moroccan press reported on Wednesday that El Othmani called Daoudi on Tuesday night to denounce his participation in the sit-in. Daoudi, however, denied this, claiming that the head of government only called him to confirm his participation. Nevertheless, the  government has long backed Centrale Danone. On May 31, El Othmani’s cabinet issued an official statement, urging citizens to avoid  further damage to the company, its partners, and foreign investment in Morocco.  After demanding the resignation of Daoudi, many Moroccans online called for the dismissal of El Othmani’s government in response to the “harsh” comments made by its ministers against the boycott and its demands. “The dismissal of Daoudi is the introduction to the dismissal of the government,” wrote a Twitter user. ????? ??????? ????? ?????? ???????#??????? — ?????? (@ZnZnZnnnnZnZnZn) June 6, 2018  “I like the idea of demanding the dismissal of government and the parliament and president of municipalities and dissolution of parties to start from scratch.”  ???????? ???? ????????? ?????? ??????? ????? ???? ????? ???????? ?????? ???????? ??? ??????? ??????? ????????? ? #??????? — ????????? (@EttayaGb) June 4, 2018  “One after one until they know the value of madawikh # boycotting,” said another on Facebook. Besides Centrale Danone, the boycott is also targeting Afriquia gas and  Sidi Ali. Unlike Centrale Danone, Sidi Ali and Afriquia gas have not announced the consequences of the boycott. Centrale Danone has made a series of statements decrying the “damaging consequences” of the boycott on its products and its workers. The boycott also forced the company to buy 30 percent  less milk from its farming partners. Danone has also broken temporary contracts with other partners.

Rabat – France and Morocco are joining forces to fight against global warming, to protect the environment, and to preserve biodiversity. The French ambassador in Morocco, Jean-François Girault, inaugurated  the French initiative “Green Embassy” on Tuesday, June 5, to allow the diplomatic representations of the Hexagon abroad to reduce their energy footprint. The initiative was conceived in the spirit of the Tangier appeal launched by King Mohammed VI and the president of the French Republic on September 20, 2015, as a relay passage between the COP21 of Paris and the COP22 of Marrakech. In 2015, the French Embassy in Rabat was one of the first diplomatic representations abroad to adopt a “Green Embassy” plan. Three years after its launch, the results are tangible: the elimination of its oil-powered boiler, the reduction of electricity consumption by 17 percent in 2017, the recycling of 10 tons of paper per year and all electronic waste, and the development of a sustainable garden that consumes little water. These measures, consistent with the efforts made by Morocco, particularly in terms of sustainable housing, have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent. Speaking on this occasion, Girault stated that the French Embassy in Rabat is committed to reducing its environmental impact, through the implementation of a green embassy approach, noting that this approach is not isolated, but concerns the entire French diplomatic network abroad. For his part, the Minister of Spatial Planning, Urban Planning, Housing, and Urban Policy, Abdelahad Fassi Fihri, explained that the Green Embassy is an exemplary experience that makes a significant contribution to the fight against climate change. Moreover, Fassi Fihri is calling for green initiatives to draw on this experience and generalize it at the level of national administrations.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of General Affairs and Governance, Lahcen Daodi has asked the head of the government to relieve him from his position. The decision comes following the uproar that Daoudi caused after he took part Tuesday night in a sit-in against the ongoing boycott targeting three companies, Centrale-Danone, Sidi Ali and Afriquia. The move caused the displeasure of Morocco’s head of government, who called for an extraordinary meeting of the Party of Justice and Development on Wednesday night. According to a communique released following the extraordinary meeting, the politburo of the PJD accepted the resignation of Lahcen Daoudi. In the communique, a copy of which was obtained by Morocco World News, the General Secretariat of the PJD considered Daoudi’s participation in the sit-in as ” unreasonable and inappropriate.” “The members of PJD appreciate that brother Lahcen Daoudi asked to be dismissed from his ministerial responsibility,” it added. On Tuesday night, the Moroccan Minister who made no secret of his support of the Centrale-Danone, appeared in a video chanting slogans denouncing the boycott’s reported “negative effect” on the Moroccan economy. His presence at the sit-in caused an unprecedented backlash on social media with thousands of Moroccans describing it as “irresponsible” and “unworthy” of an incumbent minister. For the resignation of Daoudi to become effective, it will require the approval of King Mohammed VI, as set out in the Moroccan constitution. According to article 47, “the Head of Government can demand of the King to terminate the functions of one or more members of the government who make their individual or collective resignation.”

Rabat- A Moroccan man living in Les Lands in southeastern France was shot and killed by his neighbor in his own home. Authorities placed the culprit in detention on charges of “racially motivated murder,” reported French news outlet 20 Minutes on Tuesday. The incident took place on May, 20 when the attacker used a 22 long rifle to shoot his 39-year-old neighbor five times in the leg, arm, back, and shoulder, causing the victim a severe spine injury. The two neighbors were engaged in a verbal fight over a parking space when the culprit shot his neighbor with a rifle in his home. Following hospitalization, the victim returned to his family with bullets still in his back since they were too close to the spinal cord to remove without risking paralyzing him.Shortly afterwards, he collapsed and was transferred to Bordeaux University Hospital where he was declared brain dead on Monday afternoon. The deceased man’s lawyer, Frédéric Dutin told the same source that the victim was very distressed because of his injuries and told him before his death: “I cannot carry my children anymore, I will not be able to go to work anymore because I could be paralyzed in a second.” The perpetrator is currently in detention on charges of committing a hate crime, while investigations are still ongoing to pinpoint any medical complications that could have contributed to the man’s death.

A massive number of North African migrants have found themselves trapped in detention centers across Libya following their illegal attempt to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. The number of irregular migrants in Libya reached 700,000 by the end of 2017. Several Moroccan migrants shared videos in 2017 and early 2018, urging the Moroccan government to bring them back home.

By Karen Duarte Rabat – The German Football Association (DFB) is still uncertain as to which of the two bids to host the 2026 World Cup it will support. The competing offers are: a joint North American bid from the United States, Canada and Mexico and one from Morocco. The FIFA Council will vote on the bids at the 68th FIFA Congress on Wednesday, June 13 in Moscow. FIFA has judged Morocco’s bid to be “high-risk” because of a lack of infrastructure, transportation, and accommodations. There has also been “allegations that president Gianni Infantino has tried to undermine Morocco’s bid.” Although Morocco should reach FIFA’s stadium and infrastructure requirements in time for the tournament, North America’s bid would allow FIFA to concentrate on other aspects of the tournament. In the North America bid evaluations, FIFA says that they will “focus on a number of exciting initiatives related to sports science, fan engagement, multimedia interaction, and other new forms of digitalization.”  However, the North African country is believed to be popular among many of the voting countries. According to German weekly sports magazine Sport Bild, DFB President Reinhard Grindel said his association has yet to make a decision as to which bid it will support. “FIFA’s bid evaluation favors North American because task force sees advantages in the areas of stadium, transport, as well as ticketing and hospitality,” he said. “But in fairness, we will now await the debate over the FIFA Council report. Only after that will the DFB delegation make a decision on which bid to back.”

That was unexpected. Rabat – The Embassy of Israel has responded to Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who called the Jewish state a “cancerous tumor” that must be “removed” on Twitter with a mocking GIF. Israel mocked Iran’s threats to destroy it on Monday, responding to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah with an animated GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)on Twitter, where it wrote “Why are you so obsessed with me?” featuring American actress Rachel McAdams from the 2004 American comedy, “Mean Girls.”  The Embassy’s tweet went quickly viral, generating 27,750 retweets and thousands of reactions from social media users who were shocked by the unusual reaction. “2018 is wild,” “I was not expecting that at all,” “if the embassy of Israel really just replied to Khamenei with a Regina George GIF, we are living in an alternative universe,” commented the public whose opinions seemed to be divided regarding this tweet. If some thought that the GIF was inappropriate and childish, others applaud the creativity of the embassy’s answer. These reactions come after a series of tweets in which Khamenei harshly criticized Israel for its handling of the Hamas’ protests along the Gaza border. “Our attitude towards Israel is the same as always,” he said. “#Israel is a malignant cancerous tumor in the West Asia region that must be eradicated: it is possible and it will happen,” he wrote in another tweet.

Rabat – In an unprecedented move, Minister of Governance and General Affairs Lahcen Daoudi participated Tuesday night in a sit-in held by workers at Centrale Danone in front of the parliament in Rabat. The minister’s participation sparked outrage among Centrale Danone boycotters who decried Daoudi as the first minister to stand against the demands of citizens. Approximately 2,000 workers of the dairy company protested in a sit-in held late on Tuesday in front of the parliament. Daoudi, along with the protesters,  chanted slogans against the boycott that is targeting the high prices of the company’s products. The workers were protesting losing their jobs after a month and a half of the boycott, which started on April 20. Carrying banners denouncing the boycott, the workers also blamed the government for “degrading the purchasing power of Moroccans,” according to Reuters. 
Daoudi angers El Othmani? Several Moroccan media outlets reported that Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has expressed anger over the participation of Daoudi in the sit in. Sources close to El Othmani also claimed that he called on Daoudi to denounce his participation in the sit-in. Daoudi, however, denied that El Othmani expressed anger. “He called me to ask if I was participating in the sit-in and I confirmed affirmatively.” He added that the workers asked him to participate in the boycott and he accepted their request. “I am a citizen before being a minister,” said Daoudi.

 Daoudi, “spokesperson” for Centrale Danone The workers’ protest did not surprise boycotters as much as Daoudi’s participation. Criticizing Daoudi,  a boycotter tweeted: “Is Daoudi the Minister of Agriculture or the owner of Centrale Danone?” ????:
??????? ???? ??????? ?? ???? ???? ??????. ?
?????? ????? ?? ?????? ???? ???? ????????. — Said Noussi (@noussielec) June 6, 2018  Daoudi has been subject to backlash since the launch of the boycott for statements he made to the Moroccan press. Defending Centrale Danone, the minister said in an interview with Moroccan television channel Al Oula on May 31 that the boycott is ongoing for “no reason,” adding that the “instigators of this movement are playing with fire.” He also claimed that the company’s profit margin is 0.9 percent.  Many people supporting the boycott have heavily criticized and trolled Daoudi for his statements on social media. The photo of Moroccan football player, Mehdi Benatia, who sheltered a little girl from the rain during a friendly game against Slovakia, has provoked boycotters. A Twitter posted an edited photo of the footballer, depicting Daoudi sheltering Centrale Danone from running boycotters. «Au Maroc, gouverner c’est pleuvoir» – Theodore Steeg

The company also announced a loss of MAD 150 million in the first half of 2018 on June 4. For the past seven weeks, the government and officials of Centrale Danone have been calling on citizens to end the boycott on Centrale Danone. Boycotters, however, declined the request, demanding the company to lower its prices. The campaign is also targeting Sidi Ali mineral water and Afriquia gas. The government, however, has yet to take a stance regarding the boycott against the other two companies.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has instructed the cabinet to order the construction of river and hill dams to help alleviate water scarcity in rural zones of the country. In a meeting he chaired yesterday at the Royal Palace of Rabat, the King decided, based on the conclusions of the commission he appointed in October 2017, to address the water shortage in the country.  A statement from the Royal Cabinet wrote that the King ordered the “construction of dams of different capacities (large, medium and small), as well as hill dams as soon as possible and in different regions of the kingdom. ” The monarch also called on the commission to consider the establishment of desalination plants and to ensure continuation of the program to save water in agricultural fields. According to the statement, the King has also ordered the government to launch an awareness campaign in partnership with NGOs and other intuitions to raise public awareness of the importance of water and its conservation. In October 2017, the King chaired a council of ministers, during which he called on the government to address the scarcity of drinking water in rural zones and mountains. The King has also appointed a commission led by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani to address this issue in order to find appropriate solutions. Tuesday’s meeting took place in the presence of El Othmani; the King’s advisor Fouad Ali El Himma; Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit; Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch; Minister of Energy and Mining Aziz Rabbah; State Secretary for Water Charafat Afilal; and Director of the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water Abderrahim El Hafidi.

Rabat – Argentina has called off its pre-World Cup warmup game with Israel amid controversies and criticism targeting the national squad and “Captain Lionel Messi,” Argentinian press reported on Tuesday. Argentinian sports outlet Minutouno announced that the national team’s last pre-World Cup warm up match, which was set to be played in West Jerusalem on June 9, has been “suspended amid escalating violence, threats, and criticism.” The move followed waves of protests initiated last week by the chief of the Palestinian football federation, Jibril Rajoub, and the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions), the global pro-Palestinian advocacy movement. Both parties urged Argentinian authorities to boycott “Israel’s politicization of a sports event” and called on fans and pro-Palestinians around the world to boycott Messi and teammates should they travel to Jerusalem. Speaking to ESPN after Argentina’s cancellation of the match, striker Gonzalo Higuain gave the decision a nod, arguing that it was the best course of action given the circumstances. “In the end, they’ve done the right thing, and this is behind us. Health and common sense come first,” the Juventus star said. ‘Nothing Friendly’ The decision was widely celebrated by pro-Palestinian supporters and human rights advocates, with thousands taking to social media to express their support for the Latin American country’s decision to heed their pleas. For some, the decision, however symbolic, is a decisive win for the BDS and the cause it espouses. “Argentina says no to Israeli friendly match. Argentina says yes to BDS. Palestine and the world say thank you,” one user wrote on Twitter. “There is nothing friendly about Israel shooting Palestinian footballers,” wrote another, casting a modicum of irony on the “friendly” aspect often ascribed to international fixtures. The BDS, which last month initiated a wider campaign to persuade Argentina to withdraw from the fixture, described the game as a “political tool” that Israel sought to use to “cover up attacks on Palestinians on and off the field.” “There is nothing friendly about military occupation and apartheid. Don’t play Israel until Palestinians’ human rights are respected,” the group said. There are reports that the boycott movement gained momentum after footage went viral of a Palestinian football player, Mohammed Khalil Obeid,  being shot on his knees by Israeli snipers. In a later video, Obeid urged Lionel Messi to “stand in solidarity” with his Palestinian fans.  “I call on the Argentinian team and especially captain Lionel Messi—because he is very popular in Palestine, particularly in the Gaza Strip—to stand in Solidarity with Palestinians and to boycott the scheduled game with Israel, which is occupying our land,” Obeid said. Amid celebrations in Gaza and Ramallah, the Palestinian football federation issued a statement thanking Messi and his teammates for calling off Saturday’s game. “The Palestinian FA thanks Argentina’s players led by star Messi for refusing to be used to serve a non-sporting goal,” the statement read. Jibril Rajoub, the chairman of the Palestinian FA, called the cancelation a victory for Palestine and the values shared by people supporting its cause. “Values, morals, and sport have secured a victory today and a red card was raised at Israel through the cancellation of the game,” Rajoub declared. Attempts to Rescue the game While pro-Palestinian circles called for boycott, the Argentina versus Israel game attracted significant attention in Israel. Israeli fans were reported to be very excited at the prospect of Messi’s visit. According to Israeli news outlets, tickets to the game sold out in 20 minutes, indicating that the prospective visit of Messi and teammates was as relished by Israeli fans as it was loathed in pro-Palestinian circles. Although Israeli officials—both the government and the football federation— are yet to react to news of the cancellation, there are reports in the Israeli press that say that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Argentina’s president Mauricio Macri to ask him to “intervene” and “persuade” the Argentinian national squad not to cancel their visit to Jerusalem. However, the same sources added, quoting anonymous diplomatic sources, “chances of salvaging the game are very slim.”

Rabat- Moroccan sensation Saad Lamjarred has forgone his typical pop lyrics in exchange for more religious lyrics and his fans are loving it. Lamjarred surprised the public when he released his song “Ya Allah.” Far from his usual pop style, the Moroccan singer, who achieved great success with his track “Ghazali,” has decided to try something new this Ramadan, with a religious song called “Ya Allah.” His recent legal controversy have not stopped him from producing music. Released on Monday, June 4, the clip, which does not feature him, is already trending #4 on Youtube with 2, 2 million views. The song was produced by Moroccan producer Jalal Hamdaoui, and the lyrics were written by Salah Kurdi, a Lebanese composer and musician who works with many artists from the Middle East. On social media, the public appears to be seduced by Lamjarred’s new genre. “Mashallah you have an angelic voice,” “I really love your new style of music,” “Thank you for the amazing song,” commented fans. The Moroccan singer, who has chosen to spend Ramadan in Morocco this year, made the headlines earlier this week. Appointed to the Court of Great Instance (TGI) in Paris on Monday, June 4, for a medical expert opinion in summary, the singer of “Ghazali,” represented by one of his lawyers, has contested the request for a medical examination from the complainant, Laura Prioul. In addition, Lamjarred is suing Prioul for defamation over her legal request.

Rabat – The South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) has reportedly turned down a request from Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid committee for a last presentation of its bid before the FIFA vote. While the Moroccan committee has announced its determination to promote its bid to host the World Cup in 2026 until the deadline, CONMEBOL refused the North Africans a chance to make a final presentation of the bid before June 13, when football associations will sit to vote for their favorite candidate. International sports outlet ESPN reported yesterday that the South American confederation promised to vote for United 2026 in April.  “We have to answer with a refusal to your request due to the fact that the time available for presentations at the Moscow meeting will be limited,” CONMEBOL wrote in their refusal letter to the Moroccan committee, according to ESPN. The South American confederation backed up its argument, saying that it has already heard Morocco’s presentation. “Your BID has already presented the project to our Council Members,” in May, CONMEBOL said. Finishing its statement, the confederation added that it has already “confirmed its commitment to support the Canada, Mexico and USA bid.” Morocco World News contacted FIFA today to inquire about whether it has a stance regarding such situations, but did not receive any answer yet. Morocco’s bid has clinched the right to go to the last phase to compete with United 2026 for the hosting rights of the tournament. The FIFA Task Force validated the Moroccan bid as an eligible host on June 1. The Moroccan bid committee has been touring Gulf countries in the recent weeks. The committee landed in Qatar, Oman, and the Emirates, hoping to get their votes to host the World Cup 2026. 
The bid committee has convinced several countries to support the North African bid, including France, Qatar,  Botswana, Nigeria, France, Russia, Palestine, Luxembourg, Qatar, Tunisia, Algeria, Belgium, Saint Lucia, and Serbia.

Rabat – “Côte d’Ivoire is in favor of this accession,” said Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara as he endorsed Morocco’s bid to join the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) during a recent interview with Jeune Afrique. In his interview, the president underscored the importance for the community to open up to other African nations. According to the president, Morocco’s accession is beneficial, “because we consider that enlarging the economic space is good for growth.” Ouattara also added that the ECOWAS commission has been mandated to study the issue, and two summits have already discussed it. “As far as we are concerned, we are in favor of Morocco’s accession,” he said. He also raised the question of why the community “can’t open up to countries like Morocco, Mauritania or Chad,” adding that such accessions would “be good for all of us and in line with the free trade area of the African continent.” Morocco announced its desire to join the ECOWAS in February 2017. The North African country aims to strengthen the cultural, economic, and diplomatic links uniting Morocco and ECOWAS member countries. In March, Speaker of ECOWAS Parliament Moustapha Cissé Lo announced his support for Morocco’s bid to access ECOWAS at a conference in Rabat held under the title “Towards a Better Movement of People and Goods between African countries.” Cissé Lo said that Morocco’s accession to ECOWAS will undoubtedly add value to the community, asserting that his parliament will “fully play its role in the process of Morocco’s admission to ECOWAS.”

Rabat – Despite the praise Morocco receives from international observers and partner countries for its anti-terrorism efforts, Morocco’s security authorities think there is more to do to shield the country against transnational terrorism and other criminal networks. Morocco’s success in the fight against terrorism, radicalization, and ideology-associated violence or crime is globally acknowledged. In a recent interview with Moroccan outlet Le Site Info, Abdelhak Khiame, Director of the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ)—one of Morocco’s most recognizable elite units—gave a comprehensive account of Morocco’s success on the anti-terrorism front. “Numerous Challenges Ahead” While lauding the marked improvements that the BCIJ has brought to the “Moroccan security architecture,” the BCIJ director had some reservations regarding the “numerous challenges ahead.” Khiame is concerned about rehabilitating ISIS returnees and managing Moroccan combatants stranded in combat zones who plan to return to Morocco as soon as circumstances allow them. Calling the BCIJ a “super police,” Khiame explained that since the inception of the BCIJ in 2015, Morocco’s security system has been “essentially effective,” especially in its ability to identify and thwart security threats. For example, 54 terrorist cells have been dismantled as a result of the BCIJ’s numerous field operations. Khiame stated that, according to official estimates, the number of Moroccan fighters affiliated with ISIS and other transnational terrorist networks is “only 1,660 fighters.” They are disseminated throughout the MENA region, but are mainly in Iraq, Syria, and Libya. That figure also includes the 200 or so who have already returned to Morocco. Some Moroccan combatants have been reported to have died, either in combat zones or in “allied strikes.” Others have also been reported to have killed themselves in “suicide missions,” including in several European cities over the years. So, Mr. Khiame concluded, “the situation of Moroccan fighters who have not come back is uncertain.” Dealing with Returnees When asked about Morocco’s plans for former ISIS fighters now living in Morocco, he said that “preventive measures” have been taken to specifically deal with “the revenants,” the term used to refer to ISIS returnees. Within the framework of the 2015 anti-terrorist law, there are specific “legal measures” be applied depending on how the individual returned. If, for example, authorities suspect an individual’s desire to join a terrorist organization, the penalty is ten years or more in prison, depending on the gravity of the offense. All of this is done through due process, Mr. Khiame asserted. Towards the end of the interview, he briefly spoke about the state of security in Syria. He said that “Syrian refugees are welcome in Morocco” and that those who are already in the country should be treated according to international standards. The community of Syrian refugees in Morocco, he added, has a right to “Moroccan hospitality” and “in no way should they be regarded as potential threats or terrorist suspects, as they are mostly women and children.”

Rabat- Palestinian-Austrian Islamic scholar and television pundit Adnan Ibrahim has left  Morocco after Morocco’s Ministry of Religious Endowments and Islamic Affairs denied speculations that he would attend the King’s religious lectures and preach in Moroccan mosques for the rest of Ramadan. Following the online controversy stirred by news of the scholar’s attendance at the king’s “Hassania” religious lectures, new speculations have erupted in the media about the scholar’s hasty departure from Morocco. According to Moroccan news outlet, H24 info, Ibrahim spent some time in a hotel in Morocco, awaiting the ministry’s permission for him to lecture. However, because the ministry did not contact him amid the sharp criticism and condemnation expressed by religious conservatives, Ibrahim decided to leave. On June 1, administrators of Ibrahim’s official Facebook page announced his arrival in Morocco upon the ministry’s invitation to him to attend religious lectures, held during Ramadan ever since the late King Hassan II’s reign. Later, the ministry denied Ibrahim’s assertions, saying that Ibrahim was not invited to participate in any religious program, neither in mosques nor with any associations in the kingdom, and said that it prefers to keep a distance from the debates and controversy that the scholar raises. The scholar’s “liberal” or “reformist” views on Islam, such as his promotion of inheritance equality, have always provoked the criticism of more traditional or conservative Muslims. Upon learning about his arrival to preach in Morocco, many religious Moroccans strongly rejected his participation and called for the ministry to go back on its decision, believing that his approach to Islam would misguide Moroccan Muslims. “Adnan Ibrahim to preach in Morocco’s mosques!!! Does the Ministry of Islamic Affairs accept Imam mosques to spread Adnan Ibrahim’s ideas,” questioned a Facebook user.  “How could the [ministry]invite the misguided and misguiding man, Adnan Ibrahim to mislead Moroccans,” wrote another.   Last month, Saudi Arabia banned the broadcast of Ibrahim’s television show as many traditional Islamic scholars in the kingdom rose against his ideology, deeming him “dangerous.”

New York – Hosting the World Cup in 2026 will help Morocco spread its renaissance across Africa and into the Middle East, benefiting Europe and even the North American allies. For the past several years, Morocco has focused on aggressive reconstruction of its cities, many of which are becoming popular tourist attractions, while also building new infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, pipelines, and water desalination plans. Morocco is revamping its educational system, creating new skills building and jobs training programs for young professionals, hosting nearly 20 cultural festivals a year, and participating in many more abroad. Morocco is already a happening place, but after recently rejoining the African Union, it is also becoming a continental powerhouse and a rising star. Through a mixture of business deals and development aid, Morocco is helping its African neighbors combat security issues and poverty, and developing entrepreneurial and cultural ties. Hosting the World Cup, a passion of Morocco, would be the fulfillment of a lifelong dream, but at the same time a watershed moment for the country’s ambitious development plan. Morocco has been planning for the bid for years. In preparation for the deluge of fans, tourists, and sponsors, Morocco worked hard to become more presentable, refurbish cities, and modernize a country which boasts a rich and ancient cultural heritage. The World Cup would be a unifier, bringing friendly competitive challenges to the lands which are home to multiple ethnicities and religions, living peacefully side by side for thousands of years. The competition would also act as an economic, political, and cultural bridge between the rest of Africa and the Middle East with Europe. All of these regions have had some difficult recent years; coming together for a show of sportsmanship would not solve all problems, but it would provide a different vantage point due to the geographic and cultural significance of the host country to all its visitors. Hosting would also provide a ray of hope to Morocco’s aspiring neighbors. Morocco’s exemplary progress in science; technology;  energy development, boasting the largest solar field in the world; the arts; and increasing liberalization would show that any dream is achievable with hard work, vision, and a unique use of human resources. Morocco has likewise achieved an enviable level of security and stability. Spared from terrorist attacks since 2011, the country is a model to its troubled West African, Middle East, and European counterparts, many of which have benefited from Morocco’s intelligence sharing and counterterrorism expertise. Seeing that such stability is possible amidst regional turmoil could be the impetus needed towards replicating the same: the ability to host a large scale event in countries that up to this point had only thought about how to get by. Hosting the World Cup could mean that for Morocco, as potentially, for many others, the era of soft bigotry and low expectations is finally over, that their efforts have been noticed, and they are becoming equal, valuable, and valued counterparts in international human development, rather than dismissed as “developing countries” with something to prove. All of that is endangered by the joint bid of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which joined the bid race in April 2017. By all accounts, Los Angeles, along with its Canadian and Mexican sister cities, would be a fine place to host a major scale event such as the World Cup. They have the infrastructure, the funding, and they would certainly generate enough revenue to make up for the expenditure. Indeed, Morocco, in this race, is an underdog. It was ranked lower than the United States on almost all indices, except for the government support. As critics point out, a Morocco bid would require billions dollars of spending towards infrastructure development, and generate half the revenue the “United 2026” bid is projecting. But the money is actually the very reason why Morocco should be the host. Working towards a major achievement against seemingly insurmountable odds is a stimulus for an energetic, optimistic, hard-working, and talented population of a country that is striving to be a leader in Africa and to benefit much of the world with the fruits of its progress. When one has a dream, perhaps even an impossible dream, one breaks one’s own boundaries, all expectations, all glass ceilings to achieve that noble end. The fact that Morocco is ready to make those investments, which will continue to pay off for the country and its visitors long after the competition is over, should be enough of a reason for any country to vote for Morocco if it wishes to see prosperity, an economic boom, and the broadening of expertise, industries, and enterprises. FIFA and European states can be a part of something significantly greater than a one-time event. It would be easier for the United States to host the World Cup. It would also not be particularly meaningful as football is nowhere near the country’s favorite sport. In fact, it is a fine point of cultural distinctions for Americans to not care about “soccer” except during occasional championships. While the North America bid may indeed generate twice the revenue as Morocco would, in Morocco that money would go a much longer way. Morocco has waited to host the championship for so long, and finally getting that opportunity would bring an unprecedented number of investors to its shores, continuing to generate income in terms of tourists, memorabilia, additional investments, and ability to capitalize on the newly built infrastructure for decades to come. The championship would not be the end, but a beginning, a great start towards bigger and better projects. For the United States, it would be just another big event, and furthermore, it would ultimately turn into a visa-related nightmare and a logistical headache of coordinating with two other countries. If the US hosts the game, it will be forgotten the day after it is over. No one thinks about it now, and it is not creating any particular changes or stimulating any creative drives. For Morocco, it could be a significant contribution towards the positive transformation it is undergoing, which could make it a better and stronger partner for the very countries that are now expecting to cast their votes. Europe and FIFA should help Morocco’s long-standing dream come true and be part of an investment into a much brighter future for Africa, for the Middle East, and for Europe, as well.

Rabat – The Atlas Lions’ performance at the pre-World Cup friendly game against Slovakia has received loud applause and admiration from the Spanish press in the countdown to the FIFA world premier tournament. Spanish-based international sports outlets Marca and Mundo Deportivo have praised the Moroccan Atlas Lions, who confirmed that they will do their best to achieve good results in the World Cup 2018, which will kick off on June 14 in Russia. Marca wrote after the game that the Moroccan team will not have an insignificant role in the World Cup, as the Atlas Lions proved themselves a strong rival during the friendly game against Slovakia. Morocco, a tough team in a “deadly group” The other teams in Group B, dubbed “the deadly group” in the World Cup, should fear the Atlas Lions for what they can show from good performances during the competition. “Both Spain and Portugal are going to have a tough rival on their way. This was confirmed in the game that the North African team played against Slovakia on Monday,” wrote Marca. According to the news outlet, the national team has delivered a show of “speed, verticality, pressure and intensity that dismayed Slovakia at all times.” Spain aware of  Atlas Lions’ strength Marca said that the coach of the Spanish team, Julen Lopetegui, has to “take good notes of what was seen in Geneva,” where the game between Slovakia and Morocco was played.  Lopetegui has already recognized the threat Morocco poses to his team.  After the World Cup’s final draw, which took place on December 1, 2017, Lopetegui said that Morocco’s national team is “one of the toughest teams” for excluding the Ivorian team in the World Cup qualifiers. Lopetegui also told Marca in January that he believes that Morocco is the best team in Africa, adding that the Atlas Lions “achieved their objective in a wonderful way, without letting any goals and by knocking out Ivory Coast, one of Africa’s strongest teams.” For Marca, “it is clear which team was preparing” for the World Cup. The Atlas Lions have also impressed Mundo Deportivo with their fascinating defense and attacking skills. Following the game, the sports news source said that the Moroccan national football team “showed that they are a rocky group and difficult to beat.” According to the source, Morocco’s national football team knows what they are going for. The Moroccan national football team played a friendly game against Slovakia on Monday, scoring two spectacular goals, against Slovakia’s one goal. Slovakia opened the scoring at the 59th minute. Morocco, however, was quick to respond with an excellent header from Moroccan star Ayoub El Kaabi, who rocked the game in the second half. The winning goal was delivered by midfielder Younes Belhanda in the 74th minute of the match. Morocco will play their last pre-World Cup friendly game against Estonia on June 9. When the tournament begins, Morocco will face Iran on June 15 in St. Petersburg. Their second game will be against Portugal on June 20 in Moscow. Morocco will play the last game in the first round of the World Cup against Spain on June 25 in Kaliningrad.

Rabat – Morocco’s OCP Group has launched an initiative to boost Ethiopia’s agriculture and help the country reach its food safety goals, in line with OCP’s African agenda. To assist the Ethiopian government in its agricultural plan, the OCP foundation has initiated a national campaign. Ethiopia’s Minister of Agriculture Shiferaw Shigute presided over the opening ceremony, which was held last week. The ceremony boasted the participation of numerous other high-ranking officials, including three state ministers, Morocco’s Ambassador to Ethiopia Nezha Alaoui M’hammdi, and many stakeholders in Ethiopia’s agricultural sector, including entrepreneurs and representatives of agriculture-related agencies and research centers. With the objective of completing a thorough study of the country’s fertility level, OCP and the Ethiopian government are planning to finalize a pilot zone by October 2018. The zone will consist of 100,000 hectares of arable lands and 1,000 samples of composite soil from throughout the country for laboratory analysis. According to OCP agricultural engineers, the results of the soil analysis will provide stakeholders and policymakers with a clearer idea of the requirements for a more productive and sustainable agriculture in Ethiopia, especially for matching fertilizers with specific types of soil. The second phase of the OCP-Ethiopian government agricultural cooperation will be devoted to awareness-raising campaigns in remote areas. The overarching goal is to promote the use of fertilizers, inform the population about the stakes of the project, and gain the cooperation and adherence of “small farmers.” The new initiative is the latest cooperation between the OCP foundation and the Ethiopian government in a series of joint projects. Ethiopia is one of OCP’s most strategic partners in its bid to increase intra-African exchanges in the field of agriculture (especially technical assistance and provision of fertilizers). In the early phase of OCP’s Africa project, the Moroccan agriculture giant signed a USD 2.4 billion agreement with Ethiopia’s authorities. The contract entailed the construction of a fertilizer production unit in the Dire Dawa region. Upon completion, the Dire Dawa factory will have an annual production capacity of 2.5 million of tons of fertilizers, an impressive yield which Ethiopian authorities expect will be of crucial importance in the fight for sustainable agriculture and food safety. An additional investment of USD 1.3 billion is expected to boost the initial project and increase the Dire Dawa annual yield to 3.8 million tons, an impressive figure on which Ethiopia is counting to reach complete food safety for the 100 million-populated country in the coming years.

Rabat – After incurring months of heavy criticism for his alleged preference for the North American bid to host the 2026 World Cup, FIFA president Gianni Infantino is now sending messages of objectivity and neutrality ahead of next week’s vote to determine the winning bid. “FIFA can afford whatever the congress decides,” Infantino said on Monday, a suggestion that no one in the FIFA administration would begrudge Morocco its success should the Moroccan bid triumph on June 13. “We have to live with that and to make the best of any decision which is taken,” Infantino added. Last week, the task force published its final assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the two contending bids. Morocco’s bid, which was deemed “sufficient” by FIFA’s committee of technical experts, was declared “fit” to organize a tournament at FIFA standards for the World Cup. The task force, however, ranked the North American bid “significantly higher” in terms of projected financial returns. Asked whether Morocco’s triumph would be more costly for FIFA, Infantino stated that “money is one element, but not the only [one].” According to Infantino, the report only highlighted that a prospective Moroccan triumph would require more investment in construction and renovation. Adamant that the task force was diligent and fair, Infantino reiterated FIFA’s executive board’s neutrality throughout the entire process of the evaluation and scrutiny of the Moroccan and the joint North American bids: “What our task has been is to make sure the process is as objective, as clear as possible and to highlight the pros and the cons of everything.” To national federations, however, Infantino’s message is that voting should be based on merit alone, rather than on any other criteria which the FIFA president described as “subjective.” “I hope when they vote they think what is best for football, definitely not on other subjective criteria that they might have for themselves.”

Rabat – Despite measures to prevent cheating during baccalaureate exams, photos of exam sheets were leaked on social media only minutes after the exam started today. Exam questions covering science, physics, and Arabic have all been leaked on social media. Students have also been active on Whatsapp groups to help students cheat on exams and provide answers for the baccalaureate questions. The baccalaureate exams started today across the country. In response to the leaks, the Ministry of Education has tracked the people who shared photos of the exam sheets. The ministry noted that the culprits have been detained inside institutions, where examinations are ongoing, pending measures against them. The ministry has mobilized 41,660 teachers to oversee exam conditions. The ministry added that a further 40,000  teachers would grade approximately 3.6 million exam papers. The ministry also assured that strict measures would be taken for fairness both before and during the exam. In 2017, the ministry announced that the rate of cheating in Morocco dropped by 60 percent. Last month, the Minister of Education, Vocational Training, and Scientific Research, Said Amzazi, ordered students to keep any communication devices at home during exams. Amzazi had also urged parents to cooperate with the ministry’s anti-fraud law against cheating in baccalaureate exams by preventing their children from taking their phones with them into exams. The minister also pledged strict measures to guarantee a fair atmosphere during the exams, running until June 8.

By Karen Duarte  Rabat- While a few of the 64 combined home and away kits have been striking, others have disappointed fans. Out of the 32 national teams participating in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Morocco’s home and away kits have been ranked 29th, according to the American television channel CBS Sports. After Adidas revealed the first kit on April 27, President of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) Fouzi Lekjaa urged Adidas to redesign the kit. Many Moroccans and officials criticized Adidas’s second jersey for looking too similar to the Casablanca Widad Club’s jersey and like a discount-rack Adidas jersey.  The ranking list seems to confirm the criticism of the Moroccan population, ranking the Moroccan jersey ahead of only Panama’s, Iran’s, and Tunisia’s. The FRMF delayed their kits’ reveal, making it one of the last showcases, yet the official versions ended up resembling replicas.  One reason why the Moroccan jersey might be ranked so low is because it appears to be similar to other Adidas jerseys, such as the Iran kit design. Adidas did not seem to put effort into creating an original jersey for Morocco, even after FRMF demanded a redesign.  The white “away” kit design has also been criticized for being an outdated Adidas template.  The kits of Nigeria, Belgium, and Brazil were ranked best, second best, and third best, respectively. The 2018 World Cup kicks off on June 14, as the Moroccan national football team will bring their skills to Russia, whether or not their jerseys have a low ranking.

Rabat- Minister of Education, Vocational Training, and Higher Education Said Amzazi personally supervised the baccalaureate exams in Tifelt, near Meknes, on Tuesday, the first day of the baccalaureate final exams which will continue until June 8. Amzazi paid a visit Tuesday morning to Zineb Ennafzaouia high school in Tiflet in addition to other educational institutions in Rabat, Sale, Temara, and Khemisset regions in order to monitor the exam conditions  on the first examination day of the 2017-2018 school year. In an interview with Moroccan news outlet Le 360, Amzazi applauded the efforts of the administrators to create the best exam atmosphere for students: “We have put serious efforts to guarantee the best circumstances for students in addition to raising awareness.” Amzazi added that he visited the exam institutions to accentuate the importance of the “national” examination, emphasizing that the focus should not always be on the problem of cheating, but also on providing students with a comfortable examination environment. Today, students across Morocco have taken the exam under the surveillance of the newly installed classroom cameras to prevent cheating and to raise awareness of the graveness of the act. The current anti-fraud law penalizes cheating candidates caught with communication devices with six months to five years in jail and a fine ranging from MAD 5,000-100,000. The candidates are also prevented from retaking the exams for two years. Meanwhile Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani visited an educational center for students with special needs in Hay Riad in Rabat to check on students with physical and mental disabilities taking the baccalaureate exams. Previously, the Ministry of Education announced that this year’s baccalaureate exams are adapted for students with hearing problems and for those with mental conditions, such as autism. The students will benefit from extra exam time and an assistant. Last year, 325,191 Moroccan students took baccalaureate exams, according to a statement released by the ministry. This year, the number of baccalaureate candidates increased to 440,000 students.

Rabat – Former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane has joined the list of people who singled out Centrale Danone to defend the company and its farmers against the “damaging” consequences of the boycott campaign, sparking online backlash. Benkirane told Chouf TV that the boycott for political reasons is “understandable.” Benkirane, however, does not agree with the boycotters. “There is no reason to boycott the company that produces the milk because milk prices have not increased since 2013.” Many Moroccans have been boycotting three major companies (Centrale Danone, Sidi Ali, and Afriquia gas) in protest against high prices since April 20. Benkirane asserted that the boycott is more of a political message than a social demand. “The political messages of the boycott are clear and have arrived at their destination.” Defending Centrale Danone, Benkirane said: “My housemaid’s sister is living in the countryside. She has a cow and she sells her milk to a cooperative for MAD 30 a day and it is thanks to this money she survives.” He added that “the boycott should not last longer as the investors who bought this company do not reap the benefits they expected to get.” Benkirane’s statement was not well received on social media, with commenters comparing his latest comments with a speech he delivered in 2011. In the 2011 speech, Benkirane denounced the increase of prices on milk and dairy products in an open-air meeting with citizens. “Today I saw some boys demanding 10 days of Danone boycott. I will be the first to boycott Danone,” said the former head of government in his speech. He also asked the citizens if they do not know how to “prepare raib” (homemade yogurt). In his speech, he claimed that he had no hand in the increase of prices on dairy products, because the prices are liberalized. Several social media users took to their Twitter to denounce Benkirane’s new comments, saying that he is contradicting his previous stance. ??? ??????? ??? ?? ??????????? #??????? ???? ??? ????? ?????? ???????? ?? 2011  ?? ???? ??????? ???? ??????? ?????? ????? ..???? ????? ????? #??????? https://t.co/xm0GTMCcIb — Laila (@lailaamzir) June 4, 2018  “Uncle Benkirane, who taught citizens the techniques of boycott in 2011, is the same Benkirane who urges us to end the boycott today.

Rabat – Mehdi Benatia has melted the hearts of Moroccan fans. The captain of the national team channelled his fatherly instincts, by sheltering a little girl’s head from the rain with his pennant, before the pre-World Cup friendly between Morocco and Slovakia, on Monday June 4, in the Geneva stadium. Beating the Slovakian team (2-1) was not Benatia’s only victory. The French-Moroccan football player won over people on social media when, before the start of the match, as rain fell while the teams began their national anthems, the Atlas Lion covered the head of a child in front of him.  Goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, in turn, covered the head of the child in front of him with his hand. Shared by the Moroccan team’s official Twitter account, the cute picture quickly viral on social media, generating hundreds of retweets and reactions. “As you have protected the child of others, Allah will watch over yours, My dear Mehdi,” “So cute,” “Grand Capitano,” “Big respect,” “What a fantastic example, football is more than a sport,” commented fans on social media. Moroccan supporters were also proud of their team who raised the bar, scoring a double against Slovakia (2-1) Monday night in Geneva, Switzerland. For the second pre-World Cup game, the national team made quite the impression by beating Slovakia thanks to goals from Ayoub El Kaabi (63) and Younes Belhanda (74). The Atlas Lions’ next match will take place on June 9 against Estonia on their home turf, six days before Morocco’s first World Cup match against Iran on June 15.

Rabat – Twitter has suspended the account of Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani after restricting access to the account in May. El Othmani shared a post with his followers on Facebook to explain the situation. The head of government said that the block was due to security measures taken by Twitter following heavy traffic on the account, found May 15. El Othmani added that his team are closely following the situation until everything is back to normal.

Some Moroccan news sources, including Ya Biladi, speculated that El Othmani’s Twiter was suspended due to his series of tweets last month with the hashtag #consumer_first (in Arabic).  The suspension of the account comes on the heel of the ongoing boycott, which started on April 20. The boycott targets three companies: Sidi Ali, Afriquia gas, and Centrale Danone. El Othmani’s cabinet has been urging Moroccans to end the boycott on Centrale Danone, given the “damaging consequences” of the campaign on farmers and their families.

Rabat – The Saad Lamjarred scandal is far from over. Saad Lamjarred has (once again) missed his court date. The Moroccan singer chose to spend Ramadan in Morocco and be represented by his lawyer. Appointed to the Court of Great Instance (TGI) in Paris on Monday, June 4, for a medical expert opinion in summary, the singer of “Ghazali,” represented by one of his lawyers, has contested the request for a medical examination from the complainant, Laura Prioul. In addition, Lamjarred is suing Prioul for defamation over her legal request. French authorities arrested Saad Lamjarred on October 26 for the alleged rape of Laura Prioul. He was released and put under surveillance on April 13. Last month, Prioul’s lawyer requested a medical expert in Paris, aiming to establish a link between the rape she reportedly suffered in October 2016 and the deterioration of her  health since. “We pleaded this morning the request for medical examination of Laura Prioul to the High Court of Paris in summary, because she has a problem with her left kidney that no longer works and we want to see if it has a link with the aggression,” said her lawyer Jean-Maric Desboubes to HuffPost Maroc. Desboubes added that “the Dupond-Moretti firm was present to represent Saad Lamjarred. They objected to the request for an examination and claim 15,000 euros in damages from Laura Prioul because they find that this request is detrimental to their client.” Monday was not the first time that Lamjarred missed a court date. The first hearing was originally scheduled for April 9 and was postponed until Monday. Mediapart attributed Saad Lamjarred’s absence to “a hangover due to a big anniversary party in the night club l’Arc Paris two nights before the audience.” A video of the Moroccan singer celebrating his birthday while standing next to a bottle of vodka has also been circulating on YouTube. However, this time, the popstar’s presence in court is not required by law. Lamjarred, who is spending some family time in Morocco, will have to wait for the report of the doctors to decide whether Laura Prioul’s deteriorating health is related to the alleged rape or not. The verdict will be returned on June 18. Lamjarred is also facing arrest in the United States for another case of sexual assault in 2010, where an Albanian-American woman accused him of rape and violence.

Rabat – The Argentina versus Israel friendly match scheduled for this weekend has sparked a wave of criticisms in pro-Palestine circles, with Palestinian fans and footballing authorities demanding that the match be called off.   The head of the Palestinian football federation, Jibril Rajoub, has asked supporters of the Palestinian cause, mostly Arabs and Muslims, to burn photos and t-shirts of Argentinean star Lionel Messi, if he participates in the game, which is scheduled for Saturday. Rajoub made the announcement during a demonstration he organized in front of the Argentinean representative office in Ramallah, where he made his wishes known to the authorities of the Latin American country. He requested that they cancel their national team’s friendly game with Israel. The match is to be played at the Jerusalem Teddy Kollek Stadium in the neighborhood of Malha, a site that once hosted a Palestinian village that was destroyed during the 1948 war following the establishment of the state of Israel. In addition to the trauma of the destroyed village, it is also believed that Israel seeks to use the match that features the world’s most recognizable footballer for purely political motives. “The Israeli government has turned a regular sports match into a political tool. As was widely covered by the Argentinean media, the match will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the state of Israel,” according to a letter that Rajoub sent to Argentina’s football federation. “Messi, don’t come. Don’t whitewash the face of racism,” Rajoub said. “He’s a big symbol so we are going to target him personally,” Rajoub further explained, as he urged fans to single out the Barcelona star if he plays a match believed to be a disgrace to the star’s Palestinian fans as well as people in the Muslim world, mostly in Asia and Africa. “We call on everyone to burn his pictures and shirts and to abandon him. We still hope that Messi will not come,” he told reporters. Despite the boycott campaign, Israeli authorities are confident that Messi will participate in the game. Thousands of  Israeli fans are reportedly eager to attend the match and watch their idol play.

Rabat – Since his election, United States President Donald Trump has refused to carry on Hillary Clinton’s tradition … until now. It appears Trump has changed his mind and decided to  organize a f’tour at the White House this year in continuation of a tradition started under former President Bill Clinton. According to the New York Times, the breakfast is scheduled for Wednesday, June 6, but the White House has refused to make the guest list public.  On May 15, before the start of Ramadan, Donald Trump wished Muslims around the world a great Ramadan, which “reminds us of the wealth that Muslims add to the religious landscape of American life.” “In the United States, we are all blessed to live under a constitution that promotes religious freedom and respects religious practice. Our constitution guarantees that Muslims can celebrate Ramadan without being bothered by the government,” he said. Trump was heavily criticized last year for ending the tradition that Bill Clinton began that was then adopted by George W. Bush and Barack Obama. The current US president has repeatedly insinuated that Barack Obama was a Muslim. He has also made controversial statements about Muslims and in 2015, he said he was seriously considering closing mosques. The same year, he attempted to prevent Muslims from entering the United States. As president, he fought to establish his “Muslim ban,” an anti-immigration decree that targets seven Muslim countries. The tradition of having f’tour in the White House started in 1996 with Hillary Clinton, then First Lady of the United States, and has continued since.

Rabat – The ongoing boycott against high prices has caused Centrale Danone a major loss in revenue. Centrale Danone announced today that it has suffered a net loss of MAD 150 million in the first half of 2018 due to the boycott of its milk. Centrale Danone added that it had made a profit of MAD 56 million in the same period last year. The dairy firm published a statement today, in which it shared the “significant” consequences of the boycott, which also targets high prices of two other companies: Sidi Ali mineral water and Afriquia gas. “The company experienced, since the start of the campaign on April 20, a contraction of production and a consolidated revenue drop estimated at 50 percent,” the statement added. The statement t recalled that the boycott has pushed Centrale Danone to reduce its order of milk by 30 percent from its 12,000 partner farmers since May 29. The company has additionally terminated the contract of its temporary workers.  Centrale Danone shallow promises Since the launch of the boycott on April 20, Centrale Danone promised to meet customers’ demands. While boycotters have urged the company to lower its prices, Danone has denied that it has increased dairy products since 2013.  Instead, the company has also chosen to terminate its contracts with nearly 1000 farmers to overcome the crisis, according to Minister of General Affairs and Governance Lahcen Daoudi.  The company has not yet given any indication that it would decrease its prices. In its latest statement, Centrale Danone promised customers that it would “continue to take all actions necessary to satisfy” them. The statement added that the company will also make necessary decisions to “mitigate the effects of the boycott on its profit. Government backs Centrale Danone Government officials have urged Moroccans to end boycott on milk. Last Thursday, the government released a statement, expressing concerns about the “damaging consequences” of the boycott singling out Centrale Danone. The government called on boycotters to end the campaign, which “negatively affects the 120,000 farmers who work for Centrale Danone and who support approximately 600,000 family members. The government also warned that the boycott will make Morocco lose foreign investment, which according to the cabinet, will have a negative impact on the national economy. The supporters of the boycott, however, are still resisting, emphasizing that the boycott will end only when the company lowers its prices. The chief executive of Centrale Danone, Didier Lamblin, admitted last week that the impact of the boycott is “very significant.”

New York – Razan al-Najjar was a 21-year old Palestinian volunteer medical nurse who was deliberately shot by an Israeli sniper last Friday, June 1st. Thousands of people gathered to mourn her death at her funeral held on Saturday.  Razan was shot while approaching to help peaceful Palestinian protesters who had been wounded by the Israeli military. She wore white, which indicated she was a nurse, and waved her hands, showing she had no weapons and was a humanitarian worker. There is no possible way to interpret her killing other than as a cold-blooded intentional murder by occupiers who have entirely lost their humanity and have no mercy for the people they have been torturing and dispossessing of life and land for over 70 years.  Razan al-Najjar is the 119th Palestinian killed since the peaceful protests began in March. These demonstrations, titled “Great March of Return,” call for the right to return for the Palestinians who have been dispossessed since 1948. A group of United Nations agencies issued a statement condemning the murder of al-Najjar, “a clearly identified medical staffer,” calling it “particularly reprehensible.”   Al-Najjar was a strong and courageous young woman, committed to helping her community. She received no salary for her work and wanted no compensation. She did her work out of love, for the sake of God, and for her community. She described feeling a responsibility to do all she could to alleviate the unbearable pain Palestinians in Gaza are forced to endure daily. She also wanted to demonstrate that despite women everywhere being judged, women are in fact, in al-Najjar’s words “stronger than any man.”  The murder of Razan al-Najjar and the entire occupation project, including the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and their genocide, are possible through mechanisms that dehumanize Palestinians. Israeli soldiers view them as “notches on their belts” as Sheikh Suhaib Webb aptly wrote on a recent Instagram post. There is absolutely no way to construe this genocide as a “conflict” or as “clashes” because Israel has overwhelming superiority, limitless resources, and the support of the most powerful nation in the world. Palestinians have rocks. They lack access to basic resources, including water, food, and medical aid. They are under siege, unable to leave the prison they are force to exist in. How, then, is this a conflict? How can this illegal and monstrous occupation be called anything but what it is, a colonialist, genocidal venture? It is every single person’s responsibility to do absolutely everything within our power to stop this shameful calamity. If you can write, then write. If you can donate money to reliable organizations such as Medical Aid for Palestinians, please do. In whatever form is most suitable to you, please, it is crucial to raise awareness and prevent with all our might the sanitizing of this massacre and acceptance of the brutality Palestinians are enduring. We are all accountable for it.  Countless former IDF soldiers have spoken about the horrors of the occupation, about having to destroy entire towns, receiving orders to kill civilians in cold blood, terrorize them nightly by entering their homes shouting and destroying their things, having to arrest people, including children, who posed absolutely no threat, forcing the elderly out of their homes and throwing them out to live amongst the rubble, in order for more illegal settlements to be built by the monstrous bottomless greed machine called Israel.  In a recent account, Yonatan Miller, a former soldier narrates being surprised upon hearing Palestinians referred to as human beings who deserve dignity. He realized that he had never before acknowledged their humanity. This is the level we, as a global community, have sank to. Please, I urge you to inform yourself of the reality and cease accepting nonsensical fictions that allow the perpetration of these monstrous crimes to continue. Since 1948 and until today, approximately 510,000 Palestinians have been killed, which by most definitions constitutes a genocide. A genocide is a rationally calculated and systematic mass annihilation of a population, a structure of hatred that targets a whole class of people just because they are who they are. The Palestinian genocide, which is ongoing, has been facilitated by the biased information published by the Western press for over a century. The mainstream Western press is the voice of the state and its mechanisms are created by and embedded in the global power structures. The systematic erasure of Palestinians at the hands of the Zionists, backed by international world powers, also constitutes a form of ethnic cleansing, which is a well-defined crime against humanity. The United Nations’ official definition of ethnic cleansing is “rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation remove from a given area persons of another ethnic or religious group.”  Ilan Pappé, citing Drazen Petrovic, defines ethnic cleansing as a “well-defined policy of a particular group of persons to systematically eliminate another group from a given territory on the basis of religious, ethnic or national origin. Such a policy involves violence and is very often connected with military operations. It is to be achieved by all possible means, from discrimination to extermination, and entails violations of human right and international law.”   The crimes against the Palestinian people perfectly fit the definition of ethnic cleansing. To give but one example, in a 1937 letter to his son, David Ben Gurion, wrote: “We will expel the Arabs and take their place. In each attack a decisive blow should be struck resulting in the destruction of homes and the expulsion of the population.” To the Jewish Agency Executives Ben-Gurion stated in 1938: “I am for compulsory transfer, I do not see anything immoral in it.” Much earlier than this, the early Zionist immigrants who arrived in Palestine, such as Chaim Weizman, openly admitted that they hoped the Arabs would soon no longer be the majority. I will end this short article with a poem by Mahmoud Darwish, a resilient and beautiful human being who refused, despite the pain he endured throughout his life, to ever sink to the level of the occupiers. Finally, I encourage you to support Palestinian artists, including the brilliant and courageous Rafeef Ziadah, a Canadian-Palestinian spoken word artist and activist. Her debut CD “Hadeel” is dedicated to Palestinian children, who, in the face of bombs, still fly kites and remember the names of their villages in Palestine, most of which have been destroyed by the revolting State of Israel. The title of her work is “Hadeel,” in honor of these youth, who say they can still hear the sound of cooing doves over Gaza. May you rest in peace dearest Razan. I offer my most sincere condolences to Razan’s family, friends and loved ones, including her parents, Ashraf and Sabreen al-Najjar, with the promise that we will never forget Razan. She is a martyr and a strong example of courage, dignity and strength for every single human being.  To a killer: 
if you had looked into the face of your victim 
and thought carefully,  
you might have remembered your mother in the Gas Chamber,
and freed yourself from the rifle’s prejudice
and changed your mind.
Come now, this is no way to restore an identity! –Mahmoud Darwish (State of Siege, p. 43).

Rabat- The King’s Attorney General at the Safi Court of Appeal ordered the prosecution of the group of men who violently abused a woman and a van driver while the two victims will be tried Monday on charges of adultery. After admitting to being involved in romantic relationship, a 21-year-old woman and a van driver in coastal city of Safi will be tried in court. Meanwhile the 14 men who assaulted them have pleaded guilty and will be prosecuted for robbery, attempted murder, and vandalism. The court’s decision was made following the recent circulation of a  video that shows masked men beating the two victims with sticks. The men are also seen accusing the victims of engaging in illicit sexual acts during the month of Ramadan. The men later revealed their faces to the press and explained that they had resorted to violence because they had caught the driver and woman eating in broad daylight during Ramadan. “We are not running from anyone…we are not terrorists,” the men declared before they presented themselves to authorities.  According to the other side of the story, the driver told the Moroccan news outlet, Hespress, that he was driving the woman, who is a university student, when the men beat and robbed them.  The video, which went viral on social media  last week, has raised widespread controversy among Moroccans.  A teacher in Tetouan named Toufiq Tajkani, who claimed to work at the Ministry of Education, received widespread condemnation for suggesting on his Facebook page that the woman and driver should be stoned to death.  “Many of you who watched the video must have felt sorry for the man and woman who were beaten to a pulp with sticks… I too am sorry that they were not stoned to death,” he said.

Rabat – “The party is over for illegal migrants,” said Italy’s new Interior Minister Matteo Slavani during a rally on June 2 in Vicenza, referring to the country’s previously friendly attitude towards the more than 700,000 migrants reported to have landed in the European country in the last five years. He added, “[T]hey will have to pack their bags. Refugees escaping from war are welcome, but all others must leave.” The remarks were made during one of the numerous tours that Mr. Slavani has held around the country since the June 1 formation of Italy’s new government coalition, comprising Matteo Slavani’s nationalist League party (Lega) and the populist Luigi Di Maio’s internet-propelled Five Star Movement (M5S). In a 39-page document, the new coalition outlined its hawkish and nationalistic policies, including populist, eurosceptic, and anti-migration discourse. Taking inspiration directly from US President Donald Trump, the new Italian government has vowed to reclaim the country’s national sovereignty by implementing an “Italy first” policy. Since the beginning of 2018, more than 13,000 migrants are said to have reached Italy, while the International Organization for Migration reports that in the past five years more 500,000 migrants have arrived. As the number of incoming migrants typically increases in summer, the Lega-M5S government has vowed to turn immigration centers into deportation centers, a move they say will help speed up the process of deporting all undocumented migrants from Italy. Speaking on June 3 in Sicily, a major arrival point for migrants, Salvini expressed his frustration at Italy’s becoming “Europe’s refugee camp.” Instead of the open doors policy that has been prevailing for quite some time, the Lega leader promised that “deportation will be the new priority,” together with tougher border control and government-inspired changes to reclaim Italy’s lost “respect and sovereignty.” “Open-doors in Italy is for the right people and a one-way ticket out for those who come here to make trouble and think that we will provide for them…” “Enough of Sicily becoming the refugee camp of Europe. I will not stand by and do nothing while landing after landing of migrants [takes place]. There are not enough homes or jobs for Italians, let alone for half the African continent.” Pledging to deport 500,000 migrants in the coming years, the new Interior Minister also accused Tunisia, the main point of departure for migrants who land in Italy, of “deliberately sending criminals” and trouble-makers to create problems for Italians.

By Intissar Faouzi Rabat – In Benslimane Province, King Mohammed VI initiated, on Sunday,  the construction of an addictology center. The project is a demonstration of the monarchy’s concern for young people and its determination to protect them from harm. The new center funded by the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity, is the first of its kind in the province of Benslimane. It will constitute an integral part of the national program against addiction that was implemented by the foundation in 2010, accordingly with the King’s instructions. The program is executed in partnership with the Ministries of Health and the Interior. This national program aims to prevent young people from using psychoactive substances, to improve the quality of care for addicts, especially drug users, and to encourage the involvement of civil society and social sectors in tackling addiction. This program will also help families of beneficiaries to deal effectively with the negative consequences of addictive behavior. Following in the footsteps of similar foundations in Casablanca (in the Ibn Rochd University Hospital and the Sidi Moumen neighborhood), Rabat, Oujda, Nador, Marrakech, Tetouan, Tangier, Fez and Agadir, or those proceeding in Meknes, Tangier (Mghogha region) and in Marrakech (El Mellah neighborhood), the center tends to raise awareness and prevents the use of narcotics. The center also provides medical and social care for people suffering from addictive behavior, and attempts to involve families in prevention treatment. Additionally, the center aims to reintegrate its patients into society following treatment. It additionally provides training for associations in the field to reduce the risk of addiction, by educating young drug abusers and youth at risk of addiction. The future center will be built on a 3,000 square meter plot within 12 months. The new space will include a space for communal activities, an art room, as well as sports field and an office for associations. It will also include a variety of treatment rooms and a pharmacy. The project aims to provide care, awareness, diagnosis, prevention, and psychosocial support. As such, the medical center will provide consultations in general medicine, addiction, psychiatry, and collective psychotherapy. MAD five million have been invested in the center.  The project, supported by the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity in the Casablanca-Settat Region, aims to support and preserve vulnerable populations.

Rabat – For three years in a row, the Premier League’s Player of the Year Award has gone to Muslim footballers—Leicester City’s Algerian winger Riyad Mahrez in 2016, Chelsea’s French defensive midfielder N’Golo Kanté in 2017, and Liverpool’s Egyptian star Mohamed Salah this year. The most sensational of the three, however, is clearly Salah, whose assists and phenomenal goal count led Liverpool to the Champions League final as well as a sought-after third place in the Premier League. The Egyptian’s impressive season even prompted Liverpool’s fans to soften their perceptions of Islam, a religion they now associate with Salah’s attitudes on and off the pitch: cool, friendly, devoted, team-player, and humble. At some point in the season, every time Liverpool’s players walked down the pitch, Salah, who by now had been nicknamed the “Egyptian King,” was greeted by a boisterous and grateful public that chanted: “Mo Salah, Mo Salah, Mo Salah, running down the wing! Salah la la la la, the Egyptian King!” Another chant, wholeheartedly embracing the player’s faith, states: “If he [Salah] is good enough for you, he’s good enough for me. Sitting in a mosque is where I wanna be… If he scores another few then I’ll be Muslim, too.” The message conveyed was clear: in just a season, Salah has succeeded in distinguishing himself from the crowd; no longer a mere footballer, he has become a symbol used to discredit the sea of biases and stereotypes that target Muslims and Arabs; as well as a role model and inspiration. Before the May 26 final in Kiev (Ukraine), hashtags on Facebook and other social media called on “all Africans” and “all Muslims” to support Liverpool. And so, when Real Madrid and Liverpool met on May 26, most of the world’s football fans had their eyes set on the direct confrontation between five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, and the “Egyptian King,” Mohamed Salah. For many, the Real Madrid game was an opportunity for the Egyptian star to make his mark on world football, securing his spot among contemporary football’s greatest. Unfortunately, just over 30 minutes into the game, the Premier League Player of the Year sustained a shoulder injury, ending his participation in the long-awaited final. As he left the pitch, the “Egyptian King” was inconsolable and broken—his final showpiece of months of devotion and hard work was lost in seconds against Real Madrid’s veteran defender Sergio Ramos. With Liverpool’s front three players out, Madrid ultimately won the match. Religious and Political Debate But what followed Madrid’s win was even more interesting than Salah’s loss. Fans could not possibly understand Salah’s misfortune, much less during the season’s most defining moment. Some depicted Ramos as the incarnation of the Devil, a defender with a history of “dirty and inhumane tricks” on serious opponents. But, Salah was not just any opponent; he is a King. Which is why, at one point, religion and politics entered the picture. Salah’s misfortune has become a rant against the geopolitical and global order, which favor the “strongest.” Some have made that analogy that Ramos and Madrid symbolize the US and its allies in the North, while Salah and Liverpool represent the Global South. Like the developed world, some fans argue, Ramos and Madrid are allowed to be ruthless and violent without punishment or sanction. Just as the developed world’s financial aid comes with strict conditions, Madrid is suspected of having “bought off the referee,” preventing him from penalizing Madrid for its “dirty” and “disgusting” play. “How come Ramos was not even carded?,” some dejected fans asked. Amid the contention, some religious clerics felt that it was their duty to provide some explanations to heartbroken fans, especially the Egyptian and Muslim ones. They suggest that there was some godly reason for the dramatic outcome. On May 28, Kuwaiti Islamic cleric Mubarak al-Bathali tweeted that Salah’s injury was God’s punishment for his breaking of the fast on the day of the final. In that sense, Ramos was no longer a “devil;” he was an angel of God used to remind Salah of his religious duty. “God punished him. Unfortunately, he will bear the burden,” the Kuwaiti preacher said, explaining that “everything happens by the will of God.” He concluded: “May Allah Guide you, Mohamed Salah. Perhaps the injury will be good for you.” The Al-Azhar Fatwa Global Center reportedly responded to Bathali’s tweet by issuing a statement that endorsed Salah’s breaking of the fast. The Center argued that it is legitimate to do so on special occasions and that hardship can, in fact, be a sign of God’s love for a believer. It concluded that al-Bathali should worry about himself and leave Salah alone. While all of this may sound like an exaggerated show of attention, it is more understandable given the significance of Salah’s performance for his club and country this season. There are reports that Egyptian authorities have started using Salah’s image to boost support for its policies. More pointedly, perhaps, in Egypt’s latest presidential elections in April of this year, over a million voters reportedly cast their ballots for the 25-year old star, even though he did not formally run in the election Salah came out as runner-up in the election, indicating the love and respect he has garnered at home. As Egyptians prepare to travel to Russia for the 2018 World Cup this summer, it remains to be seen whether the Liverpool star will recover from his injury in time to perform at the skill level that has earned him such widespread international acclaim.

Rabat – Algerian author and journalist Mohamed Benchicou has criticized the political status and economic situation of the Algerian regime in a recent interview with “Le Point Afrique,” a French news outlet dedicated to African news. The journalist described Algeria as a “stateless” nation subjected to “corruption and predation.” Discussing the economic crisis in Algeria, Benchicou said that the regime has brought the country to “its knees” in the past two decades, adding that the national currency continues to devalue to the point of becoming “funny money.” The journalist also criticized trade and investment in the country, emphasizing that the country imports almost “everything it consumes and produces almost nothing, except hydrocarbons.” The lack of economic plan is a major concern for the country, according to Benchicou. He said that the economic crisis in the country made the “IMF [International Monetary Fund] concerned about the unemployment rate.” He said that Algeria lives on an artificial image. “We are not masters of our future either economically, socially, or politically. Everything is done to let things rot and to worsen delays,” he added. He further explained that the delay and lack of development is the result of a “repressive regime led by very powerful groups, who do not want to be held accountable or withdraw from their privileged position.” He concluded his interview saying that Morocco’s eastern neighbor is losing sovereignty at all levels, including economic and political spheres. “It is a country which we can say that it is moribund, but well made up to create an illusion and to receive visitors,” the journalist said. Benchicou’s statement follows other comments heavily criticizing Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Algerian journalist Lila Haddad recorded a video at the European Parliament’s studio in Brussels, denouncing the Algerian regime for “undermining”  the dignity of Algerian citizens. The journalist, who is based in Brussels, said that Bouteflika is “nothing more than a heap of flesh exposed to the world.” “Algerians have become the laughing stock of the world. Their dignity has succumbed to their own humanity to form a mountain of shame,” she added.

Rabat– Morocco’s Ministry of Religious Endowments and Islamic Affairs has denied speculations that Palestinian-Austrian Islamic scholar and television pundit Adnan Ibrahim attended the King’s religious lectures in Ramadan. Ibrahim’s official Facebook page administrators recently announced that the scholar arrived in Morocco upon the Ministry of Religious Affairs’ invitation to attend the “Hassania” religious lectures, held since the late King Hassan II’s reign during Ramadan. Ibrahim’s Facebook post also said he would deliver sermons across the kingdom’s mosques for the rest of the holy month. 
The announcement sparked controversy on social media because the scholar is known for his reformist or “liberal” approach to Islamic teachings, opposing conservative views of Islam. While some conservatives condemned his attendance at the lectures and described him as a “misguided” man, others welcomed the news and encouraged his anti-religious extremism approach and his quest to modernize Islam. On the other hand, the ministry told Moroccan news outlet Hespress in a statement that Ibrahim was not invited to participate in any religious “program” whatsoever, neither in mosques nor with any associations in the kingdom. The ministry added that it would like to keep a distance from the debates and controversy that the scholar raises. Last month, Saudi Arabia banned the broadcast of Ibrahim’s television show as many traditional Islamic scholars in the kingdom rose against his ideology, deeming him “dangerous.”  In contrast with traditionalists, Ibrahim believes in inheritance equality and says that wearing hijab(hair-covering scarf) is not mandatory for women in Islam, but is rather a custom that has become religious.

Rabat-Today, the majority of Muslims around the world are fasting for Ramadan. But do followers of other religions fast on particular holy days?  How do they fast and why do they do it? Fasting in the Catholic church is less restrictive than in Islam. Catholic Christians are to abstain from eating meat (not including fish) on Fridays during Lent, which is a six-week period before Easter. Catholics may eat meat on Fridays outside of Lent if they perform a charitable act. In addition, Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent, and Good Friday are obligatory fasting days. However, Catholic fasting allows Christians to eat one meal. In 1966, Pope Paul VI declared in his Apostolic Constitution Paenitemini “The law of fasting allows only one full meal a day, but does not prohibit taking some food in the morning and evening…” During Lent, Catholics also focus on prayer and charity to become closer to God. In the same vein, Mike Aquilina of the St. Paul Center for Biblical Theology asserts, “Fasting is a spiritual feast.” Many Catholics today also take the opportunity to “fast” from non-food items that hinder their relationship with God during Lent, by giving up gossip, social media, or Netflix, for example. Protestant Christians practice private fasting because of Jesus’ words exhorting his followers not to fast for public approval. In Matthew 6:17-18, he says, “So when you fast, wash your face and make yourself look nice. Then no one will know you are fasting, except your Father, who is with you even in private. He can see what is done in private, and he will reward you.” Because fasting is a private matter, many Protestants do not fast at all. For those who do, fasting is practised at any time and in a variety of ways. Standard fasting is going without food, but still drinking water, often for a 24-hour period. Some denominations also encourage fasting every Sunday. Protestants fast in order to focus on prayer and growing closer to God, often before making life-changing decisions. In the Bible, Jesus fasted for 40 days before he began his ministry, the patriarch Moses fasted 40 days while receiving the Law, and the prophet Elijah fasted 40 days when fleeing for his life.  Jews fast on Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement) in accordance with God’s command to Moses in Leviticus 16:29, “This law will always continue for you: On the tenth day of the seventh month, you must not eat food.” There are four additional fast days in commemoration of defeat at the hands of the Babylonians and one fast day celebrating Queen Esther’s fast. Similar to Muslims, Jews fast from dawn until the first stars are visible. However, Jews fast a full 24 hours without food or water for the Day of Atonement and the 9th of Av, the day both the first and second Temples were destroyed. On Yom Kippur, Jewish communities fast to repent of sins. On other fast days, with the exception of Esther’s fast, Jews communally mourn the destruction of the Temple and the desecration of God’s name at the time of the Babylonian captivity.  Fasting in Buddhism is considered an ascetic practice. Lay Buddhists fast by abstaining from meat and luxurious food two or more times per month. Some Buddhists eat only one meal every day, just before noon. Monks go even further; a typical Monastic fast lasts 18 days and involves drinking only a small portion of water. Buddhists fast to purify themselves and to clarify their thoughts. Buddha said that when fasting, “my soul becomes brighter, my spirit more alive in spirit and truth.” Fasting in Hinduism can take many forms. It can be as simple as eating a meal without meat or drinking only water and milk. The most common fast in Hinduism, Ekadasi, takes place twice a month on the 11th day of the new and full moons. Many Hindus also fast during the month of Shravan, which falls in July and August, in worship of the god Shiva. Bhishma, a devotee of the god Krishna, said, “He will be regarded as one that is always fasting if he eats once during the day and once during the night at the fixed hours without eating anything during the interval.” Followers of Sikhism do not fast, because they believe it does not give any spiritual benefit. In the words of Guru Granth Sahib Ji, “Pilgrimages, fasts, purification and setting limits are of no use, nor are rituals, religious ceremonies or empty worship.” Sikhs, however, are encouraged to practice moderation in all things, including in eating. They are neither to eat gluttonously nor to fast. During Ramadan, Muslims fast communally from dawn to sunset. They forego not only food, but water, smoking, and sexual activity. Dr. Arafat el-Ashi, director of the Muslim World League Canada Office, notes that according to the traditions of Prophet Mohammed, Muslims should eat light meals before and after fasting, and that the fast should be broken with dates or water. The purpose of fasting in Islam is to develop righteousness. Surah al-Baqarah verse 183 says, “O you who believe, fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you that you may become righteous.” Muslims do not only fast during Ramadan, the ninth month in the Islamic calendar. They are also encouraged to fast for six days in Shawwal, the month following Ramadan; Mondays and Thursdays; the “white days” of the lunar month when the moon is full; Ashura, the tenth day of the first month in the Islamic calendar; and for the nine days preceding Eid al-Adha.

Rabat – Four Moroccan seasonal farmers, working in Huelva, Spain, have reportedly filed complaints against their manager for alleged sexual assault. Spanish news outlet El Mundo reported that the four women lodged complaints against a supervisor on a Huelva farm, who was questioned by authorities last Friday for the allegations. El Mundo reported that two women filed complaints with the Spanish national police while two others lodged their complaints with the Civil Guard. Spanish authorities arrested the 47-year suspect on Friday, May 25. The suspect was released on bail after questioning. The complaints and arrest followed an exclusive press report by El Español, featuring several Moroccan victims of alleged sexual assault. In May, Morocco’s Ministry of Employment released a statement, announcing that it opened an investigation into the sexual assault claims. The ministry appointed a Spanish-Moroccan delegation to visit Huelva and to inquire about the working conditions of Moroccan farmers working in strawberry fields. Following the visit, the ministry published a statement, denying claims that Moroccan farmers are being assaulted. On Thursday, Luis Fernandez told Huelva Informacion that Spanish police are following sexual assault cases which date back to 2015. He said that the prosecution office has only received four complaints so far, but they urge other women to open up about sexual assaults to contribute to the investigation process. Morocco’s Minister of Employment has also called on Moroccan seasonal farmers to open up about sexual assault on Wednesday.

Captain of the Moroccan team Mehdi Benatia said in a recent interview with France 24 that he sees himself in the final of the competition to make Moroccans happy and proud in the streets of Moscow. “We have seen the state of mind of the national team during the pre-World Cup friendly games. We have a strong bond and that’s how we help each other,” he explained.

Rabat – The fearful Islamic State has been duly defeated by a Western-Islamic coalition through a combination of aerial pinpoint bombardment and a land offensive undertaken successfully by the Iraqi army beefed up by Kurdish, Iranian and Western forces. As a result, the cities controlled by this infamous State were re-conquered and its militias killed, imprisoned or have merely disappeared in the thin air.   However, the question is:  is this enough to crush Islamic fundamentalism that aims to adopt a time-old Caliphate system and engage in spreading  Islamic religion through a combination of gentle persuasion, jihad in dar al-Kufr (Infidels’ homeland) and terrorist actions both at home and abroad? So, what is presaging the downfall of this religious ideology? Surely military defeat alone is not the only reason of the setback. Actually, there are a number of other reasons given here below: Strong American  determination to bash violent religious extremism It might be a fact that the American administration has flirted gently with Islamism, at some point during the presidency of Barack Obama, thinking, maybe, that if the Islamists were allowed to assume power democratically they could, ultimately, be won over by democratic ideals and give up, consequently, violent extremism. Thus, the  Justice and Development Party (AKP) arrived to power in Turkey in 2007 and later on in 2012 their mirror image PJD in Morocco. According to a study undertaken by the RAND institution entitled “The Rise of Political Islam in Turkey,” AKP did not flaunt an extreme ideology, at any time,: “While the AKP has Islamist roots, it is fundamentally different from its predecessors—the National Salvation, Welfare, and Virtue parties—in terms of its ideology, its political goals, its market-oriented economic program, and the broader range of the electorate to which it appeals. Despite its origins, the AKP government has not pursued an overt Islamist agenda (although critics accuse it of seeking to infiltrate Islamists into the civil bureaucracy and condoning Islamization at the local level). The AKP government has given priority to pursuing Turkey’s European Union (EU) membership, economic stabilization, and reform of the legal system over divisive symbolic issues such as the Islamic headscarf controversy. Secularists, however, worry about “creeping Islamization.”” However, this did not stop Da3esh from taking power and control of swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria and committing despicable terrorist acts worldwide, reminiscent of the dark ages of humanity,  in the name of the establishment of the time-old khilafah (Califate.)  On the Caliphate of the Islamic State, Code Bunzel writes in an analysis paper entitled: “From Paper State to Caliphate: The Ideology of the Islamic State” published by Brookings institution (The Brookings Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World): “If jihadism were to be placed on a political spectrum, al-Qaeda would be its left and the Islamic State its right. In principle, both groups adhere to Salafi theology and exemplify the increasingly Salafi character of the jihadi movement. But the Islamic State does so with greater severity. In contrast with al-Qaeda, it is absolutely uncompromising on doctrinal matters, prioritizing the promotion of an unforgiving strain of Salafi thought. The Islamic State’s adoption of this acutely severe version of Jihadi-Salafism is attributable to Abu hadis, including those in al-Qaeda, have espoused “defensive jihad,” casting their militant acts as defensive in nature. They perceive the Middle East to be under attack by secular “apostate” rulers and their Western “crusader” backers. The Islamic State also advocates for “defensive jihad.” As former Islamic State leader Abu ‘Umar al-Baghdadi once observed, “The rulers of Muslim lands are traitors, unbelievers, sinners, liars, deceivers, and criminals.” What is more, he said in 2007, “[we believe that] fighting them is of greater necessity than fighting the occupying crusader.”” All in all, it must be pointed out that the moderate Islamists, if any, have no influence whatsoever on the hardliners. Worse, the latter may have used the moderates maliciously to beautify their despicable actions of terror and slaughter. During his electoral campaign in 2016, Trump announced his disposition to fight violent Islamism and make America safer again, however his approach sounded too harsh and stereotypical and was criticized left and right. Once elected, one of his first presidential directives was the Muslim Ban, preventing citizens of some Muslim countries from entering America. Muslim Ban  The American Civil Liberties Union –ACLU- viewed this ban as a discriminatory act with tremendous effect on Muslims and in this regard, Amrit Cheng, Communications Strategist writes: “This ban tears at the heart of Muslim communities in the United States, reminding them daily that the president openly discriminates against their faith and has instituted policies that embody this prejudice and bigotry. It will separate Muslims in the United States from their family members abroad. It takes away the ability of U.S. citizens and green card holders to live with, or even be visited by, spouses, parents, children, grandparents, and other family members. Among other things, it will exclude friends and family from weddings, graduations, and funerals; prevent grandparents, uncles, and aunts from holding and caring for newborns; deny final visits to ailing relatives; deprive American audiences and scholars of the ability to hear from and collaborate with individuals from the banned countries; and bar talented, promising young people from U.S. universities and companies. The impact of this discriminatory ban is tremendous.” But probably Trump’s most important decision was putting pressure on the Gulf States to stop supporting or harboring Islamism and, as a result, Qatar was quarantined by its fellow GCC sister countries and, also, the unexpected advent of the political and social revolution in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, undertaken by the hyper active Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Ben Salmane -MBS- Alongside, Trump has borne tremendous pressure on MBS to  drop, gently but surely, Wahhabism that incites religious fundamentalism around the globe through a multitude of associations by generously using petrodollars to create Wahhabi chapters in many Muslim countries and spread extreme Islamist ideology. The unhoped for revolution of Mohammed Ben Salamane Back in the 18th century a religious leader by the name of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703-1792) and the leader of a strong tribe of the Sauds Muhammad ibn Saud who reigned from  1726 to 1765, a deal was reached to rule the country, whereby The Saudis would take control of politics and Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab of fundamental  Islam known as Wahhabism. A developed form of tribal Islam that finds its origins not in the Salafi Islamic religion only but, also, in pre-Islamic patriarchy traditions. In this practice, women are kept under tight control and away from the public sphere. It must be pointed out that prior to the advent of Islam, Quraish and other tribes of Felix Arabia used to bury female babies alive (wa2d al-banat) to avoid shame, however, Islam disallowed this pagan tradition but was unable le to shake off misogynist sentiments in the region. Wahhabism has been variously described by Muslim and non Muslim religious experts  as “ultraconservative”, “austere”, “fundamentalist”, or “puritan(ical)”; as an Islamic “reform movement” to restore “pure monotheistic worship” (tawhid) by devotees; and, also, as a “deviant sectarian movement”, “vile sect” and a distortion of Islam by its opponents. For more than two centuries, Wahhabism has been Saudi Arabia’s dominant faith. It is an austere form of Islam that insists on a literal interpretation of the Koran and is against ijtihad (jurisprudence.)  Strict Wahhabis believe that all those who do not practice their form of Islam are heathens and enemies. Unable to lead the social revolution himself, King Salmane delegated this hard task to his young son MBS, full of vigor and youth and educated in the West. But the problem is that there is so much rot in the country and one would not know where to start at: corruption , nepotism, gender inequality, religious extremism,  etc., not to forget of course that the reactionary forces could at any time gang up to stall any reform by silent opposition or literally assassination. Indeed, MBS has not appeared in public since April 21, 2018 and rumors are circulating in the net currently stating that he has been killed in a military coup then. MBS Revolution MBS skillfully opted for the bulldozing effect to destabilize opponents and dark forces. He started liberating women from male dominance: allowing them to drive and watch football matches in stadiums. Then, he moved on to tackle corruption among the princes and the elite who have always considered it as a birthright and not a felony or an economic crime. He rounded up all the “filthy rich” of the kingdom and “imprisoned” them in the deluxe Ritz Carleton Hotel and exacted from them large sums of money that went to the treasury. The ultimate aim of MBS is to obliterate Wahhabism and return the country to moderate Islam this would dry up the sources of financing of fundamentalism worldwide, by ricochet. In this regard, the famous journalist Thomas L. Friedman wrote in an opinion piece entitled: “Saudi Arabai’s Arab Spring, at last: The crown prince has big plans for his society,” in the New York Times on November 23, 2018 “Unlike the other Arab Springs — all of which emerged bottom up and failed miserably, except in Tunisia — this one is led from the top down by the country’s 32-year-old crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and, if it succeeds, it will not only change the character of Saudi Arabia but the tone and tenor of Islam across the globe. Only a fool would predict its success — but only a fool would not root for it.” Stifle European Islamism Since the 1950s thousands of workers were brought from North Africa, Sub-Sahara and Turkey to rebuild Europe with American money (Marshall Plan, 1948). Later on the Europeans allowed them to bring their families to enhance their productivity and stimulate their interest in work. Children were born to these first generation migrants. On reaching school age they were schooled but due to the lack of parental follow up they dropped out and became first petty thieves, later on peddlers and finally joined organized crime. As a result of their acts Europeans looked down on them and considered them as social misfits. When the migrants’ children visited their countries of origins they were considered Europeans because they did not speak the local language and, consequently, they felt not belonging anywhere, in the end. These kids, sick at heart, felt country less and without a definite identity and these are the two personality psychological ailments the master Islamist recruiters used to approach them. And, as such, brainwashed them into believing that they were chosen by God for a mission to fight the  European infidels and establish the supreme glory of Islam, an act for which they would be rewarded with paradise (Jennah) and its many virgins (houris.) As an initial act of trust and reward they were given large sums of money by the recruiters, to build confidence and strengthen their hold on them. For months they were formed in fundamentalist Islamic religion precepts to strengthen in them the belief that dying for God is the best of ends one can ever hope for. The Islamic State found in these young people the ideal cannon fodder for its religious war in Europe against the New Crusaders (Salibiyun al-judud) and means to carry out its violent agenda outside of the Muslim world. In many cases, contact was established through the Internet and even the ideological training was undertaken through the very Internet and then they sent to die and cause mayhem. Of course, the true sponsors always remain in the dark and unknown. The US, declared enemy of violent religious extremism  Probably the last terrorist action of Trèbes and Carcassonne in the Aude region in France that caused the death of four people is the last gasps of the dying infamous Islamic State. It is a pretty minimal action claimed hurriedly by this terrorist organization just to say it is still around. Logically speaking it seems more like the work of a long wolf than that of an established organization. Anyway, since the coordinated international onslaught on the territory of ISIS and its consequent defeat, only lone wolves committed terrorist acts in total despair, such as ramming vehicles into pedestrians to cause maximum casualties or attacking civilians or military at knife point. All in all, the European concerted effort to wipe out Islamist terrorists with the help of North African countries like Morocco is paying. Terrorism cannot be, of course, totally eradicated, but terrorists will have a hard time operating like they used to do in the past and this, slowly but surely, will lead to the demise of violent Islamism, in the long run. De-radicalization The Western world has to enact stringent laws for Islamist brainwashing which is very active in improvised prayer rooms where preaching is political and incendiary and, also, with unemployed and marginalized youth. Like in Morocco, prayer rooms have to go under the strict control of the state and Imams have to be trained and vetted prior to assuming their function. Their sermons have to be issued by  a central state-controlled religious authority. Mosques and prayer rooms will be allowed to open only for prayer times and during some special religious functions. Many countries, Muslim or non Muslim, can learn from the Moroccan strict management of the religious field by vetting and training Imams and religious clerics with the mission to assist the population in religious affairs (murshidine (male) and murshidate (female)) in moderate Islam philosophy and practice through the wasatiyya approach, in state owned and operated institutions such as the Imam Academy in Rabat and a strict control of mosque and preaching and religious organizations and associations and their finance. De-radicalization will have, also, to affect publications, meetings and all kind of gatherings and celebrations. The youth have to be watched closely and the European states must train them to get jobs to become fully active within society but, also, to strengthen their sense of identity and belonging. The Islamists have grossly used Western freedom and they must understand that this is not allowed anymore. The  integration of moderate Islam in the European social fabric is an urgent necessity today more than ever before and the same is true of the rest of the Western world. Only the recognition and activation of moderate Islam can help suffocate violent religious extremism Will the West learn the lesson? Only time will show.

Rabat – The scene shocked Marjane shoppers in Agadir. According to local media outlets, a 30-year-old man set himself on fire at the main entrance of the supermarket Sunday, June 3, to the cries of others nearby. The 59-second footage of his act, taken by a customer, has circulated on social media, causing uproar among citizens. A security agent at the store intervened, running after the man to extinguish the fire. After local authorities arrived, the man was transported to Hassan II Hospital in Agadir with second- and third-degree burns. According to the local news site Agadir24.info, the man has a criminal record, as he first entered the mall on Sunday morning to steal. He was caught in the act of shoplifting. Once the stolen object was paid for, he left the store, only to return later in the afternoon equipped with a flammable product. For now, the local authorities have not yet commented on the incident.

Rabat – Nabil Dirar will miss Morocco’s friendly game against Slovakia. The national coach Hervé Renard reassured Moroccans Sunday about the injury of the right side Nabil Dirar. The international football player will be absent for the friendly match against Slovakia Monday in Geneva, just a few days before the 2018 World Cup in Russia. “Dirar had a small calf alert and there is no point in taking unnecessary risks. We are ten days away from the competition and we must not use his assets,” Renard said during a press briefing at the Geneva stadium. According to the French coach, “it’s just a precaution to be in possession of all our strength on the D-day…. It’s better to leave him a few days off, and not let him play tomorrow to make sure he can get back in shape pretty quickly.” In anticipation of their friendly against the Slovakian team, the Atlas Lions performed a training session of about sixty minutes Sunday afternoon. “The very concentrated group made the final adjustments before the Monday game,” it was reported to the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF). Mehdi Benatia’s teammates started their preparation for the World Cup with a draw against Ukraine (0-0). After the match against Slovakia, the national team will fly to Estonia where it will compete against the Estonian team on 9 June. Placed in Group B, the Atlas Lions will play their first game on June 15 in St. Petersburg against Iran. They will play their second group match against the Portuguese five days later on June 20 at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow. The Lions will close their first-round experience on June 25 with a game against Spain in Kaliningrad.

Rabat – It appears that Saudi Arabia is not only looking out for its own national interests. The kingdom has also been campaigning for the North American World Cup host bid, arranging meetings between the United 2026 bid committee with Gulf countries. It seems clear where Saudi Arabia’s vote will go on June 13. Following a series of continuous hints, Saudi Arabia is campaigning for United 2026. The New York Times reported on June 1 that the Moroccan bid’s rival has found for itself a “powerful surrogate” in Saudi Arabia. The US-based news outlet said that Saudi Arabia helped to arrange meetings with Asian voters and “recently announced that it would back the bid.” US is Saudi’s “strongest ally” Saudi Arabia has not officially announced its support for United 2026 yet. However, Chairman of the Saudi General Sports Authority (GSA) Turki Al Sheikh has been giving the world clear hints that Saudi Arabia is likely to lend its support to North America. “We will look for Saudi Arabia’s interest first,” Al Sheikh said in most of his interviews on Saudi Arabia’s stance on the 2026 World Cup host. In a recent interview given to CNN, the Saudi official said that the US is Saudi Arabia’s “biggest and strongest ally.” During his interview with CNN’s Beki Anderson, Al Sheikh made it clear that his country’s voice will likely go to its “strongest” ally. When the journalist asked him he was referring to supporting the North American bid, Al Sheikh answered: “You are intelligent Beki. You can read between the lines.” In recent months, Al Sheikh has posted several tweets implying that his country would vote for the North American bid. In another interview with Saudi-based sports news platform Arriyadiyah in March, Al-Sheikh said that friendship has been “very detrimental to the Saudis.” He added that what really matters now to him is that “the 2026 World Cup needs to be hosted  in the best conditions.” Trump’s influence It is nearly impossible to imagine that Saudi Arabia will change its stance after US President Donald Trump’s  infamous tweet threatening countries that showed support for Morocco’s bid. Trump tweeted that it “would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the US bid.”. The tweet has already influenced opinions. On May 3, South Africa denied that it had previously supported the Moroccan bid, deleting an early statement from the president of its football federation, Danny Jordaan, who promised Morocco the country’s vote. While Uganda has not yet made its choice clear, the African country said it is not sure about voting for Morocco 2026.  Uganda’s football federation president Moses Hassim Mogogo announced his official support for the African bid last month, but he said that he does not have the last say when it comes to the interests of his country and the executive committee of the federation. Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid is standing stronger than ever as the FIFA task force announced its eligibility to go to the last phase: June’s vote. On June 13, football associations worldwide will gather together in Moscow to vote for the World Cup 2026 host during the 68th FIFA Congress.

Rabat – A group of retired Moroccan railway workers in France have lodged a complaint against their lawyer for demanding an “outrageous bonus” from the compensation they received from the French National Railway Company (SNCF). Eight hundred SNCF workers, including Moroccans, sued the SNCF for discrimination for more than EUR 600 million. The workers fought for a reported 10-15 years while waiting to be acknowledged and compensated by the railway company. In 2015, the Council of Paris Industrial Tribunal officially charged the SNCF with discrimination against Moroccan railway workers. The SNCF appealed the rulings. However, a Paris court upheld the decision last February, stating that the discrimination was blatant and that the company “did not demonstrate that this difference in treatment was justified by objective reasons.” The court also ordered France’s national rail operator to pay over EUR 160 million as compensatory damages to the workers. However, 30 of the retirees filed another complaint against their lawyer, Clélie de Lesquen-Jonas, on May 7 for breach of trust. The lawyer, according to Mediapart, deposited the workers’ compensation in her personal bank account, demanding an “outrageous bonus” for the case. The lawyer is allegedly urging the workers to sign an agreement with a 5 percent bonus for herself. The agreement would allow the lawyer to gain USD 7 million, while workers would be given sums ranging from EUR 17,000 to EUR 287,000. According to the complainants, the lawyer allegedly billed the workers EUR 6,000 before the French Employment Tribunal and another EUR 30,000 before the court of appeal. Mediapart quoted the lawyer saying that she would “probably launch an action for defamation.” She added that she could have asked for a 10 or 15 percent bonus. “These are the usual rates in the labor law.” The lawyer also claimed that she had “sacrificed” four and a half years of her life and that she “lost on appeal.” “I would have lost four and a half years of my life. Besides, I did not do it for the money at the beginning. Frankly, I did not think we would win as much,” she said.

Rabat – Moroccans are outraged after soap opera “Shir Chat”  featured during Ramadan on Saudi TV channel SBC, portrayed Marrakech as a capital for “pleasure marriage.” Episode 14 dubbed “ Marrakech, the last trip” feature the journey of three main actors to the city of Marrakech. The men traveled to the Moroccan city, seeking temporary marriage for pleasure with Moroccan women.  The episode shows that the actors arrived in Morocco after they lied to their Saudi wives, claiming that they are going to perform Umrah (a non-mandatory pilgrimage made by Muslims to Mecca) to justify their absence. The husbands, however, found themselves the victims of their wives, who already knew their plan. The wives plotted a fabricated abduction with the help of a Moroccan woman in order to get the money their husbands wanted to spend on “pleasure marriage” in Morocco. Moroccans and Saudis alike took to social media to condemn the series for “tarnishing the reputation of Morocco and Moroccan women.” A Saudi Twitter user wrote: “Imagine a Moroccan series showing Moroccan [men] bringing 20 Saudi women to choose between them. (..) This is what the Shir Chat series is doing.”  “And we are asking why they hate us,” added the same twitter user sarcastically. ???? ?????? ????? :

Rabat – More than 30 people were killed after a boat carrying undocumented migrants capsized off Tunisia’s southern coast. The coast guards managed to rescue 67 others, including two Moroccans. The list of victims includes Tunisian nationals and other nationalities, the Tunisian Ministry of Defense said on Sunday. The civil guard also rescued two people from Ivory Coast and two others from Cameroon. Tunisian authorities said that the boat was carrying 180 migrants, including 80 from African nations. Thousands of migrants die every year while attempting to reach Europe. In February, 90 migrants were killed after a migrant boat capsized off the Libyan coast near the city of Zuara. In the same month, Moroccan Royal Navy rescued 71 passengers off the coast of Tangier. Since the beginning of 2018, Morocco-based National Observatory of Human Rights (ONDH) reported in January that over 1000 migrants tried to enter Spain during January 2018.

By  Mohamed Belkhayat Washington D.C. – In 2015, I was invited to visit GE global research center near Albany, New York; a center which boasts almost three thousand Ph. D. researchers. As a supplier of one-third of all electric energy generation equipment in the entire world, it was an honor for me to visit this truly amazing company and its research center.  In fact, I felt like a kid in a candy store. After the meeting, our host took us for a short tour of their hall of fame. The walls were adorned with a large number of inventors, including Nobel Laureates for inventions ranging from light bulb filaments to health imaging equipment. But what struck me most was Edison’s desk and his picture behind it. Edison, of course, was the inventor of the first successful light bulb, and he had over 1000 patents to his name. His face in the picture was captivatingly childlike and almost at odds with his grey hair. His gaze was almost hypnotic. You get the immediate sense that his intense curiosity about how the world works never left him even in later years. How did Edison acquire his curiosity? A quick look at his biography reveals simple facts that explain a lot.  Edison’s mother was an excellent school teacher and she nurtured his imagination. She also let him set up a chemistry lab in the basement. Coupled with his curiosity was his business acumen, which allowed him to be one of the founders of GE and make such a huge impact on the world we live in today. What does young Edison’s chemistry lab have to do with Morocco’s strategy for R&amp;D? The answer is simple; curiosity in young children. Curiosity is like a plant that grows given the right soil and water. Every child is born with an innate curiosity and if not given the proper attention it evaporates with age. No matter how many billions in investments, how many experts you bring from within or from without, and how many research centers you build, if the soil is not ready, if the young generation’s scientific curiosity is not there, a true R&amp;D ecosystem will be very difficult, if not impossible, to exist and to make any significant impact. R&amp;D begins with a good science teacher! As I write this, there are tens if not hundreds of high schools in Morocco, especially the small private ones, which do not have any labs whatsoever! How does one expect to have researchers? The ministry of education should not give permission to high schools to operate without good science teachers or science labs. The ministry should also train good science teachers, and encourage or even subsidize science labs in private schools. Finally, businesses owe corporate social responsibility to the locals, especially in the form of schools and colleges. Businesses, especially large companies, should not be allowed to open unless they make a commitment to the local education system. I believe humanity is experiencing the fourth revolution of learning, which is marked by the internet. The third revolution was associated with the printing press, the second with paper, and the first with an oral tradition and rudimentary writing. One can argue that the history of the Muslim civilization rose with its mass development of writing paper and fell with their lack of quick adoption of the printing press. On this, many books have been written. But since we are living the fourth revolution let me continue with this topic. There are literally millions of free books and courses online now. To begin with, here is the international library of children’s books, and here is the world digital library which covers 193 countries and history from 8000 BC to 2000 AD. Google books also offers millions of books online and so does Amazon. In the late 1990s, I had to take a class at MIT on energy efficiency. I had to take the plane from Washington D.C. to Boston.  My company had to pay for an expensive hotel-stay and meals, in addition to the course fees. Nowadays, similar courses could be pursued from the comfort of one’s home or even from one’s school in Morocco. So online learning should be integrated in the science curricula, but possibly by selecting the best content online that can be afforded first. There are a lot of free YouTube classes but some are better than others, so the student or teacher has to be judicious in their selections. Books and classes are not the only thing you can access online, you can access real physical experiments as well.  While visiting the Princeton Plasma Physics lab in Princeton New Jersey with my son in 2016, I learned of an amazing plasma experiment that you can control from your home! You can control the pressure in the plasma, the voltage, and magnet strength. If all of this is not enough to impress you, try the National Institute of Health’s data base in Bethesda Maryland online where genomic sequence data is available to download and analyze from the comfort of your research center in Morocco! Still not enough? Try Elite Dangerous, an electronic game that boasts around 150,000 star systems to build our galaxy from real-world astronomical data, and you can visit these worlds in your starship. The game actually includes 400 billion stars for the galaxy. We are truly living the fourth revolution of learning. The philosopher’s stone and AI In the world of research and development, Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to be a modern-day philosopher’s stone. The search for this mythical stone, which the alchemist and first scientist Jabir ibn Hayyan looked for, claims the property of turning base metals into noble ones such as gold. It was a similar search for gold that led to the discovery of Phosphorus, Morocco’s white gold. This element literally keeps all life going through the production of ATP, the energy currency of every living cell on the planet.  Artificial intelligence (AI) has already turned data into gold, bested Chess and Go games masters, made significant contributions in agriculture, transportation, medicine, and law. The US and China have made AI one of their top national priorities. Google has already announced that it is an AI company first. The other top software companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and Baidu are following in the same footsteps. The next step is a master algorithm that can learn on its own not only to identify pictures, translate one language into another, transfer speech into text, drive our cars, fight our wars, clean our houses and maybe even cook for us. Google has already developed your digital twin, which is called google duplex, which can take care of your doctor’s appointment, your travel arrangements, and even sound like you on the phone! These algorithms do exist but in separate forms. Deep mind at google promises an algorithm that can potentially learn as people do and maybe much more. AI is a wake-up call to all nations that are serious about R&amp;D and their future development. AI will touch every single sphere of society; the revolution is on and those who choose to ignore its call will be doomed to suffer the same consequences suffered when the printing press was ignored. So how does Morocco engage and inspire its research community to shift into high gear? Well as always, it is about leadership. Morocco needs to have a serious commitment to R&amp;D and consider the top priorities as they relate to the local needs and as they relate to the rest of the world. The leaders in Science, Engineering, Technology and Math (STEM) need to inspire not only their colleagues at universities and international conferences, but also the next generation at the local high schools. Researchers should be encouraged to visit the local high schools and give talks about their work and inspire the next generation.  In 2008, I was invited to give a talk about renewable energy at Alakhawayn University in Ifrane and the local community students were invited. At the end of the talk I lit up a bright LED lamp with small AA batteries that I carried with me into the hall. The look on the students’ faces was priceless. This was before LEDs were in Morocco. I also took with me a small wind generator and a small water powered car that I had installed outside the conference hall and they attracted a lot of attention.  I had my chance to prove to the young students that through the use of a fuel cell and solar power or wind power one can indeed have a car run on water only! Inspiring the young students at the local high schools is where it begins, challenging them with science projects every year in robotics, electric cars, renewable energy solutions, and even AI.  At the national and public level, I would open the mosque for education in coding and science in general. The best model of the mosque is the original model of Alqarawiyyin in Fes which was not only a Mosque, but also a school where regular people could learn not only spiritual values, but also the sciences and even work skills. There is no reason that the Imam should be learned only in religious affairs. In this day and age if he or she (murshidat) cannot code a few lines they are not truly keeping up with the times!  I would also dedicate a portion of the radio time to science and technology. Here in the US, there is a program that I listen to regularly called Science Friday. The host covers topics ranging from space and the big bang to how to build your own robot. It’s very entertaining and engaging. There is no reason that a mosque, a structure which costs a lot of money to keep, only opens for the five prayers. In the US, and many other countries, mosques double as learning centers for language, sciences and other topics. Accommodations should be made for both literacy programs and also for learning sciences and particularly coding. “One Hour of Code” was started by Microsoft and millions of young and older students stand to benefit. Morocco could benefit from similar programs. Engaging MREs The ministry of residents abroad has actually organized a number of events to attract talent, competencies, and expertise from abroad for forums and conferences in Morocco. I attended a number of forums including one on “la charte de l’environment” and also one on Moroccan American competencies on renewable energy. Both were in Rabat. But it takes more than a visit to the nursery to grow a tree! In agriculture as in business, it takes at least two to three years of sustained investments to begin to see a return. Some R&amp;D products, especially in medicine, may take up to 15 years.  Another crucial factor is that it is important that the folks coordinating these events or relationships should have a background in STEM and not just administrative skills. Likewise, invitations to professionals must be advanced in enough time to allow scheduling for STEM conferences.  Several times I was invited at the last minute to speak at a conference in Morocco, but I could not fit it in my schedule. In other international venues to which I’ve been invited, the invitation came a year in advance. Despite the many challenges, there were some successful relationships built. Some were through the ministry and some were through individual efforts. But in general, the administrative burdens demanded a lot of resilience. One such relationship is the Solar Decathlon Africa which Morocco was invited to participate in this year. A successful National Science R&amp;D strategy for morocco should be focused primarily on the development of a competitive work force that is able to meet the challenges of a technological future not only for itself but also for Africa at large. Investing in people and especially in good teachers is the cornerstone of any serious R&amp;D strategy.  In addition to its geo-strategic location, its proximity to Europe, and its historic alliance with the US, Morocco is more than a gateway to Africa. Morocco should position itself as a model for the rest of Africa; a model for research and development and innovation. According to a 2010 UNESCO report cited by Hassan II Academy (H2A), Morocco is first in the exportation of high tech products compared to other Arab states. It is important to celebrate what is right. One way to keep this lead and to even scale it up is to focus more on engineering and technology research. Morocco still lags in number of engineering diplomas per year. H2A also pointed out in the same report that of all Ph. D. degrees granted every year in Morocco, engineers with Ph. D. degrees were the lowest in numbers in Morocco. Engineers are the economic engine of an innovative nation. In all spheres of research, engineers are an essential element in bringing new products to the market. One way to increase the number of engineers is to encourage and foster an even closer relationship between industry and universities. While a number of research centers in Morocco such as ESITH, INRH, REMTEX, CELOG, MAScIR have close relationships with industry and government agencies, universities have to increase their collaboration with industry even further. Besides developing research ecosystems in terms of dedicated centers, universities and industries that provide a model for Africa, it is important to keep the public well informed. For example, media outlets such as TV and radio should have dedicated programs on Science and research using language that is accessible to the general public. It is important to inform and challenge the public with the needs of Morocco in science and research in general. Inventions do not always favor formal education; a lot of inventions have come from inventors who did not have a formal education. The classic case is that of Edison who invented many devices even though he did not have a formal education. National Science and engineering challenges such as the solar car, the solar house, driverless car, useful robots, with dedicated winning prizes can galvanize the public and research community at large. International conferences and competition events held in well media covered locations are very important. Morocco should consider the following key hard science and engineering areas/priorities: 1- Renewable Energy and water, 2- Mining, 3-IT, 4-Agriculture, 5-Health, 6-sea-air and space defense. Morocco should attempt to at least double its percent GDP spending on R&amp;D which is currently under 1%. But the funding should be allocated to forming science and technology teachers as well. There are 4 areas of basic and fundamental research sweeping the world now:  Artificial intelligence, this will remain the modern-day philosopher’s stone for a long time to come. There should be a concerted effort to host diverse groups of researchers from Europe, the US, Morocco and Africa. The latter is very important. Diversity of thought is key in research both in hosting conferences as well as working together and publishing together. While Europe and the US may have excellent solutions for R&amp;D, African researchers may have entirely different needs.

Rabat- Ramadan is that time of the year when all 1.8 billion Muslims can enter the realms of spirituality and introspection, sympathize with the poor, develop patience, and get rid of bad habits. While it is all that and more, Ramadan is also the best time for dates. Dates…those naturally sweet, underrated fruits that finally get their time in the spotlight during Ramadan! During the holy month, the ftour table is simply not complete without dates, even if just for show. Although they contain an abundance of health benefits, sometimes their potentials are unknown even to people who eat them at every ftour because of their religious significance. Dates were mentioned 20 times in the Qur’an. Muslims traditionally break the fast with dates since the Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, said: “When any one of you breaks his fast, let [it] with dates for that is a blessing; if there are no dates then with water, for that is a means of purification,” as narrated by al-Tirmidhi. Ironically, the dry fruits keep the body hydrated when fasting thanks to the levels of sugar, making them a means of purification to metabolism in Ramadan. Dates are known to be a source of minerals, potassium, magnesium, vitamins, iron, and fiber. They ooze with natural glucose, which helps keep the body energized and hydrated during long hours of fasting. Breaking the fast with dates stimulates blood sugar levels to return to normal, which also make dates a good pre-workout snack.  As a matter of fact, the drier dates are, the higher their sugar concentration gets. Diabetic patients are advised to consume dates in moderation, following exercise and a balanced diet. If not, the dates will cause their blood glucose to shoot up, according to the International Diabetes Federation. Doctors at Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar (WCM-Q) conducted research on what makes dates healthy other than the fact that they contain vitamins.  The researchers sought to analyze the blood of research participants who ate date varieties after fasting for twelve hours for presence of beneficial phytochemicals, a chemical compound found in plants. Although the results have not been revealed yet, the research hopes to pinpoint which variety of date fruits contain higher concentrations of beneficial phytochemicals. Karsten Suhre, professor of physiology and biophysics at WCM-Q, said: “[It]would allow us to make better dietary recommendations to help people protect their health.” A specialist in food science and health, Dr. Sweety Mathew, and a professor of medicine at WCM-Q, Dr. Stephen Atkin, both confirmed that dates “have significant health benefits if incorporated into a healthy diet.” They added that the large amounts of phytochemicals in dates reduce risk for heart diseases. Phytochemicals contain antioxidant , anti-inflammatory properties, anti-cancer properties, and neuroprotective properties, yet this is not widely known. Dates are not only an excellent fast breaker, they are also an ideal nutrient to add to the suhur meal before fasting. The date palm, known as nakhla in Arabic, comes from a family of palm trees that can reach 23 meters (75 feet) in height and can live up to 100 years. Fossil records revealed that the date palm has existed for 50 million years, while the cultivation of dates is traced back to prehistoric Egypt.  Remains of dates from over 7,000 years ago were discovered by archaeologists in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. Archaeologists believe that dates have originate in modern-day Iraq, although it is widely believed that Saudi Arabia was the first to introduce them to the rest of the world. Date palms require a dry and hot climate, and it takes four to eight years to produce fruit. Date palms are found in the Middle East, North Africa, and India; in California, Florida and Arizona in the US; and in Spain. The date harvest begins when the skin starts to soften, usually in August to December or January in the northern hemisphere.  Fresh dates are either soft with a glossy skin, semi-soft or dry. Fresh dry dates contain less moisture and have a long shelf-life when packaged tightly in a refrigerator, remaining fresh for eight months. Deliberately dried dates can be kept up in a refrigerator for a year. Date production has increased in the last century; according to the UN Food and Agriculture organization, global production of dates has increased from 1.8 million tonnes in 1961 to 2.8 million in 1985 and 5.4 million in 2001, with major production in the Middle East and North Africa. Compared to the doubling of the global population over 40 years, date production has increased 2.9 times. Total global exports of dates increased by 1.71% over 40 years.  There are many varieties of dates, each with distinct features and taste.  Saudi Arabia cultivates approximately 40 types of dates. Morocco also produces multiple date varieties in the Draa-Tafilalet region, including majhoul or medjoul, anbara, and deglet noor.  Deglet Noor is known as the “queen of all dates.” It has a soft, honey-like flavor and is semi-dry.  Deglet Nour is well-known in the Middle East and the Maghreb, but especially in Tunisia, its leading producer. It can also be found in many US stores.   Majhoul dates rival the “queen of dates” in popularity. Majhoul dates have a caramel-like flavour and coffee-brown color that make the mouth water, especially in Ramadan. Majhoul are naturally dry dates, due to their firm and wrinkled texture. Majhoul are also high in calories and fiber. The high fiber levels make it a good solution for health problems such as constipation. Next to Majhoul, Kholas dates are also widely consumed in Morocco. They look and taste like honey, and have soft sticky flesh. Kholas dates contain high levels of Vitamin A, which is good for the eyes. Another popular date in Morocco, sukkari dates are sugary as their name suggests. They are crisp and have a very sweet flavor.  These small jewels can be a replacement for sugar and sweets, as they are not only sweet but contain folic acid, protein, iron, and of course, fiber. Ajwa dates are dark and can be either soft or dry with a smooth taste and sweet flavor. The ajwa date is exclusively found in Saudi Arabia and people on the Umrah pilgrimage break their fast with them in Ramadan. The ajwa date has a significant place in Islam, as it is said in hadith that the Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) used to break his fast with seven ajwa dates.

Rabat – Algerian journalist Lila Haddad has heavily criticized the Algerian regime in a video recorded at the European Parliament’s studio in Brussels. In a three-minute video, the former correspondent for the Algerian television channel ENTV criticized Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, saying that he is “nothing more than a heap of flesh exposed to the world, despite facing disdain from a whole nation.” The journalist also accused Bouteflika’s brother and special advisor Said Bouteflika of thinking that he is the “only one who is entitled to dispose of him.” Criticizing the human rights situation in Algeria, the journalist said that the “dignity of an entire people is scorned,” and “Algerians have become the laughing stock of the world. Their dignity has succumbed to their own humanity to form a mountain of shame.” The Algerian embassy in Brussels was quick to release a statement in response to the journalist’s accusations.  The embassy denounced the “inacceptable misappropriation of the symbols of the European Union and the headquarters of the European Union to undermine honor and dignity of the Algerian institutions,” in the statement published by Algerian Press Service (APS). The embassy said that the journalist was dismissed from the ENTV because of her “incivism” (lack of patriotism) and “bipolar behavior.” The embassy also labeled Haddad a “pseudo-journalist” who “attacked the honor and dignity of the institutions of the Algerian Republic.”

Rabat- The teacher who shockingly suggested that the best lesson for the woman and van driver accused of engaging in a sexual act in Ramadan is to be stoned to death, has publicly shared his residential address on Facebook as a challenge to social media users who largely criticized and condemned his statements. The teacher, Toufiq Tajkani from Tetouan who claims to work at the Ministry of National Education, must have thought it brave to share his personal address following a new controversial post, before he changed his mind and disabled the post later: “Stoning to death is one of God’s punishments that Islam brought to fight eroticism and profanity,” he wrote on a Facebook status with a background symbolizing Ramadan.  In a follow-up post he displayed the address of places he frequents in Tetouan as well as his personal address. Tajkani remained firm on his previous remarks when he said that he felt sorry because the assaulted woman and van driver were not stoned to death instead of being beaten with sticks. Tajkani’s post sparked widespread condemnation from social media users who personally attacked him and deemed his statements brutal, siding with the abused individuals. The woman said to her attackers she was only riding with the driver to run an errand. Following the wide social media circulation of the video showing masked men beating a woman and van driver, the King’s Attorney General at the coastal city of Safi’s Court of Appeal has opened an investigation to examine the incident’s circumstances.

Rabat – “It is impossible not to have the 2026 World Cup bid,” said a very determined Jamel Debbouze. The French-Moroccan comedian has agreed to meet Youtube influencer Saad Abid to endorse Morocco’s World Cup bid in his own unique way. On Day 9 of his incredible journey of “meeting 26 celebrities, in 26 days, in 26 countries” to score symbolic support for Morocco 2026 in the #Maymkench2026 (impossible) challenge, Abid flew to Paris to spend a funny moment with the proud Moroccan comedian Debbouze. In a video posted on his social media, Abid shared about his trip to the French capital. Having just landed at the airport, he found a supporter of #Maymkench2026 who agreed to drop him off at his hotel.  After a night’s rest, the Moroccan activist met the French-Moroccan humor sensation near the Seine “to explain the project.” “I’m sorry I have a little asthma,” the actor of “Les indigènes” joked before giving his breath, symbolically inflating the hopes of Moroccans to host the World Cup in 2026. Debbouze then nominated an unexpected person to take on the challenge. After joking about nominating the late boxer Mohamed Ali, who Debbouze claims has “his number in heaven,” the humorist nominated another almost unreachable Mohamed. “I’ll name you someone less reachable: his majesty the king of Morocco. If he gives you his breath my brother, it’s not a ball that you will have, it’s a balloon!” said the 42-year-old artist. “King Mohammed VI! Jamel gave me the biggest challenge of my life,” Saad Abid told the camera. Debbouze also signed the ball which boasts signatures from Eto’o, Iniesta, RedOne, Gad Elmaleh, Pirlo, Achraf Hakimi, Lionel Messi, and more.  Afterwards, Abid accompanied the native of Trappes in a film shoot, where he was able to find Gad Elmaleh, before following Jamel to the recording of an episode of the Burger Quiz, where he asked for the breath of French actor Jean Dujardin. Can Saad Abid take on the most difficult challenge of his adventure yet and score the King of Morocco’s support? To be continued …

Rabat – The United Nations has honored seven Moroccan peacekeepers, who died during peacekeeping operations in 2017 as part of the UN Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA). In a ceremony at UN headquarters in New York, the UN awarded the seven blue helmets with the Medal Dag Hammarskjold on Friday, June 1, in recognition of the Moroccans’ sacrifices during their peacekeeping duties. The seven Moroccan peacekeepers were: Lieutenant Hicham El Aouzi, Corporal Chief Mohamed El Azzabi, Chief Warrant Officer M’Bark Azyz, Corporal Chief Abdeljalil Ezzaitouni, Corporal Chief Hicham Amahrit, Corporal Chief Zaid Kabouz, and Sergeant Chief Mohamed Ait Said.

The ceremony also honored 128 peacekeepers who died in the field with the Medal Dag Hammarskjold. The ceremony was attended by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Omar Hilale, Morocco’s Permanent Ambassador to the UN. Hilale represented the Moroccan peacekeepers who died and received the medals from Guterres. The UN chief paid tribute to the “men and women who lost their lives while serving under the flag of the United Nations.” He also commended the courage of those who sacrificed their lives for peace. Guterres confessed that peacekeeping has become increasingly “dangerous and our peacekeepers are increasingly targeted.” He noted that in 2017, 61 peacekeepers lost their lives in attacks, the “highest number in a quarter century.” He further explained that many other peacekeepers died due to diseases or other incidents. Guterres also recalled the launch of the Action for Peacekeeping initiative in 2018, which included measures to reinforce partnerships with member states to handle peacekeeping challenges.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI continues to receive Moroccan celebrities for f’tour during Ramadan. After breaking fast with MMA champions Abu Bakr and Ottman Azaitar, the sovereign has invited Moroccan comedian Tahar Lazrak, also known as Oualas.

Rabat – FIFA has finally published its evaluation report on Morocco’s 2026 and North America’s United 2026 bid. Both bids made it to the last phase, when 211 football associations will cast their votes for the candidature they wish to win the hosting rights of the FIFA 2026 World Cup. Morocco hopes to be the second African country to host the world premier tournament in 2026, preparing a “well presented and strong” bid “in terms of government commitment,” according to the FIFA task force. The report demonstrates both the strengths and weaknesses of the Moroccan bid. The task force said in their evaluation report that Morocco needs to do a lot of work to guarantee stadiums that meet FIFA requirements for football fans and the 48 football teams, as well as good accomodation services. In its bid, Morocco promised to make 14 stadiums ready to house the games of the World Cup. FIFA’s task force said that 9 of the 14 stadiums need to be built from the ground up, while the 5 existing stadiums need significant renovation. More work to be done The report has shut down rumors that the task force will disqualify the Moroccan bid before the vote, scheduled for June 13 in Moscow during the 68th FIFA Congress. The evaluation, however, acknowledged that the government needs to do serious infrastructure work to make the North African country eligible to host the tournament. FIFA’s task force gave Morocco a score of 2.7 out of 5, while the United 2026 bid obtained a score of 4 out of 5. The United 2026 bid includes three countries bidding to host the tournament (US, Mexico, and Canada), while the Moroccan bid is playing solo to get the hosting rights. Morocco said that the renovation and construction of stadiums would require an investment of USD 2.2 million. Morocco’s bid committee has also promised FIFA that the renovation projects will be completed two years before the tournament: 2024. The Moroccan committee has also promised FIFA that all stadiums, will “be fully compliant with FIFA’s requirements.” The task force also said that Morocco will still have to build more than half of the 130 promised training sites. The Moroccan cabinet also pledged to finance all infrastructure works within its competency. In March, Morocco’s Minister of Trade and Industry and chairman of the Moroccan bid committee Moulay Hafid Elalamy said that the country will need a budget of USD 15.8 billion, including USD 3.2 billion from the private sector, in order to stage the tournament. FIFA positive about proximity between cities FIFA said that Morocco is blessed with strategic proximity between the 12 cities selected to stage the games: El Jadida, Nador, Fez, Marrakech, Oujda, Agadir, Rabat, Casablanca, Tangier, Tetouan and Meknes. “All of the host cities are located within a 550-km radius of Casablanca, which also serves as the main international gateway to the country.” The evaluation notes that both Casablanca and Marrakech’s international airports will serve as the gateways for visitors as both handle a “marked increase in domestic flights to the other proposed cities.” The task force also commended the significant improvement of intercity connectivity, owing to the building of high-speed rail lines and road improvements. The evaluation report, however, suggested more improvement in terms of frequency of trains and high-speed lines and public transport capacity between city centers and stadiums. FIFA’s gain? FIFA needs to guarantee good revenue for itself. The North American bid is forecasting the world governing football body a profit of USD 14.3 billion, double Morocco’s forecast: USD 7.2 billion. According to the report, Morocco’s bid scored “solidly when it comes to financial and  commercial considerations.” The report added that the organizing costs are estimated at USD 1.9 billion if the tournament were to be held in Morocco. According to the report, this is “lower than the baseline figure, which was derived from the organizing costs for the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia. Morocco satisfied with task force report Elalamy said: “We are all excited about being qualified for this stage and declared fit to organize such an event.” The Moroccan official promised to convince associations to vote for the Moroccan bid. “In the coming days, we will continue our mission to demonstrate to FIFA and the global football family, our ability to organize a genuine and profitable FIFA World Cup. The chairman of the committee also promised the world an “innovative, responsible and also compact with limited trips between matches, an asset that will allow players and fans to fully enjoy the event.” He added that football is an integral part of the Moroccan identity, promising a “magical and vibrant World Cup for players and fans in all our cities.”  President of the Royal Football Federation (FRMF) and member of the Moroccan bid committee  Fouzi Lekjaa said that if they choose Morocco on June 13, the “football family will make a historic choice that will allow FIFA to continue the development of football in the world.” Now the real countdown for the vote has begun. Eleven days remain until the FIFA congress, where football associations from all corners of the world will cast their vote for the future host of the World Cup.

Rabat- Palestinian Grand Mufti of Al Quds (Jerusalem) Muhammad Ahmad Hussein has expressed deep appreciation for King Mohammed VI’s humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, following the Gazan tragedy during protests against the US embassy move to Jerusalem in May.  The Islamic cleric described the sovereign’s initiative as an act of benevolence, kindness, and great generosity on Tuesday at the press house of Tangier. The imam of Al-Quds Mosque visited Morocco upon invitation by the Ministry of Religious Endowments and Islamic Affairs to attend the King’s lectures. He emphasized in a statement to the state-owned press, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), that Morocco has always been by the side of Palestine and that the act of solidarity is no surprise. “The wound of Palestinians is bleeding. The Palestinian people live in critical condition and are in dire need of their brothers to mend their wounds. The [King’s] assistance came to mend the wounds of Palestinians and make them realize that they are not alone but have brothers in the far Maghreb region who want to extend a hand of help,” the Grand Mufti told Moroccan news outlet Le 360. Last week, King Mohammed VI personally supervised the transport of humanitarian aid to Palestine at Casablanca airport. The King sent a Royal Armed Forces (FAR) medical unit and field hospital, stocked with blankets and medicine, as well as food aid from the Mohammed V Foundation of Solidarity. The aid was to assist the people of Gaza who witnessed and suffered the massacre which took place May 14, leaving thousands injured and dozens killed in protests the same day of the US Embassy’s inauguration.

By Lameese Madi Rabat- An American Student Highlights His Experience Fasting During the Holy Month of Ramadan.  Ramadan is a special time for many Muslims around the world. It is not only a time for fasting, but a time for families to get together and experience the struggles and joys of the holy month. For many non-Muslims, the practice seems strange and difficult, but for some, the challenge is enticing.   Lennon Jones, 24, studies Arabic in Rabat, Morocco. After graduating from Vassar College in New York, he decided to move to Morocco and continue his education in Arabic.   Although Ramadan is a traditionally religious Islamic duty to fast, many non-Muslims try to fast to obtain a better understanding of Islamic customs. When he decided to fast, Jones had already experienced Ramadan in Jordan, but he wanted to try his hand at fasting for the first time this Ramadan in Morocco. “I always thought about it in the back of my mind, oh maybe I’ll fast and maybe a couple days before Ramadan I decided, okay I’m going to fast.”   For most Muslims, the first couple of days in Ramadan are the hardest.  Getting into the routine of fasting, working, and finding time for religious devotion has its trials. Ramadan can be a time to learn useful skills, such as patience and time management. Jones experienced similar difficulties.   “The first day was easy and I was like, wow I can do this. But then these last two days have been a little bit tricky. The first time I’ve fasted, and I think I’m going to fast if not the whole month of Ramadan but at least a couple days. It’s been a rewarding experience.”   To keep the hunger at bay during Ramadan, Jones drinks plenty of water and eat wells.  “Food in a western culture is not so much to sustain yourself but it’s like an experiment. We go to these fun restaurants and find trends in foods, but it made me realize how we are separated with the substance part of [food] which is kind of the point of Ramadan…”  Unexpectedly, the first problem that he faced was actually boredom. The issues he faced were trying to find things to kill the time. As the days went on, he found that there was a lot of time for self-reflection and it was becoming a calming experience.  “The fasting was not really difficult, like the eating and the non-eating was not so difficult. The difficult part was changing my life and changing my schedule to not think about not eating and not preparing food and not buying a lot of food,” said Jones.  Jones does plan to continue to fast the rest of Ramadan after finding it challenging and rewarding.  “I don’t like to quit,” said Jones.

Rabat – “One World” is already a hit. Released yesterday, RedOne’s song for the 2018 Fifa World Cup Russia has already been viewed more than 1.3 million times on Youtube, trending #31 on the platform. Moroccan fans of RedOne will be thrilled to know that Morocco occupies a prominent place in this colorful clip shot in both Agadir and Moscow, which is dedicated to the long-awaited World Cup. The clip features Nadir Khayat, Adelina and Now United. The Moroccan producer has indeed kept its promises to promote Agadir, which is known as the “first national” seaside resort. The video, with 60 seconds devoted to Agadir, will be broadcast up to 5 times a day during the entire World Cup in Russia on all beIN Sports channels, revealing the city to the entire planet. To realize his project, the hit maker and Tetouan native signed a partnership with the Souss-Massa region in southern Morocco as well as the Moroccan National Office of Tourism (ONMT) to shoot the promotional video.  RedOne’s new production seems to be pleasing people on social media, especially in contrast with Said Naciri’s widely mocked “Malhama” tribute to the Atlas Lions, which has been harshly criticized and erased from the Youtube platform for copyright violations.

Rabat – The Moroccan interprofessional federation of milk (FIMALATI) urged the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch to intervene to end the boycott on Centrale Danone milk on Friday. In a meeting with the minister, FIMALATI representatives of Moroccan farmers expressed “strong concerns and their distress” following Centrale Danone’s decision to reduce their milk order from farmers by 30 percent. Minister Akhannouch is also the owner of Afriquia gas, which, along with Centrale Danone, is one of the three boycotted companies due to the high price of fuel. A statement from the Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture said that the professionals of the dairy sector exposed the “difficulties experienced by farmers, peasants, and milk producers” due to the boycott. The meeting also discussed the “devastating impact of the disruption of the production chain on pastoralists, compromising their income, their ability to repay their debts and maintain their investments.” The farmers have also decried the decline in the income of the entire value chain, added the statement. Akhannouch denounced the boycott in its early days. Akhannouch said, during the 13th annual International Agricultural Fair (SIAM) held in April in Meknes that the online campaign cannot stop 470,000 employees in the dairy sector. Akhannouch added that citizens “should be thankful for the fact that there are no milk shortages and the product is available throughout the year.” The ministry’s official statement followed a similar communiqué published by the government, calling on citizens to end the boycott for the sake of farmers. The boycott, according to the government, will negatively affect the 120,000 farmers who work for Centrale Danone and care for approximately 600,000 family members. The cabinet also warned that the boycott will have an impact on direct foreign investment and will lead international investments to look for other profitable markets. The boycott started on April 20, calling on three giants to lower prices of their products. Besides Centrale Danone and Afriquia Ali, the boycott also targets the mineral water company, Sidi Ali, owned by Moroccan businesswoman Miriem Bensaleh. The government, however, have not commented on the consequences of the boycott on Sidi Ali and Afriquia gas, and has singled out Centrale Danone to defend since the launch of the boycott six weeks ago.

Rabat – “Ramadan over sickness and oldness,” he said in 2017. An old video using the Qur’an to call the sick and elderly to fast, by nutrition specialist and radio host Mohamed Faid, is angering Moroccans on social media, despite Faid’s new video advising moderation.  In a 2017 video that has circulated recently in social media, Faid shocked people by asking those suffering from diabetes and blood pressure disorders to ignore their doctors’ recommendations and to fast during Ramadan. Faid, who built his reputation by hosting radio programs dedicated to nutrition, said he would take responsibility for any deaths of these people. His engaging 2017 speech has caused uproar among the public who were angry at the doctor’s dangerous guidance and for using Qur’anic texts to his advantage.  “What an idiot,” “Is he out of his mind?” “He is a liar and we have proof that sick and old people can’t fast during Ramadan in the Qur’an” were some of the negative comments on social media. However, some people seem to agree with the specialist, praising him for his advice.  Contacted by Morocco World News, Ikram Tikour, a nutrition specialist, explained that Faid recorded another video in 2018 giving the opposite views of his previous speech.  Moreover, Tikour made it clear that “sick and old people should NOT fast during Ramadan, as it is a matter of life or death.” Former Salafist Abous Hafs has also reacted to the footage. In a long post on Facebook, the former prisoner recalled “the role of Mr. Faid in promoting healthy food culture and warning against products harmful to health…. Personally I gave up several practices thanks to his interventions and orientations,” said the ex-Salafist. He added that disaster happens when you mix science and ideology. On the 2017 video, he commented that Mohamed Faid, “who is not a doctor but rather an expert in nutrition, is attacking a specialty that is not his own.” Abu Hafs also said he was “surprised to see the expert use a verse from the Qur’an where the term ‘suffering’ is used in its global sense. He then notes that the hadiths insist that God grants permissions and “likes these permissions to be used.”  Earlier this month, Faid recorded a one-hour live session on Youtube where he explained that some people who have diseases like cholesterol and heart diseases should fast, but those with type 1 diabetes should not fast.  What does the Qur’an say?  All sound and healthy men and women who have reached puberty are required to fast during Ramadan, according to the Qur’an. Yet, there are a range of people who are excused from fasting during the whole month or during certain days of it for special cases. Special cases include those who are traveling and find it hard to keep fasting; pregnant, breast-feeding, or menstruating women; and sick people are permitted to eat and drink during daylight hours, but they are obliged to make up the 30 day fast when they are able. In general, everyone who is physically or mentally unwell is permitted not to fast. According to the Qu’ran in Surah al Baqarah 2:185, “and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days.” But if the illness is permanent and there is no hope of recovery, Muslims should feed one poor person for each day that they did not fast in this Ramadan and in the previous one, because God says (interpretation of the meaning): “And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a miskeen (poor person) (for every day).”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has allowed the opening of 30 new mosques throughout Morocco, said Minister of Islamic Affairs Ahmed Toufiq. The minister said, in the presence of the King after Friday’s prayer at Al Ikhlass Mosque that the Ministry of Islamic Affairs had allocated MAD 200 million to build 11 new mosques and rebuild 17 others. The official added that the budget covered the revamping of two historical mosques that can accomodate 20,000 people. Toufiq said that Morocco has 51,000 mosques, 70 percent of which are located in rural areas. He also underscored the importance of preserving some 900 historical mosques and meeting the growing demand for mosques, estimated at 240 new mosques per year, given demographic and urban development. Toufiq added that legal and technical operation in mosques lead to the closure of approximately 140 mosques every year so they can be rebuilt. The official also added that there have been measures to ensure the neutrality of mosques and to support their religious, scientific, cultural, and social missions. The measures also aim to mobilize financial and human resources to integrate new technologies and address sustainability issues. According to Toufiq, the plans are based on three pillars: the expansion of the mosque network, the improvement of their quality, and the preservation of heritage. Toufiq also noted that there are 72,000 clerks in Moroccan mosques.

Rabat – President of the parliamentary group of the Justice and Development Party (PJD) Abdellah Bouanou has urged the government to lift subsidies on butane gas. In 2016, the previous government, led by former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane, introduced a reform of the compensation fund that provides subsidies to remove subsidies on butane gas and food products, such as flour. On May 29, Bouanou criticized the delay of the reform. He also criticized the Minister of Government and General Affairs Lahcen Daoudi. During the parliamentary meeting held in Rabat on May 29, Bouanou said that Daoudi told the group that “the clean-up of butane gas subsidies will not come into effect until 2022. The measures have been taken since the previous government so why this delay[?]” He added that some “threaten us and tell us to be careful not to touch the gas, but we must continue the reforms.”

The government has announced its determination to phase out subsidies on several products, including sugar, butane gas, and flour in January 2018. On January 23, Daoudi said that “many of those who are currently receiving support from the compensation fund do not want subsidies to be abolished as some of them consume 100 bottles of gas per day for water extraction.” Daoudi said there should be no increase in the prices of butane gas to respect the purchasing power of “poor and vulnerable categories.” An estimated MAD 12 billion was spent on the compensation fund in 2017, while nearly MAD 200 billion was spent between 2011 and 2015. Bouanou’s comes amid a major boycott targeting three companies: Centrale Danone, Afriquia gas, and Sidi Ali. Bouanou was among the officials who supported the ongoing boycott, unveiling the revenues of fuel companies. In a parliamentary meeting earlier in May, Bouanou said that removing subsidies could save the government as much as “MAD 7 billion in one year of additional profits” as the Moroccan market annually consumes 6.5 million tons of fuel. Bouanou also claimed that the profit margin for some fuel companies has tripled since the liberalization of fuel prices.

Rabat- Following the recently circulated video showing a woman and van driver being beaten with sticks by some masked men in the coastal city of Safi, the King’s Attorney General at Safi’s Court of Appeal has opened an investigation to examine the incident’s circumstances. The man and woman were beaten for allegedly engaging in sexual acts during Ramadan. Due to the violent content of the video, Facebook moderation rules labeled the video “alarming.” As the investigation continues, commenters on social media are also speaking their minds. Professor Toufiq Tajkan at the Ministry of National Education shared a controversial Facebook post criticizing the violence committed by the group of men for using the wrong tools to hit their victims. Tajkan said it would have been wiser if the attackers had stoned them instead. “Many of you who watched the video must have felt sorry for the man and woman who were beaten to a pulp with sticks,” he began, saying that he felt sorry that they were not stoned to death instead. The video, recorded by one of the attackers, revealed the bloodied face of the woman who insisted that she was not involved in any sexual act with the driver. Meanwhile the driver, who was also insulted and pushed around, repeated “Shame on you!” to the abusers as he tried to assist the woman who was panicking and trying to escape the men’s sticks inside the van.

Rabat – Denmark has passed a “burqa ban,” a law making it illegal to wear a “garment that hides the face in public.”  The law, which will take effect August 1, was passed yesterday by an overwhelming majority in the Danish Parliament with 75 votes to 30. The ban imposes a fine of DKK 1,000 (MAD 1,490) on first time offenders, but the fine increases tenfold after the fourth offense. Notably, the ban will include fake beards and ski masks that cover the face, but will not include clothing such as scarves in cold weather or masks worn on holidays like Halloween. Several European countries have banned women from wearing burqas or niqabs, including France, Belgium, and Austria. More European and African countries have introduced partial bans, including Spain, Italy, Chad, and Cameroon. In January 2017, Morocco banned the production and sale of burqas, but the kingdom does not prevent individuals from wearing them in public. While Denmark’s ban was praised by Danish Justice Minister Søren Pape Poulsen, Amnesty International’s Europe director, Gauri van Gulik, criticized the law’s restriction on freedom of expression. “If the intention of this law was to protect women’s rights, it fails abjectly. Instead, the law criminalises women for their choice of clothing and in so doing flies in the face of those freedoms Denmark purports to uphold.”

Rabat – Kuwaiti Preacher Mubarak al-Bathali claimed that the injury of Liverpool’s Egyptian footballer Mohamed Salah is “God’s punishment.” The preacher criticized Salah on Twitter, saying that “the player Mohamed Salah decided to play for Liverpool breaking the fast for the match. God punished him.” In another tweet, the preacher wrote that fasting is a must, adding that “football is not a legitimate excuse” to break the fast. The 25-year old footballer left the field of the Champions League final May 26 with a dislocated shoulder during the first half of the game against Real Madrid. International news outlets, including L’Equipe, accused Real Madrid’s footballer Sergio Ramos of deliberately injuring Salah. Al-Bathali, however, said the injury “is perhaps good” for Salah. ?????? ???? ???? ??? ????? ????? ???? ??????? ??? ??? ???? ?????? ???? ..

Rabat- In Thursday’s government council, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid revealed the number of children unregistered at birth and discussed the national campaign to accelerate birth registration, as well as approving other draft laws. During the meeting, Ramid presented a report on the campaign to grant birth certificates to children whose births were not registered with civil status offices. Granting birth certificates will ensure their full rights as Moroccan citizens, including access to education and healthcare. Abiding by Article 32 of the Moroccan constitution dictating the state’s duties towards children, the campaign is supervised by the Ministry of Justice; the Ministry of State for Human Rights; the Ministry of Interior; and the Ministry of Solidarity, Equality, Family and Social Development.  The campaign is staffed by 1,941 team members and regional committees and assisted by 2,110 civil status offices. According to Ramid, since the campaign’s launch in September 2017, 23,151 children have been registered, representing 28 percent of the 83,682 unregistered individuals according to 2017 figures. Meanwhile, 39,481 birth certificate applications are under processing. Ramid emphasized that parents’ failure to register their children is caused by their lack of understanding of the law. He also noted the campaign’s efforts to raise awareness of the importance of registering marriages and children at birth. The council also reviewed draft law 19.18 presented by the Minister of Economy and Finance, Mohamed Boussaid, which lists the professional duties of customs agents and redefines the government’s strategies on international trade. The council also approved a draft decree presented by Minister of Tourism, Industry, Trade, Investment and Digital Economy Moulay Hafid Elalamy, concerning the monitoring and analyzing of investments and corporate profits. The draft law was approved on the agreement signed by Morocco and the Republic of Congo in Brazzaville, Congo, on April 30, dedicated to preventing double taxation and tax evasion. The agreement was among several agreed on to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries. At the closing of the meeting, the council appointed new senior officials in the Ministry of Equipment, Transport, Logistics and Water. On the sideline, El Othmani referred to king Mohammed VI’s personal supervision of the humanitarian aid recently sent to benefit Palestinians in Gaza, Al Quds (Jerusalem), and Ramallah following the recent violence, while also hailing Morocco’s undying support for Palestine and until it achieves independence.

Rabat – Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi has criticized the US State Department’s 2017 International Religious Freedom Report on Morocco, emphasizing that it not based on precise scientific data. El Khalfi said, in a press briefing after Thursday’s weekly cabinet meeting, that the report is not “matching reality” and has “value judgments and is exaggerated,” stressing that Morocco is a country of “religious freedom.” The report noted that despite efforts to promote religious tolerance in the country, religious minorities experience social pressures in Morocco. El Khalfi has also announced that the ministerial committee in charge of examining reports on Morocco will consider the report prepare an answer. The report, published on Tuesday, said that religious minorities in Morocco, including Christians, Jews, and Bahais, represent 1 percent of the population. Shia Muslims represent less than 0.1 percent. The report also claimed that the government jailed Christians to question them about their beliefs at times. According to estimates from Christian leaders, there approximately 2,000 to 6,000 Christian converts in Morocco. The report also mentioned instances when Christians, Bahais, and Shia Muslims were allegedly pressured by civilians, including one person attacked for eating in public during Ramadan. In addition, the report notes that “Christian and Shia Muslim citizens stated fears of government harassment led to their decision to hold religious meetings in members’ homes.” In its 2016 report, the State Department also criticized the state of religious freedom in the country, claiming that several laws undermine freedom of belief in the country. “Some local Christians reported authorities pressured Moroccan Christian converts to renounce their faith,”  reads the report. The laws which undermine freedom of religion, according to the report, include: “the fact that Sunni Islam and Judaism are the only religions recognized by the state for native Moroccans,” “the prohibition of criticizing Islam on public platforms,” and “the criminalization of the rupture of the fasting during Ramadan for people known to be Muslim.”

Rabat- The Spanish Parliament passed a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, on Friday over corruption allegations. Rajoy’s rival, leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE), Pedro Sanchez, has been voted as Spain’s new Prime Minister in his stead. The years of corruption haunting Rajoy’s government have ended, as the ousted minister who was elected in 2011 has become the first prime minister in modern Spain to be deposed due to a vote of no confidence. Spain’s High Criminal Court convicted Rajoy’s party members of several corruption scandals including extorting money from government funds to finance his People’s Party (PP)’s election campaigns, in addition to contracts schemes with accomplices from the party. In the Spanish government system, when a “no confidence” vote is given to a prime minister, a new candidate must directly replace the one ousted. In total, 180 MPs voted in favor of no confidence, 169 opposed the motion, and one MP abstained from the vote. Before Sanchez was voted in,  Rajoy told the parliament: “It has been an honour to be the prime minister of Spain, it has been an honour to leave a better Spain than the one I found. I hope that my successor will be able to say the same when his time comes.”. In a speech after the vote, Sanchez pledged to create a “plural and stable government,” expressing: “Today, democracy has won…. Leave behind a time of corruption, inequality and confrontation.”  Although Rajoy has not been among those accused within the PP, he testified against a number of his party members, which lead the parliament to eliminate him too as the party’s leader.

Rabat – The Mauritania Ministry of Foreign Affairs has summoned Iranian Ambassador Mohamed Omrany to condemn the activities of “Majmaah Imam Ali,” an association linked to the embassy. Mauritanian news source Sahara Media reported Tuesday that Mauritania’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Isselkou Ould Ahmed Izidbih informed the Iranian ambassador that the country “will no longer accept any activity by the embassy or its affiliates to change the doctrine or creed of Mauritanian society.’ According to Sahara Media’s diplomatic sources, Mauritania informed the ambassador that they had taken a number of measures to “prevent any activity to spread Shiite ideology in the country.” Among the measures taken was the sacking of the imam in Majmaah Imam Ali and appointing a new imam. Sahara Media reported that its sources claimed that they have warned Iran to stop such activities, which threaten the “unity and faith of the society.” The source added that the country has cracked down on political parties and bodies linked to Iran and its proxy Hezbollah and has banned all activities supporting the party in Mauritanian of territory. The news source claimed that the country has “minimized its diplomatic representation in Tehran for several years” due to Iranian interference in Arab countries’ domestic affairs. Iran, however, has denied the allegations, indicating that the news is “rumors spread by Saudi Arabia,” according to Iranian official press agency Fars News. The news agency added that diplomatic ties between Iran and Mauritania are “normal.” Iran also denied that its ambassador was summoned, claiming that the official was received on May 29 by the Mauritanian minister to convey a letter on the “US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal” and “developments in the region.” Fars News added that both officials have discussed ways to straighten ties between the two states. Sahara Media, however, said that the Iranian ambassador was summoned on May 25. The developments came on the heel of Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran May 1. Morocco made the decision after discovering links between the Polisario Front and Iranian proxy Hezbollah. Morocco accused Hezbollah of training the Polisario Front in the Tindouf camps in Algeria and of providing them with military equipment. Morocco announced that it backed its decision with documented evidence that proves links between Polisario and Hezbollah. Iran, Hezbollah, and the Algerian-backed separatist group, Polisario, have all denied the allegations. Iran has also denied that Morocco presented any proof that demonstrates the Polisario and Hezbollah collusion.

Rabat – Six weeks into a major boycott of three prominent companies because of high prices, the government has officially expressed concerns about the “damaging consequences” of the campaign. The cabinet’s alert, however, has singled out multinational dairy company Centrale Danone, calling on citizens to avoid further damage to farmers and foreign investment in Morocco. The government published a statement on Thursday, saying that it has been following the boycott and Danone’s response, “which is characterized essentially by the decision of the concerned company to reduce its milk orders by 30%, with all its impact on farmers and the agricultural sector.” According to the statement, both Moroccan milk cooperatives and employees have called on the government to intervene. The government then emphasized that the boycott will negatively affect the 120,000 farmers who work for Centrale Danone and care for approximately 600,000 family members. Concerned about farmers or losing foreign investments? While addressing a humanitarian message to help farmers keep their jobs with the company, the government has also expressed fear of losing foreign investment which, according to the cabinet, will have a massive impact on the national economy. “The dairy sector is of great importance in the social and economic system of our country,” reads the statement. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani also claimed to take a set of initiatives to “improve the purchasing power of citizens and to act with firmness in terms of control of the market and to fight against speculation and monopoly.” In its official statement, the government never mentioned the other boycotted companies: Afriquia gas and Sidi Ali. Why Centrale Danone? In 2014, the Centrale company, called “Centrale Laitière” at the time, allowed Danone to acquire more than 90.86 percent of its shares. Danone had a29.2 percent stake in 2001, and a 46.8 percent stake in 2013. The international giant considers Morocco one of its most important markets, making a turnover of MAD 6.6 billion annually, according to Metis Consulting. Since the launch of the boycott on April 20, Centrale Danone and Moroccan officials have attempted to convince boycotters that the company has not increased prices on its products since 2013. The same statements were echoed from one official to another. One of the first statements defending the company came from Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi, who accused people supporting the boycott of sharing fake statistics. El Khalfi also claimed that Centrale Danone is selling its products at reasonable prices. Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid echoed the statement, recalling the consequences of the boycott on Moroccan farmers. “I am asking Moroccans, who have always been known for their wisdom and rationality, to suspend the boycott of milk.” In an interview with Moroccan television channel Al Oula, Minister of General Affairs and Governance Lahcen Daoudi pleaded that “more than 1,000 employees of this company are now homeless and cannot afford to feed their families during this month of Ramadan.” Daoudi also denied that the company has increased its prices since 2013, emphasizing that Centrale Danone sells its products at the same prices other companies do. According to Daoudi, Morocco is only a small market in Danone’s network. He claimed that the boycott may push the company to look for a more profitable market. “In 2017, we were the continent’s leading foreign direct investment hub. It is not at all sure it is the case this year.” Centrale Danone’s profit margin is ‘0.9%’ Daoudi claimed that the company’s profit margin is only 0.9 percent, while others are netting 24 percent. “Again, if the company closes, it is thousands of breeders will end up without resources. It is the income and dignity of these people that we are undermining.” Boycotters, however, are not buying the statements that victimize Moroccan farmers. Instead, people supporting the campaign are encouraging farmers to sell their dairy products independently. Boycotters allege that farmers only make MAD 200 a week, but they could make more if they sold their milk by themselves. None of the officials mentioned having talks with Centrale Danone to lower its prices in order to calm the boycott storm.  Boycott ‘without any reason’ Daoudi said that the boycott is “without any reason,” and that the “instigators of this movement are playing with fire, especially since this is a sector, namely agriculture, which is vital to our economy and which needs the most encouragement and support.” Government and Centrale Danone officials have also claimed that some people are boycotting without even knowing what it is about. In a recent interview with Media24, General Director of the company Didier Lamblin said: “What concerns us is when we ask people who boycott why they do so, many say they do not know and they are just supporting the boycott.” The chief executive of Centrale Danone confessed that the impact of the boycott is “very significant” and has led to Danone stopping all donations to foundations and freezing investment and recruitment.

Rabat – Al-Ahly is claiming USD 6 million in the liberation clause to set Walid Azaro free. The Moroccan international player has expressed his wish to leave after a year with the Egyptian club. Now courted by Wydad, will Azaro come back to Morocco? According to Al Akhbar, Al-Ahly has agreed to release its favorite striker Walid Azaro during the next summer transfer window, especially since he asked for it after the departure of his coach Houssam Al Badri. Azaro will not be left out. According to the same source, the Atlas Lion was contacted by a football agent who wanted to recruit him for Wydad. However, the price of the football player’s transfer far exceeds the means of the Casablanca club. Moreover, the Moroccan club has  strong competition, as the Moroccan striker has received a 7 million offer from an unidentified English club. Since his transfer to Egypt’s Al-Ahly club last summer, Azaro has shown the full extent of his talent as scorer.  Last month, he was named the highest-scoring foreigner in a single Egyptian season. This season, Azaro has outscored both the Angolan striker Flávio da Silva Amado and the Nigerian striker John Utaka, who previously held the record of 17 goals. A native of Ait Melloul, near Agadir, Azaro began his career with the Adrar Souss club in the highest division of the Moroccan amateur league. Before joining Al Ahly in 2017, Walid Azaro played for Difaa El Jadidi for a two-year period. He also participated in the final of the CAF Champions League, representing Morocco’s Atlas Lions, in 2017.

Rabat – A Spanish man has just been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for sexual abuse and rape against a Saharawi minor from Tindouf. Four years ago, the abuser hosted the victim in the eastern Spanish port city, Alicante, as a part of the summer vacation program organized annually for the benefit of the children in the Iberian country. Moreover, the abuser, who is a member of a local NGO that cares for sick children in Tindouf, was also sentenced by the Provincial Court of Alicante to pay a fine of EUR 3,240 for “corrupting a minor,” according to the Spanish press. The accused was also ordered to pay a compensatory fee of EUR 6,000 to the victim. He was banned by the court from receiving children from Tindouf camps for a period of four years. According to the judge of the provincial court, the minor was in Alicante in the summer of 2014  to receive treatment for an ear disease, at which time the child was touched repeatedly by the accused during his stay in the Spanish city. In addition, the searches carried out in the man’s home as part of the investigation revealed nearly 50 files containing pictures of children aged 12 to 15 who were either semi-nude or wearing underwear.
