Rabat – The Spanish political party Podemos has called on authorities in Spain to take the “necessary procedures” to stop the repatriation of 23 unaccompanied minors to Morocco, El Pais reported. The political party submitted a letter to the ombudsman, who must appear “in the Office of Children Prosecutor and the Central Alien Police Station” to check details of the procedure and to ensure the minors’ rights are respected. The Save the Children NGO also sent a letter to the Ministry of the Interior, the government, and the ombudsman, condemning the planned repatriation. The letter, according to the Spanish news outlet, asked that the deportation be abolished unless the children’s rights to security and welfare is guaranteed in Morocco. Earlier this week, the Spanish and Moroccan government agreed on the initial phase of a program to repatriate unaccompanied Moroccan minors. El Pais reported that the Child Prosecution Office in Madrid summoned 23 minors for a Moroccan delegation to interview. In addition to Save the Children and Podemos, several other associations and NGOs condemned the new joint repatriation measure. The Spanish Network of Immigration and Refugee Aid tweeted a call that “the process of deportation be stopped immediately.” The network described the move as “unfair and illegal.” The measure is in line with an agreement Morocco and Spain signed in March 2013 to improve border surveillance and readmission of undocumented migrants. Podemos is also known for opposing Morocco’s territorial integrity by supporting the separatist claims of the Polisario Front over Western Sahara.

Rabat – The Ministry of Agriculture has announced that Morocco will harvest 61 million quintals of the three main cereals, wheat, barley, and durum, for the 2018-2019 season. The forecast represents a decrease of 19% compared to the average production of 75 quintals. The final harvest forecast will depend on the weather and climate conditions. The ministry said that the 2018-2019 agricultural year recorded rainfall of 290.5 millimeters by April 24, 2019, 11% lower than the 30-year average of 326.3 millimeters and down 23% from the previous season.  This year’s irregular rainfall, the ministry acknowledged, led to lower harvest totals. For this season, farmers planted cereals on 4.7 million hectares, of which 3.5 million hectares are average to good land. Sixty-five percent of the cereal harvest will come from three regions: Fez-Meknes, Rabat-Sale-Kenitra, and Casablanca. On Monday, April 22, Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch said that the “agricultural production season will be average only for the three types of cereals.”

A source from the Ministry of Health said as many as 18 died and 22 were wounded. Local authorities rushed the victims to the Berkane regional hospital in northeastern Morocco and opened an investigation, under the supervision of the general attorney, into the accident and those responsible for the irregular migration attempt.  Police are looking for the driver of the vehicle, who is on the run.

Rabat – The grand mufti of Libya, Sadiq Al-Ghariani, has called on Muslims planning to perform a second hajj or umrah pilgrimage to Mecca to abstain, in a broadcast on the Libyan television channel Ean Libya. Those performing the hajj annual pilgrimage or the umrah, a lesser pilgrimage performed at any time of the year, for a second time “will commit an act of sin rather than a good deed.” The reason for the fatwa (Islamic legal opinions), the mufti says, is that the money pilgrims must pay to Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage “help Saudi Arabian rulers to carry out crimes against our fellow Muslims.” The money, he added, will contribute to the massacre of Muslims in Yemen, Libya, Sudan, Tunisia, and Algeria.  “Nowhere in the world,” said the mufti in a video, “hasn’t been thrown into havoc by Saudi Arabia.”  The grand mufti said he assumed full responsibility before God for issuing the fatwa.

Rabat – The Morocco Future Leaders (MFL) program has just announced the latest winners of its competition hosted in partnership with the US embassy in Morocco and the Anual Association. The goal of the MFL program is to train the next generation of young leaders in northern Morocco and strengthen their leadership, communication, and innovation skills. The program is designed to help youth build project ideas that would lead to social impact. “It is really important to keep working and developing projects like Morocco Future Leaders because these projects have a huge impact on our communities,” Safaa Ouchen, vice president of the Anual Association, told Morocco World News. “MFL is a starting point, a kickstart, projects like this will have a ripple effect across the country.” The competition selected 30 youth from seven different cities and areas in northern Morocco, Tangier, Tetouan, Al Hoceima, Larache, Chefchaouen, Ksar El Kebir, and M’Diq and Martil, based on their leadership potential and commitment to their communities. The candidates participated in four weekend trainings spread over four months. The weekend workshops focus on specific themes including identifying community needs, innovation, fundraising, and marketing projects through social networks. During the final weekend, participants had the opportunity to pitch projects to a jury who evaluated their presentations based on the innovation, impact, and feasibility of their project. “There were so many different pitches during the final week, but our main criteria was impact. We wanted to select a project that would change the most amount of lives,” Ouchen said. A project titled “Rouad f Douar,” which roughly translates from Darija (Moroccan Arabic) as “Village Pioneer,” won the competition. The winners, from Al Hoceima, Tetouan and Tangier, received $600 in funding, as well as mentoring to implement their project that focused on nurturing the leadership skills of youth.  “The Embassy of the United States of America is convinced of the potential of the Moroccan youth by working with you, through our local partners as Anual, we can help you unlock that potential,” said Stephanie Miley, the embassy’s charge d’affaires, in a press release. The Anual Association is a non-profit headquartered in Kenitra, just north of Rabat, that is dedicated to education and culture. “We are proud of the success of the MFL program. We have seen the evolution of each participant through training that contributed significantly to the birth of several projects from young leaders,” said Ilyass Benarouia, president of the association, in a press release. “We are delighted to see this initiative grow and evolve to be able to support and give a chance to a larger portion of our Moroccan society.” The MFL program is beginning the submission process of another funding proposal to the US Embassy in the hopes of hosting the program again next year. The necessary amount needed to run the program is $35,000. Anual hopes to increase the number of participants to approximately 100 next year.

Rabat – The UN Security Council’s Resolution 2468 on Western Sahara’s peacekeeping mission has called all parties to prioritize compromise, dialogue, and pragmatism. But the document’s language may embolden some to see an organized drift towards Morocco’s position. Faced with suspicions of business as usual, the Security Council seems determined to keep the new momentum in the Western Sahara settlement process. Resolution 2468 maintained neutral language, respecting the tradition of the UN. However, many of the few new additions reiterate points Morocco has been making, allowing a Morocco-friendly reading of the resolution. Amid speculations about the draft resolution over the weekend, a source told Morocco World News that the first draft adopted Morocco-friendly language. Dismissing earlier reports that the report would include a Morocco-hostile clause calling attention to Morocco’s allegedly grim human rights record in Western Sahara, the source revealed “none of the sticking points” of the first draft were against Morocco’s position. If adopted in that format, the source suggested, the resolution would actually reiterate a number of Morocco-friendly appeals. The information turned out to be exact, although the text of the final draft is filled with the usual diplomatic language aimed at pleasing all parties.
Like in previous resolutions, the latest document calls on all parties to show genuine commitment to the political process and come to the negotiations “without preconditions and in good faith.” The text welcomed “the new momentum” created by the Geneva meetings and called on all parties to take into account “the efforts made since 2006 and subsequent developments with a view to achieving a just, lasting, and mutually acceptable political solution.” Other resolutions used to refer to Algeria and Mauritania as only “neighboring countries.” The goal was to distinguish the two countries from Morocco and the Polisario Front, which were more directly referred to as “conflicting parties.” In the new resolution, however, all the four parties are accorded equal importance and weight. The draft reiterated “its call upon Morocco, the Frente Polisario, Algeria and Mauritania to cooperate more fully with each other, including through building additional trust.” More important, however, was the document’s repeated insistence on a “compromise-based political” process rather than a referendum. In what reads like a striking echo to one of Morocco’s repeated appeals in recent months, the draft “emphasized the need to achieve a realistic, practicable and enduring political solution to the question of Western Sahara based on compromise and the importance of aligning the strategic focus of MINURSO.” It added, “Realism and a spirit of compromise” by the parties are essential to achieve progress in negotiations. On the human rights question, rather than pointing fingers at Morocco, the draft called on all parties to shoulder their “roles and responsibilities.” The document highlighted “the importance of improving the human rights situation in Western Sahara and the Tindouf camps” while “encouraging the parties to work with the international community to develop and implement independent and credible measures to ensure full respect for human rights.” There have already been complaints in pro-Polisario circles that what UN diplomats call the “new momentum” is nothing but a planned validation of Morocco’s agenda. According to the argument, there have been secret meetings between Moroccan and UN representatives to push for a settlement that is more in favor of Morocco. With this new resolution, some may feel emboldened in their suspicions. As long as the UN is concerned, however, according to MWN’s source, the goal is to move forward and gradually break with decades of ineffective diplomacy. That the UN is determined to maintain the “new momentum” under the auspices of Horst Kohler is abundantly clear in Resolution 2468. Horst Kohler, the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara, has notified the four parties of a third roundtable meeting in Geneva. But it remains to be seen how the UN plans to water down the seemingly unbridgeable differences between Morocco’s and Polisario’s positions and broker the much-awaited settlement.

Rabat – Sixteen Sahrawis are calling for urgent help, complaining about torture and mistreatment in the Eddhaibia prison in Tindouf, Algeria. Ex-Polisario officer Mustafa Salma Sidi Mouloud told Morocco World News that he personally called an office in charge of human rights and refugees in Rabouni, demanding freedom of movement and the right to protest for Sahrawis. On Monday, Mustafa Salma posted on his Facebook page an announcement from several Sahrawis, who were arrested for their involvement in peaceful protests in Rabouni. Morocco World News received recordings of the prisoners, who condemned lack of freedom to protest and torture inside prisons. Mustafa Salma said that the prisoners called on the human rights office in Rabouni to intervene and urge the Polisario Front to release them. Mustafa Salma said that “one of the detainees, who was severely beaten at the gendarmerie, complained of severe pain and was not treated by a doctor.” The activist added that the detainee also announced his decision to go on a hunger strike despite his poor health. Mustafa Salma also shared 10 names of the detained activists, including another prisoner with wounds allegedly caused by torture. The Sahrawi told MWN that he told the human rights office about the arrest of 16 people on Monday. “I want to protest, but they are not letting me. I also want to condemn lack of freedom of movement. This is one of the complaints that I conveyed to the woman working in the human rights office,” Mustafa Salma said. Mustafa Salma posted on his Facebook that the Polisario Front issued orders to arrest the most famous writer in the camps, known as Moula Abou Zayed. The order came after he filed a complaint to the human rights office in Rabouni against attacks on protesters. According to Mustafa Salma, the front is preparing to charge the Sahrawi for incitement to disrupt public order. Continuous protests Since the beginning of the month, the Polisario Front has been under pressure because groups of Sahrawis have been carrying out sit-ins and protests in front of the Secretariat of the separatist group and the self-styled “Ministry of the Interior” to condemn tightened restrictions on freedom of movement in the camps. Mustafa Salma wrote on Sunday, April 28, that the front used force to disperse protesters in the camps. Mustafa Salma said there has been “violent intervention in a demonstration in the camps.” “The  police ran over protesters with security vehicles, causing ‘serious injuries,’” he added. The activist also shared photos of military tanks, accusing Polisario of deploying them against protesters. Several photos and videos posted online purport to show the ongoing demonstrations in Rabouni. Videos on YouTube show protesters shouting slogans, such as “Freedom of movement” and “Freedom.” Polisario allegedly prevents cars from leaving the camps more than once in 20 days.

Rabat – The French television channel TF1 aired a six-minute segment on Morocco’s cultural capital of Fez, called “A Weekend in Fes: Exploring the Largest Medina in the World,” on Saturday, April 27. Presented by Audrey Crespo-Mara and narrated by Pierre Gallaccio, the segment takes viewers on a journey into the heart of the city, navigating its narrow maze-like alleyways and lively souks. Recently renovated under King Mohammed VI, the northeastern city of Fez, which was Morocco’s capital until 1912, charms visitors from all around the world. The program tells visitors to Fez to “sharpen all your senses to soak up the atmosphere” of the city with “sounds of metal clangs forged, the colors, and the scents that will take you back in time.” Besides the babouch slipper market and ancient leather tanneries, the program made stops at several cultural and historical landmarks of the city. At the Bab Boujloud gate, Gallaccio says the Fez medina (old city) has “9,600 alleyways,” making it a “real labyrinth … and a compass for lost wanderers trying to work their way through the crowded streets of the medina.” Fez’s medina is home to the world’s oldest currently operating modern university of Al Quaraouiyine, founded by Fatima Al Fihriyya in 859, as recognized both by UNESCO and Guinness World Records.  The narrow streets of the medina make no room for vehicles, making mules, donkeys, motorcycles, and bicycles the only viable means of non-pedestrian transport.

Rabat – Supermodel Halima Aden will make history by becoming the first model to wear a hijab and burkini in the 2019 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue. The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit is an annual magazine that features women in swimwear at exotic locations around the world.  In this year’s copy of the magazine, which comes out on May 8, Aden will wear a burkini, the full-coverage swimsuit worn by some Muslim women that leaves only the hands, feet, and face exposed. Aden, who is Somali-American, grew up in Kenya’s Kakuma refugee camp, before moving with her family to the US at the age of seven. In 2016, Aden made headlines when she became the first contestant in Miss Minnesota USA to wear a hijab and burkini. “There are so many Muslim women that feel like they don’t fit society’s standard of beauty,” she told CNN at the time. “I just wanted to tell them it’s OK to be different, being different is beautiful, too.” In March this year, Aden was on the cover of Vogue Arabia, alongside models Ikram Abdi Omar and Amina Adan. All three were wearing black hijabs, a first for the magazine.  “I think it’s important to remember that wearing a hijab is a woman’s personal choice. It doesn’t make her any better or worse than another Muslim woman. To me, it symbolizes modesty and gives me a sense of power,” she told Vogue Arabia. According to Sports Illustrated, Aden has proved that there is a place for modest Muslim women in the fashion industry. And the magazine claims its photos are about beauty.  “At SI Swimsuit, we strive to continue to spread the message that whether you are wearing one-piece, a two-piece, or a burkini, you are the pilot of your own beauty,” the magazine  announced on Monday. Aden’s photoshoot contrasts with the magazine’s usual content. The magazine has in the past caused controversy, featuring racy bikinis that, for some, blur the line between fashion and pornography. The 2015 front cover featured model Hannah Davis in a low slung bikini bottom. Some readers were not happy. “Outrageous..inappropriate..pornographic…unnecessary…nasty,” one reader tweeted about the cover.

Rabat – Last night Dior presented its dazzling new collection at the historical ruins of El Badii Palace in Marrakech. Over 100 models walked the runway on Monday, April 29, around an enormous 16th-century outdoor pool lit up by hundreds of floating candles.  Titled “Common Ground,” the collection by Italian Maria Grazia Chiuri showcased colors, patterns, and cuts with a clear African influence. Its main inspiration was wax fabric, the colorful, patterned cloth synonymous with vibrant sub-Saharan Africa. “Maria Grazia Chiuri has always had her heart set on establishing creative exchanges with African cultures,” a Dior representative said. “With this collection, she sought to dialogue with the real and imagined landscape of Morocco, at the crossroads of the Mediterranean, Europe and Africa, as a dream destination for artists, poets, writers and eternal adventurers.” Chiuri consulted with French anthropologist Anne Grosfilley on the beautiful African wax fabrics which are used as a form of communication and expression. “Wax celebrates diversity; it is the fabric of a meeting of cultures,” says Dior. Chiuri collaborated with Uniwax, a wax design studio and factory from Cote d’Ivoire, to reinvent Dior fabrics, including revisiting the flagship Toile de Jouy.   She also collaborated with designer Pathe’O from Burkina Faso, who is known for dressing Nelson Mandela. The show also paid homage to Morocco, collaborating on the set-up with Sumano, an association that promotes traditional ceramic from the northern Rif Mountains and weaving from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, and with ceramic company Bouchra Boudoua. “Fashion is a unique blend, inspired by innumerable places and times, which come together to create a new vision,” says Dior.  Some 800 guests attended the show, including celebrities Jessica Alba, Lupita Nyong’o, Karlie Kloss, and Shailene Woodley.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI appointed Zouhair Chorfi, Mohamed Sadiqi, Khalid Safir, Mounia Boucetta, and Fouzia Zaaboul to the government’s transfer commission for privatization on Monday. The names of the members appeared in the Official Bulletin No. 6773.  The King chose the members based on their competence in financial, economic, and social matters. The role of the five-person transfer commission is to assist the minister of finance, Mohamed Benchaaboun, in transfers and privatizing state-owned entities. The members are expected to give their opinions on privatization operations, especially in light of new regulatory provisions. The King also appointed Abdellatif Jouahari, Ahmed Reda Chami, Mohamed Amine Banhalima, Hassan Boubrik, Amina Benkhadra, Ghizland Guedria, and Dia Oudghiri to the evaluation body. Jouahari will act as president of the body and Chami as vice-president. The evaluation body will take note of the valuation report issued by the minister responsible for the transfer as well as the offer price of the participant. The minister of finance is expected to seek the opinion of this body to set the terms of direct attribution. The appointments are part of the government’s plan to carry out MAD 10 billion (approximately $1 billion) worth of privatizations in 2019. The estimated revenue from privatization is MAD 5 billion ($518 million), which will go to the general budget. The main goal of the privatizations is to reduce Morocco’s annual budget deficit which currently stands at 3.7% of GDP. The government also hopes to initiate a new strategy for managing the state’s portfolio. The hope is that privatization will modernize the national economy, increase the share of foreign direct investment, improve the industrial and financial returns of companies, and increase job-creating investments.    The privatization plan involves opening up the capital of some public enterprises which are operating in competitive sectors. The second aspect of the plan is transforming certain public establishments which have commercial characteristics into public limited companies to eventually introduce them to the stock market. This was the case for Maroc Telecom and Marsa Maroc. In January, Parliament passed Law 91.18 which added La Mamounia Hotel and the Tahaddart Thermal Power Plant to the list of companies the state could privatize. Although they have been added, the companies will not necessarily be sold in 2019 because the government seems to want to remain flexible.

Rabat – Fake news is a global problem. The Facebook page “Matpartagich,” which literally means “don’t share” in the Moroccan dialect of Arabic, is tackling the issue. Created on March 25, the page aims to fight rumors and fake news circulated on social media. The page already has over 11,000 followers. “We are on the look-out for anyone who tries to fool Moroccans for political purposes. The wise will be informed of the truth,” says the page.  Last week the page called out a photo of a homeless mother and son playing on the street, allegedly taken in Morocco. After social media users circulated the picture, a number of people started raising funds for the Moroccan mother. However, Matpartagich confirmed the photo was actually taken in the Philippines and unrelated to Morocco. Matpartagich also picked up a fake story about the German government not taxing Muslim restaurants and markets during Ramadan. The stories Matpartagich picked up may for the moment be smaller tabloid matters, but the page has a broader role.  Thanks to social media, news, both true and false, circulates quickly. Initiatives like Matpartagich remind Moroccan users that not everything they see and read online is true. News stories can generate strong emotions. When other users react to or re-share a piece of information, it validates a belief that the information is important because of the emotions it creates.  Pages like Matpartagich remind users to stop and think about the truth in what they read before re-sharing information.

Rabat – The president of the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra Regional Council, Abdessamad Sekkal, has commended the integrated coastal zone management project launched on Monday, April 29.  Sekkal emphasized in a statement the full participation of the regional council in accordance with the Constitution and Law 12.81, saying the project must be “integrated and sustainable.” Sekkal called on all stakeholders, actors of the “non-centralized interests,” and territorial collectivities to effectively take part in “deepening their understanding and approach of the project” in the planning process for development and coastal security. “The coastline of the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region, which is not relatively long next to other regions, poses much more problems,” Sekkal said. He added that the region does not benefit enough from its coastline, requiring the government to protect it from damage it has sustained for decades. He noted that the coastline is threatened by climate change, which resulted in an exceptionally high tide in Sale’s Sidi Moussa area. He called for improvements to humid areas like Sidi Boughaba, 35 kilometers north of Rabat, and Moulay Bousselham, 140 kilometers north of Rabat. The Sebou river in Kenitra, a city north of Rabat, is especially important for investment, Sekkal stated, saying it could be put to good use for the area based on global experience in river management.  Sekkal also warned against the threats of the exploitation of sand dune reserves and the excessive use of fertilizers which have harmed the ecological system.  Regarding the project of the port of Kenitra, Sekkal stated, “Our region is the only one that does not have a large port, but we hope the project will be an added value.”

Rabat – The UN Security Council has voted on and adopted Resolution 2468, extending the mandate of the UN peacekeeping operation in Western Sahara, also known as MINURSO, for six months. Russia and South Africa abstained from the vote.  The resolution calls on the parties in the conflict to achieve a realistic and durable solution to the conflict. The vote followed another strong debate between the US and France over the length of MINURSO’s mandate. While France asked for one year, the US supported only a six month extension. Like previous resolutions on Western Sahara , the new text reaffirmed commitment to “assist” the parties involved in the conflict  to achieve a “realistic, practicable and enduring political solution to the question of Western Sahara based on compromise.”  The resolution also keeps the same language contained in previous resolutions in which the Security Council gives prominence to the Moroccan autonomy plan.  The resolution takes note of “of the Moroccan proposal presented on 11 April 2007 to the Secretary-General and [welcomes] serious and credible Moroccan efforts to move the process forward towards resolution.”  Preambular paragraph seven reiterates the council’s call upon Morocco, the Frente Polisario, Algeria and Mauritania to cooperate more fully with each other, including through building additional trust, and with the United Nations, as well as to strengthen their involvement in the political process and to achieve progress towards a political solution.  The language of this paragraph brings a new and significant change in comparison to the previous resolution. While in resolution 2440 the Council makes a distinction between the parties and neighboring states, the new resolution removes this distinction and names the four parties on equal footing.  The resolution also called upon the parties—Morocco, Algeria, Polisario, and Mauritania—to “cooperate more fully with each other, including through building additional trust, and with the United Nations.” The resolution echoed a statement from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and his Personal Envoy Horst Kohler, who recalled that trust is necessary to end the 44-year-old conflict. The conflict, according to Resolution 2468, requires all parties’ strong commitment and involvement in the political process “to achieve progress towards a political solution.” The resolution also stresses that a political solution to the conflict would contribute to stability and security “in turn leading to jobs, growth and opportunities for all the peoples in the Sahel region.” Contrary to the anti-MINURSO sentiment shared of US National Security Adviser John Bolton, the Security Council expressed its full support for MINURSO and its “important role played” on the ground. The resolution also insisted on the importance of the mission’s mandate, including “its role in supporting the Personal Envoy to achieve a mutually acceptable political solution.” The text also includes a paragraph in which the Security Council expressed concerns about the “violations of existing agreements.” The UN annual report on the Western Sahara situation mentioned several violations committed out by the front, with Guterres urging Polisario’s militias to meet MINURSO’s staff in Rabouni, Algeria, and not in the area Polisario claims is “liberated zones.”

Rabat – For the first time in five years, ISIS has released a new video message featuring who it claims to be Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the terror group’s leader. In the video, Baghdadi appeared sitting cross-legged on the ground next to an assault rifle and spoke on-camera for approximately 40 seconds. During the video, he announced the end of the battle for Baghouz, a town in eastern Syria which was the terrorist group’s final stronghold. “Truthfully, the battle of Islam and its people against the cross and its people is a long battle,” Baghdadi said in the video. “The battle of Baghouz is over. But it did show the savagery, brutality, and ill intentions of the Christians towards the Muslim community.” In late March, the Syrian Democratic Forces, a coalition of Kurdish and Arab soldiers backed by US, British, and French special forces, pushed ISIS out of Baghouz, marking the collapse of the group’s self-proclaimed caliphate. Later in the video, the man claiming to be Baghdadi praised the recent Easter Sunday church bombings in Sri Lanka, which killed more than 250 people and wounded at least 500 on April 21. He also referenced recent political events, including Benjamin Netanyahu’s election victory in Israel, the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in Algeria, and the ousting of President Omar al-Bashir in Sudan. If proven authentic, the video, which ISIS media wing al-Furqan posted on Monday, would be the first time Baghdadi has been seen since July 2014—when he proclaimed the existence of the caliphate at the Great Mosque in Mosul, a city in northern Iraq.

Rabat – The 2018 Trends in World Military Expenditure report that the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) released in April 2019 announced that Algeria had “by far the highest military spending in Africa” with a total of  $9.6 billion in 2018. “While in nominal terms Algeria’s military spending has remained the same since 2016, inflation meant that military expenditure fell in real terms by 6.1 per cent between 2017 and 2018,” said the report. SIPRI did not list Morocco in the report, but the institute’s database shows that Algeria spent nearly triple on its military as Morocco did in 2018 at $3.5 billion. Morocco’s military budget slightly increased from MAD 29.4 billion ($3.2 billion) in 2012 to MAD 34.7 billion in 2018 ($3.5 billion). While Algeria has experienced months of crisis in 2019, the role of its military has remained dominant. Top military figures have taken the lead during the transition period after President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s resignation early in April. Before Bouteflika resigned, army chief Gaid Salah took the initiative to call for application of Article 102 of the Algerian Constitution to declare the president incapacitated. Salah retained influence despite the fall of Bouteflika’s government, which deprived him from his role as a deputy minister of military. Many protesters have called for the Algerian military to stay out of politics. SIPRI’s recent report said that military spending in Africa fell by 8.4% in 2018, with a total of $40.6 billion, 2.2% of global military spending. Military spending in North Africa totalled $22.2 billion in 2018, representing a 5.5% decrease compared with 2017 but still 74% higher than spending in 2009. The world spent approximately $1.822 trillion in 2018, 2.6% more than in 2017. The top five countries with the highest military expenditures were the US, China, Saudi Arabia, India,  and France.  The top five countries accounted for 60% of global military spending.  Algeria fifth largest arms importer The Swedish institute also ranked Algeria among the top five importers of major arms in the world between 2014 and 2018 in its 2018 Trends in International Arms Transfers report. Algeria ranked fifth and imports 4.4% of the world’s traded arms, while Morocco ranked 24th with only 1.1 % share of arms imports. Algeria received the majority of its arms from Russia, accounting for 66% of Algerian arms imports in 2014-2018, although the percentage was down from 90% in 2009-2013. Morocco, on the other hand, received 62% of its arms from the US in the period of 2014-2018. France is also a key supplier for Morocco. In the 2014-2018 period, Morocco received 32% of its major arms from France. The top four importers are India, Australia, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia.

Rabat – April has been the most turbulent month for the ongoing teachers’ movement in Morocco. In the last 30 days, the capital city of Rabat has experienced nearly a dozen teachers’ protests, more than 60 injuries, several inconclusive meetings, and the collapse of an agreement that was supposed to bring an end to it all. The month began with Minister of Education Said Amzazi threatening to begin firing protesting teachers and ended with the unions announcing a short “break” to the months-long strike. But both the length of this break and what it means to the movement remains uncertain. At the core coalition are the “contractual teachers” who make up the majority of the protestors and are represented by the Coordination of Teachers Forced into Contracts (CNPCC). The government hired teachers within the union under renewable contracts. Their initial main demand was to be integrated as public sector employees, which would allow them more job stability, health care, and a pension plan. However, as the months have drawn on their stipulations have increased. Additional demands now include the protection of the right to strike, periodic pay increases, increased teacher training, improved student transport, the construction of more schools, wages for the months of protests, and the re-employment of suspended contractual teachers. While the contractual teachers, as well as other teacher groups, having been taking to the streets since February, the month of April was the most tumultuous.  National, regional and local meetings between teacher unions filled the last weekend of April, during which representatives from all 12 of Morocco’s regions debated the future of the movement. Following a majority-rules vote, the CNPCC announced on Sunday, April 28, its decision to take a “break” from the months-long strike and return its teachers to the classroom temporarily. Eleven of the 77 regional CNPCC representatives, roughly 14%, opposed the decision to suspend the strike—fearing it would paralyze the movement’s momentum. In an attempt to avoid this, the statement also explained that teachers would be wearing black badges throughout the work week to continue to show solidarity with the movement and “to mourn the dignity of teachers.” “The black badge is a message to the Ministry of Education and to all of those responsible that teachers are still at battle and will continue to express our dissatisfaction,” Latifa Aitali, the regional coordinator for the CNPCC’s Marrakech region, told Morocco World News (MWN). “Putting on that black badge is as significant as the protests and demonstrations in the streets.” According to the CNPCC, the suspension decision was motivated by the teachers’ desire to “preserve student rights.” The union claims their decision was in direct response to a letter sent by the National Moroccan Federation Associations of Students’ Parents (FNMAPE) begging teachers to return to school. Sent on Thursday, April 25, the letter, translated from Arabic, stated, “We hope to prevent the continued incitement between elements of the education system that is detrimental to the interests of teachers, students and the kingdom … On behalf of the students of this country and their parents, we renew our call to suspend the strike and apply the promises of the April 13 agreement.” The temporary end to the strikes comes days after riot police used water cannons and batons to disperse hundreds of protesting teachers. The final full week of April marked the month’s first violent clash between police and protesters. On Wednesday, April 24, teachers attempted to hold an overnight sit-in by the Parliament in Rabat, but were dispersed by riot police and water cannons. Throughout the night and into the next morning, teachers trying to regroup at the Parliament were continually disbanded by riot police. According to the CNPCC, 65 demonstrators were injured during the nearly 12-hour protest that began at Rabat Agdal Station and ended in side-streets all throughout Morocco’s capital city. Riot police at the march and representatives from the National Security Headquarters declined MWN’s multiple requests for comment. In the afternoon of Thursday, April 25, teachers held a silent march in front of the Ministry of Education to show solidarity with the injured and protest the violence inflicted by police forces the night before. The silent march was the end of that week’s three-day protest—which began on Tuesday, April 23. Khalid Bourhda, deputy coordinator of the CNPCC’s Rabat district, told MWN that the protests during this week were some of the largest he had ever seen. As the deputy coordinator, Bourhda sits in on all of the local CNPCC Rabat meetings and then helps coordinate the marches with the use of popular social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook. Unions organized the protests after Amzazi suspended the dialogue between the ministry and the teacher unions. In a statement, Amzazi claimed the unions had “breached the obligations” of their previous agreement by not returning to the classroom. He added that the ministry would only “resume dialogue on the condition that teachers return to work.” Unions retorted by releasing a statement claiming the ministry had breached the obligations of the agreement first by “continuing to take legal actions against striking teachers.” Amzazi denied all of the CNPCC’s claims and said, “The ministry adhered to what was agreed by suspending all administrative and legal measures taken against the teachers.” The agreement that was reached on April 13 may have officially lasted 10 days, but did nothing to stop the ongoing back-and-forth between the ministry and the union during the third week of April. Following the April 13 agreement, several groups of teachers began to trickle back to their schools over the weekend leading up to Monday, April 15—the agreed upon day teachers would return to work. Several of the early-returners claimed that despite the Ministry of Education’s promises, the government was still pursuing legal action against them. These legal measures include not paying teachers’ suspended wages, the postponement of professional qualifying exams, and the re-examination of unsigned teacher contracts. The claims went viral throughout the half-dozen teacher union Facebook pages that form the base of the movement’s communication. The posts sent a wave of dissent through the protesting teachers, many of whom immediately refused to return to classrooms that Monday. In the span of two days, the government informed the protestors of their agreement, the union instructed them to return to work, and colleagues told them to rally for more strikes. Confusion ensued and led to several days of meetings between union representatives.  On Thursday, April 18, CNPCC announced the coalition’s protests would continue until the end of the month.  The other unions that make up the coalition represented by the CNPCC include the Democratic Confederation of Labor (CDT), the Democratic Labor Federation’s National Education Union (FDT), the National Teaching Federation (FNE), the General Union of Moroccan Workers (UGMT), and the National Federation of Teachers (UMT). The following day, the unions stated if the government continued to “not act in favor of the contractual teachers [by not integrating] them into the public sector” the protests would extend indefinitely. After the April 28 announcement of the strike suspension, the CNPCC’s threat of a blank year, a full year without work, no longer applies. The end of the second week of April was the closest the teacher unions and the Ministry of Education came to resolving the teachers’ issues. Following several rounds of negotiation between the largest five unions and the ministry, the parties reached a resolution. The government announced the April 13 agreement over the weekend, and many prematurely celebrated the news as the official end of the teachers’ strikes. In an effort to pressure the ministry into taking the negotiations seriously, the unions hosted a three-day protest in Rabat April 8-10, prior to the meeting. The largest protest that week was on April 8—protesters outside of Rabat’s Parliament made it clear the government would have to meet their terms if they wanted the strike to end. Chants of “We won’t give up, we won’t give in” and “No integration, no peace” blared through megaphones into the faces of the police officers surrounding the building. “We have been protesting for too long to accept half of our terms,” Nabril Chamssi, a 28-year-old English teacher from Sidi Ifni, approximately 700 kilometers south of Rabat, told MWN. “If all of us go back to our jobs than all that we have done will have been in vain.” Days before attending the protest, Chamssi received a warning letter from his principle stating if he did not return to class within 60 days he would be fired. Chamssi claimed all 150 of his colleagues from Sidi Ifni, who attended the three-day strike with him, received the same notice. These warning letters issued by the ministry is what sparked the three-day protest. During the last days of March, Amzazi vowed to begin firing protesting teachers if they continued their demonstrations into April. Betting on Amzazi’s threat being a bluff, teacher unions protested into April, marking the third month of continuous demonstrations. According to Amzazi, Morocco has 240,000 teachers in all of its education sectors, 35,000 of whom are contractual teachers. The CNPCC claims that more than 10,000 of these teachers are participating in the national strike. While the Ministry of Education disputes the union’s calculation, it has not released its own version of the numbers. Unions scoffed at Amzazi’s threat of firing nearly 30% of Morocco’s contractual teachers. The ministry’s hiring of contractual teachers began in 2016 and was done in order to fill the already existing shortage of teachers. The firing of the teachers would also increase Morocco’s already high unemployment rate. According to Inside Arabia, 80% of contractual teachers are under the age of 30, and 23.2% is the current unemployment rate of that age demographic. The “Cell 9 Coordination” has been alongside the contractual protesters since the beginning of the movement in February. The name of the group is a pun on the famous Moroccan book “Tazmamart Cell 10” and a reference to the government’s ninth pay grade. The members of the group are a part of this pay grade and feel they are long overdue for a promotion to the 10th. The average difference between the two grades is MAD 1,500 per month ($155). According to the Ministry of Education, there are more than 4,560 teachers within the ninth pay grade. The Cell 9 Coordination has agreed to abide by the CNPCC’s decision to suspend the strikes. The “Coordination of Teachers with High University Degrees” has also joined forces with the Cell 9 Coordination and the contractual teachers. In a similar fashion, these teachers are demanding a promotion and the redesign of the current framework, which they claim makes it difficult to achieve a promotion.  Three other groups with no direct ties to the teacher causes have also taken to protesting in Rabat this month. Protests began happening in Rabat and Casablanca immediately following the April 5 decision of the Casablanca Court of Appeals to uphold the one-to-20-year sentences given to 54 Hirak Rif activists. Led by the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH) and several Amazigh (Berber) rights groups, the largest march with hundreds of protesters demanding the immediate release of the imprisoned activists took place on Sunday, April 21. A day after the CNPCC announced its strike suspension, doctors replaced teachers in front of the Parliament in Rabat. The Independent Union of Moroccan Public Doctors (SIMSP) has been hosting protests and organizing strikes since December 2018. The doctors are demanding better wages and work conditions for all medical professionals working within the public sector. According to organizers from the AMDH, many of the disenfranchised groups are attempting to coordinate a unified national Labor Day march on Wednesday, May 1, in Rabat.

Rabat – A sea of black-clad doctors, all members of the Independent Union of Public Sector Doctors (SIMSP), descended upon the Parliament in Rabat on Monday, April 29, to continue protesting for better wages and working conditions for medical professionals in the public sector. SIMSP gathered members from a range of medical fields in the public sector, including doctors, pharmacists, and dental surgeons to march from the Ministry of Health to Parliament in the “fifth phase” of the doctors’ protests. Throughout the week, protesting doctors will be wearing black to represent death and to show a marked contrast to their usually white coats. “We came out to protest this week to show the government our desperate need for better conditions,” Dr. Alaoui El Mountadar, the secretary general of SIMSP, told Morocco World News. “Without good conditions we can not perform our duty to the civilians of Morocco. We are all victims of this broken system.” A statement by SIMSP has asked all doctors affiliated with the union to take part in the strike, whether by traveling to Rabat to march or by simply staying at home in solidarity. The crisis has had immediate implications. As the strike continues, the shortage of doctors has caused the suspension of surgical operations in several public hospitals. However, some doctors have agreed to continue work in emergency cases.  “Of course we will go back to the hospitals if people are in desperate need of us. Our duty will always be to the Moroccan people first. But if we don’t protest like this, then the government will never listen and everything will get worse,” a Marrakech-based female general physician told MWN requesting anonymity because of employment concerns. According to SIMSP, the health sector suffers from the lack of a clear national strategy to meet the demands of citizens and solve the institution’s structural problems. The body says that Moroccan hospitals do not have the appropriate equipments or logistical means to deal with the majority of urgent cases. Over the years, SIMSP has frequently requested that the ministry re-evaluate the basic salary scale for medical professionals in the public sector. The union wants its members’ wages to be calculated with the public service Index 509, which recognizes the eight-plus years of study required to become a doctor. In Morocco’s current system, medical professionals in the public sector are paid under Index 336, which recognizes only five years of study. SIMSP has organized a series of protests over the last few months and has met with representatives from the Ministry of Health. Although there have been agreements between the two parties, with the government vowing to meet doctors’ demands, the government has not delivered yet. The promises have done little to improve the situation of any doctors in Morocco, according to El Mountadar. “We aren’t sure the government is listening. We have been protesting for months now and have met with the ministry but still nothing,” El Mountadar said. “We will just double our efforts if that is what it takes.” Since October 2018, nearly 560 doctors have resigned in protest. Just last week, 123 doctors resigned from hospitals in the Beni Mellal region in central Morocco because of “catastrophic and off-putting conditions that affect the public health sector. A week before that, on April 19, 305 doctors resigned from hospitals in the northern Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region because of “the deterioration of the health system in the Tangier region and the absence of proper work conditions in public hospitals.” In October 2018, more than 130 doctors resigned from hospitals in the Casablanca-Settat region because of the dire conditions in Morocco’s hospitals, including the lack of equipment and infrastructure. The SIMSP is currently considering joining the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH) and other organizations in a unified national Labor Day march on Wednesday, May 1, in Rabat.

Rabat – A Palestinian research center said that Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have detained 50,000 Palestinian children since 1967.  Abd al Nasser Ferwana, the director of the Commission of Detainees Affairs’ Studies and Research Unit, stated the figure in a press release.  IDF detained 16,655 since 2000, the time of the second Intifada, known as Al-Aqsa Intifada, which was marked by numerous intensive violent episodes between Palestinians and Israelis.  The Palestinian news outlet Wafa quoted Ferwana saying that the detention of Palestinian children is a systematic approach by Israel that aims to undermine the future and reality of Palestinian children. Ferwana noted that IDF arrested 700 children per year on average between from 2002 to 2012. The rate of detentions increased significantly between 2011 and 2018, when it hit 1,250 arrests yearly.  Ferwana called on those concerned to join forces to improve the legal status of Palestinians and the legitimacy of their struggle and to expose the human rights abuses and violations committed against Palestinian children.

Rabat – Christchurch police in New Zealand arrested a man on Tuesday and found a package with a suspected explosive device at an unoccupied property. The police cordoned off streets in the Phillipstown area of Christchurch and secured the package with the help of a bomb disposal unit. “Police have located a package containing a suspected explosive device and ammunition at a vacant address in Christchurch,” the district police commander superintendent, John Price, said in a statement. The police said that a 33-year-old man from Christchurch was arrested and that the cordon was later lifted. The New Zealand Herald reported that the police mobilized after they received threats about an explosive device and immediately started evacuating nearby houses as a precaution. The police also established a no-fly zone in the neighborhood. On March 15, a far-right extremist opened fire on two mosques during Friday prayer in Christchurch. The deadly terrorist attack killed 50 people and left 50 others wounded. The 28-year-old terrorist is in a high-security prison pending his next court appearance on June 14.

Rabat – The Moroccan State Secretary for Sustainable Development Nezha Al Ouafi has announced that 19 new waste valorization and burying centers will be built by the end of 2019. Construction of eleven of these is already underway. Al Ouafi met with the Association of Natural Science Teachers (AESVT) in Fez last week to discuss the waste management in Morocco.  She said disposal, valorization, and burying of waste is a “priority” for the Ministry of Mines, Energy and Sustainable Development. The ministry is currently tackling the conversion of 25 unregulated dumpsites into valorization and landfill centres. At the meeting, AESVT presented recommendations to the ministry on Law N. 28-200 which regulates waste management. AESVT recommended the law be revised, in particular in relation to the definition of “waste,” to recognize waste as an asset to be revalorized, reported national television channel 2M.  AESVT is a large national non-profit organisation of more than 2000 employees and 10 000 volunteers. It runs 18 environmental education centres across Morocco. A 2014 report by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), found that Morocco produced 6.852 million tons of waste that year, including 1.2 million tons of industrial waste.  Only 35% of waste collected in urban areas was disposed of in regulated waste disposal centers. The ministry estimates that Morocco will produce up to 6.2 million tons of household waste in 2020. A National Household Waste Program is currently in place to promote waste collection, treatment and valorization in Morocco. It aims for 90% household waste collection and treatment rate by 2020.

Rabat – The Security Council has postponed the vote on its new resolution to extend the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, also known as MINURSO. The vote, which was initially scheduled for Monday, will take place Tuesday, April 30. According to a source familiar with the negotiations, the duration of the mandate will be for six months, until October 31. The US has been adamant about reducing MINURSO’s mandate to six months to push the parties to show more resolve and good faith to move the stalled political process forward. During the negotiations, the US delegation also proposed ending MINURSO’s mandate and replacing it with a Special Political Mission, but the proposal did not gain any momentum. The proposal mirrors US National Security Adviser John Bolton’s views on MINURSO. The American official has on many occasions lambasted MINURSO and accused it of failing to fulfill its mandate. Aside from the duration of MINURSO’s mandate, the draft resolution contains no provision that might be perceived as hostile to Morocco’s position. The same source told MWN Tuesday that some countries that have voiced concerns with the wording of the resolution might abstain. Russia, among others, has expressed reservations about some wordings of the draft resolution, MWN’s source added. Russia has expressed concerns about the absence of any reference to the need for the parties to reach a “mutually acceptable political solution, which will provide for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara” in the operative paragraphs of the draft resolution. By contrast, resolution 2440, adopted on October 31, 2018, included an operative paragraph with the same language Russia advocated, while resolution 2414, adopted on April 27, 2018, mentioned that language in two operative paragraphs. Despite that language, Russia has, however, in both cases broken the traditional consensus on the resolution by abstaining from supporting the resolution. In light of its voting patterns in recent years and the concerns it expressed about the draft resolution, it is very likely that Russia will abstain once again. It might be joined by China, which also abstained in the two previous resolutions, as well as South Africa, one of Polisario’s staunchest supporters. Recently, reports from Moroccan and international news outlets claimed that the US, in its capacity as the penholder of the UN resolutions on Western Sahara, attempted  to include a human rights monitoring clause in the draft resolution on the renewal of the mandate of MINURSO. A source close to the dossier told Morocco World News that such reports were a “hoax.” “The US did not seek to include any such mechanism in the draft resolution. This was neither included in the draft circulated to the Group of Friends for Western Sahara (France, US, UK, Russia, and Spain) nor in the draft circulated to the members of the Security Council,” the source said. In his annual report on the situation of Western Sahara, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres discussed Polisario’s violations east of Morocco’s defense wall, calling on the Polisario Front to meet in Rabouni, Algeria, with MINURSO members instead of insisting on meeting in what Polisario calls the “liberated territories,” east of Morocco’s defense wall. The UN chief also warned against major risks of tensions in the region due to Polisario’s military exercises in restricted zones.

Rabat – The Qatari state-owned news agency QNA has announced that the emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, has appointed Fahd Ibrahim Al Hamad Al Mana as the new ambassador extraordinary to Morocco. Al Mana had served as the head of the Qatari mission in Argentina since 2013. He also worked at the Qatari embassy in Rabat in 1989-1992. Al Mana holds a master’s degree from the National School of Public Administration in Morocco. سمو أمير البلاد المفدى يصدر القرار الأميري رقم / 21 / لسنة 2019 بتعيين السيد فهد إبراهيم الحمد المانع، سفيراً فوق العادة مفوضاً لدى المملكة المغربية.#قنا pic.twitter.com/ipxlphfqu5 — وكالة الأنباء القطرية (@QatarNewsAgency) April 29, 2019  Al Mana served in the Ministry of Public Health from 1983 to 1987, and at the  Department of International Organizations and Conferences from 1987 to 1988. He also Served in the Qatari Directorate of Legal Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1994 to 1997. The appointment followed a meeting between Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani  and Qatari Attorney General Ali Bin Fetais Al Marri, during which both officials discussed how to forge more solid bilateral cooperation last week. Previously, Abdulla Fallah Abdulla Al Dossari, appointed in 2013, served as the Qatari ambassador in Morocco. Qatar and Morocco maintain strong diplomatic ties because the Gulf country holds special respect for the North African country, which maintained relations during Qatar’s Gulf crisis with the Saudi coalition. Qatar highly appreciated Morocco’s neutrality in the Gulf crisis when the Saudi coalition enforced a hard blockade on it in 2017.

Rabat – According to a report from the court of auditors in Morocco, released on Monday, 17 political parties are late in returning MAD 18.4 million ($1.9 million) to the national treasury, while four political parties out of 34 have not submitted their reports on the audit of their accounts. The four parties that did not submit their report are the Moroccan Liberal Party, the National Democratic Party, the Moroccan Union Party for Democracy, and the National Union of Popular Forces Party. The report, led by Driss Jettou, checked the veracity of Moroccan political parties’ expenses in 2017. The report revealed that 11 parties returned MAD 5.22 million ($541,000) to the national treasury, 6 parties have returned MAD 1.07 million ($110,000) in 2018, while 3 parties returned MAD 2.2 million ($228,000) in 2019. Although parties’ transactions that are greater than MAD 10,000 ($1,036) must be paid out by checks or a direct transfer as stipulated by Article 40 of Law 29.11, five political parties have paid their dues to the state in cash for MAD 930,000 ($96,000). In 2017, political parties received MAD 73.73 million ($7.6 million) from the government, compared to MAD 62.74 million ($6.5 million) in 2016 and MAD 61.22 million ($6.3 million) in 2015, according to the report. The report noted that the Party of Citizen Forces, the Democratic Way Party, and the Party of the Democratic Covenant did not receive public support and self-financed their electoral campaigns. The expenses of all political parties decreased to MAD 138.43 million ($14 million) in 2017, compared to MAD 417.99 million ($43 million) in 2016 and MAD 372.92 million ($39 million) in 2015.

Rabat – Brussels has the second highest percentage of foreign residents among cities worldwide after Dubai, according to a study from Brussels Jet Pack Center for Analysis. A total of 1.2 million people inhabit Brussels, and six out of 10 of those inhabitants were not born in Belgium. Of those six, two gain Belgian citizenship at some point.  Nine percent of non-Belgians in Brussels are from Morocco, making Moroccans the third most present nationality among foreigners after French people and Romanians. Africa is the most common place of origin of non-European migrants living in Brussels at 17% of migrants. Within this population, the migrants are more likely to be from North Africa than other regions on the continent.   There are 184 nationalities represented in Brussels, making it one of the most racially and ethnically diverse cities in the world.  Despite this diversity, there is still a high level of segregation. Foreigners from North Africa, Turkey, and the EU all live in different areas of the city. North Africans tend to settle in districts like Molenbeek, Anderlecht, Brussels-City, Saint-Josse, and Schaerbeek. On the other hand, non-Belgian EU citizens prefer to live in the city center or in the municipalities of Saint-Filles, Ixelles, and Etterbeek. The study emphasizes the importance of “ensuring the social inclusion of migrants” as fundamental to the social and cultural development of Brussel’s society. The author recommends that the local government take action to ensure the inclusion of migrants in housing, work, and healthcare. In particular, addressing issues of housing has the potential to reduce the segregation seen throughout the city today.

Rabat – Moroccan MP Omar Balafrej, the deputy for the opposition Federation of the Democratic Left (FGD) party has complained that the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) prevented Parliament from discussing a general amnesty bill for the Hirak activists sentenced to prison over the 2016-17 protests.  In the 87th episode of his weekly “Podcast Politique” (Political Podcast), Balafrej said the PJD “refused to open a discussion of the bill concerning the general amnesty for Hirak prisoners” that he and his FGD colleague, MP Mostafa Chennaoui, proposed on June 29, 2018, just days after the activists’ sentencing. Balafrej considers a general amnesty, under Article 71 of the Constitution, of utmost importance to the “building of new trust.” It’s the only thing, he added, which would make way for a “much-needed resolution.” The PJD, Balafrej asserted, is the only party that has “relatively greater control” on decisions in Parliament. “I’m not saying the Parliament has all the power, but it wields part of it, which it does not exercise,” Balafrej stressed. Balafrej also recalled the bill he and Chennaoui proposed on June 21, 2018, to abolish the parliamentary pension scheme. He said the head of the Commission for Economy and Finance, Abdellah Bouanou, refused to discuss it in Parliament.  He called on Moroccan citizens to join 160 artists, intellectuals, and activists who signed a petition launched on April 23 by signing another online petition asking Parliament to give amnesty to the prisoners.  The signatories disapprove of the “heavy” sentences of 1-20 years given to 54 Hirak activists in June 2018. The Casablanca Court of Appeals upheld the sentences on April 5, 2019.

Rabat – Growing up, Moroccan entrepreneur Faiza Hajji saw plastic bags everywhere. Strewn plastic covered neighborhoods of her city Berkane, in the far northeast of Morocco. She would bike through the streets as a child, she said, frustrated by the waste and wondering how to put it to good use. “And at the same time, I was really sensitive to women’s conditions. My mom was a doctor, and she was receiving a lot of patients from the villages,” Hajji told Morocco World News. “Many women didn’t have enough [to] pay for the consultation.” The price for a visit? Only $7. Her mother treated the women anyway. One day, as a gift of thanks, a woman brought Hajji’s mother a bread basket she had woven out of grass. But the handicraft glittered with something else—biscuit wrappers, Hajji realized. The woman had threaded them into the basket. “And this is how it all started,” Hajji said. In 2006, she launched a social enterprise called Ifassen (which means “hands” in Tamazight), inspired by the recycled basket she had seen in childhood. The company reuses plastic bags and other discarded materials to create accessories and home decorations. They employ Moroccan women artisans, partnering with local women’s collectives. “The idea is to preserve the local know-how, handicrafts, and create jobs for women, mainly in rural areas,” Hajji said.  In the 12 years since its start in Berkane, Ifassen has grown, now working with women’s collectives across Morocco. The company is just one project of Hajji’s nonprofit she launched in 2008, Association du Docteur Fatiha (Association of Doctor Fatiha, ADF), named for her mother.  Last week, the media group Sparknews featured Ifassen in its international Earth Day campaign, “Earth Beats,” which highlighted regional solutions to environmental problems around the world. Outlets like L’Economiste and the Nation, participating in the campaign, also highlighted Ifassen’s work. Lighting up a sustainable future As Ifassen grew, it began to push its designs beyond functionality into the artistic sphere. Hajji brought globally-known designers, artists, and architects to Morocco to work with Ifassen artisans. The collaborations produced designs that synthesized traditional Moroccan artisanship with cutting-edge design work. The Quai Branley Museum in Paris and the Copenhagen Museum in Denmark both have displayed Ifassen designs. Ifassen’s most recent design project is a collaboration with Moroccan architect Aziza Chaouni, known for her work landscaping and revitalizing the Fez river, Wed El Jawahir.  Together, Chaouni and Ifassen’s team designed an artisanal lamp, which they were invited to show at the 2019 Venice Biennale—an art extravaganza Hajji described as a “very big event in the design world.” Their design would be the first ever to represent Moroccan women at the event. The lamp’s skeleton is 3D-printed from recycled materials. Moroccan women artists then weave colorful, traditional tapestry across the body. A lantern is a fitting symbol for Ifassen’s work. The employment opportunities and support the organization brings to women in rural areas are empowering, Hajji said. An income allows women greater independence. It can let them send their children to school.  “Because when they don’t have money, that’s the first place where they cut the costs, is taking out the girls from school,” Hajji explained. Ifassen’s work changes that. Morocco: One of Africa’s greenest nations While Hajji was transforming Ifassen from a fledgling company to an established social enterprise, Morocco was looking again at its use of plastic bags.  Morocco banned all plastic bags in 2016 and has upped its enforcement of the law in recent months. The law helped reduce Morocco’s consumption of raw materials used in plastic bag manufacturing by 50% from 2015 to 2018, although plastic bags are still a common sight in the country. The ban was part of Morocco’s sustainability agenda, which has established the kingdom as a regional leader in sustainable energy with a growing sustainable development sector.  The plastic bag law, Hajji said, was “really good news.” But it was not the end of the story. “There’s still a long way to go, because the alternatives are not great,” she said. Replacements for plastic bags often are costly or pose different environmental problems. ADF has tried to address this problem by designing and distributing reusable bags made out of folded flour sacks. The initial market surveys of the product proved promising, demonstrating public interest in its use. Like Hajji’s other initiatives, the project employed local Moroccan women. It’s another example of the intersection of sustainability and female entrepreneurship that runs throughout her work. For Hajji and Ifassen, the two problems are inherently linked—as are their solutions.

Rabat – Moroccans report some of the highest rates of negative experiences worldwide, the latest Gallup Global Emotions Report has found. The survey, based on over “151,000 interviews with adults in more than 140 countries in 2018,” found that, overall, the percentage of people who rated their life experiences negatively has significantly risen. Gallup said the survey measures “life’s intangibles—feelings and emotions — that traditional economic indicators such as GDP were never intended to capture” by asking questions about emotions from the day before the survey. Forty-one percent of Moroccans admitted to having felt “angry a lot” the day before they were surveyed. With a negative experience index of 43, Morocco featured among the countries with the “highest negative experiences.” Chad (54), Niger (50), and Sierra Leone (50) topped the category. Meanwhile, Latin America featured nine of the top 10 happiest countries. Indonesia was the only non-Latin American country in the “highest positive experiences” category. Paraguay, which topped the list with a positive experience index of 85, has led the global happiness race since 2015, according to Gallup. Worldwide, 71% said they experienced a lot of enjoyment, 72% felt well-rested, 74% smiled or laughed a lot, and 87% felt treated with respect on the day before the survey. Rather than an exact assessment of how poor or rich a country is, the scores entail a “cultural bias,” Gallup noted. It said the numbers “strongly relate to people’s perceptions about their living standards, personal freedoms and the presence of social networks.” Gallup’s Jon Clifton said that the survey measures both “how people see their lives and how they live their lives.” The reactions of the Moroccans that Gallup surveyed are consistent with the latest official statistics on life satisfaction for Moroccan households. Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP), which records statistics on the country’s socio-economic performance, has reported that the large majority of Moroccans feel a deep sense of pessimism in the future. According to HCP, that grim outlook on life is a reaction to harsh financial situations, with 82% saying that they would not be able to save any money through 2019.

Rabat – From April 24 to 28, the remote town of Kelaat M’Gouna in central Morocco hosted the 57th annual Rose Festival. The event, organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, celebrates the region’s famous perfume rose industry. The annual festival draws industry professionals and tourists to the area, also called “the valley of the roses.” It includes scientific seminars and roundtables on the perfume rose industry as well as cultural and artistic activities showcasing the Amazigh (Berber) culture of the region. This year Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch opened the “House of the Rose.” This MAD 7.8 million (approximately $807,000) project includes a museum, a laboratory, an exhibition center, administrative offices, and a conference center. The roses produced in the area are used for rose water, essential oil, and dried rosebuds that are exported worldwide. According to the ministry, Morocco produces on average 3,200 tons of perfume roses per year, making it the third largest producer in the world after Bulgaria and Turkey. Rose production is included in the Morocco Green Plan, launched in 2008 to promote Morocco’s agricultural sector. Thanks to commercialization strategies, the price of roses has increased over the last 10 years from MAD 7 ($0.72) per kilogram before the Morocco Green Plan to MAD 25 ($2.59) per kilogram in 2018. Rose producers have grouped into cooperatives, reinforcing their commercial negotiation power and contributing to the price increase. Between 2008 and 2018, Morocco invested MAD 65 million (approximately $7 million) in the perfume rose industry for irrigation and commercialization. Morocco has three large rose processing centers and 18 smaller centers, including 15 distilleries. The Rose Festival also includes a “Queen of Roses” pageant. Soukaina Bamzil was crowned queen this year.

Rabat – The head of the media cooperation unit at the Council of Europe, Lejla Dervisagic, has saluted the role of Morocco’s High Authority of Audiovisual Communication (HACA) in fighting violence against women in Moroccan programs. Dervisagic said on Friday in Tunis at the 2nd World Forum on Gender Equality: “We can only be pleased with HACA’s regulatory experience.” She also spoke about the importance of sharing HACA’s experiences with global media to “provide common answers to the challenges faced by regulatory authorities at monitoring works during media coverage of violence against women.” The head of the Independent High Authority for Audiovisual Communication in Tunisia (HAICA),  Nouri Lajmi, also emphasized the importance of HACA’s expertise for years. He also thanked HACA for its support for HAICA. “Journalists should be encouraged to take self-regulatory measures concerning gender equality and the fight against violence against women and to avoid languages and images that could lead to discrimination on the basis of sex, incitement to hatred, and gender-based violence,” said Lajmi. Morocco’s delegation at the event was chaired by the head of HACA, Latifa Akharbach. King Mohammed VI appointed Akharbach in December 2018. Born in 1960, Akharbach is also a politician and a journalist. HACA is responsible for audiovisual communication and grants licenses for audiovisual services according to their compliance with the law.  HACA also ensures the quality of radio frequencies for broadcast programs.

Rabat – Thirteen people received injuries when an owner of the Youkous mineral water factory in eastern Algeria opened fire on protesters condemning lack of access to water. AFP reported that the owner had opened fire to disperse protests. Auxiliary forces took the 13 wounded people to the hospital after police intervention. AFP said that clashes escalated in the town of Hammamest after authorities gave the company the right to bottle the water from a spring in the area. Security services said that protesters set fire to tires and one water truck in front of the factory. The demonstrations against lack of drinking water come on the heel of a growing popular movement against the current government. Since February 22, Algerians have been rallying in the streets calling for a radical regime change against all loyalists to former Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Despite the resignation of several officials, Algerians are continuing their protests, calling for the resignation of all elites connected to the former regime. Algerians are also threatening to boycott the July 4 elections, believing that the current government has “frauds that cannot hold honest elections.”

Rabat – The Moroccan arm of the international NGO Oxfam has written a new report to warn of inequality in Morocco. The report is in line with a campaign under the theme “An egalitarian Morocco, a fair taxation.” In its report, Oxfam notes that the “gap between the richest and poorest continues to widen at the global level, and Morocco is not immune to this trend.” Oxfam found that it would take 154 years for a normal employee to earn what a Moroccan billionaire receives in 12 months. “In 2018, the three richest Moroccan billionaires alone have a wealth estimated at $4.5 billion,” said the report, a possible reference to Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch, BMCE Bank CEO Othman Benjelloun, and real estate magnate Anas Sefrioui. On the other hand, the report said that “1.6 million people are in poverty, and one Moroccan out of eight is in a situation of vulnerability.” An advocacy and campaign manager at Oxfam Maroc, Abdeljalil Laroussi, said that “inequalities in the kingdom are not a coincidence. They are the result of inadequate public policies and encouraged by international institutions.” Laroussi said that “since independence, Morocco has adopted growth models that are deepening inequalities and putting a large part of the population in a situation of extreme vulnerability.” Laaroussi added, “Inequalities slow down the fight against poverty, undermine growth and exacerbate social tensions.” Injustice in tax While speaking of poverty and unemployment, the report focused on disparities in tax payments because of the upcoming Assizes of Taxes May 3-4. A total of “82% of corporate tax revenues come from only 2% of companies. The amount of tax losses suffered by Morocco each year due to the tax practices of multinational [companies] is $2.45 billion.” “Tax justice is an excellent way of social cohesion. It helps to correct inequalities by redistributing wealth when it is badly distributed initially, and to raise the resources needed to finance infrastructure and public services that benefit the entire community,” said the head of the Oxfam Governance Program in Morocco, Asmae Bouslmati. Bouslmati also quoted Article 39 of the Moroccan 2011 Constitution, which she said guarantees the “equality of citizens under taxes, which must be paid according to the contributor’s capacity.” Oxfam also shared alarming statistics on unemployment, emphasizing that urban youth (15-24) unemployment is 42.8%.  Public service deficiencies referred to in the report also includes the lack of doctors in Morocco. “Morocco has only 6.2 doctors per 10,000 inhabitants, compared with 12 in Algeria and 37.1 in Tunisia.” The report also warned that nearly half of the working population (46%) do not have medical coverage and women’s pensions are 70% lower than men’s. Moroccan women spend an average of five hours a day on domestic work, compared to 43 minutes for men. The report added that only 64% of residents are connected to plumbing with drinkable water. Oxfam asked the government and institutions to adopt concrete and ambitious measures to fight inequalities and poverty. Oxfam also called for the development of an urgent national plan against inequalities and a  quantified goal for reducing inequalities by 2030. The North African country has been experiencing a number of protests, including demonstrations against social inequalities. In 2016 and 2017, a popular movement, called the Hirak, erupted in the northern Al Hoceima province, where thousands of citizens rallied calling for justice and condemning lack of hospitals, universities, and employment. The Hirak movement was followed by several other protests, including protests to condemn lack of drinking water in the south of the country. Morocco also experienced a set of protests in 2018 and 2019, particularly the protests of contractual teachers and doctors. Recently, at least 400 doctors resigned to condemn the poor working conditions at Moroccan hospitals.

Rabat – US President Donald Trump renewed his support for Saudi Arabia during a “Make America Great Again” event on Saturday, April 27. During the rally, hosted in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Trump indicated he would remain a firm supporter of the Saudi government, largely because of Riyadh’s continued purchases from US companies. Oil and weaponry constitute the cornerstone of the trade relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia. The US buys Saudi oil, and Saudi Arabia purchases American weaponry, with an additional understanding that the US would aid the kingdom in the event of a military attack. “They have nothing but cash, right?” Trump said. “They buy a lot from us, $450 billion they bought.” PolitiFact, a fact-checking website, has raised doubts about the $450 billion figure.  “You had people wanting to cut off Saudi Arabia … I don’t want to lose them,” Trump said. Later in the rally, Trump described a recent phone call with Saudi Arabia’s King Salman in which he demanded more from the oil-rich nation in exchange for the US’s continued military support. “We lose $4.5 billion on a country to defend them, and they’re rich,” Trump said. “So, I called them. I said: listen, no good. They were in a state of shock because they’ve never got a call like this in 25 years, right.” He went on: “I said we’re losing $4.5 billion every year, we can’t do this anymore. This is crazy. He [King Salman] got very upset, angry, said this is not fair. I said, of course, this is fair. He said we’ll give you $500 million more … I said I want more. We argued. So, they paid us more than $500 million for one phone call, it took me one call.” Trump said King Salman then asked him why he was calling because “nobody had made such a call.” “That’s because they were stupid,” Trump said. The existence of the phone call between Trump and the Saudi king has not been confirmed, nor have Trump’s accounts of their alleged conversation.

Rabat – The Independent Union of Moroccan Public Doctor (SIMSP) organized a protest in Rabat for Monday morning. The body called for a 48-hour strike to demand better wages and work conditions for medical professionals in the public sector. SIMSP has called for doctors, pharmacists, and dental surgeons in the public sector to gather outside the Ministry of Health and Parliament in Rabat today for a “fifth phase” of protests. Doctors in public institutions, excluding emergency services, will also be on strike for 48 hours Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. SIMSP has organized a number of protests in the last months. Following protests in December last year, the Ministry of Health agreed to address SIMSP’s requests for improved work conditions. According to SIMSP, however, nothing has changed since.  “We have not yet seen any positive response from the Ministry and the Moroccan government to our file,” said SIMSP. The organization added that the government continues “to ignore the causes of our protests, and we are therefore determined to continue our struggle.”  Doctors want an increase in wages. They want their wages to be calculated in accordance with public service Index 509, which recognizes the eight-plus years of study required to become a doctor. Doctors are currently paid under Index 336, which recognizes only five years of study. Doctors are also protesting poor work conditions and “anarchic surgery,” surgical operations that do not comply with medical standards and safety requirements due to limited resources. They want a review of equipment sterilization procedures in hospitals and emergency vehicles.  They also want an inquiry into the “collective resignations.” Doctors have been resigning en masse to protest work conditions. Last week, 120 doctors in the Beni Mellal region in central Morocco resigned due to “catastrophic and off-putting conditions that affect the public health sector.”  Two weeks ago, more than 300 doctors in the northern Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region resigned, citing “the deterioration of the health system in the Tangier region and the absence of [proper] work conditions in public hospitals.” In October 2018, more than 130 doctors left the health sector in the Casablanca-Settat region, 40 doctors resigned in the Western region, and 30 doctors resigned in Ouarzazate province. The Moroccan government is under pressure from public employees. Thousands of teachers have also been protesting this month in Rabat, demanding stable employment contracts.

Rabat – Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s socialist party scored a big victory in Sunday’s snap elections in Spain. But an equally big result for right-wing parties meant the experience was more of a setback for the country’s ruling socialist party. With slight differences here and there in scores obtained by different contenders, poll predictions that Sanchez’s Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE) would win turned out to be right. But the polls were also correct in predicting that PSOE would fall short of the majority needed to rule alone. PSOE won about 29% of the vote, translating into 123 seats in the 350-seat Spanish Parliament. The number is a big win for the socialist party, whose Parliament membership stood at 84 seats prior to Sunday’s elections. But that score is still far below the 176 needed to secure the majority. In retrospect, the snap elections have not exactly provided the answers the ruling coalition had expected. Instead, the results suggest that the country’s political fracture is far deeper than the political establishment thought. Even with a meaningful victory, there was very little to celebrate for Spain’s ruling leftist coalition. Podemos and other left-leaning formations, on whom Sanchez could count to form a more coherent government coalition, did not score enough to bar the prospect of seeking help from right-wing parties. “Efforts at coalition wrangling in the country could take longer because of the incoming local, regional and European elections on May 26, with parties unwilling to declare their hand until the end of the electoral season,” Politico observed. But the Guardian’s assessment was grimmer, stressing the growing momentum of the once-isolated far right in Spanish politics. “Sunday’s results are unequivocal proof of the advent of Vox in the era of five-party politics in Spain,” the British paper lamented. The conservative People’s Party secured 66 seats, the center-right Citizens Party won 57 seats, Podemos and allies landed 42, while Vox—perhaps the biggest winner—secured a comforting score of 24 seats. The result makes Vox the first ever far-right party to make it to Parliament in 40 years of post-Franco democratic experience. Sanchez’s PSOE landed a surprising victory in June 2018 after challenging the then-ruling People’s Party with a no-confidence vote over corruption allegations. But Sanchez was later compelled to call for Sunday’s snap elections in February after a coalition of nationalist and far-right parties opposed his 2019 budget and other legislative measures. In calling for Spaniards to go to polls for the fourth time in three years, Sanchez hoped for a conclusive victory. Speaking on Sunday moments after casting his ballot, he spoke of “calmness, serenity, and resolution” to mend a politically fragmented Spain. Evoking the in-fashion Trump and Brexit analogy, the Spanish prime minister urged voters to “look to the future” rather than backwards. A victory for his party, he predicted, would be “the difference between a Spain that looks towards the future and a Spain that slides back 40 years.” By the time results starting to sink in late Sunday, Sanchez, momentarily unconcerned by the success of right-wing parties and what the setback that could mean for his otherwise milestone victory, decided to focus on the bright side. He appeared to take pleasure and pride in his party’s leap from 84 to 123 seats. “We made it happen. We have sent out the message that we don’t regress or reverse. We want a country that looks forward and advances.” In response, Vox’s message was defiant and dismissive, calling Sanchez’s victory “ephemeral.” Vox leader Santiago Abascal called his party’s performance “a re-conquest of Spain,” a historical reference to the 15th-century defeat of the Moors and the expulsion of Spanish Jews. Founded in 2013 by frustrated members of the conservative People’s Party, Vox remained on the fringes of national politics until now. The party was ignored and deemed irrelevant in national debates until it secured a shock political breakthrough in Andalucia during the December 2018 regional elections. The party styles itself as avowedly Christian, conservative, and nationalist, scathingly criticizing Sanchez’s socialist party’s stance on Catalan separatism and migration. Banning pro-Catalan independence political parties is among the party’s priorities. Vox also denounces mutlticulturalism, feminism, and “unrestricted migration.” Like President Trump, Vox’s Abascal has maintained that his goal is to “make Spain great gain.”

Rabat – The Ministry of Culture and Communication has announced that the Sijilmassa archaeological site will soon be accessible to the public. The ministry’s culture department said in a statement that maintenance and development works are ongoing on the historic site to modernize it and expand its reception capacity.  The statement added that the site will be open to the public as soon as renovation is complete.  The ministry has allocated MAD 1 million ($104,000) for the restoration of “The House of the Researcher,” a residence for Moroccan and foreign archaeological students and researchers when visiting the site.  The ministry’s action program for the archaeological site also focuses on the study and classification of relics, the establishment of a conservation unit, and a center to preserve and enhance the site’s wealth. The ministry aims to promote the site as a tourist destination by improving its reception services. Sijilmassa, southeastern Morocco, was founded in 757 by the Zenata Amazigh tribe. It was a medieval Moroccan city that served as an important trade center in the Maghreb during the middle ages. In the year 1000, approximately 100,000 people lived in the city.  The ancient city experienced a series of invasions by several Amazigh (Berber) dynasties before it was abandoned in A.D. 1339. The preservation of Morocco’s unique cultural identity has been one of the hallmarks of King Mohammed VI’s cultural policy. The renovation initiative is part of the ministry’s strategy to preserve and enhance archaeological sites and historic monuments.

Rabat – Jeune Afrique, considered Africa’s top francophone magazine, has said that Abdellatif Hammouchi is the mastermind of Morocco’s successful anti-terrorism mechanism. Hammouhci is the head the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) and the General Directorate of Territorial Security (DGST), Morocco’s joint elite forces on anti-terrorism. The two services were merged in 2015 to modernize and improve Morocco’s responsiveness to terrorist threats. The success of the two security services, which has earned Morocco a strong reputation for anti-terrorism and stability, is at the same time winning Hammouchi nicknames in media reports. The latest accolade came from a Jeune Afrique profile article that lauded the “incomparable” success of Hammouchi’s four-year tenure as the head of Moroccan intelligence. The magazine listed Hammouhci among “Africa’s most influential personalities in 2019” in a dossier it published over the weekend. Jeune Afrique noted, referring to the list, that “these are people who are impacting public opinion, and are capable of inspiring and inciting us to imitate them.” Sliding into the nickname ritual set up by other outlets that have hailed the success of Hammouchi’s tenure at the DGSG-DGST in recent months, Jeune Afrique, described him as “the nightmare of terrorists.” Hammouchi “has been extolled by his African and European colleagues,” the newspaper wrote. “If Morocco features today at the forefront in terms of anti-terrorism, it owes it in large measure to his incomparable knowledge of the Islamist network.” But dismantling terror cells, thwarting terrorist plots, or even sharing vital intelligence with partner countries are not the only reasons the Moroccan officer made it to Jeune Afrique’s list. Being popular with everyday Moroccans also counted in the magazine’s choice. Hammouchi, according to Jeune Afrique, has succeeded in “reconciling citizens with the police.” While Jeune Afrique’s comments carry a degree of exaggeration, Hammouchi is no stranger to excessive praise from the media. Adopting a similar tone in July of 2018, an Italian daily referred to Hammouchi as the “super agent who never sleeps.” The paper said Hammouhci had “an incredible memory,” was the “most informed man in Morocco,” and was “one of the finest connoisseurs of extremist Islamism.”

Rabat – The Moroccan General Delegation of the Penitentiaries and Reinsertion Administration (DGAPR) has denied allegations of torture and human rights abuse in the case of Hirak prisoners. The prison institution said that Hirak Rif activists were not mistreated or tortured and that they are all treated in accordance with the law. DGAPR specifically torture and ill-treatment accusations from Nasser Zefzafi’s father. It said the allegations “are a despicable maneuver with suspicious goals which will not prevent the administration from continuing its approach to preserve the dignity of all prisoners, regardless of their categories, and respecting their rights in accordance with the law.” The DGAPR explained that although Nasser Zefzafi and other inmates have stopped their hunger strike, the activist’s father has been insistent on carrying out his maneuver. The suggestion, according to DGAPR, is that the objective behind the father’s actions was not to protest against detention conditions, but to serve a suspicious agenda that “tries to mislead public opinion.” The statement pointed out that “the prison administration ensures treating all detainees in accordance with the law, like other inmates, and that they have at no time been subjected to any ill-treatment by the administrations of the institutions where they were formerly or where they are now detained.” DGAPR added that it has initiated a series of measures in favor of the inmates concerned in the local prisons of Tangier 2 and Ras El Ma in Fez to improve conditions of detention. The success of those measures reportedly led many of the detainees to end their hunger strike. The prison administration stressed that four of the institutions Hirak Rif activists were transferred to following the confirmation of their sentence are recent and have been built in accordance with international standards.  The new facilities are said to be aimed at humanizing detention as well as preparing inmates for their reintegration after they have served their terms. The DGAPR concluded that such “gratuitous and irresponsible” accusations will not discourage it from pursuing its approach to preserve all detainees’ dignity, regardless of category.  The body said it will keep doing its duty in accordance with the provisions of the Moroccan law.

Rabat – Algerian police recently summoned former police chief Abdelghani Hamel. Hamel was sacked in June 2018 for alleged involvement in a cocaine trafficking scandal. AFP reported that the ex-police officer will appear with one of his sons before the investigating judge. The officer and his son are accused of  involvement in “illegal activities,” including embezzlement of land and “abuse of funcion.” 
Before the resignation of Bouteflika earlier in April, the Algerian army summoned several military officials for investigations over allegations of power abuse.  Despite Bouteflika’s resignation, protesters are still in the streets, demanding a total rupture from the Bouteflika establishment.  Friday marked the 10th week of protests that have swept Algeria. Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah announced that the election to appoint a new President will take place on July 4. But the interim government’s perceived determination to lead a successful transition has not calmed the anti-establishment fervor.  Thousands of protesters and several political activists are calling to boycott the upcoming election. “How can mafia and fraudsters hold an honest election?” asked a protester quoted by AFP on Friday. Algerian army chief of staff General Gaid Salah has repeatedly called on protesters to remain patient before the election. Salah also warned protesters against “unrealistic slogans.”

Rabat – International logistic firm Marine Maroc is installing a new Enerpac SL400 gantry to implement “high pressure heaters weighing 130 tons” at its coal-fired power plant near Safi in South West Morocco, according to Engineer Live. The facility is still under construction. “The plant will be the first coal-fired project in Africa to use ultra-supercritical technology,” Engineer Live noted. The new technology will offer 10 % higher “efficiency compared to conventional plants.” The new technology will also enable reductions of CO2 and  decrease in fuel costs. The plant has a capacity of 1,386 megawatts, and is in line  with Morocco’s strategy to fulfill growing electricity needs at “the lowest possible cost whilst respecting the environment,” added the news outlet.  The SL400 gantry has an Intelli-Lift wireless control system, which enables “unobstructed views of the load,”  Heavy Lift News reported. The industrial news outlet explained that the gantry’s system ensures “automatic synchronisation of lifting with accuracy of 24 millimeters” and “automatic synchronisation of travel with accuracy” of millimeters.  Mohammed Belaidi from the Technical Department of Maroc Marine said that the company’s experienced staff are “highly capable of handling large and heavy loads.” Belaidi added that the SL400 “is an outstanding addition to our heavy lifting capability for many power plant projects where the gantry can be readily deployed both outside and inside the plant when space is limited.”

Rabat – The Polisario Front has deployed armored vehicles and tanks to disperse Sahrawis’ protests in the Tindouf camps on Saturday. Dozens of Sahrawis have been carrying protests since April 1 against tightened restrictions and lack of freedom of movement in the camps. Former Polisario officer Mustafa Salma Sidi Mouloud shared photos on his Facebook, showing tanks deployed by the Polisario Front on Saturday to disperse a sit-in held in the self-styled  Ministry of Interior of the separatist front in Rabouni, Algeria. Commenting on Poliario’s move, Mustafa Salma said: “The  tragic ironic argument is that there was a protest against restrictions on freedom of movement… and that the demonstrations conquered the road with their truck and that the Polisaario has nothing but tanks to drag the demonstrators’ trucks and keep them off the road.”  The Sahrawi activist wrote in another Facebook post on Sunday that there has been “violent intervention in a demonstration in the camps.” Mustafa Salma said that police ran over protesters with security vehicles, causing “serious injuries.” The Tindouf camps witnessed several protests from Sahrawis, who have been condemning Polisario’s restrictions. On April 23, 60 Sahrawis living in Tindouf’’s Lahmada camp protested in Rabouni, describing Polisario’s restriction as “forced detention” and a “violation of the right of movement.” Several videos posted on YouTube show demonstrations in Rabouni and protesters  shouting slogans, such as “Freedom of movement” and “Freedom.” Polisario allegedly bars cars from leaving the camps. Exit  the camps occurs only once in 20 days.

Rabat – Contractual teachers have decided to suspend their protests and resume work on Monday, April 29. The National Coordination of “the Forcibly Contracted Teachers”  issued a statement, announcing that after several meetings held on Friday and Saturday, the  teachers have decided to go back to work on Monday. The statement stressed that the teachers’ decision  has been motivated by a desire to preserve student’s rights. Just for students The statement said that the teachers will put black badges during working days “to mourn the dignity of teachers.” The statement warned, however, that no  teacher take or sign any document or a reprehensible or disciplinary nature. The movement’s warning to  the contractual teachers is a response to the government’s repeated threats that it would fire protesting teachers.  While deciding to come back to work to preserve students’ interests, the coordination also wants to keep unity in its ranks. The goal is to ensure that no teacher is punished for having participated in the protests. Sixty-six regional representatives voted to suspend the strike, while 11 opposed it. The decision of the coordination is also meant to avoid a “blank” year. The coordination said they will ensure a “good” teaching atmosphere similar to the mood   before the beginning of the protests. The teachers have been protesting for more than five weeks of protest against poor working conditions. On April 14, Morocco’s Ministry of Education said it reached an agreement to end the crisis. However, the coordination issued a statement to argue that there had been no agreement with the ministry, emphasizing their determination to continue protesting until their the government meets their demands.. The teachers described themselves as “forcibly contractual educators.” In 2016, the Moroccan government began hiring teachers under annually renewable contacts. April 25 marked a massive overnight protest, bringing thousands of teachers in front of the parliament. Moroccan police used water cannons to disperse the demonstrations, which ended at about 4 a.m. Morocco’s Al Istiqlal (Independent) Party took an initiative to announce suggestions that would end the crisis. Al Istiqlal Party called on the teachers to go back to their work, urging the ministry of education to resume dialogue with its representatives. Contractual teachers have been rallying the streets of Moroccan cities since February 20, demanding to be hired into the public sector. Demonstrators also called for the abolishment of fixed-term contracts, demanding the end of “discrimination” between contractual teachers and public sector teachers.

Rabat – Jihadi extremist groups have existed in North Africa for decades. In 1997, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) was founded in connection with the Algerian civil war. The group is the most prominent transnational terrorist organization in North Africa and is dedicated to dismantling regional governments and implementing Sharia (Islamic law). Despite regional efforts to counter violent extremism, jihadi propaganda remains a threat to security in North Africa. In 2014, the New York Times’ Adam Nossiter questioned: “Is Al Qaeda’s regional affiliate in West Africa dead, at least for now?” Five years later, despite efforts led by North African governments, extremist propaganda continues to reach Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Egypt. As a result, North African states continue to experience terrorist attacks. In Tunis on March 7, 2019, a post office intercepted 19 letters addressed to notable journalists, politicians, and trade unionists containing potentially deadly toxins. In Egypt, Christians and members of other religious minorities continue to suffer from attacks. While ISIS has not carried out any successful terrorist attacks in Morocco, the kingdom has faced repeated threats and continues to discover and dismantle ISIS-affiliated cells.  ISIS no longer has territorial holdings in Syria and Iraq. At the same time, its influence threatens North African security. Jihadi militants relocating or returning from Syria are capable of radicalizing young people, especially those disenfranchised by economic or political situations. Morocco has struggled with the flight and return of foreign terrorist fighters. As of March 2017, Moroccan security sources estimated that 2,000 Moroccans had left to fight alongside extremist groups in Iraq and Syria. Around 200 of those extremist militants have reportedly returned to Morocco and faced arrest. Morocco launched a counter-terrorism reconciliation program in 2018 called “musalaha.” The de-radicalization program aims to rehabilitate Salafi-jihadis inside Moroccan prisons based on reconciliation with the self, with religious texts, and with society. While the program has shown some individual successes and some jihadis received pardons from the King, critics say the program does not do enough to counter greater extremism. According to Mohammed Masbah, the director of the Moroccan Institute for Policy Analysis, “Post-prison reintegration of jihadis is partly falling short because civil society is absent from efforts to prevent and counter extremism.”  While Morocco has avoided any major terrorist attacks in recent years, in “the absence of a comprehensive deradicalization program that includes civil society efforts to rehabilitate former prisoners, the country will remain vulnerable to growing radicalization among marginalized populations,” continues Masbah. On March 10, 2019, Moroccan authorities repatriated a group of eight Moroccans, allowing the extremist militants of Moroccan origin to return safely. Once in Morocco, the returnees are subject to judicial investigations for their alleged involvement in terror-related activities. Following the terrorist attack killing two Scandinavian tourists in Morocco on December 15, 2018, there has been a change in perception of Moroccan safety. The British government’s Foreign Travel Advice states, “Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Morocco. You should be vigilant at all times.”  The US State Department raised its travel warning to level two on April 2, 2019. The travel alert warned Americans to “exercise increased caution in Morocco due to terrorism. Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Morocco.” As jihadi extremist groups have all but disappeared, how will North African states counter violent extremism in a reconciliatory, effective, and productive manner?

Rabat – Police in the Moroccan coastal city of Essaouira have arrested a French national for links to an international drug trafficking network, a press release from Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) has indicated. According to the statement, the suspect was the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by French authorities since 2017 for links with drug trafficking entities. The same statement detailed that the suspect, aged 38, was illegally established in Morocco. The arrest comes as Morocco’s security services put in colossal efforts to reinforce its base of international cooperation. In addition to providing critical intelligence in a number of joint anti-terrorism operations with partner countries in the past years, Moroccan security services have been doubling their contributions in other security cooperation mechanism. Cooperation ranges from tracking individuals under international arrest warrants to the identification of networks of illegal psychotropic drugs traffickers. DGSN noted that the French suspect was apprehended while riding an undocumented motorbike. As they substantially dug into the reasons of his presence in Morocco, the police in Essaouira later discovered that the individual had links to an international drug trafficking and was subject of an international arrest warrant issued by French authoritarians. Under the Franco-Moroccan bilateral security and legal cooperation, Morocco can extradite suspects to relevant French jurisdictions. DGSN’s release concluded that the Moroccan authorities have informed their French counterparts of the arrest of the 38-year-old suspect, pending further investigations to establish the circumstances of the arrest and shed light into the person’s activities in Morocco.

Rabat – Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has said that his country’ ties with Morocco are strong and strategic, calling the North African country a “special ally” for Spain. Sanchez made his remarks in an interview in the May-June edition of Politica Exterior, leading Spanish magazine on foreign policy. In the interview, the Spanish PM stressed the strategic nature of the diplomatic ties between Madrid and Rabat. He particularly cited cooperation on “topics of shared interests” such as migration, anti-terrorism, and economic cooperation. “The economic and human dimensions of the Morocco-Spain relations” mean that, besides being “good neighbors,” the two countries “enjoy friendly and very close ties in many fields.” While pointing out in the interview that there are other countries in the Mediterranean and Maghreb that are also “geographically close to Spain,” Sanchez said Morocco deserved “a special mention” for the strength and “strategic significance” of its partnership with Spain. “Morocco is an essential partner for Spain and for my government.” In news reports, agreements on external borders security and intelligence sharing are usually the most recurring talking points of  the Madrid-Rabat cooperation. According to Sanchez, however, the success of the countries’ cooperation lies in a balanced blending of many other aspects. In addition to security and economy, the two allies put an equal emphasis on the human side of their cooperation. “Progress and prosperity in Morocco are determining for stability in the Mediterranean and in Spain,” he said. The point was a reference to the human factor of the emerging Euro-African agenda on migration that stresses the need to invest in socio-economic prosperity in origin and transit countries to curb the irregular migratory flow to Europe. The EU recently promised Morocco €140 million to assist the country’s efforts on migration. But statements from Moroccan officials have indicated that months since Brussels pledged the new package, nothing has yet bet delivered. Sanchez said Spain will throw its weight behind Morocco to ensure that the country gets the entirety of the funds and logistic support Europe promised, noting that Morocco’s “important efforts on migration need to be supported.”

Rabat – The latest news on the MINURSO mandate discussions at the UN are mere speculations set to change when the Security Council votes on the final draft of its Western Sahara resolution at the end of the month, MWN has learned from a source briefed on the ongoing talks. There were reports earlier this week that Morocco thwarted a US move to include a human rights monitoring clause in the draft resolution on the renewal of the mandate of MINURSO, the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara. According to the media, the US, in its capacity as the penholder of the first draft, sought to emphasize its “No more business as usual” policy by exerting pressure on conflicting parties. The move was allegedly initiated by John Bolton, the US national security advisor. Bolton, who in December 2018 took a swipe at MINURSO for being ineffective and costly, is known for his desire to give a new direction to the US’ Western Sahara policy. According to MWN’s source, however, the latest news is speculation solely based on Bolton’s past moves. “The US did not seek to include any such mechanism in the draft resolution. This was neither included in the draft circulated to the Group of Friends for Western Sahara (France, US, UK, Russia, and Spain) nor in the draft circulated to the members of the Security Council,” the source said. The source pointed out that much of the other news about MINURSO that has circulated in the media in the last days are only “sticking points” supported by Germany, Russia, and South Africa. Until April 29, when the Security Council will adopt the final draft of the resolution, the existing sticking points are still subject to minor amendments or even substantive changes in some rare cases. What is certain, though, the source elaborated, is that “contrary to news reports, none of the sticking points are against Morocco.” Post-Bouteflika Algeria continues to experience waves of anti-establishment protests. The resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the primary goal of the protests since Algerians opposed the prospect of his taking a fifth term, has turned out to be the tip of an iceberg of demands. Weeks after Bouteflika stepped down, Algerians are still on the streets. They are asking for a radical overhaul of the country’s political leadership and have made it clear they will continue protesting until they get the country rid of the restricted club that “confiscated” politics under Bouteflika. According to MWN’s source, Algeria’s domestic tumult has meant that Algiers, the Polisario Front’s fiercest supporter and the usual counterweight to Morocco’s Western Sahara efforts, “has not fought as hard for the resolution as in previous years.” Instead of lobbying for a resolution that could have made the first draft’s “sticking points” relatively hostile to Morocco’s position, Algeria’s focus has been on “weathering the storm it is facing at home.” One point journalists got right in the past weeks is the continued disagreement between Washington and Paris over the duration of the peacekeeping mission, the source conceded. The issue continues a trend which the US only initiated last year when it shocked the Western Sahara Friends committee with a proposal to extend MINURSO’s mandate for six months instead of the usual one year. Washington maintains that more pressure is necessary to keep all parties coming to the same table to broker a settlement as quickly as possible.
France’s position is that the US’s policy has already achieved its goal. All the four parties (Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Polisario) positively responded to UN special envoy Horst Kohler’s call to attend two Geneva roundtable meetings. The four parties have also expressed readiness to join a third roundtable. Now that all parties have come to the table, France argues it is better to go back to the usual one-year mandate. The US-France difference on mandate duration was, however, peripheral to the the Security Council consensus on the fundamentals, according to the source. Throughout discussions, members states stressed that more steps should be taken towards the “actual political process.” The point is not to rely too heavily on reports and draft resolutions as was the case in the past decade, according to MWN’s source. Rather than completely downplaying the role of the drafts and resolutions, however, the goal is to counter the sense of deja-vu and stasis that critics of the UN-led process have been raising. The Kohler-moderated process will not make the resolutions irrelevant. Rather, it would seek to reduce the usual hype about reports and draft resolutions to invest more into the confidence building required for the political process. “Since the past 10 years, the focus of all the parties was to get the most out of the April cycle or cut the losses and no energy was invested in the actual political process. Now the focus will be on the actual political process initiated in Geneva and less momentum will be given to the UNSG report.”

Rabat – The Spanish political party Podemos has called on authorities in Spain to take the “necessary procedures” to stop the repatriation of 23 unaccompanied minors to Morocco, El Pais reported. The political party submitted a letter to the ombudsman, who must appear “in the Office of Children Prosecutor and the Central Alien Police Station” to check details of the procedure and to ensure the minors’ rights are respected. The Save the Children NGO also sent a letter to the Ministry of the Interior, the government, and the ombudsman, condemning the planned repatriation. The letter, according to the Spanish news outlet, asked that the deportation be abolished unless the children’s rights to security and welfare is guaranteed in Morocco. Earlier this week, the Spanish and Moroccan government agreed on the initial phase of a program to repatriate unaccompanied Moroccan minors. El Pais reported that the Child Prosecution Office in Madrid summoned 23 minors for a Moroccan delegation to interview. In addition to Save the Children and Podemos, several other associations and NGOs condemned the new joint repatriation measure. The Spanish Network of Immigration and Refugee Aid tweeted a call that “the process of deportation be stopped immediately.” The network described the move as “unfair and illegal.” The measure is in line with an agreement Morocco and Spain signed in March 2013 to improve border surveillance and readmission of undocumented migrants. Podemos is also known for opposing Morocco’s territorial integrity by supporting the separatist claims of the Polisario Front over Western Sahara.

Rabat – The Ministry of Agriculture has announced that Morocco will harvest 61 million quintals of the three main cereals, wheat, barley, and durum, for the 2018-2019 season. The forecast represents a decrease of 19% compared to the average production of 75 quintals. The final harvest forecast will depend on the weather and climate conditions. The ministry said that the 2018-2019 agricultural year recorded rainfall of 290.5 millimeters by April 24, 2019, 11% lower than the 30-year average of 326.3 millimeters and down 23% from the previous season.  This year’s irregular rainfall, the ministry acknowledged, led to lower harvest totals. For this season, farmers planted cereals on 4.7 million hectares, of which 3.5 million hectares are average to good land. Sixty-five percent of the cereal harvest will come from three regions: Fez-Meknes, Rabat-Sale-Kenitra, and Casablanca. On Monday, April 22, Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch said that the “agricultural production season will be average only for the three types of cereals.”

Rabat – Sixteen irregular migrants died on Saturday, April 27, in an accident between Saidia and Nador, two cities on the Mediterranean Sea, reports Maghreb Arab Press. The accident left 17 others wounded with varying degrees of injury after a medium-sized vehicle fell while they were driving through an irrigation canal on the side road between Saidia and Nador. A source from the Ministry of Health said as many as 18 died and 22 were wounded. Local authorities rushed the victims to the Berkane regional hospital in northeastern Morocco and opened an investigation, under the supervision of the general attorney, into the accident and those responsible for the irregular migration attempt.  Police are looking for the driver of the vehicle, who is on the run.

Rabat – The grand mufti of Libya, Sadiq Al-Ghariani, has called on Muslims planning to perform a second hajj or umrah pilgrimage to Mecca to abstain, in a broadcast on the Libyan television channel Ean Libya. Those performing the hajj annual pilgrimage or the umrah, a lesser pilgrimage performed at any time of the year, for a second time “will commit an act of sin rather than a good deed.” The reason for the fatwa (Islamic legal opinions), the mufti says, is that the money pilgrims must pay to Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage “help Saudi Arabian rulers to carry out crimes against our fellow Muslims.” The money, he added, will contribute to the massacre of Muslims in Yemen, Libya, Sudan, Tunisia, and Algeria.  “Nowhere in the world,” said the mufti in a video, “hasn’t been thrown into havoc by Saudi Arabia.”  The grand mufti said he assumed full responsibility before God for issuing the fatwa.

Rabat – Predator Oil &amp; Gas have announced that four wells in its Guercif permit in northeastern Morocco have “enormous potential of natural gas.” The company owns a 75% stake in the exploration area, while the Moroccan National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mining (ONHYM) owns 25%. The company’s finding on the Guercif permit shows “recoverable prospective resources of 474 billion cubic feet for the Moulouya and Tagi prospects, targeting the Miocene and Triassic,” according to Morning Star. Miocene and Triassic are two gases discovered in the area. The net value of the Miocene gas and Triassic gas is $642 million and $207.7 million, respectively. Paul Griffiths, CEO of Predator described the finding as a “very positive step for Guercif.” Predator also hired an outside company, SLR, to provide a report on the wells’ potential. Griffiths said the “this third party prospective resources audit by SLR validates the significant volumetric and recoverable gas resources potential whilst importantly indicating too there is no significant impediment to monetising discovered gas.” He added that the finding also “references additional hydrocarbon potential over the entire Guercif area demonstrated by multiple prospective leads in diverse geological settings in the Miocene, Jurassic and Triassic.” The British news outlet added that the high forecast is estimated at 943 billion cubic feet of gas. The positive finding represents an “important tool and catalyst for attracting potential drilling partners necessary to advance rapidly a multi-well drilling programme to fully evaluate the large inventory of prospective leads developed in Guercif,” said Griffiths. The Moroccan government approved Predator Oil’s license for gas exploration in December 2018. The government granted an eight-year license, which started with an initial 30 months of exploration across 7,269 square kilometers “to the east of producing gas fields and northwest of Sound Energy PLC’s Tendrara gas project,” Proactive Investors wrote back in December.

Rabat – A recent report published by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) shows that Morocco, among other African countries like Ghana and Tunisia, will be the real losers in a no-deal Brexit scenario. With an extension until October 31, 2019, British Prime Minister Theresa May has six more months to successfully pass her Brexit Bill through the British Parliament or again face the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. However, the report by UNCTAD shows that Morocco also needs to ensure it has a bilateral agreement with the UK if Morocco is to avoid big export losses. At present, due to the European Union’s unilateral preferential schemes, Morocco enjoys favorable market access across the UK. In order to keep this, the two countries must reach an agreement before Brexit. With the future of the Brexit deal as unsure as it was 12 months ago, there is a chance the UK will crash out of the EU without bilateral deals, and smaller economies like Morocco’s will be the biggest losers. Should the UK leave the EU without a deal, imports to the UK could end up being on “most favored nation” terms, a World Trade Organization trading principle that means the same tariffs must be applied to all partners unless there is an exception written in an agreement. The British government has been working on rolling over all trade deals they currently have, through the EU, with other countries. This applies to economies of all ranges, from the large economies of Canada and Japan to the smaller economics of the Faroe Islands and small African states. As of last month, the UK has completed and signed 26 continuity agreements with countries such as Chile, Switzerland, and Israel. The process has faltered with Morocco, however, with the report by UNCTAD stressing that if countries like Morocco want to keep the market access they have now, they must act quickly. According to Pamela Coke-Hamilton, the director of the division on international trade and commodities at UNCTAD, “In many cases United Kingdom-third countries agreements, or continuity agreements, have not been signed, and there is substantial uncertainty as to whether many of these agreements will be concluded any time soon.” At the moment, UK and Moroccan businesses can trade with each other at low tariffs, but if the agreement is not rolled over in time, they will be forced to trade at significantly higher tariffs set by the WTO, meaning a dramatic increases in costs for businesses in both countries. According to UNCTAD, the total export losses estimated from 20 African countries may be as much as $420 million. As trade agreements are not easy to replicate and negotiations between countries take significant time, Morocco must move quickly to avoid losing a trading partner and a significant blow to its economy.

Rabat – The speaker of the Moroccan House of Representatives, Habib El Malki, has said that Morocco’s commitment to the cause of the African continent has been an essential factor of Rabat’s diplomacy and its latest public relations efforts. El Malki, who was hosting an African Union delegation at his office in Rabat on Thursday this week, took the opportunity to stress Morocco’s profound interest in the wellbeing of the continent, its peoples, and economies. In January 2017, Morocco made a dramatic return to the African Union, a continental club whose predecessor’s—the Organization of the African Unity—doors Rabat had slammed in 1984 over internal disagreements with the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), the Polisario Front-proclaimed state in Western Sahara. Many governments on the continent, including Morocco’s strongest allies in Francophone Africa, took issue with Rabat’s abrupt exit from an organization whose founding and functioning it had significantly contributed to. Even as Rabat maintained formal—and sometimes very close—diplomatic relations with most of the continent, its absence from the most important continental club had a considerable bearing on its interests in the African continent. In three decades of institutional absence from Africa, Rabat’s “policy of the empty chair” meant for many that Rabat had little interest in the continent. Instead, critics argued, Rabat identified politically more with Europe and culturally with the Arab world. In off-the-records discussions in African circles, Morocco’s 1987 application to join the European Communities, the precursor of the EU, still carries a significant weight. Some still use that event to shun increasing discourse of Morocco’s “genuine Africanness.” When Morocco started turning its gaze towards Africa in the first years of King Mohammed VI’s reign, there were suggestions that Morocco’s “Africa turn” was insincere and only for convenience. As far as critics were concerned, the decision to turn back to Africa was a result of the EU’s refusal to embrace Moroccan membership rather than a genuine Moroccan desire to actually “return home.” Morocco’s “historic homecoming,” as recounted in the Moroccan press, was dismissed in some circles as economically and politically motivated. Morocco’s Africanness was set to only last as long as its economic interests rest with the continent. El Malki disagrees with that reading of Morocco’s “African commitment.” In his reckoning, while it is true that Morocco has “realized that its future belongs in Africa”—a point King Mohammed VI also evoked in his speech at the AU when the body agreed to take Morocco in—El Malki argued that Rabat’s recent actions on the continent point towards responsibility instead of convenience. An alternate reading of Morocco’s increasing shift towards Africa is that the North African country wants to reconcile itself with the “historic role” it played in African affairs between the late 1950s and early 1980s, the first episodes of post-colonial Africa. Having realized that its future belongs in Africa, El Malki suggested, Morocco now wants to go beyond that realization phase. The country now wants to ensure that it shoulders its role and responsibility for the realization of that future, which is a “collective African future.” According to the Moroccan parliamentarian, the responsibility phase of Morocco’s AU membership has already started. He said, “Morocco’s African vocation and the promotion of the South-South agenda constitute the most strategic choices for Morocco.” El Malki’s reference to Morocco’s emphatic insistence on the necessity of a South-South agenda, which King Mohammed VI has maintained should include heightened intra-African exchanges, has been hailed by a number of Africa observers. In an opinion piece for Britain’s the Financial Times, Jon Marks touted Morocco as an invaluable player in the new configuration of African geopolitics. Armed with powerful financial and banking institutions investing all over the place in sub-Saharan Africa, a national company—OCP—that is a global leader in the agricultural sector, telecommunication companies considering expansion to the rest of Africa, as well as an effective scholarships-based soft power, Marks argued, Morocco is setting up a new plot for post-colonial Africa. “While Morocco’s new African strategy has been most evident in commercial deals, it also points towards the emergence of a genuinely post-colonial African order,” Marks concluded. An Africa-centered Morocco was King Mohammed VI’s idea in his early years in power. Two decades after he came to power, the idea appears to have become the lifeblood of Morocco’s diplomatic identity. Most conferences and cultural activities organized in Morocco in recent months have had one thing in common: An almost aggressive focus on Africa. Panels at the latest events of conferences like the Casablanca Insurance Meeting, MEDays, or Africities put the future of Africa or “African modernity” at the heart of discussions. Cooperating with the rest of Africa, a high-ranking Moroccan official said at the Casablanca Insurance gathering on April 3, is a priority instead of a simple desire. While there is little question—at least judging from existing data—that Morocco’s Africa turn is genuine, it will take some time for Moroccan diplomats to garner the support of some African countries. Morocco’s ECOWAS bid is still facing subtle but significant blockades. Many member countries of the West African club fluctuate between pro-Rabat pronouncements at public events and unarticulated reservations about how local populations would feel about Morocco joining the ECOWAS family. The idea is that Morocco should take nothing for granted so it can continue working with the diplomatic determination it has shown in recent years to garner more continental and regional support. The question, however, is whether Morocco will not lose its nerve as it waits. For Moroccan journalist Noureddine Jouhari, Rabat is not diplomatically naive enough to think that three decades of absence can be undone in five years, or less. “The fight for Africa is just getting started,” Noureddine fittingly titled one of his columns for Maroc Hebdo. Brahim Fassi Fihri, one of the fiercest advocates of Morocco’s Africanness and founder of the leading Moroccan think tank Amadeus Institute, said something similar at a panel on the potential advantages and disadvantages of Morocco’s dream to join the West African club. “Morocco is not in a rush…. Morocco knows the value of consultation and negotiations. We are not rushing at all,” Fihri said.

Rabat – Morocco has extradited a Russian ISIS suspect arrested in 2018 to Russia, said the Center for Public Relations of the Russian Federal Service Security (FSB). Russian media reported that the Office of the Prosecutor General in Russia announced the extradition of a member of an armed group from Morocco. Moroccan and Russian news outlets quoted FSB saying, “The law enforcement agencies of the kingdom of Morocco arrested a Russian citizen, Salamov Ramazan Magomednuriyevich, born in 1970, who was wanted for his involvement in the activities of international terrorist organizations.” FSB said that Salamov tried to settle in Casablanca in 2018 after ISIS lost significant portions of territory in Syria in 2016. The suspect also promoted religious extremist ideology among residents of Dagestan, a Russian province on the Caspian Sea. Moroccan police arrested the suspect in July 2018 at the Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca. The suspect has been the subject of an international warrant for alleged terrorism and extremism issued by Interpol at the request of the Russian authorities

Rabat – A total of 123 doctors in Morocco under the umbrella of the Independent Syndicate of Public Sector Doctors (SIMSP) resigned Friday, April 26.  Submitted to the regional director of the Ministry of Health’s department in Beni Mellal, central Morocco, the resignation lists 123 doctors who chose to walk out in disapproval of the “catastrophic and off-putting conditions that affect the public health sector.” The conditions, the letter read, do not meet appropriate scientific requirements. The doctors also cited their “conviction that this sorry condition does not help us to fully carry out our duties.” They added that the services do not live up to the expectations of Moroccan citizens and that they can no longer be blamed for the “failure” of those in charge to guarantee citizens’ rights to healthcare under the Constitution. The collective action followed the resignation of over 300 public sector doctors in the region of Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima last week, 50 in the oriental region, and 30 others in the city of Ouarzazate.  El Mountadar Alaoui, the secretary general for the SIMSP, promised that more doctors are set on handing in their notice “if the government does not respond to our demands, namely improving the working conditions in hospitals and providing the necessary equipment and an adequate number of personnel.” Doctors are planning to protest and strike from staffing hospitals on April 29 and 30, with the exception of intensive care and emergency units.

Rabat – A Royal Armed Forces (FAR) helicopter crashed on Friday in the Tichla region in southern Morocco, killing two crew members. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) quoted sources from the military who said that the pilot and a non-commissioned engineer officer were killed in the helicopter crash. Other members of the crew also sustained minor injuries. An investigation is underway to determine the circumstances of the crash. The incident comes several months after the crash of a Royal Air Force Mirage F1 fighter plane in the Taounate region of northern Morocco in January. The pilot of the fighter plane managed to eject from the helicopter without sustaining injuries. The crash occurred in an uninhabited area and did not cause any collateral damage in the area. In 2015, a Royal Air Force Mirage F1 airplane also crashed near the Sidi Slimane Air Base, northeast of Rabat.  The airplane crashed after hitting a “flock of large birds,” but the pilot managed to eject safely. FAR reported that there were no casualties from the crash, which occurred in an uninhabited area.

Rabat – A social media movement has invited Moroccan women to upload photos of them wearing traditional clothes like the “hayek” in their daily lives. The “hayek” is a large rectangular fabric that women wrap around their body and over their head. Worn across North Africa, in Morocco it is often associated with the small coastal town of Essaouira, where traditionally women would wrap themselves in the long white fabric as a common daily outfit. In recent times, the hayek is a rare sight, replaced by Western or Middle Eastern clothing or the popular Moroccan djellaba. The movement “#Moroccan_Hayek” prompts people to think about tradition in the modern world. Some photos on Instagram show a woman in a hayek, wearing sneakers and carrying a McDonalds bag. In another photo, a women wrapped in the white cloth takes a selfie. Some of the photos have sparked debate. Tafanoun, a media company which makes videos to share “human positivity,” removed their hayek photos after they caused “noise.” While the photos are no longer available online, it appears they were removed for being risque. Over a hundred people commented on the removal, expressing confusion and anger. “The photos were beautiful and in no way pornographic,” said one user. “It’s Moroccan culture and it belongs to no-one who can judge you and take it away from you. Support your artwork and don’t let taboos and hatred take over,” another said. Women’s clothing regularly prompts debates on rights and freedoms. In 2015, two Moroccan women were arrested in Inezgane in the south of Morocco after market-goers found their skirts inappropriate. Their trial and acquittal made headlines.

Rabat – Morocco’s human rights minister Mustapha Ramid has spoken to Maati Monjib, a Moroccan historian who decided to go on a hunger strike for 48 hours on Monday, April 22, when his university threatened to fire him.  On his Facebook account, Monjib thanked all “activists and citizens who stood by me in this new ordeal, accompanied by the same slander I suffer from for years with yellow journalism.”  Officially declaring that he was ending the hunger strike, Monjib added that he received a call from Ramid “reassuring me.” Monjib relayed Ramid’s message that he contacted “the ministry in charge of my case to ensure there’s no prejudice against me.” Monjib wrote a post on Facebook declaring his hunger strike in protest of allegations from the Institute of African Studies, where he teaches. The institute accused Monjib of absenteeism and threatened to fire him if he did not return to work within seven days.  Monjib, however, denied their claim saying some of his colleagues at the same institute signed testimonials as witnesses of his attendance.  Monjib, who taught investigative journalism and worked with the Moroccan Association for Investigative Journalism, noted the results of the 2019 report by Reporters without Borders (RSF), which described Morocco’s climate of journalism as “very difficult,” placing it 135th out of 180 countries. Monjib claimed the situation of journalists in Morocco has grown worse since the arrest of the co-founder of the Moroccan news outlet Lakome, Ali Anouzla. Criticizing Morocco’s human rights situation, Monjib was brought to court in 2017 on charges of “threatening state security” and “receiving foreign funds,” which generated wider criticism from human rights organizations like RSF.

Rabat – A belly dancer named Simona Guzman, whom some claim is Israeli, is organizing, for the second time in Morocco, her annual international belly dance festival “Mediterranean Delight Festival” in Marrakech June 3-10.  The news stirred outrage among social media users, especially because the event coincides with the ten last nights of Ramadan, which Muslims hold especially sacred and dedicate to all-night vigils. In 2011, Guzman hosted her festival in the ochre city of Marrakech, but the Moroccan government banned the festival the next year after several organizations objected to it. Commenting on the ban, Guzman described the government as a “hypocrite” and “coward.” In a Facebook post, she reportedly blamed the cancellation of her festival on “fanatic Moroccan Islamist movements.” Guzman instead chose Greece as her alternative destination and claimed to have received threats on social media before she decided to leave Morocco “for her and the participants’ safety.” Guzman has denied she’s Israeli, saying “I am a Turkish citizen.” But several organizations in Marrakech argue otherwise and have denounced what they perceive as a “normalization” of ties with Israel. They are planning to protest in front of the hotel hosting the festival. In a statement, the Moroccan Observatory Against Normalization also expressed its objection to the event, describing it as a “flagrant crime against Morocco’s sovereignty and the sentiments of Moroccan citizens.”  The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement in Morocco expressed delight at the cancellation of the 2012 event after they contacted former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane, urging him to take action against “whitewashing Israeli crimes.”

Rabat – A lawyer for the Hirak Rif activists, Mohamed Aghnaj, has said that people in authority continue to violate human rights in Morocco, although the Ministry of Human Rights and the National Council of Human Rights (CNDH) denies it. Aghnaj made the statements in a press conference organized by the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH) on Wednesday under the theme, “Public Rights and Freedoms Between National Laws and International Legislations.” He added that the state denies the existence of torture and fails to hold perpetrators of torture and other human rights violations accountable. Aghnaj asserted that, although 22 of the Hirak Rif activists have stated that they experienced several forms of torture, the government has not opened an investigation into the subject despite the international agreements against torture Morocco has ratified. Although a CNDH report found that 15 Hirak activists were tortured, the lawyer said, the judicial system never considered or examined their cases. He also pointed out that a leaked video showing a naked Nasser Zefzafi, a leader of the Hirak Rif movement, has not been investigated. The Hirak Rif movement was a series of protests that broke out in October 2016 after the death of Mohcine Fikri, a Moroccan fish vendor from Al Hoceima in the north, who climbed into the back of a rubbish truck to retrieve his allegedly illegal merchandise. He was crushed to death as the rubbish crusher mechanism was activated. Aghnaj stressed that torture actors enjoy impunity and that the state started prosecuting victims of torture, witnesses, and torture informants. The lawyer revealed that in the past two decades approximately 20 people were accidentally killed as a result of excessive use of force, during the arrest and detention, with no serious investigation has been launched which means that torture is methodical and not behavioral as declared by state institutions.

Rabat – Protesters are again rallying in Algeria determined that all elites from the Bouteflika regime should leave before the coming election. April 26 marks the 10th week of protests that have swept Algeria and called for a radical change in government and the resignation of all officials from the era of former Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The same slogans which resulted in the fall of Bouteflika and some of his loyalists early in April have continued to echo throughout the months of demonstrations. The slogans include, “They all should leave,” “Leave means leave,” and “System get lost.” Quoted by AFP, a protester in the street addressed the government, saying that Algerians “want the system to leave, and all the thieves should be held accountable.” The protesters are also refusing the July 4 election that Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah, a loyalist to Bouteflika, announced. “We refuse this July 4 election,” said a protester called Mohamed. “How can mafia and fraudsters hold honest elections?” said Algerian protester Samir. The protests resulted in the firing and resignation of several elites. The protests have even put pressure on the Algerian army, whose chief Gaid Salah called on protesters to remain patient before the election. Salah also warned protesters against “unrealistic slogans.” Riot police have fired tear gas and used water cannons several times to disperse protesters. However, the Algerians have continued to protest Algeria’s governing system.

Rabat – A restaurant in the French town of Etretat, Normandy, refused a Muslim family a table on the grounds that the mother of the family was wearing a veil and of the Muslim faith, reports the regional newspaper Paris-Normandy. The father of the family, Mohsen Zemni, told the news organization that a waiter denied their entrance to the terrace of the restaurant La Belle Epoque, who instead proposed they sit at the bottom of the establishment. “I asked him if it was the veil of my wife that was problematic,” Zemni told 76actu news site. “He just reiterated that for us it was at the back of the room.” According to Zemni, other guests were sitting on the terrace at the time of his family’s denial and the refusal was based on Islamophobia.  In response, the day after the incident, Zemni filed a complaint online and wrote the mayor of Etretat, Catherine Millet. “I will inquire with the institution because I have only one version of the facts. But if its the truth, it’s intolerable,” Millet said. “Of course, I will answer Mr. Zemni and I will try to reach the restaurant, but so far the communication is very difficult. We have only trade through registered letters.” According to Millet, La Belle Epoque is currently in a dispute with the municipality for illegally constructing a covered terrace in an already narrow street. The restaurant did not immediately respond to Morocco World News’ request for comment.

Rabat – The Moroccan Minister of Culture and Communication has set in motion new measures for the social protection of artists. The Minister Mohamed Laaraj met yesterday with the Moroccan Union of Dramatic Arts Professionals (SMPAD) to discuss new measures of social security for Moroccan artists. According to Laaraj, a key step is to start implementing the law on the status and social protection of artists. In 2016, Morocco introduced a new law to ensure artists benefit from the work and social security rights under Moroccan labor law. The law allows artists (including sound and light technicians and artistic directors) to access social security, and aims to reduce the financial instability of those working in the arts. Laaraj stated that his ministry is working with the Tourism Ministry, the National Office of Railways (ONCF), and the National Office of Airport (ONDA) to ensure professional artists benefit from a broad range of social services. The President of SMPAD Messaoud Bouhcine expressed gratitude for the efforts of the ministry. This week, from April 24 to 26, SMPAD is teaming up with the ministry and the International Federation of Actors (FIA) to host an international conference in Rabat.  The event is set to brainstorm amongst other things the implementation of the new measures. SMPAD intends to submit a number of recommendations to the ministry.

Rabat – The Moroccan General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR) has said that the Hirak Rif activists who have been on a hunger strike in the Tangier 2 prison and Ras El Ma prison in Fez have submitted notices to announce the end of their strike. The Hirak Rif activists have been on a hunger strike to denounce the Casablanca Court of Appeals’ ruling on April 5 that upheld their prison sentences. In June 2018, dozens of activists received sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years in prison. The court sentenced four activists, including the prominent leader of the Hirak Rif movement, Nasser Zefzafi, to 20 years. In the weeks since, hundreds of Moroccans, politicians, and artists have joined campaigns and signed petitions asking the government to release the activists. Activists also raised concerns on the state of health of one of the Hirak Rif prisoners, Rabii El Ablaq, whose health deteriorated due to a hunger strike he has been on for more than two weeks. DGAPR said, in its statement published by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), that it has adopted measures to improve conditions of detention in coordination with the National Council of Human Rights (CNDH). On Sunday, April 21, rain did not stop people from rallying in the streets of Rabat to demand the release of the Hirak Rif activists. Hundreds of people participated in the protests, chanting slogans such as “No liberty, no peace” and “Stand with Hirak Rif” in front of the Parliament in Rabat.  Police arrested hundreds of Hirak protesters in the summer of 2017. The movement, known as the Hirak Rif, began in October 2016 when a local fishmonger in the northern city of Al Hoceima was crushed to death in a garbage truck while retrieving confiscated fish. The region protested marginalization for months until the government crackdown.

Rabat – With the end of joint exercise “Saghro” on Thursday, April 25, the Royal Armed Forces (FAR) finished the series of joint and combined exercises programmed for the year 2019. The exercise aimed to test the FAR’s readiness in terms of interoperability, as well as their military prowess in terrestrial and air combats. According to Far-Maroc, the exercise is the culmination of a rich cycle of combined military exercises.

This year’s interallied exercises with a number of partner countries made it possible to coordinate the efforts of the various armies in the field of interoperability in order to conduct combined military maneuvers. The Saghro exercise follows a series of military exercises the FAR carried out in 2019 with other friendly countries. Between March 16 and April 7, the FAR took part a combined Moroccan-American exercise,  “African Lion,” which is considered among the most important interallied exercises in the world. “African Lion” is set to enhance the interoperability of the air-land command systems used by both nations and to train the air and land components on various missions.   From March 29 to April 6, the Royal Moroccan Navy started the Phoenix Express 2019, Euro-Mediterranean naval maneuvers with the US Navy. The exercise is designed to improve regional cooperation by increasing operational capabilities and enhancing efforts to achieve safety and security in the Mediterranean sea.  This year was the first time that Algeria did not join the Phoenix Express that Morocco organized for the second time. Participants included Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Libya, Malta, Mauritania, the Netherlands, Spain, Tunisia, the United Kingdom, and the US.

The 2020 edition of the Saghro joint exercise will take place in the eastern operational sector of Morocco, Far-Maroc noted.

Rabat – A notary in Casablanca has been accused of treason and indicted by the King’s Attorney General for diverting more than 50 million dirhams ($5 million) from his clients.  The notary, licensed by the government to perform acts in legal affairs, allegedly embezzled the money from nearly 400 clients. The suspect is also accused of misspending the deposits of five real estate developers by manipulating several bank guarantees. The notary is also being investigated for cashing a MAD 14 million check from a real estate developer.  After the King’s Attorney General Ali bin Fetais al-Marri opened an investigation into the matter, the notary was apprehended and spent 48 hours in custody at the head office of the Wilaya of Casablanca. The individual, whose name has not yet been made public, has had several complaints filed against them regarding embezzlement by Mohamed Bourdika, the former president of Moroccan football club Raja of Casablanca. The notary represented a property development company Bourdrika was working with.  As the notary, the suspect was responsible for paying money to an undisclosed real estate development company on Bourdrika’s behalf. But it was later discovered that those transactions between the notary and the company never occurred. Bourdrika did not immediately respond to Morocco World News’ request for comments.

Rabat – Spanish police have arrested another terrorist suspect on account of his alleged relation with a terrorist stopped last week in a joint Moroccan-Spanish counterterrorism operation.  Spanish news outlet El Pais said that police are investigating whether the new suspect has contacted other terror suspects or acted as a “lone wolf,” a term security specialists use for terrorists with no links to established terror cells or organizations. El Pais added that the police released the young suspect on parole. Last week, the Spanish Ministry of the Interior announced that the national police and the Spanish and Moroccan intelligence services “carried out an anti-terrorist operation, which resulted in the arrest in Morocco of an alleged jihadist who planned to carry out an attack in Seville.” Euro News reported that the first suspect was planning to carry out an attack during Easter celebrations in Seville. Spain is one of the countries that share strong security cooperation with Morocco. The Spanish government has long lauded its partnership with Morocco, especially on matters of anti-terrorism and de-radicalization.  Following last week’ joint operation, Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell said that the counterterrorism cooperation with Morocco was “ an example to follow for other countries.” Morocco’s foreign minister Nasser Bourita echoed his Spanish counterpart’s sentiment, acknowledging that the security cooperation between Morocco and Spain is “exemplary.”

Rabat – The Moroccan government, three trade unions and the General Confederation of Enterprises of Morocco (CGEM) have signed an agreement to increase wages and social benefits in Morocco. The agreement was signed on Thursday and will be effective from 2019 to 2021. The agreement affects minimum wages, social protection payments, and trade union freedoms, said Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani in his address to the signatories on Thursday evening. The agreement will increase the wages of around 800 thousand state body and public administration employees. Depending on the employee’s position, wages will increase by up to MAD 400 or 500 ($42 or $52) per month, starting at MAD 200 ($20) per month on May 1, 2019.  El Othmani indicated this would involve a total spending of MAD 2.5 billion ($260 million) during 2019, and up to MAD 7 billion ($724 million) in 2021. The agreement will establish a new minimum wage for national education sector employees. This is expected to benefit more than 24,000 employees, with a government spending of over MAD 200 million (roughly $21,000). The government will also increase the minimum wage in the private sector (industry, trade, services, and the agricultural sector) by 10% over two years, with a 5% increase taking effect in July 2019 and a further 5% increase in July 2020. The agreement also stipulates an increase in family benefits for public and private sector workers. Family compensation will increase by MAD 100 ($10.35) per child, for up to three children, from 1 July 2019, tweeted Moroccan television channel 2M. “The Government is committed to mobilizing the necessary financial resources to cover the costs of this agreement,” the Head of Government told the signatories. The agreement was signed by the Head of Government El Othmani, the Secretary-General of the Moroccan Work Union (UMT) Miloudi Mouharik, the Secretary-General of the General Union of Moroccan Workers (UGMT) Naam Miyara, the Secretary-General of the National Work Union of Morocco (UNMT) Abdelilah El Halouti, and the President of the CGEM Salaheddine Mezouar. The Democratic Confederation of Labor (CDT) boycotted the agreement to protest against the government failing to  respond to its demands in separate negotiations on revenue, pension tax, and workers’ right to strike.

Rabat – Judiciary police in the cities of Casablanca, Marrakech, Oujda, Meknes, and Khenitra arrested on Tuesday 100 suspects with links to unauthorized call centers, reported a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). The suspects are accused of the “theft, transfer, and piracy” of phone calls, according to the statement. The suspects, whom authorities are referring to as “fictive call agents,” are thought to be part of a network of unauthorized call centers that have established their business to benefit off authorized centers and telecommunication companies in Morocco. In its statement, DGSN established that the modus operandi of the “vast network of fictive call centers” consisted in calling their victims via a foreign telephone number. The telephone of the victim is left to ring for a very short time—only once in most cases—because the goal is to trick the customer in calling back, according to DGSN. The choice of non-Moroccan numbers is to lure victims to call back much sooner than they would have normally, with the impression that it must be an important call from abroad. Once the victim calls back, DGSN explained, the call is immediately transferred to one of the fictive centers whose agents’ job is to maintain the victim on the line. The end goal is to “exhaust the victim’s balance” and have her telecom company pay for the remainder of the call duration in foreign currency, according to DGSN. The losses have so far been estimated at MAD 2 million. The preliminary investigations, jointly conducted by agents of the judiciary police and a service specialized in telecommunications-related crimes, have so far led to the arrest of 94 call agents and 6 managers affiliated to the fictive network. The authorities have also put their hands on a number of computers as well as other telecommunications “materials suspects used for their criminal undertakings,” noted DGSN’ statement. Meanwhile, DGSN suggested that, as Morocco embraces the relentless digitization of global economic activities, telecommunications-linked crimes are set to be one of the toughest security challenges. While an established and world renowned bastion against terrorism and other classical criminal undertakings, Morocco is not sufficiently equipped to deal with the mounting threats of cybercrimes. But as it faces increasing instances of hacking, the country is taking steps to upgrade its security architecture. In most of its recent statements, DGSN maintained that internet-based crimes will occupy the lion’s share of Morocco’s upgraded security mechanism. In a related operation, security services in Khourigba, a province in the Beni Mellal region in Central Morocco, arrested on Wednesday 8 employees thought to be connected to similar fraudulent call centers, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. Suspects of both incidents have been placed under police custody as authorities across the country continue investigations to shed further light into the issue.

Rabat – The Moroccan government has allegedly thwarted a new initiative from US National Security Adviser John Bolton to include the monitoring of human rights to the mission of MINURSO, the UN peacekeeping body in Western Sahara. Sources from the United Nations told Moroccan state-owned television channel 2M that the US has presented the first draft of a new Security Council resolution on the region to the Group of Friends on Western Sahara, which includes the US, the UK, Russia, Spain, and France. Bolton, according to the sources, has been pressuring the group on the issue of human rights and MINURSO. Morocco aborted Bolton’s attempts with diplomatic intervention inside and outside the UN, said the state television today. France supported and Russia backed Morocco’s diplomatic actions to thwart Bolton’s maneuvers, the sources added. They said that the US, in its capacity as a penholder of the upcoming resolution,  was expected to submit a new draft to the Group of Friends on Western Sahara on Wednesday. The 15 members of the Security Council will vote on the new resolution, set to extend the mandate of MINURSO, on April 29. The new draft will not include the part which allows the “expansion” of MINURSO’s powers to monitor human rights, enabling “periodic visits by United Nations delegations to the region.” Russia’s stance against Bolton’s plan comes after a meeting between Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov last week, when Bourita reaffirmed that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is the only solution the country can offer to end the conflict over Western Sahara. UN sources theorized that Morocco had secured Russia’s neutral position on the conflict. Last year, Bolton expressed frustration that the conflict has not ended yet. “Ladies and gentlemen, 27 years of deployment of this peacekeeping force, 27 years and it’s still there? How can you justify that? I have got to know over the years the Saharawi people, I have enormous respect for them, I have enormous respect for the government and people of Morocco and Algeria, is there not a way to resolve it?” Bolton said at a Washington, D.C., event. MINURSO is a UN peacekeeping operation created in 1991 under Resolution 690 to monitor the Morocco-Polisario ceasefire and the confinement of Moroccan and Polisario troops to designated locations and prepare for a referendum. The Security Council renewed the mandate of MINURSO last on October 31, 2018, by extending its mandate for six months. The Security Council is set to extend the mandate of MINURSO for another six months on April 29.

Rabat – The latest statistics from the European Commission indicate that countries of the coveted Schengen area delivered 530,000 visas to Moroccan applicants in 2018. The numbers mean that the desirability score of Morocco travelers has slightly increased by 3% compared to last year. In 2017, Moroccans landed 514,872 Schengen visas. But the slight improvement does not whitewash the persistently high number of rejections. While the EU commission does not provide details on the rate of rejected applications, it did suggest that the numbers are not essentially down to the state of EU-Morocco relations. Morocco is an established EU partner, and the North African country has lately reinforced its comfortable position as a strong EU ally. On topics like security and migration, many European countries consider Rabat an indispensable partner. When it comes to visa procedures, however, Schengen area countries have mostly tightened their policies in response to migration into the EU. France and Spain, Morocco’s closest EU allies, remain the two countries that deliver the highest number of visas to Moroccan applicants. In 2018, 362,420 Moroccans applied for a French visa. The result was 56,784 rejections and 362,420 acceptances. In the same period, Spain received 200, 970 applications from Moroccans. The European country accepted 158,702 and rejected 33,520. Meanwhile, Belgium also featured as a cherished destination for Moroccan visa applicants. Of the 13,456 visa seekers who chose Belgium in 2018, only half—6,340—landed the prized document. Overall, Casablanca and Tangier led the dance in terms of visa applications. The two economic hubs were followed by Rabat, Fez, and Tetouan. The statistics indicate that, in terms of visa applications, Morocco ranked second in North Africa in 2018. Algeria took the top spot with 711,080 applications. But when it comes to acceptance rate, Morocco outranked its neighbor. Algerians received 384,302 Schengen visas in 2018, compared to Morocco’s 530,000. Tunisia and Egypt ranked third and fourth, respectively. In the majority of cases, “higher education” was the recurrent motive for successful long-stay visa applications.

Rabat – The Egmont Institute for International Relations, a think tank in Brussels, and the German Konrad Adenauer Stiftung Foundation published a new study, Wednesday, April 24, on how Morocco addresses the issue of local jihadis and returning foreign fighters. The study asserts that Morocco “is by far the most advanced in dealing with returnees” compared to the other countries it surveyed, Egypt and Tunisia. The report, however, raised concerns about the security approaches in the three North African countries, and noted that Tunisia is seen as the biggest sender of foreign terrorist fighters to the Levant. The report looked at the effect the counter-terrorism policies of these countries has on Europe.  Two reasons why these countries’ policies are of interest to Europe, the report stated, are that many Europeans who join terrorist organizations have North African heritage and any instability in North Africa “could have a damaging spillover effect for European security.” Terrorism in Morocco  Although “more than a thousand” radicalized Moroccans joined ISIS in the Middle East, Morocco has experienced only one terrorist attack, the murder of two female Scandinavian backpackers near Imlil, since 2011 when a terrorist attacked the Argana cafe in Marrakech’s Jemaa El-Fna square. Morocco has, however, been a target for terrorists, according to Egmont.“ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi singled out Morocco as a potential target for terrorist attacks” in 2014. In 1996, the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (GICM), a group of Moroccans fighting in Afghanistan, also threatened to attack Morocco. Most of the Moroccans who have joined terrorist groups in recent years have joined ISIS, and the rest joined other terrorist organizations both in Syria and Iraq. Egmont also recalled some of the positive outcomes of Morocco’s deradicalization approach. It stated that Mohammed Abdelouahab Rafiqui, alias Abou Hafs, was one of multiple former Salafi jihadis “reviewing their ideological stands” who later renounced the use of violence and is now advocating for a moderate version of Islam, including gender equity in inheritance and individual religious freedom. Moroccan foreign fighters Noting the scarcity of detailed information of Moroccan foreign fighters, the report extracted more comprehensive data from an internal document from the Central Bureau of Judiciary Investigation (BCIJ). BCIJ put the total number of Moroccan terrorist fighters who traveled to Syria and Iraq at 1,664, excluding Europeans of Moroccan descent. If the number included Europeans who have dual nationality with Morocco, it might increase to between 2,000 and 2,500. Out of the 1,664, 285 are women and 378 children. In contrast, the security and intelligence consultancy AICS estimated the number at 1,800.  Most of the terrorist fighters joined ISIS, and 900 went to the conflict zone between June and December 2013. Some Moroccans joined Harakat sham al Islam and Jabhat Nusra instead of ISIS. Social media: a tool for mass destruction The report theorizes that Moroccans were drawn towards joining ISIS in 2012 when “sheikhs across the Sunni Islamic world called for the support of Sunni communities in Syria, which may have been interpreted by young Moroccans as an official endorsement of the war.”  Morocco had joined the Group of Friends of the Syrian People, which recognized the Syrian National Coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people following the Syrian uprising in 2011.  Recruiters in Syria propagated religious rhetoric with videos and pictures of the crimes the Assad regime had committed.  Social media played a vital role in the recruitment process of terrorist groups. Citing Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi, the report states that 80% of foreign terrorist fighters used Facebook and Twitter to join terrorist groups. In the first months of 2017 only, 377 Facebook and Twitter accounts with links to ISIS were deleted.  Socio-economic background  Based on data from the National Observatory for Human Development (ONDH), two-thirds of Moroccan foreign terrorist fighters are under the age of 25.  Seventy-five percent come from deprived families living in the slums of cities like Casablanca, Sale, and especially the northern region of Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima, where there are “high rates of illiteracy, school drop-out and unemployment.” Egmont describes the region as a “breeding ground for transnational terrorist networks.” The situation of foreign fighters returning from Syria after the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces defeated ISIS in its territory earlier this month is another problematic issue facing many countries.  The study suggests that the returnees are posing a threat to Europe and North African countries.  Morocco’s counter terrorism approach  Morocco has stepped up its security measures in recent years especially with regards to terrorism. It has initiated a number of reforms. Since the creation of the BCIJ in 2015, under the supervision of the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DST), between 2015 and 2018, Morocco had dismantled 57 terrorist cells. It arrested 3,129 people, 292 of whom had a criminal record, and foiled 361 terrorist actions. At the religious level, in 2015, Morocco created the Mohammed VI Institute for Training Imams, Morchidines and Morchidates, and the Mohammed VI Foundation for African Ulema, dedicated to supporting African theologians and scholars to promote religious tolerance.  Morocco’s deradicalization policy has also catered for the country’s prisoners. Through the Moussalaha (an Arabic word for reconciliation) program, Morocco has mobilized authorities from the Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs and members of religious councils, who visited approximately 5,000 incarcerated offenders in 2013 only. The report also highlights Morocco’s active engagement in worldwide forums on terrorism such as the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum (GCTF). It also recalled a number of security mechanisms Morocco established, among which are the hadar (vigilance) mechanism, whereby Morocco deploys security forces to guard airports, train stations, and administrative buildings.  Besides monitoring telephone calls and online searches, Morocco’s interior ministry mobilized 50,000 mqadmin (auxiliary agents) across the country to keep an eye and report on “any unusual behaviour.” Morocco has cooperated with several European countries and has proven a valuable source of information because it helped detect the perpetrator of the November 2015 attack in Paris. Shortcomings in Morocco’s prevention policy Egmont noted that while Morocco has taken quantum leaps in combating terrorism through counter-terrorism and deradicalization programs, its approach has largely been security-driven. The report implied that Morocco’s counter-terrorism policy pays little attention to prevention and rehabilitation measures, especially for returning foreign fighters, except for the Moussalaha program. “[No] programmes have been put in place to tackle specifically the issue of returnees, who are treated like all other terrorists,” the report stated.

Rabat – The representatives of two Spanish political parties, the People’s Party and the Citizens-Party, have said they do not want Spain to submit a joint candidacy with Portugal and Morocco for the 2030 World Cup. In a meeting organized by the National Federation of Sports Facilities Entrepreneurs (FNEID) in Madrid, the People’s party representative, Vicente Azpitarte dismissively spoke about Spain joining a trio with Morocco and Portugal to organize the World Cup.  Azpitarte specifically wondered whether Spain would get any advantages from teaming up with the two countries, t Spanish news outlet Iusport reported on Wednesday. The Citizens-Party representative, Roberto Nunez, agreed with Azpitarte. “We do not intend to organize a World Cup with other countries. Spain has more than enough capacity [to organize the World Cup], it is a country that has already organized a World Cup, and we do not understand that proposal,” Nunez said. The adviser of United Podemos, Oscar Penas, stated that he does not clearly see why “the priority is to organize a World Cup or an Olympiad at this time.” Morocco and Spain cooperate on a number of issues, ranging from security and migration to trade and education. On November 18, the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, arrived in Morocco for a first visit since his election to premiership. During his visit,  Sanchez proposed to both Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and King Mohammed VI a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup.  “We are launching a joint message, which is that this will be a bid between two continents. The King of Morocco is receptive and we’re going to work on it with Portugal. We are very excited about it,” Sanchez said.

The bank added that the weekly evolution of the benchmark index reflects an increase in the sectoral indices of “buildings and construction materials” by 1.9%.

Rabat – Moroccan caftans were the focus at the fashion night of the “Morocco in Abu Dhabi” festival on Tuesday. Four hundred people attended the fashion show, which showcased the Moroccan caftan and highlighted the latest trends, according to Emirati news outlet Gulf Today. “Morocco in Abu Dhabi” is an annual festival which aims to promote ties between Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. The festival brings Moroccan culture to the UAE through music, art, handicrafts, cuisine, and fashion. It includes a fashion show and musical and theater performances. This year the festival also included a Moroccan Heritage Museum, displaying artifacts from ancient and pre-Islamic times to the modern world. At the fashion show on Tuesday, models showcased traditional and modern caftan designs. “The caftan has been passed down through many generations. This year, we decided to focus on the traditional Moroccan arts of sewing and embroidery,” designer Sofia Ben Ibrahim told Gulf Today. “The collection features innovative and trend-setting designs with both warm and cool colors and we also have some unique designs of new short-sleeved wedding dresses, in addition to other long-sleeved collections,” Ben Ibrahim added.

Rabat – Low-cost carrier Ryanair will launch a direct flight between Essaouira, a popular beach city on Morocco’s Atlantic coast, and London’s Stansted Airport on October 29. The company will mobilize two weekly flights to link the two cities Tuesdays and Sundays, a statement from Essaouira’s Provincial Council of Tourism announced. The new flight is the result of several partners, including Morocco’s National Tourism Office (ONMT), according to the press release published by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). “This new airline will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the tourism sector in the city” of Essaouira. The statement added that tourism operators in the city have “welcomed” the initiative, which is part of ONMT’s approach to open the city to the world. The direct flight will also connect Essaouira to a tourism market with high potential, according to the statement. Ryanair will also launch a flight from Brussels Zaventem to Essaouira in October. The company will operate the new route twice weekly on Tuesdays and Saturdays. In February, the company unveiled its 2019-2020 winter flight schedule, which also includes new flights from Marseille to Agadir, Essaouira, and Ouarzazate. The coastal city of Essaouira receives thousands of tourists annually, especially in the summer for the Gnawa music festival. Ryanair currently serves the Moroccan cities of Agadir, Fez, Marrakech, Nador, Oujda, Rabat, and Tangier.

Rabat – In an overnight protest Wednesday night, April 24, police attempted to disperse protesting teachers with water cannons and batons, leaving dozens of the contractual teachers “seriously” wounded.  65 contractual teachers sustained “serious injuries.” A member of the national commission of the National Coordination of Teachers Forced into Contracts (CNPCC), Abdessamad El Amrani, said riot police met protests with violence, that not only left 65 in “serious conditions” but also sent some to intensive care. El Amrani added that most of teachers’ injuries were on their hands, backs, and legs due to the strong force of the water cannons and the batons. The incident came amid contractual teachers’ call for three days of marches in response to the Ministry of Education, which declared it would “suspend dialogue with teachers’ representatives” until striking teachers return to work.  The protesting teachers have accused the education ministry of failing to abide by the agreements negotiated in an April 13 meeting.  Contractual teachers said they would extend their strike until April 25 or more.  The education ministry and teacher’s representatives have held several negotiation meetings since February 20 when the street marches began, but they have not yet come to a mutual understanding. The teachers have threatened a “blank year” of not returning to work for 12 months in protest of the ministry. Contractual teachers argue the education ministry does not put them on an equal footing with permanent teachers. They have been agitating for the abolishment of the fixed-term contract, some terms of which do not grant them the same level of job security as public sector teachers and to be hired into the public sector.  Although the ministry promised it would abandon its contract scheme and later decided to amend some terms in the contract, all its attempts to find a middle ground with teachers have failed. Teachers consider the education ministry’s offers “patchy” and blame it for the consequences.

Rabat – American television channel CNN has listed Morocco’s Mount Toubkal as one of the 25 most beautiful places around the world to visit. The channel said that Mount Toubkal “lays claim to the title of the ‘roof of North Africa.’” CNN said that Mount Toubkal takes travelers to a peaceful world “away from the buzz of nearby Marrakech.” “The path to its summit zigzags across empty valleys, past holy shrines and up step snowfields before emerging onto a ridge that falls away to give climbers unrivaled views across the Atlas Mountains.” The mountain, the highest peak in North Africa, attracts thousands of local and international travelers annually.  In addition to Mount Toubkal, the list of “the world’s top breathtaking, beautiful destinations” includes other mesmerizing spots in Africa, including the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest in Uganda, and Kenya’s Samburu wildlife reserve. The Maldives, Ciudad Perdida in Colombia, and Svalbard in Norway also secured places in the list. It is not the first time CNN has put a spotlight on North Africa’s highest peak. On April 1, the channel published a list of the 23 best global destinations for hiking. The list included Mount Toubkal. “The path upwards rises from the village of Imlil, passing over a dry river before rising sharply through the shrine at Sidi Chamharouch and on towards a large mountain hut,” said the US-based news outlet to describe the mountain. The channel’s recent accolades illustrate that the heinous attack on two Scandinavian tourists killed near Mount Toubkal may not affect Morocco’s tourism. In December 2018, Moroccans were shocked after security services found the decapitated bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway in the Atlas Mountains. In March, over 100 Danish tourists visited Imlil to show the world that Morocco is a safe country with hospitable people.

Rabat – Moroccan-born CEO Ali Ben Lmadani held a press conference on Tuesday to announce the start of ABL Aviation’s operations and its receipt of the Casablanca Finance City status. The status facilitates business operations in Morocco, providing tax incentives and other financial benefits.  ABL Leasing came to Morocco in 2017 and is the first commercial aircraft leasing company in Africa.  The company offers a number of services including sourcing and remarketing aircraft, leasing, aircraft technical management, and debt sourcing and restructuring. “By setting up operations in Casablanca, we aim to offer innovative solutions to African air companies as well as the unique business offering we have already achieved in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the Middle-East,” Lmadani said in the press conference, reports Moroccan television channel 2M. “We strongly believe in the potential of the aeronautical market on the African continent, and we consider we have the expertise and experience necessary to accompany its development,” he stated. Africa “is a region where we see huge potential” ABL Aviations said on social media.  According to a 2017 – 2036 market outlook document by Boeing, air traffic for African carriers is forecast to grow 5.9% annually over the next 20 years. The number is above the world average and is driven by African economic growth and the increasing numbers of travelers from, to, and within the continent. According to Boeing, African airlines will need 1,220 new airplanes over the next 20 years to accommodate the growth. The African air market is challenging. Direct flights between countries are limited because bilateral agreements control which direct connections are available. The market also faces safety issues arising from inconsistent enforcement of international safety standards as well as challenges due to political instability.  Based in Dublin, ABL Leasing also has offices in New York, Hong Kong, and Dubai.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani met Qatari Attorney General Ali Bin Fetais Al Marri, with whom he discussed how to forge more solid bilateral cooperation in a meeting in Rabat on Wednesday. During his visit, the Qatari official commended the “distinguished” position of Morocco within the Arab world. He also applauded Morocco’s support of the UN-led initiatives in the area of law enforcement. El Othmani’s talk also focused on cooperation against corruption. Al Marri also met Morocco’s Minister of Justice Mohamed Aujjar. During the meeting, both officials discussed ways to improve judicial cooperation. Aujjar told the press that both Qatar and Morocco are pledging to solidify their cooperation. In March, El Othmani received the speaker of the Qatari Advisory Council, Ahmed bin Abdullah bin Zaid Al Mahmoud, who expressed Qatar’s satisfaction with its diplomatic ties with Morocco. Qatar and Morocco maintain strong diplomatic ties because the Gulf country holds special respect for the North African country, which maintained relations during Qatar’s Gulf crisis with the Saudi coalition. Qatar highly appreciated Morocco’s neutrality in the Gulf crisis when the Saudi coalition enforced a hard blockade on it. King Mohammed VI also ordered the government to offer humanitarian assistance to the Gulf country during the crisis.

Rabat – Students barred Ahmed Raissouni, the president of the International Union of Muslim Scholars (IUMS) from chairing a lecture on Wednesday at the Faculty of Human Sciences at Abdelmalek Saadi University in Martil, near the northern Moroccan city of Tetouan. The lecture, organized by the Student Renewal movement, “Attajdid Attolabi,” was interrupted 23 minutes after it began under the theme “Moroccan choices in religiosity and doctrine.” The students, carrying knives, attacked Raissouni and forced him to leave the symposium. Student Renewal shared a statement on Wednesday to condemn the attack. “We were surprised by a terrorist attack, in which knives were used and chairs by a faction called Al Kaidhiyin students,” wrote the movement. The statement added that some members of the movement received injuries. The movement described the attack as a criminal and flagrant attack which harmed “the value of science and diversity at the Moroccan university.” The movement said that it has filed complaints with the security forces in Martil. Student Renewal also expressed support for their members’ missions and initiatives. Raissouni has not commented on the incident yet but has shared several posts on his Facebook from Moroccan news outlets condemning the attacks on him. Raissouni is one of the most renowned scholars in Morocco. In November 2018, the International Union of Muslim Scholars elected the scholar as its president. The scholar, who previously served as vice president of IUMS, was born in 1953 in the village of Awlad Sultan in Larache, northern Morocco. Raissouni earned his bachelor’s degree in Islamic law at Al Quaraouiyine University in Fez in 1978. He also served on the executive board of the World Forum of Muslim Scholars and as secretary general of the Association of Graduates of Islamic Studies. Raissouni also holds a master’s degree from Mohammed V University in Rabat from 1989 and a Ph.D. degree from 1992.

Rabat – Police forces used water cannons and batons to disperse thousands of contractual teachers attempting to hold an overnight sit-in in front of Parliament. According to early estimates from the Coordination of Teachers Forced into Contracts’ (CNPCC) 64 protestors were injured during the nearly 12-hour protest.  The demonstration began in the afternoon of Wednesday, April 24 at Rabat Agdal Train Station and ended in the morning of Thursday, April 25, in dozens of alleyways across Morocco’s capital city. Following the use of water cannons in front of parliament at approximately 11:30 p.m., riot police spent the next several hours deploying throughout the city and using their batons to scatter any large formation of protesting teachers. At approximately 12:45 a.m., a group of nearly 300 teachers attempted to march back to their original position in front of parliament but were chased away by roughly two dozen riot police. “They are chasing us like dogs,” Achmed Labid, CNPCC’s coordinator for the Marrakech region, told Morocco World News (MWN). “Look at how they are treating peaceful protesters. Nights like this only inspire us to come back.” This is the second time police have used force to disperse an overnight sit-in.  The first time was on Saturday, April 23. Despite the heavy-handed response from authorities, the teachers said they will continue demonstrating to vent their dissatisfaction. “Overnight sit-ins are important because it reminds the government that these problems do not go away when the sun goes down,” Labid said. “That is why they always break them up.” Riot police at the event declined MWN’s request to comment. The sit-in was the third contractual teacher protest held this week—the first two taking place on Monday and Tuesday. The CNPCC along with other unions are planning to host protests until Saturday. Official details regarding the upcoming demonstrations have not been released. “We will continue to put pressure on the government by protesting until they invite us back to negotiate new terms,” Zakaria Elkoti, a member of the CNPCC’s Supervising and Follow-Up Committee, told MWN. “Teachers are more motivated than ever to continue their fight for integration.” The series of overnight sit-ins follow weeks of failed negotiations with the government. Earlier this week, the already slumbering “social dialogue” between demonstrators and authorities came to a halt again after yet another failure to reach an agreement on teachers’ demands. On Tuesday, the Ministry of Education officially announced the collapse of the negotiations between the government and the teachers’ unions. Both sides are accusing each other of breaching the terms of the April 13 agreement.

Rabat – The Spanish and Moroccan governments have launched the initial phase of a program to return unaccompanied Moroccan minors back to Morocco. The Child Prosecution Office of Madrid has summoned 23 youths to be interviewed by a Moroccan delegation, said Spanish newspaper El Pais. According to the Spanish Minister of the Interior, the purpose of the interviews is to identify unaccompanied minors currently housed in Spanish reception centers who may be eligible for repatriation. The Spanish government has emphasized that the return of minors is voluntary and that it will not repatriate minors who do not want to return to Morocco. The Spanish Network of Immigration and Refugee Aid (Red Inmigracion) has strongly opposed the measure, tweeting yesterday that “the process of deportation be stopped immediately.” The network described the policy as “unfair and illegal.” “The Government of Pedro Sanchez must reverse its actions immediately.” Unaccompanied Moroccan minors represent 70 percent of the more than 7,000 minors in the care of Spain’s regional governments, according to data from the Spanish government. In March 2013 Spain and Morocco signed an agreement to address illegal migration between the two countries. The agreement entailed improved border surveillance and readmission of irregular immigrants. In January, the European Union announced it would give Morocco 110 million euros to support its policies under the 2013 agreement. Several organisations in Morocco have experience in assisting with the return of minors from Europe to Morocco, including the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), and Bayti Organisation. Moroccan authorities proceed on a case by case basis in repatriation situations, requiring confirmation of Moroccan nationality and evaluating whether the repatriation is in the child’s best interests.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI inaugurated on Wednesday a new radiology and medical analysis centre in Agdal, Rabat. The centre will provide services to active and retired members of the national police force and their families. Moroccan police force members and their families benefit from the Police Force Health Insurance which is “one of the more dynamic insurance policies,” states the National Fund of Social Welfare Organizations (CNOPS). The new centre is built on three storeys and includes a radiology center, a medical analysis laboratory and a day hospital. The radiology center provides for dental radiology, ultrasound imaging, digital mammography, bone densitometry and magnetic resonance imaging. The medical analysis laboratory provides for sampling, microbiology, immuno-hematology and immunology, as well as hematology units. The laboratory includes a biochemistry unit for both routine examinations (like liver, kidney and blood testing) and specialized examinations (including hormone testing, fertility testing and infectious serology). The day hospital has eight individual rooms for medical consultations and outpatient treatments. The center employs four physicians of different medical specialties, eight laboratory technicians, four radiology technicians, four sampling anaesthetists, four nurses, four administrative managers and ten support workers.  It expands the services and benefits provided by the Moroccan government to members of the police force and their families.

Rabat – Spanish football club Real Betis is interested in recruiting Moroccan international footballer Youssef En-Nesyri, who currently plays for Leganes. Spanish sports news outlet AS said that the 21-year-old footballer is his club’s top scorer this season, with 10 goals. Other local and international news outlets also speculated that Arsenal wants to hire the young Atlas Lion. In February, En-Nesyri gave his football club Leganes the first hat-trick in its history in a match against Real Betis. “It was not a personal success, but a collective effort of the team and scoring a hat-trick will always be memorable for me,” said the Fez native. En-Nesyri signed a four-year contract with Leganes in August 2018. He started his football career in the youth team of the Maghreb AS. The footballer was summoned to join the Atlas Lions in 2016 when he played a friendly match against Albania. En-Nesyri also played with the Moroccan national football team in the 2018 World Cup.

Rabat – The leader of the Mauritanian People’s Progressive Alliance (APP) party, Ahmed Ould Iyahi, has promised that if elected in Mauritania’s June 22 presidential elections, he will find a political solution to the Western Sahara conflict satisfying all parties. Ould Iyahi made the statements in an event he organized at a Youth House in Nouakchott in which he announced his election campaign. Mauritania participated in the two Western Sahara roundtable discussions in Geneva that the UN-sponsored. Representatives from Morocco, Algeria, and Polisario also took part. In an interview with Palestinian journalist Abdel Bari Atwan, Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz has said that powerful countries in the UN are more in favor of Morocco’s Western Sahara position than the settlement brokers would like to admit. Aziz stated, “The West, Europe, and the US, do not want another state geographically separating Morocco and Mauritania.” He added, “Everything you hear outside of this frame is not correct.” Abdel Aziz, a member of the ruling Union for the Republic (UPR) party, is not running for re-election, leaving the field open for a new candidate. The Economist’s Intelligence Unit predicts the election winner will be another UPR candidate or Biram Ould Dah Ould Abeid, an anti-slavery campaigner.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI launched construction on a new headquarters for Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) on Wednesday in the Hay Riad district in Rabat. The new headquarters, which are set to cost MAD 2 billion ($207 million), are in line with the royal speech from the 17th anniversary of the King’s Throne Day in 2016, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). During his speech, the King acknowledged the difficulties faced by national police due to limited resources. “They work day and night and are subject to tremendous pressure, as they are exposed to danger when they are on duty.” In his speech, the King urged the government to “provide the security authorities with the necessary human and material resources to enable them to carry out their duty properly.” The new facility will be built on an area of 20 hectares and will include a modern and integrated administrative complex, sheltering all the directorates and central services of the national security branch. The headquarters will also include a conference room with a capacity of 1,200 seats. The government expects to complete the project within five years. It will also include a museum of national security to trace the history of DGSN and its efforts to fight terrorism, drug trafficking, and criminal networks. The architectural design will meet international standards. The DGSN’s headquarters will also benefit from improved accessibility thanks to its location in Hay Riad and its connection to Rabat’s motorway network. The facility will also include an archive center, a center for sports, a center for the registration of identity data and printing of national maps, a reserve force accomodation center, a computer center, and a parking lot with a capacity of 1,500 vehicles.

Rabat – The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has disqualified Congo from the final phase of the 2019 Africa Under-23 Cup of Nations in Egypt. The decision comes after Congo did not comply with the competition’s rules by allowing a football player to play who was over 23.  In order for players to participate in the Under-23  tournament, they must have been born on or after January 1, 1997. However, one Congolese player, Zola, was born on February 23, 1996. Zola played in two matches against Morocco in the second qualifying round. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) had filed a complaint against the player for ineligibility.  The Moroccan national Under-23 team was initially disqualified after losing on aggregate 2-1 to Congo. The Atlas Lions will now face off against Mali in a home match on June 5 and an away match on June 9 to seek a spot in the final phase in Egypt. The 2019 Africa U-23 Cup of Nations matches will qualify teams for the 2020 Summer Olympics men’s football tournament in Japan.

Rabat – Over 160 artists and intellectuals have signed an online petition demanding the Moroccan government free Hirak activists. The petition is yet another call to authorities to release the activists, whom police arrested for rallying against corruption and unemployment in northern Morocco’s Rif region in “unauthorized protests” in 2016 and 2017 in what is known as the Hirak movement. Actors, writers, and intellectuals signed the petition, criticizing the heavy prison sentences imposed on the activists and demand their immediate release. On April 5, the Court of Appeals in Casablanca upheld the prison sentences imposed on dozens of the Hirak activists in June 2018.  The court sentenced the leader of the movement, Nasser Zefzafi and activists Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid to 20 years in prison for “conspiracy aiming to undermine state security.” Other activists were sentenced to prison terms of 15, 10,7, 3, or 1 years, and fined for “participating in unauthorized protests.” Among the signatories are actors Mohamed Choubi and Touria Alaoui; film producers Nabil Ayouch and Driss Roukhe; and intellectuals and journalists Ahmed Assid, Sanaa El Aji, and Ahmed Bouzafour.  Member of Parliament Mustapha Chennaoui also wrote to Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani on Wednesday demanding the release of the activists. In his letter, Chennaoui expressed concern about the health of the prisoners, in particular, activist Rabii el Ablaq, who has been on hunger strike. Chennaoui requested the release of all the activists, stating they had done nothing wrong and had only demanded their human rights of justice and equality.  On Sunday, thousands of protesters took to the streets in Rabat, demanding activists be freed. Political and civil rights groups organized the march, as well as the families of the prisoners.

Rabat – The Moroccan Public Ministry, in partnership with UN Women, launched in Rabat an awareness-raising campaign on human trafficking in Morocco on Monday. The campaign’s purpose is to inform local bodies and the general public about human trafficking as well as the Moroccan laws about trafficking. It is part of a broader program by the Moroccan Public Ministry to ensure “access to legal services for women and children victims of human trafficking in Morocco.” The campaign includes two short animated videos explaining human trafficking for social media; a 26-minute documentary to be shown on 2M and National Society of Radio and Television (SNRT), the two main Moroccan television channels; and a short radio broadcast. In August 2016, Morocco introduced Law 27.14 which sets out a framework for prosecuting human trafficking crimes, in line with international laws. The law defines human trafficking and sets out the penalties for the crime. The head of Public Prosecutions, Mohamed Abdennabaoui, stated on Monday that the fight against human trafficking remains a central preoccupation of the Morocan justice system and that the law “provided an effective framework to prevent traffickers and to guarantee legal protection for the victims.” Abdennabaoui is also the president of the Public Ministry. In 2015, UN Women released a study on human trafficking in Morocco. It identified incidences of trafficking of local and migrant men, women and children for sexwork, forced labor and terrorism and incidences of underage and forced marriage, the selling of infants, and forced begging.  At the time of the study, human trafficking was not part of the Moroccan legislative framework, though other legal provisions such as “intentional violence” and “kidnapping” were used to prosecute cases.

Rabat – The 2019 Migration and Remittances report from the World Bank has expressed positive expectations on the inflow of remittances from the Moroccan diaspora. In 2018, according to the report, Morocco received $7.4 billion from its diaspora, equal to 6.2% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The report found that remittance inflows to North Africa and the Middle East overall experienced ”rapid growth” in 2018. Egypt ranked highest in remittances, having receiving $28.9 billion from its expatriates, followed by Morocco, Lebanon with $7.2 billion, and Jordan with $4.4 billion. Tunisia and Algeria received only $2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. Throughout the year, the Moroccan diaspora sends or brings home remittances which help the country’s economy. The North African country receives thousands of returning expatriates for holidays throughout the year. In 2018, 1,741,212 passengers, 464,977 vehicles, and 4,390 buses transited the Tangier Med port during the Marhaba 2018 operation that annually facilitates the summer influx of Moroccans living abroad (MREs). In addition to Tangier Med Port, thousands of MREs also choose to fly home for holidays. In January, Reuters said that remittances from the Moroccan diaspora dropped 1.7%. The World Bank report also evaluated the cost of sending money between countries within the Middle East and North Africa, emphasizing that “sending money” within the regions “is less expensive than sending money from outside.” The report found, however, that the fourth highest “cost corridor” in the region was to send money from Israel to Morocco.

Rabat – When Samira Ahmad (not her real name) left her native Morocco and got on a bus to Spain in April 2018, she felt a mix of pride and self-fulfillment. She had made the final cut of Moroccan women selected to join Spain’s prized strawberry industry as seasonal workers. As she embarked on her Spanish journey to register as a migrant worker just miles away from Morocco, Ahmad told a Guardian reporter, she thought the opportunity was the happy ending she had been expecting, having struggled to make ends meet for herself and her family. To Ahmad’s unpleasant surprise, however, the work and the environment she was promised were the total opposite of the labor exploitation and other inhumane treatment she and many other compatriots faced in strawberry fields in Spain’s Andalucia region. “Before I left my home I was like a hero to everyone,” the Guardian article quoted the Moroccan woman. “Nobody in my village had ever had the chance to go and work in a rich country like Spain. But it has turned out to be the worst decision of my life.” Ahmad said she and other seasonal workers were mistreated, sexually abused, and exploited on a regular basis. “Ahmad’s life is in ruins,” the article commented. “She is destitute, divorced and for the past 10 months has been living in hiding, surviving on handouts with nine other Moroccan women who – like her – claim they faced human trafficking, sexual assault and exploitation on the farm where they were hired to work.” According to the news outlet, Ahmad and eight other Moroccan seasonal workers have filed a complaint with Spain’s Civil Guard, the military police.
The women put all their hope in that legal procedure, but they appear to concede that no substantial result may come out. All they want, according to the article, is to have their names cleared so they can return home. Many of the seasonal workers say that their families have disowned them after learning about their experiences in Spain. The families think they work as prostitutes, the article noted. “We knew we couldn’t go home because we still hadn’t been paid and we had to prove that the things that we had told the police were true,” said one of the women. In the meantime, both Spanish and Moroccan authorities have been nonchalant, even dismissive at times, in how they have treated stories like Ahmad’s. According to the Guardian article, authorities in both countries have “downplayed” the extent of the tragedy the women report to have faced daily. While the Spanish courts have been obstructing progress in the case, according to the article, Morocco’s employment ministry, responsible for the paperwork of Spain-bound seasonal workers, has played down what it sees as alarmist reports. According to the ministry, cases of abuse and labor exploitation are not as widespread as reported. Like Ahmad, the Spanish women’s rights advocacy groups defending the cause of vulnerable seasonal workers appear to think that authorities from both countries would do little in such cases. They say the system is skewed against the most vulnerable populations. “In Morocco they are deliberately looking for those who are cheap and vulnerable to do this work, namely rural women with young children who only understand Arabic, cannot understand their contracts written in Spanish or claim their rights. It is a rigged system,” said Alicia Navascues, a women’s rights activist. Spain’s booming strawberry industry is its most important agricultural product. Each year, seasonal workers—almost all women—leave Morocco to work in neighboring Spain in an industry that is now labeled the “red gold” of the stuttering Spanish economy. Over 20,000 Moroccan women are expected to join in this year’s harvest, the Guardian noted. But Ahmad and her friends have a message to those preparing to embark on the Spanish journey: Don’t be lured. “I didn’t think that such stories could be true in a rich country like this,” Ahmad said of instances when, as she prepared to travel to Spain, she would dismiss reports of sexual abuse and exploitation coming from the women who preceded her cohort. Now that she experienced firsthand the stories she once ignored, Ahmad is an outspoken critic of what was once her most prized dream. She says she does not want others to experience the same plight as her and her friends. “I say to the women coming now, please don’t come. If bad things happen nobody will help you. Turn around and go home to your families.”

Rabat – Following the deadly terrorist attack at two Christchurch mosques, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and French President Emmanuel Macron will co-chair a global summit on May 15 to address online extremism. Ardern said on Wednesday, April 24, that the meeting will be a call for world leaders and executives of tech companies to agree to a pledge called “Christchurch Call,” named after the New Zealand city where a terrorist opened fire at two mosques, killing 50 people and wounding another 50.  The call is designed to end the misuse of social media to promote terrorism and hatred as a response to the Christchurch gunman’s live-streaming a 17-minute video of the heinous shootings on Facebook. Ardern noted that, despite social media’s positive uses, it can also be used to “incite extremist violence, and even to distribute images of that violence, as happened in Christchurch.” Ardern said the criminal used social media to propagate hatred and terrorism. “This isn’t about freedom of speech,” Ardern said. “It’s specifically focused on eradicating those extreme acts of terrorism online.” Ardern called on the leaders of tech companies to “join with us and help achieve our goal of eliminating violent extremism online at the Christchurch Summit in Paris … to ensure social media cannot be used again the way it was in the March 15 terrorist attack.”

Rabat – The Indo-Asian News Service has reported that Morocco’s security services provided “sensitive intelligence” to Sri Lanka to help identify suspects in the attacks on several churches and hotels on Easter Sunday, April 21. The newswire said that the information “was also shared with India” because Morocco and India have a “strong counter-terror cooperation.” In February, Rabat and New Delhi signed a memorandum of understanding to fight terrorism. The signing took place during the visit of India’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Sushma Swaraj to Morocco. Morocco provided the information, according to the newswire, within 48 hours of the attacks, which killed more than 350 people and injured approximately 500 others. One Moroccan woman was among the injured. The information helped Sri Lanka arrest nine suspects and identify their alleged ISIS handlers. ISIS claimed responsibility for the heinous attacks on three churches and three hotels across Sri Lanka.  Acknowledging Morocco’s leadership in countering terrorism, the newswire said that Morocco has “one of the successful records of counter-terrorism and de-radicalization in the Islamic world.” Since the 2003 attack in Casablanca, Morocco committed to strengthening its security to combat extremists and terror cells. Morocco also created the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) in 2015, which works with all Morocco’s security bodies, such us Morocco’s general directorates of national security (DGSN) and territorial surveillance (DGST) to raid terror cells across Morocco. On April 24, Morocco arrested a seven-member terror cell which was plotting to undermine the security of the country. The operation is one of many that BCIJ has carried out throughout the year against terrorists. Morocco also has several international counterterrorism cooperations with powerful intelligence agencies, including in the US, Spain, and France.

Rabat – Morocco will celebrate the first day of the holy month of Ramadan most likely on Tuesday, May 7, astronomer and researcher Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al Ifrani told Morocco World News today. The astronomer told MWN that on May 5 (Sha’ban 29), seeing “the crescent will not be possible in the east, and it will be slightly possible in the west, which means that the vision of the crescent will be impossible in eastern countries and even in Morocco’s eastern cities.” He added that astronomers will be able to see the crescent with difficulty “if the weather is appropriate in south-western cities.” The astronomer concluded by emphasizing that it will be “necessary to wait as the calculations are not completely settled.” A graduate of Madrasa Al-Atiqa in Morocco’s Souss region, Al Ifrani has made multiple predictions about when religious holidays will occur before that have come true. With Morocco unlikely to see the new moon until Monday night, May 6, “the first day of the holy month of Ramadan will be either on Monday or most likely on Tuesday,” Al Ifrani told MWN. Earlier this month,  Moroccan astronomer Hicham Elaissaoui said that Morocco will celebrate the first day of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, on May 7. The holy month of Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. All months in the Islamic calendar last from 29 to 30 days. A new month begins when scholars can see the new moon. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: “Do not fast until you see it [the crescent] and do not break the fast until you see it, and if it is covered then complete the month.” Muslims all across the world fast from sunrise to sunset to fulfill the second essential pillar of Islam after the profession of faith (shahadah), prayer (salah), charity (zakaat), and pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj). Some Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, might begin fasting a day earlier than Morocco, on May 6. The Emirati National said that astronomers predict the first day of Ramadan to be on May 6 in the Gulf. Quoting Hasan Al Hariri, the chief executive of Dubai Astronomy Group, the outlet said, “This year the [fasting period] will be shorter than last year, because of the starting date.” In addition to fasting, Ramadan is also a month that brings Muslims closer to God. After iftar (breaking fast), Muslims, men and women, of all ages head to mosques to perform night prayers (taraweeh), extra prayers performed only during Ramadan.

The documentary film “Amussu” about protests in Imider, a village in south-east Morocco against exploitative action from a local mining company, has been chosen for premiere at the Hot Docs International Festival in Toronto, Canada, which runs from April 25 to May 6. The film is scheduled to premiere on April 29 with at least two more showings on April 30 and May 4. If the film wins best international documentary at the festival, it will be eligible for the Oscars. For Moroccan director Nadir Bouhmouch, “Amussu’s” selection proves that “African cinema does not need large means, does not need French producers, nor their sophisticated equipment, nor hierarchical production structures” to make an impact. Bouhmouch, a 28-year-old based in Marrakech, works as a filmmaker, photographer, researcher, and writer. His work focuses on indigenous land rights and environmental issues in Morocco’s marginalized interior regions. Bouhmouch created the film in collaboration with the Imider community. The “Movement On the Road ‘96” acted as the producers and the Local Film Committee of Imider worked with Bouhmouch to write the screenplay. Movement on the Road ’96 was founded in August 2011 as a grassroots socio-environmental movement and is largely responsible for organizing the Imider protests. The Local Film Committee of Imider is a film collective made up of local volunteer artists, peasants, workers, shepherds, unemployed youth, and film technicians. The committee acts as the audiovisual arm for the Movement on Road the ’96. It seeks to promote cultural production and innovation, preserve local culture and popular memory, defend Imider from environmental degradation, and encourage social change. In addition to creating films, the group has archived hundreds of hours of poems, plays, songs, traditional chants, and oral stories. They have also organized two film festivals, dozens of individual film screenings, and workshops for children, unemployed youth, and women. Protests against exploitation Imider, a village in south-east Morocco, is the location of the biggest silver mine in Africa. Despite promises from the mine’s parent company Managem that the mine would bring economic growth and employment to the community, Imider remains one of the poorest regions in Morocco. The local people feel that they have faced abusive exploitation by the mine owners. They say that the fight against the mine is about “the right to water, land, and decent life.” The villagers peacefully rebelled in 2011, shutting down a major water pipeline that leads to the mine. They still occupy the land around the pipeline today and have kept the valve to one of the mine’s biggest wells shut for eight years. What was once a makeshift protest camp has essentially become a small solar-powered village. The pipeline to the mine had been using the village’s groundwater, drying out crops and creating serious agricultural problems. According to a report by the Global Amazigh Congress in September 2015, the mine uses 1,555 cubic meters of water every day. The figure is 12 times the village’s daily water consumption. Since the water source has been cut off, the mine’s capacity has dropped between 30 and 40 percent. The protestors want to end the mine’s exploitation of the village and its water as well as push the government to provide jobs to residents and establish a local school and hospital. Bouhmouch’s film follows the protestors and villagers in their continued efforts beginning in 2016, five years after the protests first began. Dozens of villagers have been arrested in those five years.   The film’s creators describe it as “a form of resistance in itself.”

Rabat – Russia’s deputy foreign minister and special presidential representative for the Middle East and Africa Mikhail Bogdanov has said that Russia stands for a “quick and mutual solution” to the Western Sahara issue.  Speaking yesterday to Morocco’s state-owned Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) following a meeting with vice-president of the Afro-Asian Peoples’ Solidarity Organization (AAPSO) Talea Saoud El Atlassi, the Russian official said that his country considers Morocco a “strategic” ally. “The meeting served as a great opportunity to exchange ideas and address a variety of issues of concern to both countries and the current issues in the Middle East and North Africa, including that of Western Sahara,” Bogdanov said . Referring to the strategic partnership Morocco and Russia forged in 2016, Bogdanov highlighted the strong historical ties between Morocco and Russia. He said that the newfound momentum in the Rabat-Kremlin ties have been propelling both countries to “take steps forward” and “try to boost effective and fruitful cooperation.”  He added that Morocco and Russia see eye to eye on “strengthening and maintaining a bilateral dialogue in the service of mutual interests” on issues like combatting terrorism and radicalization, as well as creating opportunities for social and economic development in the region.  In return, Al Atlassi, chairman of the Moroccan Commission for peace and solidarity and vice-president of AAPSO noted Russia’s “positive role” in the ongoing UN-led process for a political settlement in the Sahara dispute. Atlassi noted the meeting with Bogdanov reflects Russia’s intent to work out a “mutual, sustainable, and realistic solution to the issue of Western Sahara.”  The meeting’s primary focus was the discussion of the Russian-Moroccan relationship under the auspices of King Mohammed VI and Russia’s president Vladimir Putin in cultivating the dynamics of dialogue and development between the countries.

Rabat – The Benabdallah Private School Group in Marrakech and the Finnish franchise FinlandWay International Preschools signed a memorandum of cooperation on Tuesday, April 23, bringing in a Finnish curriculum for Benabdallah’s pre-school education. As the first of its kind not only in Morocco but also in Africa, the groundbreaking initiative will target children aged 12 months to 6 years with innovative teaching based on the latest Finnish play-based teaching methods.  “It’s about bringing new life to our methods to better support younger generations in acquiring knowledge and developing their skills,” said Adnane Benabdellah, the founder of the private school group. The co-founding president of FinlandWay, Noora Laitio, noted that her company will offer students a participative, fun, and effective program and a comprehensive school curriculum designed to lay a solid foundation for lifelong learning.  Laitio added that parents will also benefit from an e-learning system to track their children’s progress, which will “help parents and school work together to support student development to develop the key skills for their future.” Led by Finnish experts, the project also aims to offer nine months of online courses for educators with methods best suited to the needs of Moroccan children. Finland is well-known for its high quality education. It ranks among the top countries worldwide, especially in science, mathematics, and reading, according to the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 report.

Rabat – The German automaker BMW has decided to start buying its cobalt, an essential component for electric vehicle batteries, from Australian and Moroccan mines, reported Reuters on Tuesday.  Andreas Wendt, a member of the BMW Purchasing Board, said in a meeting in Paris that BMW would use the new cobalt supply in its next generation of electric vehicles in 2020. The announcement comes as the London Metal Exchange (LME) has launched an initiative to ban or delist brands that are not meeting, by 2022, a “minimum level of responsible sourcing compliance” in the fight against the exploitation of children or corruption in the mining industry. Congo has the largest known cobalt reserves in the world, with 60% of the world’s cobalt reserves, followed by China and Canada. BMW said last year that it was seeking ways to improve working conditions for cobalt mining in Congo through a pilot project, the agency reported. Morocco is the 12th biggest cobalt-exporting country because of its Bou-Azzer mine, 120 kilometers south of Ouarzazate in the Sahara desert. Morocco produced 2,081 metric tons of the mineral in 2016. Morocco’s Managem group is the company responsible for extracting the precious metal. Cobalt sells for approximately $79 per kilogram.

Rabat – Algeria’s interim president Abdelkader Bensalah has sacked the CEO of state-owned petroleum company Sonatrach, Abdelmoumene Ould Kadour, Algerian state television reported on Tuesday. The interim president nominated Sonatrach’s head of production and exploration, Rachid Hachichi, as the new CEO of the company. The Algerian interim leader did not state his government’s reasons for sacking Kaddour. But it is possible that the decision was due to Kadour’s close relationship with former Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika who appointed him as the head of Sonatrach in March 2017. After the mass Algerian protests against his re-election for a fifth term, Bouteflika resigned on April 3. But Algerians have also been complaining about the widespread corruption in the country, demanding that all the corrupt officials of the former regime be held accountable. Kaddour’s departure follows the dismissal on April 5 of the Algerian intelligence chief Athmane Tartag. The move is seen as a way to appease Algerians. By appearing to move away from the Bouteflika establishment, the new interim leadership wants to make a statement about its stated commitment to engineering a successful democratic transition.

Rabat – Canadian automotive supplier Magna is launching the construction work for a new mirrors facility in Morocco. The move comes as the Canadian giant seeks to be a part of the North African country’s growing automobile sector.  With a budget of $11.3 million, the plant will create 275 job opportunities.  The expansion of the Canadian firm seeks to “further support customers in the region,” according to Nasdaq The new plant will be built in a 61,44 square foot space in the free industrial zone in Kenitra, an hour drive from Rabat. The plant is set to supply international automotive companies with interior and exterior mirror systems. The facility will start production in the spring of 2020. The president of Magna Mechatronics, Lighting, and Mirrors, John O’hara said, “Expanding into Morocco is a strategic move.” O’hara’s hope is that expanding to Morocco will attract a new and considerable base of customers. But the company also expects to capitalize on the North African country’s workforce. “We also value the high level of skilled employees and engineering talent in the region, and we look forward to building a strong and capable team,” O’hara noted. In 2018, Magna and Altran Technologies SA set up an engineering center in Casablanca to provide engineering services for cars. Fourteen kilometers away from Europe and a doorway to Africa, Morocco has established itself as a leader in the automotive industry. Morocco’s strategic location has attracted several world leaders in the industry. Along with the aeronautic industry, the automotive sector is significantly contributing in the success of Morocco’s new development strategy.  Between 2014 and 2018, the automotive industry held the highest record of job creation per economic sector in Morocco. The sector generated 116,611 jobs in that time, representing 28.8 percent of all new jobs at the time, the Ministry of Industry said earlier this month.

Rabat – The High Commission for Planning (HCP) has announced that during the month of March, Morocco experienced an increase of 5.2% in gas prices. The HCP noted in the consumer price index (CPI) that the cost increase came at the same time as a 0.3% drop in the food index and partially caused the 0.2% increase in the non-food index. According to the HCP, from February to March 2019, the price declines in the food products mainly concerned the following categories: Fish and seafood at 2.6%, vegetables at 1.3%, oils and fats at 0.9%, and milk and cheese at 0.6%. For non-food products, the 5.2% fuel price increase was the most significant change. The largest fuel price decreases, according to the CPI, were recorded in southern Morocco’s Laayoune at 0.6%, in northern Morocco’s Tetouan and Al-Hoceima at 0.3%, and in Casablanca and Rabat at 0.2%. On the other hand, the CPI recorded the three largest increases in Guelmim at 0.5%, in Oujda at 0.3%, and in Agadir and Fez at 0.2%. The underlying inflation indicator, which excludes products with volatile prices and public tariffs, experienced a decrease from February to March 2019, but an 0.8% increase from March 2018.

Rabat – Thousands of contractual teachers from the 12 regions of Morocco marched through Rabat in the first three-day protest since the collapse of an agreement with the government. A meeting between the major teacher unions and the Ministry of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education, and Scientific Research was scheduled for Tuesday, April 23. But following accusations from both sides that the other had violated their April 13 agreement, the meeting was canceled. Minister of Education Said Amzazi, just 10 days earlier, had announced an agreement had been reached and the end of the months-long protest was at hand. In contradiction to Amzazi’s claims, protestors promised to continue protesting this week. On Tuesday, contractual teachers attempted to gather at the 16th November Square in Rabat to host a rally before the march began, but were prevented by riot police. Three teachers, not visibly injured, told Morocco World News (MWN) that several policemen excessively used their batons to keep teachers out of the square. Teachers’ unions have not released a statement regarding the alleged incident, and no injuries have been reported. Contractual teachers usually march from the Hassan Quarter down Hassan II Avenue to the Parliament. During one other occasion, protestors attempted to host a rally at the 16th November Square, but were prevented by police on April 8.  Riot police at the march and representatives from the National Security Headquarters declined to comment on the incident to MWN. The sun was blotted out in Rabat by a sea of umbrellas held by the teachers, who were all following trucks bedecked with speakers and the most enthusiastic protestors. Chants of “We’ll be here till integration” and “Our fight continues, we won’t give up” were amplified through the speaker systems and echoed down Hassan II Avenue. At the end of the chant “Don’t make us do this for a year, Amzazi,” smoke began to billow from a decrepit-looking speaker attached to one of the trucks of the Coordination of Teachers Forced into Contracts (CNPCC). “Even the equipment is tired of having to keep protesting against the ministry,” Khalid Bourhda, deputy coordinator of the CNPCC’s Rabat district, told MWN, as he waved away some of the smoke. The 40-year-old, who teaches Arabic at an elementary school in the city, played a key role in coordinating the national marches in Morocco’s capital city. According to Bourhda, this week’s three-day strike has teachers from the 12 regions of the country: Tangier-Tetouan, Fez-Meknes, Beni Mellal-Khenifra, Souss-Massa, Rabat-Sale-Kenitra, Oujda, Draa-Tafilalet, Casablanca-Settat, Laayoune, Guelmim, Dakhla, and Marrakech. “Each one of the national protests is even more of a success because the number of teachers attending keeps growing,” Bourhda said. “More and more teachers are inspired to join our fight for stable employment and basic dignity.” As the deputy coordinator, Bourhda sits in on all of the local CNPCC Rabat meetings and then spreads the information and details about marches through social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook. The truck, supporting a still smoking speaker, stalled in front of Bab Chellah, roughly a kilometer from its destination—the Parliament building. Bourhda laughed and, along with half-dozen fellow teachers, began pushing the truck forward. “See what I mean, everything is tired of marching,” Bourhda said. Both sides have taken to blaming each other for the collapse of the April 13 agreement. During the morning of Tuesday, April 23, the ministry released a statement saying that it had “suspended the meeting… with the coordinations that most represent of teachers.” The ministry stated the decision had been made to cancel the talks after the teacher unions “breached the obligations” they had agreed to by not returning to work by Monday, April 15. The ministry stated that it would “resume dialogue on the condition that teachers return to work.”  In response, teachers’ groups released a statement claiming that the ministry had been the first to breach obligations by continuing to pursue legal action against the protesting contractual teachers. The unions then threatened a blank year, a full 12 months of not reporting to work, if the ministry continued to fight their demands. “The first round of discussions with the ministry was a complete failure,” Zakaria Elkoti, a member of the national CNPCC, told MWN. “The agreement they proposed wasn’t what we wanted because they did not promise integration. That’s why we decided to launch this week’s protests.” As a member of the CNPCC’s Supervising and Follow-Up Committee, Elkoti has been present during the discussions with the ministry and is not surprised with the April 13 agreement. “If they aren’t giving us what we are demanding, then of course we aren’t going to go back,” Elkoti said. “We can’t say yet if a blank year is going to become necessary, but none of us want to do it. If the ministry helped us find a solution today, we will go back tomorrow.” Since 2016, the ministry has been hiring teachers through regional academies under annually renewable contracts to fill the education system’s need for more teachers. Those hired in this manner are known as “contractual teachers.” The contractual teachers receive the same salary, starting at MAD 5,000 ($520) a month, as teachers in the public sector permanently on the government payroll. But their annual contracts include a reduced pension and lead to less job security—the two main reasons many have been protesting. As the protests and strikes have gone on since February 20 and the talks with the ministry have continued to fail, many teacher unions are also demanding that the ministry does not take legal action to fire or suspend the monthly salaries of striking contractual teachers. Representatives from the Ministry of Education declined to comment to MWN.

Rabat – Amid speculations of spite between Rabat and Cairo over Egypt’s position on Western Sahara, the Egyptian ambassador to Morocco has strongly dismissed claims that Egypt is backing the Polisario Front’s self-determination claims. Speaking to Moroccan outlet Le 360, Ambassador Achraf Ibrahim sought to “clarify” Cairo’s position on the Western Sahara dispute, saying that Egypt has never supported Polisario. The outlet describes Ambassador Ibrahim as “very firm and explicit” in his dismissal of claims that his country has been a Polisario backer. The ambassador said, according to Le 360, “Egypt has not and will never recognize what is called Polisario.” When Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi was appointed earlier this year to take charge of the revolving African Union presidency for the 2019-2020 tenure, there were fears that Egypt could undermine the considerable progress Morocco has made within the AU since returning to the organization in January 2017. Those fears were born out of the perception that Morocco did not warmly welcome President el-Sissi’s rise to political power in 2013 through a military intervention to topple the democratically-elected Mohamed Morsi. The suggestion was that President el-Sissi, who had made statements that appeared to lean towards self-determination in Western Sahara, would use his continental leadership to counter Rabat’s African overtures. Also included in the fears was the belief that Egypt is poised to reclaim the MENA and African leadership position it had in the post-colonial period.
Since Morocco has established itself as an indispensable continental player, the argument suggested, Egypt’s continental dreams would undermine or contain Morocco’s expanding clout. Most recently, a Polisario delegation attended an AU conference in Egypt.
The news reinforced the perception is some circles that Egypt was set on undermining Rabat’s recent continental overtures. (In both African and world affairs, the Western Sahara question is the thorniest diplomatic issue for Morocco, the red flag that both countries and companies quickly raise when challenging Moroccan interests.) According to Ambassador Ibrahim, however, the presence of the Polisario delegation in Cairo meant nothing. Rather, he argued, as the chair of the AU, Egypt is restricted in some of its moves in continental issues. The suggestion is that, while Cairo does not support Polisario’s claims, it decided not to spark controversy at the continental level. Some African countries—and the AU in its current Constitution—recognize the Polisario-governed self-styled SADR. “I can assure you that our position on Western Sahara is clear,” Ibrahim declared. He added that it has never been question of “coordination” with Polisario or its supporters. Describing Rabat-Cairo relations as “very strong,” the ambassador revealed that both Egypt and Morocco are actively working on an upcoming visit to Egypt by King Mohammed VI. “When he visited Cairo in January, Bourita and his Egyptian counterpart discussed the preparations for the visit,” he said.

Rabat – Morocco’s national football team manager Herve Renard has opened up about the differences he had with star player Hakim Ziyech in his very first weeks as the Atlas Lions’ head coach. Speaking about his decision in March 2016 not to include Ziyech in his starting lineup but to make him a substitute, Renard argued that they were playing a difficult away game against Cape Verde during the Africa Cup of Nations qualification stage, and he had selected only 18 players. “It was a match typically African that I know its features and I put Hakim Ziyech in the bench because there were only 18 players,” Renard told the RMC Sports television channel. In the home match in Morocco, Renard played Ziyech for only 25 minutes. “He was certainly unhappy. And here I think I made a mistake in that I did not talk to him,” admitted Renard. He added that after the group stage the situation became tense.  “Ziyech came back injured and it gets to the point that I do not select him anymore. But I can say today that [the behavior of] Hakim has nothing to do with [me not picking him],” he explained. He further explained that Ziyech has always had good behavior and never reacted badly. “On the contrary, he remained silent, of course, unsatisfied with his situation, but he remained excellent, and I didn’t talk with him much,” added Renard. A 3-minute heart-to-heart works wonders Ziyech declared in April 2017 that he would never return to the Moroccan squad as long as Renard was the head coach. A year after the Cape Verde game, Renard said that Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) President Fouzi Lekjaa told him he should visit Amsterdam to meet Ziyech and that he had been having a good season. “On the player’s quality, there is nothing to say. He is a very talented player, and he is what we need,” Renard told Lekjaa. In 2017, after speaking to Ziyech for three minutes, the coach stated that everything had been settled. “He wanted to come back because he is so attached to his national team, and I needed him, and I recognized my mistakes. And these mistakes, I’m responsible for them for 99%, and now the problem is more than resolved,” concluded Renard. Ziyech played with the Atlas Lions during their three World Cup games in 2018 and will play in the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) that will kick start on June 21 in Egypt.

Rabat – The Imlil terrorist attack trial will begin on May 2 in Morocco, defence lawyer Saad Sahli told AFP today. Twenty-four defendants will face trial in Sale, a city next to Morocco’s capital Rabat. Twenty-four-year-old Louisa Vesterager Jespersen from Denmark and 28-year-old Norwegian Maren Ueland were killed in the Atlas Mountains near Imlil in December, in what Moroccan authorities described as a criminal and a terrorist act. The defendants will face charges including promoting terrorism, forming a terrorist cell, or causing premeditated harm to persons, Sahli told the news agency. The victims were found in a popular hiking area in the High Atlas Mountains, near Mount Toubkal. Police arrested four main suspects immediately in relation to the incident. A video that circulated on social media, which Norwegian police said they had no reason to doubt, showed the murder of one of the victims. The four suspects had also appeared in separate video footage pledging allegiance to the Islamic State. Moroccan authorities subsequently made a number of other arrests, including Swiss-Spanish national Kevin Zoller Guervos, who appeared in court in February. The Norwegian and Danish embassies assigned a lawyer from Marrakech to both victims’ families for the upcoming trial. The United Kingdom’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office updated it’s Morocco travel advice on March 20, noting the Imlil incident and stating that “terrorists are very likely to carry out attacks in Morocco.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) said it has arrested another suspect in Dakhla, southern Morocco, for his connection with a terror cell dismantled earlier in the day in Sale, Rabat’s twin city. The BCIJ said that the arrest was made in coordination with security services in the city. The Sale cell included six members who had allegedly pledged allegiance to ISIS and were plotting terror attacks across Morocco. Investigations are still ongoing to identify new possible suspects connected to the dismantled cell. The members of the terror cell BCIJ dismantled today are aged 22 and 28. BCIJ’s first statement today about the arrest said that the suspects used to gather in a mosque in Sale to plan terror attacks in Morocco.  The suspects, according to the statement, also tried to learn how to manufacture explosive devices with the aim of using them in terror attacks.Police seized several knives and mobile phones as well as books promoting extremist ideology.

Rabat – Facing widespread controversy for a draft law seeking to replace Arabic with French as the language of instruction for scientific subjects in Moroccan schools, the country’s education minister has issued his strongest defense yet for using French. More than a policy preference, Minister Said Amzazi argued, adopting French would allow Morocco to come to terms with its persisting problem with social inequality. At the same time, Amzazi predicts, as more Moroccan graduates master French, Morocco will become more competitive in the global knowledge market. Amzazi’s defense of French came in a wide-ranging interview with Moroccan outlet Challenge. Speaking about the motives behind Draft Law 51.17, the proposed “Frenchification” law, Amzazi said that shifting to French is necessary because it will help address the negative impact that three decades of Arabization have had on Morocco’s competitiveness in an era of relentless globalization. “Ours is an era of globalization. So we have to either catch the train, or we don’t and then we exclude ourselves from the global dynamics,” Amzazi said. According to the minister, fluency in many languages, and French in particular, will also help open doors for Moroccan graduates. In Amzazi’s assessment, the majority of job offers in the Moroccan labor market require fluency in foreign languages. The result is that only a restricted circle of students can get well-paid and status-enhancing job offers from the mostly French multinational companies operating in Morocco. By continuing to learn scientific subjects in Arabic, Moroccan students will have “the scientific prerequisites,” but they would lack the “necessary soft skills” to function in a changing and globalizing workplace. “French is a precious asset on which we should capitalize at all costs if we want to promote our competitiveness at the global level.” But Amzazi is not exclusively interested in the economic aspect of his policy. From a social equality stance, he argued, Arabization created a feeling of national pride and equality without tackling the country’s socio-economic inequality. “Teaching scientific subjects in foreign languages is an imperative for social justice,” Amzazi claimed. According to the minister, Arabization brought about the internalization of inferiority by students who cannot communicate in French. Arabization, he said, created two Moroccos separated by a socio-economic status often associated with fluency in French. According to Amzazi, even after three decades of Arabization, French has remained the most effective social capital for moving up the Moroccan social ladder. Amzazi also pointed out that years of teaching in Arabic have created a “linguistic fracture” between Moroccan graduates of the immediate aftermath of the independence years and those of the post-Arabization period of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Because they were fluent in French and were taught to master other foreign languages, such as English and Spanish, Amzazi suggested, the first generations of Moroccan elites were equipped to navigate the world without feeling insecure. In addition to their scientific knowledge, they were linguistically prepared to excel nationally and globally. “Ours is an education system that is devaluing scientific fields” by making them less attractive to students who do not master French, since Moroccan universities teach scientific subjects in French, and “creating in our students a genuine sense of linguistic insecurity.” Amzazi cited official statistics: “During the first year at university, one out of four students drop out before the first term.” According to the minister, the linguistic insecurity that most Moroccan students feel accounts for the high rate of college dropouts. Having studied the majority of their formative high school years in Arabic, they enter university unprepared. Amzazi’s position, which many conservative Moroccans have already decried as elitist and a blow to national pride and identity, is set to raise eyebrows among politicians and commentators who see the minister’s policy move as a cultural surrender to France. Abdelilah Benkirane, former chairman of the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD), has been the harshest critic of Amzazi and all circles calling for the adoption of French. According to Benkirane, switching to French will effeminate the honor and pride of Moroccanness. The conservative politician sees faithfulness to Arabization as the final arbiter of Moroccan national pride, calling any prospective adoption of French a crime and a fatal blow to Moroccan values. For all the trenchant criticism, however, Amzazi showed inflexible faith in the necessity of shifting to French to increase Morocco’s competitiveness globally. “What exactly are we asking of our education system?” he asked. “Do we want to train our children in a vacuum in a model predefined for eternity and without regards for the changing world around, or do we rather want them to be equipped to be citizens of the world, capable of integrating themselves in competitive work settings, and having mastery over technological advances impacting all the fields?”

Rabat – Sri Lanka’s defence minister Ruwan Wijewardene has said that the bombs that hit churches and hotels were in retaliation for the Christchurch attacks, which took place on March 15 in New Zealand.  At least 50 people were killed when a terrorist opened fire at two mosques in Christchurch. The Australian suspect in the Christchurch attacks filmed the shooting on a live video on Facebook. On Easter Sunday, April 21, eight bombing attacks killed 321 people and injured more than 500 others in several churches and hotels across Sri Lanka. Police said they have arrested at least 40 suspects as of Tuesday. The country is in national mourning and held a mass funeral for the victims. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Tuesday. On Monday, the Sri Lankan government linked the attacks to the National Thowheed Jamaath, a Muslim movement in the country. One Moroccan, a woman named Hajar, was injured in the attacks. The Moroccan embassy in India said that the Moroccan woman is a flight attendant who works for Saudi Airlines.Hajar, 38, suffered minor injuries, which are not sources of concern, said the Moroccan embassy.

Rabat – Aziz Akhannouch, the minister of agriculture and fisheries has commented on Morocco’s expected agriculture production this year, saying wheat, barley, and durum harvests, the three main cereals in Morocco, will be only average. In response to a question in the House of Representatives on Monday, April 22, Akhannouch stated that “the agricultural production season will be average only for the three types of cereals.” “Production of olives should reach 1.9 million tons, bearing in mind that most of the olive areas are in good condition,” he continued. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries aims to produce 2.5 million tons of olives per year in 2020, under its “Green Morocco Plan.” Akhannouch also noted that Morocco will produce 2.6 million tons of citrus fruit, despite difficulties in the sector. Akhannouch recognized that Morocco received irregular rainfall in the current agricultural season. Morocco recorded 284 millimeters of rainfall to this date, a 12% decrease from a normal year, and dams are at 59% capacity. To promote a successful 2018-2019 agricultural season, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries had ensured the availability of 500,000 tons of fertilizers on the market. In relation to exports, the minister identified that exports of agricultural products are expected to increase by 9%. Citrus exports had already reached 628,000 tons, an increase of 6% from last year.

Rabat – The family of a disappeared ex-security official for Polisario, El Khalil Ahmed, has urged the Polisario Front once again to reveal the fate of their relative. Through a communique, “the coordination of doctor El Khalil Ahmed who disappeared in Algeria in 2009,” condemned Polisario’s silence on the disappearance of the Polisario member. The statement, published by a pro-Polisario news outlet, expressed the concern of the family of El Khalil. The statement added that the family and the coordination have been “holding out hope for the commitments” made by Polisario leader Ibrahim Ghali. “We are extremely shocked because the president did not respect the commitments he made to resolve the issue and did not even give a convincing explanation for this,” said the statement. Under pressure from the family of the disappeared activist, Ghali met a representative of the family in February. He also promised to find out what happened and reveal El Khalil’s fate. For several years, the Sahrawi family has been calling on Algeria and Polisario to explain what happened to El Khalil, who was kidnapped under unknown circumstances in 2009. In February, El Khalil’s family threatened to protest the disappearance of their relative in front of Algerian embassies abroad, including in Paris, Brussels, and Madrid. The family and El Khalil’s friends also launched an international online campaign to draw attention to his disappearance. El Khalil was born in Tan-Tan in southern Morocco. He decided to join Polisario in 1977, where he was tasked to monitor human rights in the Tindouf camps before his disappearance.

Rabat – The Ministry of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education, and Scientific Research said in a statement that it has “suspended the meeting to be held on Tuesday, April 23, 2019, with the coordinations that most represent of teachers.”  The education ministry noted that it made on the grounds that striking teachers “breached the obligations” they agreed to in the April 13 meeting of returning to work on Monday, April 15.  The Coordination of Teachers “Forced into Contracts” (CNPCC), however, blames the education ministry for “flagrantly violating” the April 13 agreement. The teachers’ groups asserted in a statement that the ministry breached the April 13 agreement by “continuing to take legal actions [dismissals] against striking teachers, especially those working in academies in the southern region, and did not postpone professional qualifying examinations.” In response, teachers continued to strike and decided to press ahead with protests until April 25 or longer, threatening to push for a “blank year” of not returning to work for 12 months.  The education ministry also denied CNPCC’s claim that the ministry broke its promises. “Contrary to what has been said, the ministry adhered to what was agreed by suspending all administrative and legal measures taken against teachers.”  The legal measures include the payment of suspended wages, the re-examination of the situation of suspended teachers, and the postponement of professional qualifying examinations. The ministry concluded that there is “no way it could engage in dialogue in the absence of the minimum requirements to negotiate a serious and responsible solution.” It added that it would “resume dialogue on the condition that teachers return to work.”  Teachers’ representatives and the education ministry have held several meetings to work out a solution.  Contractual teachers have been rallying the streets of Moroccan cities since February 20, demanding to be hired into the public sector, the abolishment of fixed-term contracts, and for the government to end “discrimination” between contractual teachers and public sector teachers.

Rabat – The UAE ambassador to Morocco, Ali Salem Al Kaabi, has left the North African country at a “sovereign” Emirati request, according to Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum. The newspaper obtained information from anonymous sources who said that the ambassador left Morocco for the UAE “all of a sudden.” The newspaper added that the Emirati ambassador was appointed a year ago to Morocco without giving further details about the ambassador’s summons home. The state-owned Emirati news agency has not confirmed the withdrawal, but the alleged move comes within the context of rumors of friction between Rabat, Abu Dhabi, and Riyadh. Last week, Morocco’s foreign minister Nasser Bourita completed a tour of five Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia. The minister, however, excluded the UAE from his Gulf tour, leaving room open for further speculation on tension between Rabat and Abu Dhabi. Amid stories of escalating friction, international media reported in February that Morocco had recalled its ambassadors to the Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The reports followed the airing of a documentary by a pro-Saudi government television channel which challenged Morocco’s position on the Western Sahara conflict. The Moroccan government, however, denied that it had recalled its ambassadors from the Gulf states, describing the summoning of its ambassadors as a normal procedure for consultation. Bourita also described Morocco’s diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE as strong and historic, before saying that cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the UAE will from now on depend on reciprocity. “It may happen that we do not agree on certain issues. Foreign policy is a matter of sovereignty, and in Morocco, it is also based on principles and constants,” said Bourita in March before his Gulf tour. The foreign minister said that from “the point of view of Morocco, relations with Gulf countries,” especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE, “have always been deep historical relations.” Two weeks following his statement, Bourita flew to Saudi Arabia and conveyed a “brotherly”  message from King Mohammed VI, suggesting that diplomatic ties between Riyadh-Rabat were as strong as they have always been. Moroccan media also reported that King Mohammed VI is expected to arrive in Saudi Arabia on an official visit on April 24.

Rabat – Sixty Sahrawis living in Tindouf’s Lahmada camp resumed their sit-in in front of the self-styled Sahrawi Ministry of the Interior in Rabouni on Tuesday to complain about tightened restrictions inside the Tindouf camps in Algeria. The Sahrawis protested in early April what they described as Polisario’s “forced detention” and a “violation of the right of movement.” The Sahrawis have carried out several sit-ins and protests throughout the month of April. On Tuesday, April 16, some Sahrawis in Lahmada camp, including women, took part in a sit-in in front of Boujdour prefecture, inside the Tindouf camps, blaming Polisario for obstructing a political solution to the Sahara conflict. Lahmada’s population brought their concerns in protest before the separatist leaders, who were gathering at the headquarters of the self-proclaimed “Sahrawi National Council.” They complained about the degradation of their living situation and tightened restrictions. In March, several Sahrawi MPs conducted a sit-in in front of Polisario’s secretariat to protest widespread corruption in Tindouf camps. In a public statement, the MPs said they are protesting the waste of public money, abuse of authority for personal purposes, absence of accountability, and the prevalence of all kinds of corruption.

Rabat – The Moroccan historian Maati Monjib  said on Monday, April 22, that he would go on a hunger strike in protest of the Institute of African Studies, which threatened to fire him.  The institute, which is affiliated with the Ministry of Education, allegedly accused Monjib of being absent from work since early February. Monjib wrote in a statement that he had received a notice from the education ministry warning him to return to work within seven days.  He noted that he was asked to sign a work resumption letter, which he refused, saying he had not been absent from work. “Signing the letter,” he said, “would mean [admitting] I was absent.” Monjib stated that he would carry out a two-day hunger strike in the presence of activists and politicians.  Monjib said some of his colleagues at the institute are witnesses and have signed testimonials that he was at work. He said the ministry “threatened” to fire him and completely bar him from employment in the public sector.  Not his first hunger strike Monjib, who taught investigative journalism and has links with the Moroccan Association for Investigative Journalism, commented earlier this month on the 2019 report by Reporters without Borders (RSF), which ranked Morocco 135th out of 180 countries for journalist safety.  He claimed that press freedom in Morocco now is the worst it has been since the 1990s, according to Moroccan outlet Alyaoum 24. He argued that the situation of press freedom worsened especially in 2013 with the arrest of Ali Anouzla, the co-founder of the Moroccan news outlet Lakome. As president of the free speech organization Freedom Now, Monjib has expressed views in favor of northern Morocco’s 2016 and 2017 Hirak protests. Amnesty International reported him commenting on one of the Hirak activists, El Mortada Iamrachen, saying he was a “free thinker” convicted for “peacefully expressing his views.” In May 2017, RSF called on Moroccan authorities to drop charges against Monjib and six other activists, who were brought to court on charges of “threatening state security” and “receiving foreign funds.” RSF traced the beginning of the issue to 2015 following training workshops organized by Monjib together with the other six activists on investigative journalism and using an open source online app, called “Story Maker,” that supports citizen journalism. The Index on Censorship, a nonprofit campaigning for freedom of expression, stated that Monjib has since been subject to “much police prosecution” and was banned from travelling in late 2015, for which he went on a hunger strike.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), in cooperation with the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST) has thwarted a drug trafficking operation in Casablanca. BCIJ seized seven tons of hashish resin that was on a cargo truck and MAD 204,630 (approximately $21,000). A statement from the BCIJ said that the operation was part of its efforts to combat organized crime, especially international drug trafficking. Police arrested seven suspects in connection with the drug trafficking operation. Police, according to the statement, will resume their investigation to determine any possible links with international networks. The operation followed a number of raids on drug trafficking networks by Moroccan police.  Earlier this month, Moroccan police and customs in Guerguerat, at the border with Mauritania, seized 11 tons and 940 kilograms of cannabis on a truck bound for an “African country.” In March,  police seized 1.675 tons of Cannabis resin in Fez.  Police also seized 13 tons and 750 kilograms of hashish in Tangier Med Port. In December 2018, BCIJ  busted an international cocaine trafficking ring and seized one ton of cocaine.  In 2018, Moroccan security services seized 1.65 tons of cocaine, over 1.3 million psychotropic and ecstasy pills, 52 tons of cannabis resin, and 693 kilograms of cannabis. Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said last year that Morocco prosecuted 107,000 people in 2017 in drug cases, an increase from 36,000 people per year during the previous decade. In addition to its work against drug trafficking across Morocco, BCIJ also plays a leading role in fighting terrorism.

Rabat – The Moroccan Bar Association (ABAM) has called for an investigative committee to examine rights infringements in the trials of protesters from several movements across Morocco, including the Hirak Rif, Jerada, and Zagora. The remarks were made at the 30th General Conference of ABAM in Fez. In the general statement of the conference, ABAM noted that the trials had several violations of fair trial rights. In the last year, courts have sentenced protesters involved in several movements to prison terms. In the Hirak Rif, activists protested against social disparities; in the eastern Jerada protests, locals took to the streets after informal minors died when illegal mines collapsed.   In October 2017, locals in the southeastern city of Zagora were protesting lack of drinking water. ABAM called on the National Council for Human Rights (CNDH) “to carry out its functions as a constitutional institution in accordance with the Paris Principles in dealing with the human rights files and unfair trials and the several forms of torture and inhuman treatment the detainees were subjected to.” They highlighted the need for ABAM’s practical involvement in drafting and ratifying all legislation, especially the Civil Procedure Code, the Criminal Procedure Law, the Judicial Organization Act, and the Non-Constitutional Payment Act. They also called for the adoption of substantive and constitutional criminal legislation that takes into account the Constitution, Morocco’s human rights obligations, and the Havana Declarations on Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers. In particular, the bar noted the right of the accused to obtain effective legal assistance in the pre-trial research stage. The conference also called for a revision of the Family Code, saying paragraph 3 should be removed from Article 45. The paragraph stipulates that a wife who refuses polygamy is divorced by the court. The bar also said Morocco should repeal Article 16 of the Family Code which only recognizes marriages if the couple has notified the court of their marriage within a certain period of time. Third, the Moroccan lawyers called for the abolition of Article 19, which authorizes the marriage of a minor if there is a waiver, the adoption of the right of nannies to travel freely with children without permission, and for the law to consider a woman’s work within the house as a contribution to the family’s funds.

Rabat – Private doctors in Morocco have announced they will no longer accept reimbursements from the National Fund of Social Welfare Organizations (CNOPS) for cesarean operations. “Our position on this matter is firm” Doctor Hachem Tyal, the deputy director of the National Association of Private Clinics told Morocco World News. The National Coordination of Private Doctors (CNMP) announced in a press release on April 20 that “from 1st May 2019, for reasons beyond their control, gynecologists will no longer accept reimbursements from CNOPS.” Patients receiving c-sections will now have to pay clinics upfront for the surgery’s full cost, and it will be their responsibility to seek reimbursement from CNOPS. CNMP’s  decision is a direct response to recent changes by CNOPS in its c-section reimbursement procedure. The changes angered doctors who claim CNOPS is accusing them of performing unnecessary cesareans. Doctors also claim that CNOPS is attempting to control the cesarean birth rate. In a press release on April 17, CNOPS announced that from May 1, all cesareans performed without a medical justification would be reimbursed at the same rate as a natural delivery. CNOPS also introduced more stringent reimbursement requirements.  Cesarean providers seeking CNOPS reimbursements would have to provide a document identifying the reasons for the cesarean, a risk-benefit analysis of the procedure and the conditions of its delivery, stated CNOPS in the press release.  High rate of cesareans According to CNOPS, the new requirements come in response to the “abnormally high rate of cesareans” in Morocco. In 2017, CNOPS counted 30,583 births, of which 18,522, or 61%, were by cesarean. In 2013, cesareans accounted for 35% of births. Spending by CNOPS on cesareans increased from MAD 13 million ($1.3 million) in 2013 to MAD 130 million in 2017 ($13 million). According to Tyal, these numbers are biased.  “The cesarean numbers recorded by the CNOPS are completely biased. Many women in Morocco do not have access to CNOPS so these numbers do not take into account the high number of natural births for which no CNOPS reimbursement is claimed. These numbers do not reflect the real childbirth situation in Morocco,” Tyal told MWN. Aziz Khorsi, head of communication at CNOPS told Morocco World News that the CNOPS statistics do only reflect patients covered by CNOPS. He added, however, that “the cesarean statistics are worrying.” “The reimbursement procedure has not changed significantly. All we are requiring is a medical report.” The World Health Organization considers the ideal rate for cesareans to be between 10% and 15% of births. In its press release, CNOPS also cited a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, noting that non-necessary medical procedures and “wastages” account for 20% of spendings on health. Doctors have expressed anger about this comment, saying CNOPS is suggesting gynecologists in Morocco are performing unnecessary cesareans. “This is pure and simple defamation. The CNOPS must not make allegations that gynecologists are crooks,”  Tyal complained.  Tyal wants the CNOPS to reconsider the changes it has made to the reimbursement policy. “CNOPS is not here to control the rate of cesarean births. It makes no sense. This is a medical decision to be taken by the doctors,” he said.  “CNOPS must reconsider its position. CNOPS is threatening the health of mothers and children and it’s comments towards gynecologists are defamatory.” The National Association of Private Clinics is meeting with the Minister of Health this morning to discuss the issue.

A video posted by 2M showed that BCIJ seized several knives, a camera, and several mobile phones. The operation followed a similar raid from BCIJ, which dismantled a four-member terror cell in Taza, 120 kilometers east of Fez. Morocco’s Ministry of Interior announced that the extremist terror cell is led by a former terrorist who was active in conflict zones in Iraq and Syria. BCIJ also dismantled a six-member terror cell on March 14. Throughout the year, BCIJ dismantled several terror cells.  The success of the security forces against ISIS has gained Morocco a strong reputation for security and anti-terrorism. Morocco has strengthened its security strategies since  2003 after the terror Casablanca attacks and the 2011 terror attack in Marrakech.

Rabat – Algerian authorities arrested five billionaire businessmen on Monday, April 22, who were allegedly closely allied to the ousted Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. According to Algerian state television, an Algerian court is investigating the five billionaires on allegations of corruption.  One of the five is Issad Rebrab, CEO of the Cevital industrial group and one of the wealthiest men in Algeria.  In 2015, Forbes named Rebrab the wealthiest man in North Africa, with a worth of $3.2 billion.  Four brothers of the Kouninef family are also under arrest. According to France 24, the family “is hugely influential and the four brothers have dealings in everything from agribusiness to civil engineering.” The anti-corruption crackdown came after army chief Ahmed Gaid Salah stated it was possible ruling elites could be prosecuted on corruption charges.  The arrests are also coming after Algerians continued protesting  for the ninth consecutive week since February 22, calling for a radical regime change. A loyal ally of Bouteflika, former Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, is also being investigated on charges of misuse of public money. In early April, Algerian authorities also arrested tycoon Ali Haddad at the Tunisian border.  Demonstrators have been calling for the removal of men they are calling the three B’s: Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah; Interim Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui; and the head of the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) party, Moad Bouchareb.

Rabat – The Algerian Ministry of the Interior has revealed a list of 24 Algerians who want to run for the July 4 election after the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. “The provisional balance sheet of the submission of individual signature application forms for applicants to the candidacy for the election of the presidency of the republic … has twenty-four letters of intent filed,” the ministry said in a statement published by Algeria’s official news agency APS. The statement said that the candidates “were able to benefit from quotas of subscription forms, in application of the legal provisions in force.” Election plans are proceeding “in good conditions,” added the statement. The ministry’s announcement comes on the heel of continuous mass protests against the current government run by Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah, a loyalist to Bouteflika. Throughout the protests, the army has made multiple arrests and purged military officers, investigating them for corruption. An Algerian court summoned former Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, who resigned moments after Bouteflika did, for an investigation. The current finance minister, Mohamed Loukal, was also summoned, international media reported yesterday. The two officials are under investigation for “dissipation of public money” and “illegal privilege.” Friday marked the beginning of the ninth week of mass protests against Bouteflika. Hundreds of thousands of Algerian citizens shouted slogans against the current government demanding radical change. Some political activists are also urging protesters to boycott the election. Dozens of Algerian mayors supporting the Algerian “hirak” movement said they will boycott the July 4 election. The mayors’ decision followed the announcement of Algerian magistrates, who are also threatening to boycott the election. Algeria’s opposition Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD) party said it supported the Algerian hirak, emphasizing that all of its elected personnel would refuse to “organize the election.”

Rabat – Following the government’s announcement to turn back clocks from GMT+1 to GMT for the holy month of Ramadan, Morocco’s flag carrier Royal Air Maroc (RAM) has reminded its customers to set their clocks one hour back.  Royal Air Maroc said in a press release that the timing of its flights will advance one hour. It will take effect on May 5 at 3 a.m. for all arriving and departing flights at Moroccan airports and will run until June 9 at 2 a.m.  “In this regard, our customers are kindly asked to arrive on time for the check in, at least three hours prior to take-off time,” announced RAM.  For further inquiry on flight schedules, customers are also invited to use the newly-launched chatbot on WhatsApp at RAM’s national number, 089000 0800, or international number, +212522489797.  According to the astronomer Hicham Al Issaoui, Ramadan is to expected to start on May 7 as confirmed by the Ministry of Endowments and Islamic affairs on Sunday, April 7.  The government’s abrupt decision to adopt GMT+1 around the year just two days after Moroccans were to set their clocks back to winter time has angered many Moroccans. In 2017, a group of activists launched a petition calling on the government to drop daylight savings time.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI is expected to arrive in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, April 24. During his visit, which the royal cabinet has not confirmed, the King will discuss several regional issues with the Saudi royal family, including the Libyan crisis and the Israeli-Arab conflict. The monarch will also fly to Jordan on April 26, a source told a Moroccan outlet. “The two countries are preparing to receive the King of Morocco for talks related to the latest developments on the Arab scene, including the dangerous crisis in Libya and the Arab-Israeli conflict,” the source added. The King’s visit to Jordan comes shortly after Jordanian King Abdullah II visited Morocco in March. During his visit, the two monarchs issued a joint statement on their discussions. Among the topics discussed were the Palestinian cause and the Syrian crisis. Both monarchs also expressed determination to strengthen diplomatic ties. King Mohammed VI’s possible visit to Saudi Arabia comes at a time during rumors of friction between Rabat and Riyadh. In the past two months, local and international media reported that Morocco recalled its ambassadors from both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi because of the two Gulf countries’ positions on Morocco’s interests, including its territorial integrity. Morocco denied the rumors, emphasizing that its diplomatic ties with the UAE and Saudi Arabia are strong and historic. There have also been formal letter exchanges and phone conversations between King Mohammed VI and  King Salman of Saudi Arabia. The first formal phone conversation came from King Salman, who called for a discussion on Saudi-Morocco relations. During the phone call, King Salman requested Morocco review their “brotherly relationship.” The latest move came from the Moroccan monarch, who sent a “brotherly” message to Saudi Arabia earlier this month. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita conveyed the message while on a tour of Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait.

Rabat – Moroccan students studying in Rabat and Fez have just completed the construction of two nano-satellites that will be launched into space in May to study the ozone layer and climate change. The students are from the National School of Computer Science and Systems Analysis in the Mohammed V University in Rabat and the Private University of Fez. According to Dr. Ouazzani Jamil Mohammed, the dean of the faculty of engineering sciences at the Private University of Fez, the team that built the satellites was composed of five students and a professor. The construction of the project took more than two months. The KSF Space Foundation announced it will be providing a space capsule that will be used to launch the neo-satellites into space. Satellites built by students from universities in India, Mexico, and the United Kingdom will be launched alongside the ones from Morocco. “Innovation is growing all over the world. Our foundation has an initiative that aids universities and developing countries that are building space programs,” Dr. Mohamed Kayyali, chairman of the foundation, told Morocco World News. “We want to encourage people, universities and countries to keep going for such great initiatives.  The capsule the foundation will be providing is a meter tall and weighs roughly 10 kilograms. Its exact cost and the materials used to build it are confidential.  “The materials we used to build the capsule will allow it to withstand all of the external pressures it will face in the upper atmosphere and in space,” Kayyali said. The payload for this space mission will weigh approximately 50 kilograms. It will include the five nano-satellites, a high-definition imaging system, and additional climate change sensors. The launch of the capsule is expected to take place during the third week of May, but according to Kayyali, that is subject to change because of the weather. The launch site is in the coastal city of Chennai, in northern India. International dignitaries, including the Moroccan ambassador to India, are expected to attend. After the launch, the two Moroccan universities will work alongside the other universities to analyze the scientific data the satellites collect. Their research will be in collaboration with the International Federation of Global and Green Information Communication Technology (IFGICT) based in North America. “The IFGICT are the best people to analyze this data because they’ll make sure the information is understandable and they will make it available to the public,” Kayyali said. According to Kayyali, the KSF foundation is currently planning on launching another space mission in October 2019. This mission, which Kayyali hopes universities will be a part of, will include the foundation’s first biological cell testing in zero gravity. But its main mission will continue to be studying climate change. “Climate change is an issue that the entire world will need to face,” Kayyali said. “Supporting projects from universities and developing countries will benefit everyone from everywhere.”  ——— This story was updated on April 22, 2019 to include original statements from Dr. Mohamed Kayyali, chairman of the KSF Space Foundation. It was updated again on April 26 to include information provided by Dr. Ouazzani Jamil Mohammed, the dean of the faculty of engineering sciences at the Private University of Fez.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Culture Mohamed Laaraj has overseen the opening of a new museum at Lixus, an ancient Phoenician archeological site dating to the 12th century B.C. The Ministry of Culture opened the new facility on Saturday, April 20. Built in the 12th century B.C. by Phoenicians and regarded as one of the oldest urban centers in North Africa, Lixus has undergone restoration and is now open to the public along with a visitor center.  The Roman empire captured the Phoenician settlement in the 1st century B.C. With the Roman empire’s decline, the Amazigh (Berber) people lived at Lixusz from the 5th to the 7th centuries A.D. before it was completely abandoned, according to the World Monuments Fund. Spread over 62 hectares, Lixus, Laaraj said, opens a new era in the management of archaeological sites. Speaking about the historical significance of Lixus, Laaraj said the ministry has a “great responsibility that requires an appropriate approach to preserve its authenticity for the benefit of future generations.” Lixus, which Pliny the Elder linked to the Garden of Hesperides where the Greek hero Hercules picked the golden apples, is situated on Tchemmich Hill on the eastern bank of the Loukkos valley near the seaport town of Larache on the Atlantic coast of northern Morocco, 80 kilometers south of Tangier. The restoration projects carried out by the ministry in partnership with foreign institutions, like the Italian embassy and the University of Siena, aimed to “raise awareness” of the importance of safeguarding Lixus’s history, which had sunk into “oblivion,” noted the minister.  Laaraj added that the site boasts important artifacts and stands out as a “universal heritage.” The new museum contains two exhibition halls that display Phoenician, Mauritanian, Roman, and late Islamic archeological artifacts.  The ministry spent approximately MAD 12 million ($1.2 million) rehabilitating the site. The opening of the site to the public falls within the framework of Heritage Month, which Morocco celebrates between March and April every year.

Rabat – The fifth Jidar Street Art Festival will be back in Rabat April 22-28. Organized by the Artistic and Cultural Education-L’Boulvart (EAC-L’Boulvart) Association, the festival will bring 12 local and international artists to Rabat, who will use building facades throughout the city as open-air canvases for large-scale murals. The festival will also include opportunities to meet the artists, a number of masterclasses for students of the National School of Architecture (ENA), and a half-day art workshop open to the broader public. The theme of this year’s festival is “childhood,” celebrating spontaneous creativity and imagination through abstract ideas, colors, and forms. The festival seeks to bring artists, the general public, cultural bodies, and local structures together to “rethink the world, and re-think the city, as well as relationships with public spaces” states EAC-L’Boulvart in its press release on the festival. The festival will host artists from Morocco, such as Machima, a digital artist based in Casablanca, as well as international artists like Phlegm, a world-renowned British cartoonist and illustrator, and Caratoes, a Belgian-born contemporary artist who currently lives in Hong Kong.  The building facades chosen for this year’s festival are spread throughout Rabat and include facades of the Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art.  The museum has made available six facades of its building for street-art. Each year during the festival, artists will paint two facades of the museum on a rotating basis, bringing urban and contemporary art together.  The festival also includes a collective street-art project, where students from different art schools across Morocco will have the opportunity to work together on one large mural, under the guidance of Canadian artist Danae. Morocco has a growing street-art culture, and a number of companies now offer street-art tours in major Moroccan cities.

Rabat – One Moroccan woman was among the injured of a series of blasts targeting several churches and hotels across Sri Lanka. The Moroccan embassy in India announced that the 38-year-old Moroccan is a flight attendant working for Saudi Airlines. The Moroccan woman was injured by a bomb that hit a hotel in the city of Colombo. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) quoted the embassy saying that “following the terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka, the Moroccan Embassy in India also accredited to Sri Lanka, has contacted the authorities in the country to take the necessary measures and provide assistance to the Moroccan national.” The embassy sent a representative and a doctor to Sri Lanka to visit the victim to assess her state of health and ensure she receives help. Her medical report indicated she is suffering minor injuries, which are not sources of concern. The statement added that the embassy transferred the woman from the public hospital to a clinic to give her better medical care. Authorities in Sri Lanka announced that 290 people died and 500 were injured in the series of bombs. International media reported that police arrested 24 suspects in connection with the blasts. A series of eight bomb blasts hit several churches and hotels on Sunday during the Easter celebration. Sri Lanka’s Minister of Economic Reforms and Public Distribution Harsha de Silva, commented on the attacks via Twitter saying, “Horrible scenes. I saw many body parts strewn all over. Emergency crews are at all locations in full force.We took multiple casualties to hospital. Hopefully saved many lives.” Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe also denounced the attacks, calling on people to remain united and strong. “I strongly condemn the cowardly attacks on our people today. I call upon all Sri Lankans during this tragic time to remain united and strong,” he said. The government spokesperson, Rajitha Senaratne, linked the attacks to the National Thowheed Jamaath, a Muslim movement in the country. According to Al Jazeera, the attackers were Sri Lankan nationals. Senaratne added that police had been “aware of information” of possible attacks during Easter. Several world leaders condemned the attack on Sri Lanka, including King Mohammed VI, who sent condolences to the people and president of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena.

Rabat – The sound of rain was drowned out by the chants of hundreds of protestors at this year’s first major march in support of Hirak Rif prisoners in Morocco, following a controversial court decision. Slogans such as “No liberty, no peace” and “Stand with Hirak Rif” rattled the gates of Parliament as dozens of protesters waving Amazigh (Berber) flags rallied in front of the building in Rabat. The protest was sparked by the Casablanca Court of Appeals’ decision to uphold the sentences of 54 Hirak activists who have been in prison since June 2018—activists were given sentences varying from one to 20 years. Following the court’s April 5 decision, more than a dozen organizations began planning the march, each one calling for all of its members to join the protest. “It is great so many organizations are working together because we are giving the people a unified front,” Merieme Maskar, an organizer for the Moroccan Association of Human Rights (AMDH)  told Morocco World News (MWN). “If we keep protesting together that gives all of the prisoners a better chance of being freed.” The majority of the political prisoners who are from Al Hoceima, a northern Moroccan province, identify as Amazigh. To show solidarity with their imprisoned kin, several Amazigh rights groups marched alongside the AMDH. “They are Amazigh just like us. All they did was exactly what we are doing now, fight for basic human rights,” Meryam Demnati, an activist for the Observatory of Amazigh Rights and Liberties, told MWN. “We are marching for every Amazigh prisoner and are demanding their liberty because their liberty is our liberty.” The streets of Rabat weren’t the only ones filled with protests this weekend. On Saturday, April 20, roughly 250 protestors in the Netherlands took to the streets of The Hague, denouncing the continued imprisonment of the activists for the first time since the recent appeal denial. “We demand the immediate release of all Hirak Rif prisoners,” Mohammed Talhaoui, a politician for the Dutch Labour Party and member of the Rif Project, told MWN. “If the entirety of the EU demands the Moroccan government to release the prisoners, it would only be a matter of hours until they do so.” Talhaoui, whose parents are from the Rif Region, says many Moroccans in the Netherlands feel a strong connection to the movement. “We hope that the protests we are organizing here act as a wake up call to the Dutch government and the European Union to bring an end to these human right violations,” Talhaoui said. On April 3, days before the appeal failed, 25 members of the European Parliament signed a letter that was delivered to Morocco’s justice minister Mohammed Aujjar. The document expressed their concern “about the conditions of imprisonment of all the activists of the popular movement of the Rif, especially Nasser Zafzafi.” Zafzafi, one of the Hirak leaders, who was a finalist for Europe’s 2018 Zakharov Prize for Freedom of Conscience, has experienced several health issues while in prison. The same parliament members have also summoned Morocco’s ambassador to the Netherlands to discuss the court’s decision. This request is pending the approval of the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Stef Blok who, during his last visit to the Kingdom, spoke out against the sentencing. At a press conference during his visit, Blok pointed out the unresponsiveness of Moroccan officials during the Rif uprisings, suggesting that the government and its apparatus had not been “effective in responding to the grievances of the people who took to the streets.” Along with the European Parliament members, more than 300 people from political parties, organizations, and labor unions have signed an international petition condemning the court’s decisions. Organizations from eight countries across Europe and North Africa signed the petition. The Committee to Support the Rifan Movement in Paris published the petition on April 12 on the Jewish-French Union for Peace website, demanding the immediate release of the Hirak activist.  In 2018, 54 Hirak activists were convicted of “threatening state security” following their participation in the 2016-17 Hirak Rif protests in Al Hoceima. The massive demonstrations were sparked by the death of Mohcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was killed in a garbage truck while trying to retrieve his confiscated fish. The Hirak Rif protestors, in addition to seeking justice in the form of an investigation into the death of Fikri, also protested political conditions and demanded reforms such as demilitarization of the northern Rif region, shared governance in investment and infrastructure planning, the release of political prisoners, and respect for Amazigh identity. The Moroccan government quelled the 10-month long demonstration by arresting hundreds of protestors, including the movement’s leadership.

Rabat – Academic and author from the University of Birmingham Chris Allen has correctly discarded this thesis. He argues that it’s extremely dangerous because it ultimately legitimises indolent stereotypes which describe all Muslims as terrorists. And it plays into racist views held by individuals and parts of the media. It amalgamates Islam, terrorism, and all Muslims, which means that the faith is viewed as a threat. A study conducted by Pew Research found that, even in more supposedly liberal countries such as France, nearly half of respondents thought that some Muslims supported the Islamic State and its aims. Other research has found that a majority of people in several European countries – among them Poland and Austria – supported a ban on immigration from majority-Muslim countries. In my book, New Horizons of Muslim Diaspora in Europe and North America, I explored how people living in Muslim societies view this growing prejudice. I also interviewed numerous Muslims: some were still living in majority Muslim countries in North Africa and the Middle East; others had emigrated to Western countries. I found that Islamophobia has changed how certain Muslims portray themselves to society. The people I interviewed considered themselves targeted and vilified by Islamophobia; many hid their Muslim beliefs and identity or pretended to be less devout than they really were – some women, for instance, have stopped wearing the veil. My respondents felt that Muslims in Western countries aren’t treated fairly. They also worried that the rise of Islamophobia had badly damaged Islam as a religion of peace. The book argues against an approach to the concept of culture that reduces all Muslims to one category. Such a reductive approach ignores other important factors that shape the attitudes and behaviours of Muslims all over the world. These factors include their socioeconomic status, their gender, age, level of education, social class; as well as their attitudes to religion and to Western lifestyles. I interviewed 116 people and held less formal conversations with more than 100. They lived in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, France, the UK, Germany, Italy, the US and Canada. Those living outside majority-Muslim countries were heterogeneous: they had diverse cultures and ethnicities. They were actually divided, rather than united, on issues related to Islam and to their new, Western homes. The most conservative, traditional Muslims in the diaspora tend to be marginalised. They don’t work, or work low-income jobs. Many turn to religion and traditional values and practices as a reaction to their socio-economic exclusion from European or American society. But the majority of people I interviewed described themselves as only moderately religious. They were open to other cultures and principles such as secularism. Governments in Europe and North America should be working with such people to reach others who could be taught about a moderate, progressive approach to Islam rather than one that tends towards extremism. It has already been shown that Muslim Europeans and Americans are often the first to respond to radicalism – by rejecting it. They could be drawn into programmes to help new arrivals in Western countries adapt and learn about their new cultures. This is especially important because I found in my book that many Muslim leaders have an insufficient knowledge of Western countries, and find it hard to fight Islamophobic propaganda. Likewise, most imams in the West do not master the language of the host country. This makes it difficult for them to explain moderate Islam to the Western societies and to fight against Islamophobia and youth radicalisation among the Muslim diaspora. Younger, more open-minded Muslims could fulfil a valuable role in integration and in teaching non-Muslims about the religion.

Rabat – Mustapha El Khalfi, the government’s spokesperson, denied that the Cabinet will delegate the issue regarding contractual teachers to the Ministry of Interior. After the weekly government council, El Khalfi told the press that the dossier of the contractual teachers is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education only. “No third party intervenes on this issue, whose management is based solely on the Ministry of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education and Scientific Research,” asserted El Khalfi. Earlier this week, the contractual teachers announced their decision to extend their strike for another week. The announcement came a day after the Ministry of Education announced that it had reached an agreement with the contractual teachers, who promised to resume their work starting Monday, April 15. Despite the official announcement, some contractual teachers’ Facebook page posts indicated that no such agreement had been reached between them and the Ministry. Moroccan television channel 2M reported that the contractual teachers will begin a new round of dialogue with the Ministry on April 23. The teachers, who describe themselves as “forcibly contractual educators,” are seeking permanent jobs and equity with other teachers in the public sector. In 2016, the Moroccan government began hiring teachers under annually renewable contacts every year.

Rabat – Algerian authorities summoned former Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, a loyalist to former Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Ouyahia is being investigated for alleged  “dissipation of public money” and “illegal privilege.” In addition to Ouyahia, an Algerian court also summoned current Finance Minister Mohamed Loukal. The investigations are being held amid mass protests against  the current government and elites, who governed the country during Bouteflika’s  rule. Friday, April 19 marked the ninth week of protests, which started on February 22. The protests led to the resignation of several senior officials, including the former president of the Constitutional Council, Tayeb Belaiz. Protesters are now calling on Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah to leave as they are demanding radical change in the system. Facing pressure due to continuous protests, army chief Gaid Salah called on protesters to remain patient and to refrain from chanting “unrealistic” slogans before the coming election, which will take place on July 4. He said that time is “running out” to end the escalating crisis in the country before elections. Salah asserted that “all options are open in the pursuit of overcoming the different difficulties” to end the crisis “as soon as possible.”

Maitre Gims has expressed his love towards Morocco and King Mohammed VI during several interviews before. In October 2017, the singer said that “the King of Morocco has become a friend, someone who is close to me, someone who helped me a lot and who has presented Morocco to me in a different angle,” he said. Marrakech is a top holiday destination of many celebrities. Earlier this month, Real Madrid’s stars, Karim Benzema, Carvajal, and Asensio have all been seen enjoying Morocco’s ochre city. In addition to Maitre Gims and Maluma, several Moroccan international including Saad Lamjarred and Ahmed Chaouki filmed some of their music videos in the city of Marrakech.

Rabat – Moroccan international football star Hakim Ziyech said he is “always very picky” in response to offers he receives  from football giants. Ziyech, who plays for Dutch football club Ajax Amsterdam, has commented on whether he will leave his team for one of the football teams interested in hiring him next summer. The 26-year old footballer, however, hinted that he might stay with his current football club leaving room for speculation about his future. Quoted by sports news outlet Goal, Ziyech said that he is “always someone who is very picky.” “Anything is possible. There must be a club that I want to trade in for Ajax. That doesn’t just happen,” he added. Earlier this month, 90.com reported that several football giants including Bayern Munich, Chelsea, and Arsenal are interested in hiring the Moroccan footballer Ziyech joined Ajax in 2017, and has a contract with them until the end of the 2020-21 season.

By Afifa Hassainate Rabat – It was a nice warm winter afternoon in Marrakech when, as part of an international film festival, we decided to watch a movie and searched for one with so-called real deep art. We had already been through a “colonized” red carpet and tried to discuss our Moroccan culture in the French style as we must stay faithful to art and society.  Someone then proposed the movie “Volubilis.” As I was born a Meknessi, a native of Meknes, the city 30 kilometers south of ancient ruins of Volubilis, I thought to myself, “What can a producer make out of a beautiful yet abandoned city? Can it be an actual real piece of art?”  Faouzi Bensaidi’s “Volubilis” is the story of a woman, the story of a man, and the story of a lost city. But it is a city that is found in the eyes of some artists, writers, and historians. Bensaidi, the movie’s director, gives us a piece of art, images that took our breath away, deep dialogues, and scenes that entice desires while holding back.  The movie highlights a woman, Malika, a working class girl who just got married and who is trying to live and to love within a world of ugliness and poverty. Living in an abandoned city, the characters are also abandoned. Nevertheless, like everyone else her age, Malika wanted to discover, to see what was behind and before her. Her eyes expressed an amazing depth, and they also sank with secret pain. After all, we all aspire to experience and uncover hidden meanings. The story went on, and other women came into the picture: Rich, elegant, and refined women who make up high society, drinking champagne while bathing in exquisite pools, a pond where many feminist thoughts were stuck, as Virginia Woolf put it. There, Malika throws away her “pink” working apron when she feels humiliated by all the others. It was an act of anger, a refusal to be put down and stepped upon. But at the same time, it was like removing her feminine side. If a woman is tired of life, she is simultaneously tired of herself. “Volubilis” surely recalls images from previous art pieces and the struggle to survive. The moment Abdulkader was violated was reminiscent of the scene of the storm in King Lear. Though he was not a real King, he believed he was as the head of security at La Belle Vie mall.  Ultimately, it is about the battle between good and evil, the idea of the subaltern, the lower, trying to speak and voice his side of the story.

Rabat – Hicham Lasri is a Moroccan filmmaker who, even at an early age, had released many television and cinematic works. The majority of his works raise controversy, which is especially clear in his capsules on YouTube, like “No Vaseline Fatoua” and “Bessara Overdose.” With “Jahiliya,” Lasri made his fourth participation in the Berlin film festival last year. Lasri is a prolific filmmaker, typically making one feature-length film per year. His pieces include “The End,” “The Sea is Behind,” and “Starve Your Dog.”  In an hour-long telephone interview with Morocco World News, Lasri opened up about his childhood, his inspirations, and his ambitions for the future. You studied law before you moved to script writing and film directing. When did your passion for cinema start?  I was brought up in a family interested in culture and art. My parents’ love of music, theater, and painting encouraged me to express myself and my artistic interests. I started painting at the age of three. Read Also: A Burqa Mini-Skirt? Hicham Lasri Releases ‘Girl Power’ Video Trilogy My love for cinema appeared when I used to watch movies; this hobby was an obstacle that challenged me to make my own cinematic work. At that time, I was writing some plays and some film scripts. I also attended many scriptwriting and cinematography workshops around the world for about five years. As there weren’t institutes of cinema in Morocco, I came up with new ideas to allow more creativity in the field of the cinema. What is the link between scriptwriting and filmmaking for TV as well as YouTube capsules?  I think that all my works gather around challenging the society and the real life in order to be different and get out of the ordinary concepts. For me, the important thing is creativity for the sake of creativity, philosophically speaking. You have to know that the idea of capsules took me back to the internet which I cut down for about five years. This virtual world is very important nowadays, because it provides me with the needed materials, especially in my job. As you know, I belong to a generation that suffered a great deal. For example, if you needed a book to read, you had to go to a library which was far away. In other words, it was time and energy consuming. I used to record my favorite music tracks on tapes of 60 or 90 minutes. Read Also: Moroccan Director’s ‘Al Jahiliya’ Film Screens at Cairo Film Festival I used all the books I read and music I listened to to create my own cinematographic working style. Therefore, I chose to go back to the world of the internet and thus, the idea of comic capsules emerged. Why are your films not screened in local cinemas, festivals and some language and cultural centres?  I have a personal conviction that I believe in my own work. I prefer screening my films in international festivals to be watched by thousands of people from different countries in very good circumstances, I mean new cinemas that use new technologies, that allow the spectators to enjoy the film more rather than to be presented in an area that lacks the minimum equipment, such as the sound system or the image.  My works are not designed to be commercialized. My purpose is that my films could travel around the world. I make a lot of effort, I read a lot to come up with something very special in every single work. Your long films deal with stories from the 70s, 80s, and 90s like the death of King Hassan II and the “baguette crisis.” Are you trying to reconstruct scenes from your childhood or are you simply in love with those periods?   I consider every film of those periods as a recovery from past wounds and suffering. I tried to mix between the suffering and the happy and glorious moments, such as the victory of Said Aouita and Nawal Moutaoukel … Through these heroes we live the moments. However I consider my childhood as a happy and peaceful one. Of course, not all the moments were happy, but I had that feeling of love and protection within my family. Your capsules on the internet raise a lot of controversy. What is the purpose behind them?   The digital world is a big field of experiments that work on new characters, just like the writings of Oscar Wild were based on mocking some behaviors and convictions.  So through “no Vaseline Fatoua” we tried to mock those people who consider themselves as religious advisors that have never been to school or done any religious training. So, I invite them to start education which is one of the pillars of the Islamic religion.  Are you moving toward creating a modern type of cinema that is not based on the dialogue itself, but based on different components to the successful script?   Relying on the dialogue is not always considered as a problem, because there are many outstanding film directors that were interested in the dialogue in their films like Sydney Lumet. But one should not rely too much on the dialogue, because it will create a problem in the dramatology as Alfred Hitchcock said. Generally speaking, a good film depends on characters, not on dialogues, because the deleted items from a script are more important than the remaining ones.    You have given the first roles to some Moroccan actors like Hassan Badida and Malek Akhmiss and Saleh Bensaleh. What did you notice as special in these actors?   I consider these actors as people who accepted the challenge as the roles they played depended on physical efforts. They are really hard working; with their help we break the Moroccan stereotypes in filmmaking, and we go beyond the concrete towards something unusual.

Rabat – The traditional dish of couscous continues to span borders and boundaries in North Africa, where conflicts divide. Couscous remains at the foundation of food culture in Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania, and Tunisia. Recently, the four North African countries overcame their differences and came together in a joint bid to give UNESCO heritage status to couscous. Joining forces to preserve couscous UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage list highlights the world’s most treasured cultural practices. In 2016, Algeria announced a bid to get protected status for couscous, which sparked outrage from Moroccans who felt the dish was theirs as well. This time around, four ambassadors, from Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania, and Tunisia, joined to file the application, an act of comradery and coexistence in a time of division. Morocco’s ambassador to UNESCO, Zohour Alaoui, asserted that the joint Maghreb bid underscores “the knowledge and the know-how of the practices related to the production and the consumption of couscous.” The move was an effort “to devote the tremendous wealth the Berber culture transmitted, not only to the Maghreb countries but also in Africa, the Mediterranean, and today in the world as a whole.” Fatema Hal, a Moroccan-born anthropologist, says UNESCO recognition would be a positive step for the region. “If couscous can help bring them together, all the better,” she said. “But rather than putting all our energy into trying to get a label, we should be doing what’s necessary to preserve our cuisine.”  Le Couscous ferment de l’unité maghrébine. Les ambassadeurs d’Algérie, du Maroc, de Mauritanie et de Tunisie à l’@UNESCO ont signé et déposé ce matin le dossier de son inscription comme patrimoine immatériel universel. Vive le Maghreb #Tunisie #Maghreb #Couscous الكسكسي# pic.twitter.com/kjaKjBx4j3 — Ghazi GHERAIRI (@GHAZIGHERAIRI) March 29, 2019  The history of couscous Though the relationship between Morocco and Algeria remains strained, the historic ties of both countries to the traditional dish unified the two. Archeological evidence of cooking utensils in North Africa dates couscous back to the 10th century, and the first reference to the dish was in a 13th-century North African cookbook.  Since then, couscous has remained an integral part of society, in part due to the Maghrebi women who passed the tradition and way of cooking on from generation to generation. An elderly woman from Temara, near Rabat, told Morocco World News that in the past, couscous was eaten every day and mainly consisted of just grains and vegetables since meat was hard to get and expensive. The dish originally came from the Amazigh (Berber) people of North Africa. The name couscous comes from the Amazigh words “seksu,” which means “well-formed” and the word “keskas,” which is the name of the cooking utensil used to make the dish. Historically, couscous was hand-rolled at home from semolina flour and water, however this time-consuming process is rarely practiced anymore.Moroccans typically pair couscous with leben, a beverage of fermented milk similar to buttermilk. While sour-tasting, the pairing is crucial to the overall taste of couscous. Historically, families prepared their own leben, however, now most Moroccans buy pre-made leben. Variations on the traditional dish After the 12th century, couscous spread from Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia to Mauritania, Libya, Egypt, and sub-Saharan countries. With the spread of couscous came a variety of preparations of the dish.  In Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Libya, couscous is traditionally served with vegetables, cooked in a mild broth, and topped with meat. In Algeria and Morocco, there is a sweet variation of couscous sprinkled with almonds, cinnamon, and sugar, called “sfouf.”  In Morocco, there is also “tfaya” which comes with sweetened onions, raisons, and almonds paired with either lamb or chicken. “Tfaya” couscous is often prepared for funerals, but can also be found on Fridays as well. In addition to traditionally served couscous, Moroccans also eat “saykouk” which is a bowl of the couscous grains filled with leben. “Saykouk” is traditionally eaten in the summertime to combat the heat and is also sold from carts on the street year-round. The dish can also be prepared with barley in the place of couscous. In Tunisia, couscous is made spicier using “harissa” and can also be topped with seafood or camel.  In Libya, there is another sweet variation to couscous referred to as “maghrood,” prepared with dates, sesame, and pure honey. Likewise, couscous is prepared as a dessert in Egypt with butter, sugar, cinnamon, raisins, and nuts and topped with cream. Couscous, now a popular dish in Israel, came with the return of Jews from North Africa to Israel in the 20th century. Israelis eat a variation of the dish called “ptitim” which is made with larger pearl couscous. Couscous as a unifying force Since their independence, Morocco and Algeria remain in conflict. One area of tensions between the two countries is the longstanding dispute over Western Sahara. However, the common love for couscous has the ability to bridge deep divides. The dish not only acts as a unifying force between rival countries but also as a centerpiece of family life. On Fridays, Moroccans traditionally gather around to share a platter of couscous following Friday prayers. Halima, another woman from Temara, told Morocco World News, “It’s important to have couscous every Friday because it brings the family together.” The dish is also eaten at births and weddings along with festivities at the end of Ramadan. Because of these occasions, the dish is associated with abundance, fertility, and fidelity.  Will the common bond over couscous prevail despite conflicts within or between nations in the Maghreb region?

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has highlighted how Morocco prioritizes the development of South-South cooperation for an integrated and prosperous Africa. South-South cooperation for an integrated, flourishing, and competent Africa will be achieved when youth, leaders, and institutions double their efforts. Morocco will support these efforts, wrote Bourita in the “Metro UN,” a bi-monthly publication for the UN in New York. Symbolizing Morocco’s commitment to sustainable development in Africa, the minister referred to a quote by King Mohammed VI, who said: “It is to Africa that the Kingdom is seeking to give leadership.” Titled “Inter-African cooperation: For an integrated, flourishing and competent Africa,” Bourita’s article explained, “It is in this direction that we have been working since our return to the African Union.”. Since 2000, Morocco has signed nearly 1,000 agreements with other African countries. From 1956 to 1999, Morocco only signed 515. “This cooperation must be linked to our common designs and be reflected in the harmonization of our objectives. Only deep cooperation between African countries and more broadly with countries of the South, which face similar challenges, will enable these countries to survive and prosper,” Bourita argued. Bourita said that it is crucial that the African free trade zone emerges because Africa must rethink its commercial strategy.

Fez – Their feet tapped in unison as the Andalusian music coming from their instruments filled every corner of the auditorium. All wearing matching white gandoura tunic dresses and traditional red Fez hats, the local orchestra’s performance was the main event of the night during the 24th Andalusian Music Festival. The week-long event, hosted from April 6 to 13, featured more than 30 orchestras from Fez, Tangier, Tetouan, Rabat, Meknes, Casablanca, and Spain. Each orchestra sharing their version of Andalusian music with the audience. “This music symbolizes happiness and creates a joyous atmosphere in Moroccan society,” Abdeslam Chami, director of the artistic administration of the festival, told Morocco World News. “The Andalusian music should be present in all events.” One of Chami’s goals during this year’s festival was to give the audience an opportunity to compare different forms of Andalusian music by inviting international orchestras. Miguel Ruiz, the clarinet player for the Spanish orchestra “Salema” and resident of Andalusia, was thrilled to get an invitation to Fez to play during the festival. “It is so important for us to play our Andalusian music here because it is such a special opportunity for us to share our form [of] Andalusian music with the Moroccan public,” Ruiz told MWN, moments before stepping onto the stage. For more than an hour, Ruiz and his orchestra played for the dozens of people that filled the auditorium. “We want our audience to feel the union of Arab, Jewish and Spanish culture in our music,” Ruiz said. “We want them to feel the changing time periods and cultures and appreciate them all.” The crowd greeted Ruiz’s final note, played on his clarinet, with a standing ovation. Cheering loudly in the audience was music professor Abdelwahab Alaoui. Throughout his years teaching, Alaoui has seen a consistent interest in Andalusian music from Moroccan youth. “Andalusian music is a part of Moroccan cultural heritage and it has seen a large amount of interest from Moroccan students in the last several years,” Alaoui told MWN. In recent years, the festival’s organizers have made it a goal to promote Andalusian music and art among young people. Alaoui is in complete support of the goal. “Festivals like this one are important because they keep interest in Andalusian music alive,” Alaoui said. “It is important that Moroccans all together ensure the preservation of this type of music and make sure it is still present for the next generation.” Andalusian music’s exact origins are unknown, but it was allegedly born during the 9th century in Al-Andalus, the southern part of Spain controlled by Arabs. The unique form of Spanish music came to North Africa following the exodus of Jews and Muslims from the Iberian Peninsula caused by the fall of the Moorish-rule in Andalusia at the end of the 15th century. The exodus spread Andalusian music to Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria.  Many settled in northern Moroccan cities, such as Fez, Tetouan, Tangier, and Chefchaouen—growing the music’s popularity within the country. Since the great exodus, each country has developed its own version of Andalusian music but kept a similar structure to the original. The core-structuring concept is called the “nawba.” Each nawba is on a “tab,” which is similar to the musical concept of a mode. These tabs are structured in a sequence of five “myazen,” each one on particular rhythmic pattern. Each myazen begins with an instrumental prelude and is followed by a number of sun poems, also known as “sana’i,” which includes intermittent  instrumental interludes. These interludes are often filled with music from a barbuka drum, oud guitar, taarija tambourine, the rebab stringed instrument, piano, or violin. According to Chami, Moroccan Andalusian music is the most similar to the original. “While Moroccans developed this music to keep it alive, Moroccan artists maintained the original Andalusian music the most,” Chami said. “While it is very close to the original Andalusian music, we call it Moroccan Andalusian music because we don’t want it to be mistaken for Algerian or Tunisian Andalusian music.” To keep the practice of Moroccan Andalusian music alive, several festivals are hosted each year to celebrate the unique practice. The 25th Andalusian Music Festival will take place at a similar time next year and will again be organized by the municipality of Fez and the Fez-Meknes regional council. The coastal city of Essaouira will host the annual Festival of Atlantic Andalusian Music in October.

Ouarzazate – With a lit cigarette between his lips and a walking cane in hand, “Osama Bin Laden” left his clay home to begin his daily neighborhood stroll. Dressed in his classic white gandoura tunic dress, beige beret, and favorite military jacket, Bin Laden walked through winding roads of eastern Morocco’s Ouarzazate—a name that originates from the Amazigh (Berber) words “ouar” and “zazt,” which mean “without” and “noise.” The only sound early on that Thursday morning were the flip-flop of Bin Laden’s sandals—a methodical pitter-patter that only paused three times during his walk. First, he stopped to refill his packet of Fox cigarettes. Second, he stopped to take grains for the birds out of his pistol pocket. Third, he paused to wave back at locals who had recognized his film-famous salt-and-pepper beard from a block away. Nicknamed Osama Bin Laden for his striking resemblance to the infamous terrorist leader, 61-year-old Abdelaziz Bouydnayen is one of Ouarzazate’s longest-serving extras. “They all love me here,” Bouydnayen told Morocco World News. “Even all the tourists visit me when they come visit this city.” Bouydnayen’s career in film began in 1985 as a set assistant for the James Bond classic “The Living Daylights.” He remembers Timothy Dalton’s arrival on set and the fervor of excitement that rippled through the city. Ouarzazate, roughly 200 kilometers southeast of Marrakech, earned the nickname “Africa’s Little Hollywood” after the city’s picturesque kasbah, fields of sand, and snow-capped mountains became a popular filming location among Western directors. The desert city has been the setting for classics such as “Lawrence of Arabia” (1962) and 21st-century blockbusters such as “Gladiator” (2000), “Black Hawk Down” (2001), and “Kingdom of Heaven” (2005). Most recently, the city’s Kasbah Titrit was the set of HBO’s hit series “Game of Thrones”. The screen time made Ouarzazate, Morocco’s 51st most populated city with just 71,000 inhabitants, one of the country’s top tourist destinations. “Ouarzazate is the capital of cinema in Morocco, which brings pride and people to the city,” Mohamed Amzil, the provincial director of the Ministry of Culture, told MWN. “People from all over Morocco and the world come to visit Ouarzazate.” According to Ouarzazate’s Provincial Council of Tourism (CPT), nearly 245,000 tourists visited the city in 2017. Within the first three months of 2018, the Ministry of Tourism estimates that the tourism industry generated nearly MAD 15.8 billion. The growing international interest in Morocco led to the creation of two film studios in Ouarzazate—CLA and Atlas—only increasing the city’s popularity as a setting for both local and international films. The once remote French military base is now home to more than 10 luxury hotels, 20 tour agencies and an international airport, all built to support Ouarzazate’s film and tourism industry. The growing infrastructure and the city’s inundation of movies has allowed Bouydnayen to enjoy a more than three-decade career in film. “I love this field. I fell in love with it when I was young and never stopped loving it,” Bouydnayen said. “So many people in Ouarzazate dream to work in film.” Younger actors have also been taking to careers in film, hoping to dedicate just as many years to Ouarzazate’s film culture as Bouydnayen has. “I was willing to explore this new world and try it out because I was inspired by older people that had been working in the field for so long,” Achraf Choukri, a 23-year-old local actor, told MWN. Throughout Bouydnayen’s career, he has been a part of more than 100 films, shows, and documentaries. His greatest role was playing terrorist Osama Bin Laden in a documentary about the hunt for the Al-Qaeda leader—a casting that made him famous throughout the city and led to his notorious nickname. When starring in documentaries, Bouydnayen, along with hundreds of local actors, are commonly recruited as extras for large scenes. Still hanging on his wall is a photo taken during one of the days he spent as an extra for one of the battles in “Kingdom of Heaven.” To this day, Bouydnayen swears that Orlando Bloom, the movie’s lead actor, waved directly at him during one of the breaks. “One of my favorite things about this industry is being able to meet foreigners,” Bouydnayen said. “What other career would make me meet Orlando Bloom or Timothy Dalton? None. Just this one.” But after cameras stop rolling, Bouydnayen and many other extras spend the rest of the year unemployed—waiting for the next film. On the side of his acting career, Bouydnayen runs a small cigarette shop just down the road from where he lives. But despite the popularity of smoking in Morocco, he says business has been slow. Having dedicated his life to intermittent cinema, Bouydnayen will retire with no pension and limited savings, a concern that hasn’t caused him to have any regrets. “I’m not too worried. It will work out, God willing. For me, it’s not always about the money,” Bouydnayen said. “Sometimes you just have to do what makes you the happiest.”  When his walk ended in front of his home, Bouydnayen pushed open the wooden doors, lit another cigarette, and smiled while looking at the dozens of photos nailed to his wall. “Happy, happy, happy,” he said, pointing to each one.

Rabat – Abdellah El Bakkali, president of the National Union of the Moroccan Press (SNPM), cast doubt on the credibility of the 2019 ranking by Reporters without Borders (RSF).  The report ranked Morocco 135th out of 180 countries for safety of journalists, describing its media climate as “very difficult.” “I don’t always trust RSF’s reports,” said El Bakkali, asserting that the stance of those who produce the report “lacks credibility,” especially in what it reports on Western Sahara.  He said their position on Western Sahara is based on a “pack of lies” and “unfounded.”  RSF’s 88-word write-up on Moroccan press freedom for 2019 made no explicit mention of Western Sahara. However, it noted, “Several foreign reporters were expelled.” El Bakkali said journalists in Morocco face difficulties, but “we are not waiting for RSF to teach us lessons in journalism.” The situation of journalists in Morocco, El Bakkali argues, is better compared to a number of Arab countries, complaining that “RSF wants to shed specific light on Morocco.” RSF ranked Morocco as the 9th best country for journalist safety out of 19 countries in the Middle East and North Africa.  However, the co-founder of Freedom Now, a coalition of human rights defenders in Morocco, Maati Mounjib, argued that press freedom in Morocco now is the worst it has been since the 1990s. Mounjib traces back the beginnings of the deterioration of the media climate in Morocco to 2002. But Mounjib said it started getting somewhat better in 2011-2013, only to degenerate afterwards with the arrest of the co-founder of the Moroccan news outlet Lakome, Ali Anouzla, in September 2013 and other arrests that followed. In its 2019 annual report, RSF gave Morocco a score of 44.98 on a scale of 0 (best) to 100 (worst) compared to 43.13 in 2018.  The report blamed the situation on the Moroccan “authorities deliberate obstruction of national and international media” for covering the Hirak protests that broke out in Rif region, northern Morocco.

Rabat – Several hundred protesters are rallying in the streets of the Hague in the Netherlands on Saturday, April 20, denouncing what they see as the heavy sentences Morocco imposed on activists of the Hirak mass protests in Al Hoceima in northern Morocco.  According to the Dutch Broadcast Foundation (NSO), there are approximately 250 demonstrators. One of the protesters, Mohammed Talhaoui, said, “We demand the immediate release of all Hirak prisoners” for receiving “unfair [sentences] as described by human rights organizations like Amnesty International.” A Casablanca court sentenced 54 Hirak activists to 1 to 20 years in prison in June 2018. The Hirak activists people, the protester said, were demonstrating because of the militarization of Morocco’s Rif region, in demand of a better health care system, education, and decent living conditions. Commenting on the hunger strikes of some Hirak prisoners, Talhaoui claimed prisoners “are dying” after they staged all sorts of protests like sewing their lips.  The demonstration is a call on Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok, who also denounced the “heavy” prison terms in a report Blok wrote the same year. Protesters are also calling on European organizations to unanimously “put pressure” on the Moroccan government. “If the EU unanimously says today that this is not allowed, it will stop today,” Talhaoui asserted. A Dutch correspondent, Willemijn de Koning, said it is difficult to know the prisoners’ state of health, especially those serving 20 years.  Koning said what’s “alarming” is prisoners’ state of mental health because of being placed in solitary confinement. Moroccans are also planning a protest in support of the Hirak activists on Sunday in Rabat.

Rabat – After Morocco’s ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) sidelined her for association with a scandal, MP Amina Maelainine is intent on setting the record straight. The “disappointed” MP is now exposing what she sees as political “cowardice” at the heart of the PJD. Speaking to France 24 Arabic in her first televised appearance since making headlines for appearing without her traditional Islamic veil in Paris, Maelainine took issue with the lack of conviction in a party she still represents at the Moroccan Parliament. “The PJD is not an angel party,” Maelainine told France 24 Arabic, later suggesting in the interview that she has grown disappointed with how the PJD deals with controversial issues. “I have paid the price of my choices,” Maelainine said. Firing her most lethal verbal shot in the interview, she added, “There is cowardice at the PJD.” On regional politics, Maelainine said that she is very happy with Tunisia’s recent political reforms to grant Tunisian women the same rights as their male compatriots. The suggestion, for somebody who has been adamant about her right to make independent choices, is that she would like to witness the same changes in Morocco. Without appearing to want to resign from her current seat as a PJD MP, Maelainine told France 24 that her political future does not necessarily lie with the PJD. She said she may join a party that is more in line with her convictions. In an earlier reaction on Monday this week, Maelainine defied the PJD leadership, saying that she would not be silenced in her fight. But the France 24 interview is so far Maelainine’s harshest criticism of the entire PJD culture. The comments are not, however, the first time the MP has appeared to reproach her party for a perceived lack of political conviction or coherence. “I know some leading PJD members who are very open on the question of the hijab. Their stances are indeed very liberal. But they can’t openly express their ideas because of party and social constraints,” Maelainine said in a March 9 interview with a Moroccan paper.

Rabat – Although an official provision excludes him from needing to complete mandatory military service, Mahmoud Elmghaitri, a man suffering from a physical disability, was summoned to complete his census form to perform military service. Originally from Guelmim, a city in southern Morocco, Elmghaitri has been suffering from a disability his entire life. The law does not require Moroccans who financially support their families as well as persons with disabilities to fulfill the military service. Like others who qualify for an exemption, Elmghaitri will have to file for exemption by submitting an application within 20 days of completing the census form. He must submit the application to local administrative authorities who will transfer the request to the prefectural commissions which make exemption decisions. “Youth of Guelmim,” a popular Facebook page, posted photos of Elmghaitri and his contract, which has since been shared nearly 250 times.  محمود المغيطري من ذوي الاحتياجات الخاصة توصل باستدعاء للخدمة العسكرية التجنيد الاجباري من المسوول عن هذا هل هو غباء المقدم و الشيخ او غباء القائد الدي وقع الاستدعاء من سنحاسب الان Publiée par ‎شباب كليميم‎ sur Jeudi 18 avril 2019 The post also received over 60 comments, many expressing confusion and outrage that Elmghaitri received a conscription notice. However, according to the process the Council of Ministers adopted for military conscription, after an individual fills out the census form, he should receive a receipt in an email informing him that he can file an application for temporary or definitive exemption. The Moroccan government has not released a comment on the situation.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has instructed Morocco’s interior minister to plan elections for local representatives of Morocco’s Jewish community, a press release from the royal cabinet states. The move comes as King Mohammed VI works to institutionalize the historical rights of Moroccan Jews. In his public statements in recent months, the Moroccan King has repeated his desire to establish Morocco as a land of peaceful cohabitation between different faiths. According to the royal cabinet’s press statement, the election of local Jewish representatives has not taken place in Morocco since 1969. With this move, the statement suggested, King Mohammed VI is sending a symbolic message to the Jewish community about their safety and rights in their country. In the same instructions, King Mohammed VI also asked that the election not be a one-off event. The King instructed that the frequency for elections be in accordance with the May 7, 1945 Dahir (royal decree). The news comes days after the historic appointment of Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto as the chief rabbinical judge for Morocco’s Jewish community. The appointment made Morocco the first Muslim country in the modern world to recognize a Jewish religious authority. Serge Bardugo, a key figure of the Moroccan Jewry, who attended Rabbi Pinto’s swearing-in ceremony as King Mohammed VI’s special emissary, stressed the King’s belief in inter-religious dialogue. He said that Rabbi Pinto’s appointment fell within the context of the King’s sustained push for peaceful cohabitation and dialogue between the three Abrahamic religions that have historically found in Morocco a home. “The Moroccan Kingdom has never ceased to pursue the love and adoration which exists between the sons of Abraham, an affinity which unites them all,” Bardugo said.

Rabat – Moroccan footballer Abderrazak Hamdallah has become the leading scorer of all time in Saudi Arabia’s professional league after scoring 29 goals for Al-Nassr football club this season. The BBC reported that Hamdallah outperformed Al Ahli’s Syrian footballer Omar Al Somah, who had made 27 goals in the 2015-2016 season. The 28-year-old footballer joined Al-Nassr football club in 2018. He also played for Morocco’s under-23 football team and the national football team. Hamdallah made his debut with the Atlas Lions in a friendly against Burkina Faso in February 2012. The head coach of Morocco’s national football team, Herve Renard, had summoned Hamdallah to play with Morocco in March. The BBC said that the footballer could not accept Renard’s invitation for family reasons. Renard has commented on Hamdallah’s decision, saying that he spoke to him on the phone. “He declined for reasons you know, I had 33 other players to manage, so I turned the page.” It remains to be seen whether Renard will call Hamdallah for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN), which will take place in June in Egypt.

Rabat – Turkish law enforcement have arrested two spies who have allegedly confessed to working for the United Arab Emirates, reported international media. Reuters reported that one of the two spies arrived in Turkey in October 2018 after Khashoggi was killed in Istanbul in the Saudi consulate. The other spy arrived “later to help his colleague.”  An anonymous Turkish official said that authorities are investigating whether the spies’ arrival had any relation with the killing of Khashoggi. Police detained the spies on Monday and formally arrested them on Friday, according to AP. “It is possible that there was an attempt to collect information about Arabs, including political dissidents, living in Turkey,” said the official. Khashoggi was killed on October 2, 2018, when he went to the Saudi consulate to get documents for his upcoming wedding. Turkish police never found Khashoggi’s body. Turkish police said that Khashoggi’s remains might have been dissolved in acid and poured down the drain of the Saudi consulate. In February, the New York Times cited US officials who spoke of a damning statement from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS. MBS had said he would use “a bullet” on Khashoggi, who wrote critically of the Saudi government, if he refused to come back to Saudi Arabia. The New York Times article said that “current and former American and foreign officials” relayed the conversation between Mohammed bin Salman and a top aide, Turki Aldakhil. The conversation, which was intercepted by American intelligence agencies, dated back to September 2017.

Rabat – The administration of Casablanca’s Ain Borja Prison has rejected a report from Human Rights Watch that claims imprisoned Moroccan journalist Taoufik Bouachrine is being held in an “abusive solitary confinement.” The prison issued a statement asserting that Bouachrine is benefiting from all human rights like any other prisoner “without any discrimination” in accordance with the laws governing prisons. The administration said that Bouachrine is being held in a solitary cell at his request. Bouachrine had asked to join a cell with other prisoners, and the administration accepted his request, planning to move his belongings to a collective cell. “Nevertheless, the detainee finally withdrew his request, preferring to stay in his cell.” Bouachrine’s cell “has all the necessary hygienic conditions, including ventilation and natural light,” according to the prison. The administration also argued that security services in the prison “behave with him the way they do with other prisoners, as part of their duties.” The prison “responded positively to several requests submitted by [Bouachrine], concerning needs relating to his health and the state of his accomodation.” In addition, the administration said, Bouachrine regularly “receives visits from his wife, children and other family members.” He is also allowed to make telephone calls. The journalist also receives daily newspapers at his request. In November 2018, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals sentenced Bouachrine to 12 years in prison. Bouachrine faces charges of human trafficking, rape with violence, and sexual assault. However, some, including Prince Moulay Hicham, believe the convictions were political retribution for Bouachrine’s investigative work into powerful Moroccan figures. Bouachrine was the director of one of Morocco’s major newspapers Akhbar Al Yaoum and its online version, Alyaoum24. In February 2018, Moroccan police seized 50 tapes allegedly depicting sexual acts as evidence of Bouachrine’s crimes. The journalist was arrested after several women working in his newspaper filed complaints, accusing him of assault.

Rabat – A video depicting domestic violence has made the rounds on social media. The two-minutes-long clip showing what is believed to be a husband abusing his Moroccan wife, Safaa, who is 17 years old. In the video, which the alleged wife secretly filmed, the husband is seen carrying a belt while brutalizing his underage wife  and strangling her against the floor.  In the second part of the video, having beaten his wife, the husband appears to act as if he had only been reciting the Qur’an to exorcise his seemingly possessed wife. The two parts of the videos posted on social media triggered public outrage and indignation. Originally from Temara, South of Rabat, Safaa, who said she comes from the countryside, filmed a separate video in which she recounts her situation, including her identity and how she got where she is now.  She said she married her Saudi husband and relocated to Saudi Arabia, where she got beaten on the first day she arrived. She also recounts how her husband repeatedly brutalized her since relocating to Saudi Arabia. She said her abusive sometimes locks her up to prevent her from leaving. Safaa said she had a miscarriage as a result of violent beatings.  Safaa, who explained that she has suffered greatly, said, “I slept alone on cardboards because I couldn’t stand him being around.”

Casablanca – “I still can’t remember how I felt when I got my letter. I was numb. I couldn’t believe that finally my future would start, and at the same time, I was sad because I might not be able to see my family for several years. It was a huge mix of emotions. I was in shock.” Faisal Saeed received an acceptance letter from a Moroccan government scholarship program in 2014 that opened up new possibilities for the young Eritrean refugee. The program allowed him to leave Saudi Arabia for Morocco where he could pursue a university education. Although he arrived in Rabat over four years ago, his experiences as a refugee has made it challenging for the 22-year-old to find a sense of home in Morocco. Today, Saeed is one of nearly 6,500 refugees living in Morocco, according to numbers from the UNHCR. Although most refugees in Morocco are from Syria and Yemen, some, like Saeed, are from Eritrea, a coastal country in the Horn of Africa that borders Sudan, Ethiopia, and Djibouti. Saeed is Tigrinyan, one of nine recognized ethnic groups in Eritrea. While the Tigrinya tribe makes up 55% of the country’s population, Saeed said the tribe is often a target of government abuse. Eritrea has one of the worst human rights records in the world. Arbitrary detention, mandatory and indefinite military conscription, torture, sexual violence, and forced labor are just some of the violations that have driven nearly 15% of the population to flee Eritrea since the 1998 war with Ethiopia. The one-man dictatorship ruled by President Isaias Afeweki faces little resistance for the abuse against its citizens. Eritrea’s independent press was shut down in 2001, and no domestic institution exists that can investigate abuses. The Committee to Protect Journalists has consistently ranked Eritrea as the number one most-censored country in the world with a record worse than North Korea. The United Nations Human Rights Council stepped in to fill the shoes of local media and has attempted to report on claims of human rights abuse. Despite requests to visit Eritrea to conduct a fact-finding mission, the HRC was denied. Instead, a team gathered 550 first-hand testimonies from witnesses living in other countries in addition to 160 written submissions. From the testimonies, the HRC revealed in its 2015 report that “widespread and gross human rights violations have been and are being committed in Eritrea under the authority of the government. Some of these violations may constitute crimes against humanity.” Saeed’s family members witnessed the abuses described by the HRC’s report around them every day. Saeed said his family left Eritrea in 2000. They made their way to Saudi Arabia where he spent most of his childhood in Riyadh. “Some people there were nice. Some people were the absolute opposite. They constantly reminded you that you don’t belong there,” Saeed said of Saudis. “I knew that from an early age that I didn’t belong there.” As he grew older, Saeed felt trapped in Saudi Arabia. After finishing secondary school, his residency permit expired. Saeed faced a very real fear of being repatriated, of being sent back to Eritrea. As Saudi Arabia is not a signatory of the 1951 Refugee Convention that grants rights to refugees, many of Saeed’s friends and family members were deported from Saudi Arabia back to Eritrea. For Saeed and other Eritrean refugees, “returning to Eritrea means death,” he said. The Eritrean Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly insisted that people who fled are free to return without repercussion. However, repatriated refugees told Human Rights Watch that upon return to Eritrea, they received harsh punishment, including torture and indefinite detention without outside contact. A report from the European Asylum Support Office stated that “shortly after their return to Eritrea, [repatriated refugees] were beaten and imprisoned in overcrowded cells. One informant explained that several people in his group of returnees died as a result of those beatings.” If Saudi Arabia repatriated Saeed to Eritrea, an unpleasant return awaited him, at best. At worst, death. So as graduation grew closer, Saeed desperately searched for opportunities to avoid what he perceived as imminent repatriation. He needed to leave Saudi Arabia. In December 2014, Saeed received an acceptance letter from the Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation program that provided funding for a university education in Morocco. Almost immediately, Saeed moved to Morocco. He focused on French at a language center in Rabat before he started his bachelor’s degree in Kenitra, a city on Morocco’s Atlantic coast north of Rabat. In 2018, Saeed was one of a handful of refugee students selected for the Albert Einstein German Academic Refugee Initiative program (DAFI) to continue his studies in Morocco. He currently studies radiology in Casablanca at the Higher Institutes of Nursing and Health Technology Professions. Saeed has been in Morocco for over four years, but he does not yet feel at home in the North African country. “I feel like no matter how my situation is here in Morocco, I don’t feel like this is my home,” he said. “The word ‘home,’ the definition of it in my mind is the place where my family is because I didn’t have a homeland. I was hardly there. Eritrea is not my home. Saudi Arabia is not my home. Morocco is not my home. I am always a foreigner.” Saeed is unsure of when he will see his family next, as most of his family members are in Saudi Arabia, but he is making the most of his time in Morocco. Since coming to Morocco, he became the vice-president of the DAFI student association. Above all, Saeed says he is grateful to have found safety, security, and an opportunity for a better life in Morocco. “I’m thankful, to be honest. This is such a good point in my life that I was hoping I would reach that so many refugees don’t reach. I’m finally here,” he said.

Rabat – The chairman of the Arab-Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Roland Jabbour, has said that Australia “strongly supports the sovereignty of the kingdom of Morocco and its territorial integrity.” Jabbour said that Australia’s support is based on the “belief that prosperity is achieved through unity.” Talking to the press after a meeting with the Moroccan secretary of state to minister of foreign affairs, Mounia Boucetta, Jabbour said that he is “impressed” by the development he has witnessed in all regions of Morocco. He also expressed his country’s determination to reinforce diplomatic ties with Morocco. Jabbour also spoke about Morocco’s investment opportunities, “which will certainly promote” Australian-Moroccan bilateral ties. Jabbour said that Morocco is a gateway to both Africa and Europe. It is a “springboard that will allow us direct access to both continents through many free trade agreements with the European Union and the rest of Africa.” The determination of Jabbour to reinforce trade and diplomatic relations with Morocco was also emphasized by Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch, who visited Australia in February. During the visit, the agricultural minister for the Australian state of Victoria, Jaclyn Symes, said that “Victoria has shown great interest in supporting Morocco in the development of its agriculture and fisheries sectors.” The two-way trade between Morocco and Australia reached MAD 660 million ($69 million) in 2017. In a previous statement, the Australian ambassador to Rabat, Berenice Owen-Jones told Morocco World News that “Australian exports comprised around AUD 40 million [$29 million], mostly in wheat, meat and paints, and imports from Morocco were valued at around AUD 57 million [$41 million], including fertilisers, clothing and vegetables.” In addition to Australia, the Czech Republic also recently expressed support for Morocco’s autonomy plan as a durable political solution to end the “artificial” conflict.

Rabat – Some Sahrawis in Tindouf’s Lahmada camp in Algeria, including women, have taken part in a sit-in blaming Polisario for obstructing a political solution to the Sahara conflict. The sit-in took place in front of Boujdour prefecture, inside the Tindouf camps in Algeria, on Tuesday. The Sahrawis complained of the degradation of their situation and tightened restrictions. Lahmada’s population brought their concerns in protest before the separatist leaders, who were gathering at the headquarters of the self-proclaimed “Sahrawi National Council.”. They also hold the Polisario Front responsible for the length of the Sahara conflict, according to Moroccan outlet Le360. In an investigative film produced by Moroccan television channel Medi1TV that aired Sunday, a Spanish journalist spoke with a Sahrawi living inside the Tindouf camps, who asserted that humanitarian aid with food and medicine never reached them but was instead sold in the market in nearby Rabouni. He added that anyone who speaks to international media or human rights organizations is severely punished. The man also said that he experienced torture and punishment. When his father and oldest sister died, he reached out to Polisario’s health ministry which denied responsibility for their deaths and told him to remain silent. The Tuesday sit-in is one of the multiple protests the Sahrawis have been conducting in recent months. In early April, dozens of Sahrawis carried out a sit-in in front of the headquarters of the self-styled Sahrawi Ministry of the Interior to protest tightened restrictions at the Tindouf camps in Algeria. In March, several Sahrawi MPs conducted a sit-in in front of Polisario’s secretariat to protest widespread corruption in Tindouf camps. In a public statement, the MPs said they are protesting the waste of public money, abuse of authority for personal purposes, absence of accountability, and the prevalence of all kinds of corruption.

Rabat – The Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH) has called on human rights minister Mustapha Ramid to come to the aid of Rabi Al Ablaq, a Hirak activist, who has gone on a hunger strike for more than three weeks.  The organization raised concerns about the “deteriorating” health of Al Ablaq, who was also a journalist at Badil. Al Ablaq’s brother had written about the activist’s health on Facebook, calling on Ramid to intervene because “the prison administration is reluctant to rush him to the hospital claiming the prison is too remote.” The organization especially urged Ramid to intervene, informing him of Al Ablaq’s fragile condition and calling on Ramid to guarantee “his right to life and bodily integrity under the international law for human rights and article 20 of the Constitution.” Recently relocated from Casablanca’s Oukacha prison to “Tangier local prison 2,” Al Ablaq is one of the Hirak prisoners whom police arrested for engaging in the Hirak protests that broke out in the Rif region, in northern Morocco, in 2016 and 2017. A Casablanca court sentenced Al Ablaq to five years in prison along with 53 other activists—including Hirak leader Nasser Zefzafi, who received a 20-year sentence—on charges of taking part in unauthorized protests, disrupting public order, undermining the internal security of the state, and plotting against internal security. Rabii Al Ablaq was rushed to the hospital in Casablanca in 2017 after he went on a hunger strike for 40 successive days. Al Ablaq’s lawyer then quoted the journalist, who said, “I am officially announcing that I have ended the hunger strike … not for fear for my life or fear of death, but for the love of this land, which resides within our hearts, in spite of everything.” The lawyer said she conveyed Al Ablaq’s message with “honesty and abundance of love.”

Amsterdam – The UN  adopted a resolution on June 30, 2016, for protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The council adopted the resolution despite votes against from mainly MENA countries, such as Algeria, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar. In most MENA and African countries, engaging in same-sex sexual acts is a crime. In countries such as Morocco, Algeria, and Chad—but also Turkmenistan and Malaysia—men who have sex with men can face prison time from 8 years to a life sentence. In other countries (Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan, northern Nigeria, Yemen, the UAE, Pakistan, and Sudan), individuals engaging in same-sex sexual activities can face the death penalty.  Unlike Morocco and Mauritania, Egypt does not have formal norms that explicitly criminalize same-sex interactions, but they are criminalized under other legal provisions. In Bahrain, the Parliament is debating a law to punish all people who publicly present themselves as transgender or pretend to be the other sex. In Kuwait, 76 men were suspected of being gay and received a penalty of up to 7 years of prison in 2017.  Saudi Arabia has no written laws on sexual orientation or gender identity. The judges use Sharia to prosecute homosexual acts. One transgender woman from Pakistan died in Saudi police custody. Though Saudi authorities described her death as the result of a heart attack, the body showed signs of torture.  Why is there so much homosexual activity in MENA? There are no reliable figures on the number of men who have sex with men (MSM) in the MENA region. Male homosexual behavior is difficult to understand from the Western point of view on defining MSM; it is more of a spectrum than “ever engaging in anal sex.” Gender segregation, difficulty in accessing female sex workers, and delayed marriage can contribute to increased casual anal same-sex contacts in the region. In countries such as Pakistan, it is not uncommon for adolescent boys to engage in same-sex contacts with boys their age or with older men. It is also not uncommon for married men to have extramarital homosexual contacts. In one study 49.3% of surveyed Pakistani men reported to ever having sex with men. For street children in Egypt,  of male street children reported ever having sex with males and 37.1% reported being forced to do so. In Iran, 29% of single sexually active men reported homosexual contacts.  It’s about health and harm reduction MSM show risky sexual behavior: Having multiple sex partners and engaging in unsafe sex, while often reporting to be married or also having sex with women. This results in the transmission of HIV from key populations to the general population, such as the spouses.  An extensive report on characterizing HIV/AIDS in the MENA region found that there is a tendency to tackle HIV by law enforcement to prevent risky practices and same-sex acts.  However, the HIV transmission mode reflects the risks and vulnerability in societies. Repressive measures will only complicate efforts to tackle HIV and increase hidden risky behavior and discourage people from seeking help.  Applying law enforcement would not change the behavior but lose control over the MSM population and therefore also on the HIV epidemic. This method will not be able to apply proper infection prevention measures. One of the key messages of a bio-behavior study conducted in Marrakech and Agadir underlines the need for long-term and sustainable risk reduction through legal reforms and the protection of human rights. High criminalization and discrimination of MSM are therefore not beneficial.

Rabat – “Concordant sources” close to the Moroccan royal palace have indicated that King Mohammed VI will visit Saudi Arabia as early as next week, a number of Moroccan outlets have reported. Starting on April 24, the Moroccan monarch will allegedly embark on a trip to Riyadh and Jeddah. Without elaborating, sources told Moroccan outlet Le 360 that King Mohammed VI will have audiences with both King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS. Neither strong allies nor vested enemies The news comes on the heels of uncertain relations between Saudi Arabia and Morocco. In the last months, assessing the extent of Morocco-Saudi friction became more increasingly difficult with a series of mixed messages that the two formerly strong allies sent each other. Unhappy with Riyadh’s shaky support on issues like Western Sahara, which Morocco deems essential to its national identity, Morocco warned Saudi Arabia of the importance of reliability and reciprocal loyalty in bilateral relations. Appearing to speak to Riyadh, Morocco’s foreign minister Nasser Bourita said at a news conference in early April that bilateral relations only work when each of the parties makes efforts to avoid crossing the red lines set by the other. A working alliance, Bourita emphasized, is built on reciprocity and loyalty to “principles and constants.” Riyadh, meanwhile, is understood to have taken issue with Morocco for not following its guidelines in the Saudi-led boycott of Qatar during the latest Gulf crisis. The friction between the two allies allegedly intensified when Rabat appeared to announce a withdrawal from the Saudi coalition in the war in Yemen. But even as reports continued pointing to deteriorating relations between the two kingdoms, officials argued that the situation was not as dramatic as presented in media narratives. Even in what has so far been seen as his most muscular public statement on the alliance with the Saudis, Bourita was diplomatic. He was crystal clear on what Morocco wants but less so on where Rabat stood with Riyadh. While the two allies disagreed on regional issues, Bourita declared, it had never been question of a total rupture in their “historical” and “brotherly” ties. Rapprochement in the air On Tuesday, April 16, a picture featuring Morocco’s King Mohammed VI and Turki Al Al Sheikh, an adviser at the Saudi royal court, made the rounds on social media. The picture in itself was an event, perhaps the boldest statement so far. Turki Al Sheikh, just months earlier a hated figure in Morocco for numerous remarks that many Moroccans perceived as more than unfriendly and undiplomatic, now stood side by side, broadly smiling, with Morocco’s King. The picture, the Saudi official later commented, marked King Mohammed VI’s acceptance of Al Shiikh’s request that the Arab Championships, a regional football tournament, be named after the King. “As the president of the Arab Football Union, I am very honored that our next championship will bear the name dear to all Arabs: that of King Mohammed VI,” Al Sheikh said. The King’s meeting a Saudi official whose explosive statements during the build up to Morocco’s failed bid to host the 2026 World Cup was, however, the culmination of numerous steps Morocco had taken towards regional peace and dialogue. Morocco made the first ‘brotherly’ steps Between April 9 and 10, Bourita met Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, a further indication of Rabat’s calls for regional unity, according to Morocco’s state-run Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).The current escalation of tensions in the Libyan crisis has been one instance where Rabat and Riyadh have so far parted ways. Saudi Arabia and the UAE support General Khalifa Haftar, whose troops control much of eastern Libya and recently assaulted Tripoli. Morocco, meanwhile, is calling for a dialogue-based political process. “The military option would only further complicate the country’s situation and [negatively] affect the stability and security of citizens,” Bourita said on Wednesday following a meeting with an envoy of the UN-recognized Libyan government in Tripoli. In his meetings with both King Salman and MBS, Bourita stressed King Mohammed VI’s message of fraternity to preserve a solidarity-driven agenda in regional matters, especially in Libya, where Morocco is positioning itself as the primary peace broker. According to Le 360’s sources, the announced visit of King Mohammed VI to Riyadh is consistent with Morocco’s expanding role in regional geopolitics. King Mohammed VI, the argument goes, wants to finish what Bourita initiated with his recent Gulf tour. According to the same sources, while bilateral ties will feature in King Mohammed VI’s audiences with King Salman and MBS, regional coordination in Libya is set to take center stage. As Morocco takes the leading role as a moderator of the political process in post-Arab spring Libya, the King wants to make sure that all regional powers are on board with Morocco on the principle of non-intervention.

Rabat – The Dame of Paris was about to be reduced to ashes as fire fighters pumped hopes, prayers, and sighs with every pulse of water that combated the ravishing fires’ attack on the roof of the much-adored cathedral.  Some might have thought that Notre Dame was, after all, “just another building”–an old building the French could rebuild if, in the worst-case scenario, it was consumed down to ash and rubble. Well, we all know that this ancient building is not just another old building. Anyone familiar with the urban heart of Paris will recognise Notre Dame as both a powerful symbol and an iconic landmark. Visited by at least thirteen million tourists each year, it stands as the incarnation or the pinnacle of medieval architectural ingenuity; beyond  the Eiffel Tower, it defines the City of Lights and offers a sense of direction on both the symbolic as well as topographical plane. It is a building draped in layers of history, or rather a building that overwhelms French history from the thirteenth century to April 15th, 2019, the day of its inferno. We need to appreciate that while this cathedral bears meaning for Catholics all over Europe, it also speaks much of France’s secular identity. It brings both Victor Hugo and Napoleon Bonaparte under the same roof. It stands at what may be the most secular location of Paris: between the Louvre and the Sorbonne, not far from the very spots that France’s most unflinching existentialists used to frequent and fill with their unruly passion, along the streets of Saint-Michel and Saint-Germain-des-Prés. It overlooks the Seine and the Left Bank, the very cradle of  twentieth-century French Intellectualism and avant-gardism.  Notre-Dame is an edifice marked by the history of the contradictions it hosted and survived, as it served as a backdrop to both the radicals and the conservatives as a testimony to times of peace and against times of horror. It withstood and challenged serious threats from Robespierre to Hitler, yet finally survived the blaze of the most recent inferno which threatened to bring all of its vaults and arches down. While the causes of the conflagration are still under investigation, there is a political and social context within which the tragic event of the burning of the Cathedral can be located and reflected upon. The great fire of the Dame took place following a series of events that points to the déchirures and ailments of the body politic in today’s France. The strong, pervasive protests triggered by the movement of the gilets jaunes, across the Hexagon, have represented the first major challenge to Emmanuel Macron’s non-traditionalist political stance and have awakened the French to their new social and political reality, one in which the social fabric seems to be under unprecedented pressure, strained to the degree of almost irrevocable damage.  No rational person wants France to deteriorate into a country of social unrest and political instability. The world insists upon seeing France as the center of European culture and as a country of fine art, fashion, cinema, literature, elegance, and enduring monuments. France has for the last hundred years attracted intellectuals and artists from all around the globe and has offered dissenting intellectuals the comfort they require and the protection they have sought the most.  As young students, we in North Africa were first introduced to the idea of an idealised and romanticised France through the works of a long list of Arab authors like Taha Hussein, Suhail Idriss, and Amine Maalouf, not to mention the many Arab Francophone writers based in France. Perhaps because of them, we share an imagined inheritance. The burning of the Notre-Dame cathedral reinforces the idea of France as a cultural concept foremost, which, in my opinion, the gilets jaunes movement has reshaped into an overcharged political category under the strain of France’s current social malaise. It happens, however,  that culture is a generous and flexible concept at its ethical base. Thus the inferno seems to have awakened the cultural unity of France out of disaster at a crucial moment and urged business paragons and political potentates to come together and pledge fortunes to rebuild the Dame of Paris.  The fire of Notre Dame must inspire the French to the necessity of providing a better vision for France in the twenty-first century: France,  as a harmonious cultural model and a generous secular space, within which frictions and tensions of all kinds exist, could turn into the model of solidarity, tolerance, and hospitality. The incandescence of the icon of Paris is alas another reminder of the fragility of the idea of the state when its apparatuses of power and capital continue to race without regard for  cultural values and ideals.  We often forget that it is culture that can save us in times of trouble. However, the crumbling of the Dame’s spire is also symbolic of the event when culture itself might falter under the excesses of materialism and utilitarianism. This time, the columns of Notre-Dame withstood their ground, and with that,  possibilities for change and hope become–once again–miraculously real. Culture is indeed a phoenix, but will it always rise?

Rabat – Algerians have taken to the streets by the Grand Post in Algiers, the center of mass protests since February 22. For the ninth Friday in a row, Algerian citizens are protesting, and dozens of activists are shouting slogans against the current government demanding radical change. The protests have continued despite the resignation of many senior officials, including former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika on April 3. The protesters are also seeking the resignation of Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah, a loyalist to Bouteflika. Algerians are shouting slogans such as, “The people want them all to leave” and “That is enough of this system.” Despite warnings from the army and national police, who have used water cannons and tears gas to disperse protests throughout the two months of the popular movement, the protests are continuing. The army chief, Gaid Salah, has been calling on the protesters to stop chanting “unrealistic” slogans, emphasizing that some foreign countries are taking an interest in the crisis in Algeria. He added that time is “running out” to end the escalating crisis in the country before elections on July 4, asserting that “all options are open in the pursuit of overcoming the different difficulties” to end the crisis “as soon as possible.” Human Rights Watch (HRW) has criticized the security forces’ response to the protests, commenting that the police have renewed their “crackdown on mass protests.” HRW added that the crackdown “is an apparent attempt to curb the massive pro-democracy marches.” Sarah Leah Whitson, HRW’s Middle East and North Africa director, said that “Algerians have continued to assert their right to peacefully assembly in recent weeks despite growing police efforts to crack down on them.” She added hat the demonstrators “report being arrested, strip searched, handled roughly, and detained for hours.” This week, a group of 10 protesters in Algeria condemned police for arresting them before they had even begun to protest last Saturday. Four of the female protesters said that a woman police officer demanded they take off their clothes for a search at the police station.

Rabat – Morocco is participating as an honorary guest in the 2019 Montreal International Aerospace Week, which kicked off on Tuesday, April 17. Morocco’s Minister of Industry, Investment, Trade, and Digital Economy Moulay Hafid Elalamy is participating in the four-day event, along with other officials and aerospace professionals, including Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science, and Economic Development Navdeep Singh Bains. By attending, Elalamy aims to showcase Morocco’s ever-growing aeronautic market and the opportunities it has generated over the years. He also hopes to improve bilateral cooperation with Canada in the aeronautic sector. In a speech, Elalamy said that Morocco’s aeronautics sector has stood out as an “interesting platform” for creating 16,700 jobs and currently has 140 aeronautics companies. Morocco’s major objective in aeronautics is to boost its revenues to $2.8 billion and create 23,000 job opportunities by 2020.  Morocco has drawn significant investors, Elalamy said, referring to large manufacturers such as Boeing, Bombardier, and Airbus. It also has the largest Boeing 737 fleet in Africa. Elalamy noted that Morocco has, since 2005, become a cost efficient destination, and the sector has grown 10 times in a 10-year span. Within a 17-year period, Morocco witnessed considerable growth in the number of companies in the aeronautics industry, with 140 companies compared to 10 in 2001.

Rabat – Pope Francis traveled to the south of Rome to celebrate the Lord’s Supper on Maundy Thursday, April 18, in the Velletri prison. During the mass, the pope kissed and washed the feet of 12 prisoners, calling on them to help each other and abolish the “inmate hierarchy structure” in prisons. The 12 prisoners came from Italy, Brazil, Cote d’Ivoire, and Morocco. During the ceremony, the pope thanked the inmates for a “beautiful letter from several of them,” according to the Vatican News. “The pope reflected briefly on the gesture of Jesus washing the feet of the disciples, which priests around the world repeat on Holy Thursday,” said that news outlet. Christians around the world commemorate Maundy Thursday as the night before Jesus’ crucifixion when he shared a last Passover meal, also called the Lord’s Supper, with his disciples, washing their feet to demonstrate how to be a servant-leader. On March 30 and 31, Pope Francis visited Morocco for the first time. During his visit, Pope Francis met with King Mohammed VI, senior officials, and migrants. The pope enjoyed his visit to Morocco, delivering statements to express gratitude for the warm welcome he received. “Last Saturday and Sunday [March 30-31], I completed an Apostolic Journey to Morocco, and I thank His Majesty King Mohammed VI and the other authorities, for their warm welcome.” The pope also said that it was an honor and a joy to visit the “noble kingdom of Morocco.” “King Mohammed and I reiterated the essential role religions have in defending human dignity, promoting peace and justice, and in caring for creation, our common home.” The pope also promised to visit prisoners held at in the Castellon II prison in Albocasser, Spain.

Rabat – The tug of war between the teachers who say they were “forced into contracts” (CNPCC) and the Ministry of Education in Morocco continues after a series of negotiation meetings.  While contractual teachers have pledged to suspend their April 15 strike and return to work, they have decided to extend their protest until April 25 on the grounds that the Ministry of Education “flagrantly violated” their April 13 agreement.  After the Ministry of Education and six unions representing teachers held a separate meeting on April 13 to discuss the current dilemma, the parties came to a mutual understanding. However, the CNPCC says education minister Said Amzazi failed to keep the promises the ministry made and is threatening to push for a “blank year” of not working for 12 months. The Ministry of Education, said the CNPCC in a press release, breached the April 13 agreement because it began to take legal action against striking teachers, especially those working in academies in the southern region, and did not postpone professional qualifying examinations as agreed. Contractual teachers double down on their demands Determined to press ahead with their primary demands to be hired into the public sector, the CNPCC stated that it holds the education ministry accountable for the “catastrophic situation of education.” On April 18, the group issued a statement renewing its “refusal of teaching under fixed-contract” and called on teachers in training to “join the struggle” and “boycott training courses” until the ministry meets their demands. Minister of Education Said Amzazi said that integrating contractual teachers into the public sector is not feasible and will not be part of the agenda in the next meeting on April 23. Contractual teachers have been protesting since February 20, when police used water cannons to disperse protesters, wounding some teachers. On March 9, at the request of Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, the education ministry agreed to abolish teacher recruitment under fixed-term contracts and amend many of the provisions of the contracts. Contractual teachers say their contracts are “discriminatory” because they do not have the same benefits permanent teachers in the public sector enjoy. One of the most contentious terms within the contract states that senior officials at academies where teachers work can revoke the contract if they see fit.  Teachers have complained of being “under the mercy and whims” of academies and the education ministry’s “patchy” solutions, calling for permanent jobs that guarantee them “social, financial, and psychological stability.” Calling for “serious” dialogues with the education Ministry, the CNPCC also expressed disapproval when Amzazi did not show up for a meeting. Instead, Amzazi attended a festival in Fqih ben Saleh in the Beni Mellal-Khenifra region in northern Morocco.

Rabat – Moroccan and Sahrawi flags were both seen in Cairo this past week at an African Union specialized committee meeting.  The AU had invited officials from both Morocco and the Polisario Front to the summit, which took place from April 14-18. Polisario was represented by its secretary-general of transport, Salama Mohamed Youssef, and Morocco’s secretary of state for transport, Najib Boulif, led the Rabat delegation. While Polisario’s invitation to the meeting was not unexpected, since the self-proclaimed SADR is an AU member state, it does conjure up memories of past diplomatic tensions raised when delegations from both Morocco and the self-proclaimed SADR arrived at international summits. The AU’s specialized technical committees are the primary bodies in charge of its program and project implementation and work in areas that range from women’s empowerment to security and defense. They meet every two years. The specialized technical committee that met this week in Cairo was the committee on transport, infrastructure, energy, and tourism. It was billed as the “most prominent meeting of ministers responsible for transport,” bringing together the top transport officials of AU member states and hundreds of other professionals.  Attendance from many African nations was key to push the AU’s goals for transportation forward, said Cheikh Bedda, African Union commission director of infrastructure and energy. “Our collective effort is critical,” he emphasized in his opening remarks at the meeting. For the AU, Polisario was included in that collective action. Throughout the week, Youssef joined other top officials from dozens of African nations to construct a vision for transportation and energy in Africa. The committee placed a particular emphasis on infrastructure development. The continent was at an important crossroads, Bedda said. “Whether it’s a new airport in Dakar in the West or a 300 MW wind farm in the East, major road and rail links in north, central and southern Africa, or energy generation and interconnection projects in various parts of the continent, infrastructure development in Africa is leaving a mark and making a difference in the lives of ordinary people,” he said. This week was not the first time Polisario has provoked questions about Egypt’s stance on the Western Sahara conflict. In October 2018, a representative from Polisario attended an event at the Egyptian embassy in Ethiopia, although Egyptian Ambassador to Morocco Ashraf Ibrahim said that the individual sneaked into the event and was not invited. Egypt officially supports Morocco’s stance on Western Sahara. The African Union has proclaimed its support for the UN’s role in the conflict, most recently when 37 AU countries attended a Moroccan conference in Marrakech in March on the issue.

Rabat – After threatening, around 305 doctors in Morocco’s Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region submitted their resignation letters on Thursday in protest over what they called “the deterioration of the health system in the Tangier region and the absence of [proper] work conditions in public hospitals.” According to a petition addressed to the Ministry of Health regional director in Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima, “the move came in view of the catastrophic conditions the health sector is experiencing, which does not meet the scientific conditions in force internationally.” The doctors argued, “The health sector does not live up to the citizens’ aspirations and expectations to ensure their right to treatment as a constitutional right in addition to the absence of social dialogue by officials.” The doctors have gone on several marches in protest of their work conditions and calling for improvements to the health system and a rise in wages. They accuse the government of disrespecting their rights and blame it for what they call the failure of the health sector. The doctors say the sector is entering  “the heart attack phase.” The move came at the same time as medical students are protesting the Ministry of Health’s agreements with private medical schools, which they call “a blow to the meritocracy principle, the equality of chances, and a threat to the training quality in the university hospitals.” In October 2018, approximately 130 doctors left the health sector in the Casablanca-Settat; 40 doctors resigned in the Oriental region; and 30 doctors quit in Ouarzazate province.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has instructed Morocco’s governmental departments in charge of water policy to improve water supply for Moroccan homes, especially in the remote localities in the northern and southern provinces. The firm royal instructions came during a high-profile meeting on water policy on Thursday in Rabat, according to a press release from the Royal Cabinet. At this period of the year, just before the holy month of Ramadan and high tourism season in summer, demand for water and other resources grows substantially, according the press statement. But the increase in water demands is also linked to the existence of industrial plants and other development projects launched in recent years in many of the concerned regions, the statement noted. “These socio-economic projects such as the Renault automobile industrial plants or the Tangier Tech Mohammed VI initiative launched in cooperation with Chinese partners require an improvement in the water supply of the regions,” the statement explained. In his instructions, the King emphasized that all relevant ministries should work together to meet the increasing demand for water. In line with the King’s instructions, the government water department promised that “the needs in water will be met thanks to interconnection programs” linking three dam projects in the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region. The projects include the Bni Mansour dam, set to have a capacity of over 1 billion cubic meters. The King’s appeal, which falls within the bounds of the country’s new inclusive and sustainable development model, is a further illustration of the Moroccan monarch’s push to improve the efficiency of public service in meeting the demands of the country’s most needy households, the statement suggested. Also included in the royal statement was the King’s insistence that subsequent meetings and government actions be organized to “accord special importance” to securing and improving water supply for “regions that have chronically lagged behind.”

Rabat – After stating that English would not be able to replace French in Moroccan schools any time soon, Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi has spoken of the “excellent” cooperation between Morocco and France in the field of education. The minister made the comment while speaking about the International Baccalaureate Option (OIB), which he said reflects their “excellent” cooperation. Amzazi said that the excellence of the Rabat-Paris cooperation was the “fertile ground on which the successful OIB experience that emerged in the kingdom was developed.” The minister made his remarks during a meeting under the theme “Arabic, French: a shared ambition.” The meeting comes on the heel of a national debate over the language of instruction of scientific subjects in Moroccan schools. Currently, schools teach in standard Arabic, but Amzazi supports a bill that would allow schools to teach scientific subjects in French. Some scholars and politicians oppose the bill and are in support of the Arabization of the education system. The event was organized by the Royal Moroccan Academy in partnership with the French embassy in Rabat on the 30th anniversary of OIB. “The introduction of the OIB option in schools under the authority of the Agency for French Education Abroad (AEFE), an experience that began in Morocco, to our great pride, constitutes today a true path of excellence and a lever for student success at national and international levels,” said Amzazi. He added that Moroccans enrolled in OIB courses can acquire “not only perfect bilingualism but also knowledge and attachment to their Moroccan culture.” Languages are full of culture, identity Amzazi commented that everyone is “aware that languages are not just tools for communication or learning, but that they are full of culture, identity and history that make them all the more endearing.” The minister also spoke of how the Ministry of Education provides AEFE schools with more than 200 teachers of the Arabic language. Minister Amzazi is known for his defense of the proposed education bill, Law 51.17, which would reintroduce the French language into the education system. In January, the minister said that English cannot replace French in Moroccan schools for at least 10 years. Amzazi explained that Morocco does not have trained teachers in English for the language to be able to replace French.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has informed the government of the recent developments in the Western Sahara conflict in the aftermath of the two UN-sponsored roundtable discussions in Geneva in December and March. In a statement to the press on Thursday after the weekly government council, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said that Bourita had discussed Western Sahara with some “international players.” Bourita had reiterated Morocco’s positions on the political process to them. The official also informed the “parties” of how Algeria, Mauritania, and Polisario participated in the talks. Bourita also shared with the international players about the MINURSO delegation’s management and “some ideas and unproductive projects related to this matter.” While El Khalfi did not explain which countries were the “international parties,” earlier this week, Bourita attended the Russia-Arab forum in Russia. He also concluded a tour of Gulf countries last week. Bourita discussed Morocco’s principles in the conflict during an interview with Russian news outlet Sputnik and said that Morocco will not offer any other political solution outside of its autonomy plan. “If the other parties had a real will, Morocco has presented its initiative of autonomy,” Bourita said. The official also warned that the  North African country not be willing to “continue discussions on non-practical and non-consensual issues.”

Rabat – Before even graduating college, 23-year-old Tangier-native Younes Bensouda Mourri was already giving lectures. During his senior year, Mourri was working as a teaching assistant and gave his first lecture on deriving linear regression in front of a class of 30. Some of the students in the room were undergraduates like him, while others were pursuing Ph.D.s. “It is scary to teach because you have people from all different types of backgrounds and you have to cater to everyone’s needs,” Mourri told Morocco World News. “I was shaking a little during my first lecture.” Now pursuing his masters in statistics at Stanford University in California, Mourri is specializing in artificial intelligence (AI). He has also gone from occasionally giving lectures to teaching several computer science classes. Mourri is the primary instructor of “Applied Machine Learning” and “Teaching Artificial Intelligence,” while also being a course advisor for the class “Deep Learning.” He is credited with co-creating all three of these classes. Besides working with students in person, Mourri has also taken to teaching online.  Alongside Professor Andrew Ng, with whom he has worked with to co-create classes, Mourri has also developed content for the online course “Machine Learning” hosted on Coursera, an online learning platform. “I was hired by the AI lab to improve the online ‘Machine Learning’ course and ended up redesigning a lot of the assignments because they were boring,” Mourri said. “I also worked on improving the class’ grading system.” He is credited with redesigning 12 of the class assignments and building an auto-grader that grades millions of submissions in real time. “Working online is incredible because I can be in my room making assignments for thousands of people all over the world,” Mourri said. “When you teach in the classroom, at most, you impact a few hundred students. But when you do it online your reach is endless.” But working online provides a different set of challenges. “Online, when you design an assignment, build a course or develop notes, you can’t make any mistakes,” Mourri said. “When you make a mistake it is a huge issue because there is no one else to help the students. Whatever you write has to be self explanatory and accurate because the students have no one else to go to if you’re wrong.” The “machine learning” course is considered the most popular AI online class in the world. Nearly 100,000 have rated the course, giving it a 4.9 out of 5 stars.  “This class is so special and appeals to a broad audience because it explains a complicated topic in an understandable way,” Mourri said. “Anyone interested in breaking into the field of AI can enroll in this course and learn the basics. We make a complicated topic friendly.” The course has also received as many as 25,000 reviews, many of them lauding the design of the class. “An amazing skills of teaching and [a] very well structured course for people start[ing] to learn … machine learning. The assignments are very good for understanding the practical side of machine learning,” wrote an online student, with the initials “AQ,” in one of the class’s reviews.  Mourri’s future is uncertain, but he hopes to take everything he has learned and put it to good use. “I’d love to one day begin an educational startup that works with schools to teach K-12 students computer science and AI. The current education system teaches students to compete against robots, when really, we should be teaching them to program the robots,” Mourri said. “I’m going to take all the AI I know and build something meaningful to help student[s] all over the world.” ——— This story was updated on April 20, 2019 to include original statements from Younes Bensouda Mourri.

Rabat – The media advocacy organization Reporters without Borders (RSF) ranked Morocco 135th out of 180 countries in its 2019 annual report on freedom of press.  RSF described Morocco as a “very difficult” country in which to practice journalism, along with 29% of all the countries it studied. RSF blamed the difficulties journalists in Morocco face on “judicial harassment.”  The organization reported that, in addition to legal proceedings against professional and citizen journalists, Moroccan “authorities deliberately obstructed the national and foreign media that tried to cover the so-called Hirak protests in northern Morocco’s Rif region, as well as reporting on migration, a subject that is now off limits.” On Thursday, April 18, Reporters Without Borders released the report, which measures the degree of safety journalists have. The outcomes are based on “pooling the responses of experts” through a questionnaire that measures pluralism, media independence, media environment and self-censorship, legislative framework, transparency, and the quality of the infrastructure that supports the production of news and information. Journalism in North Africa According to the report, both Morocco and Algeria took steps backward. Morocco scored 44.98 (on a scale in which 0 is best and 100 is worst), compared to 43.13 in the 2018 report. While Morocco maintained its 135th ranking since 2018, it has been sliding down the ranking of 130th in the 2015 report. Of the 336 journalists who remained in prison in 2018, RSF notes eight were in Morocco. Morocco arrested eight journalists, citizen-journalists, and media assistants between May and August 2017: Hamid El Mahdaoui, Rabiaa Lablak, Houssein El Idrissi, Jawad Al Sabity, Abdelkabir Al Hor, Abdelali Haddou, Fouad Assaidi, and Mohamed Al Asrihi. With a score of 45.75, Algeria now ranks 141st and has ranked steadily worse since its 2014 ranking of 121st. For other countries in North Africa, Tunisia ranked 72nd, Mauritania ranked 94th,  Libya ranked 162nd, and Egypt ranked 163rd. Morocco’s Ministry of Culture and Communication rejected RSF’s 2018 report as “biased” and “inaccurate,” arguing that Morocco enjoys “an atmosphere of freedom and independence, without any direct or indirect censorship.” The report estimates the number of journalists killed at 80 in 2018. The organization found that Afghanistan was the most dangerous country to be a journalist, and the Capital Gazette shooting  made the United States another of the “deadliest” countries for journalists.  RSF was able to verify that eight journalists were killed as a direct result of their journalistic work in 2018, including one citizen journalist and one media assistant.

Rabat – The Moroccan government under the instruction of King Mohammed VI will financially contribute to the reconstruction of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. The Moroccan ambassador to France Chakib Benmoussa informed the Archbishop of Paris of Morocco’s decision. In his message to the Paris Archbishop, Benmoussa reiterated King Mohammed VI’s full solidarity and support following the fire that ravaged the cathedral on Monday evening. The Archbishop of Paris, Monseigneur Aupetit,  said, “I want to thank his majesty the King of Morocco for the contribution.” The Archbishop, who described the gesture as an “important sign of friendship,” expressed his gratitude to King Mohammed VI with the Moroccan ambassador., Recalling the visit of Pope Francis to Morocco, the bishop hinted at the Moroccan monarch’s commitment to advancing inter-religious dialogue. “We are extremely touched,” he said. The move comes in the wake of what has been called a historic papal visit to Morocco, with King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis emphasizing religious dialogue and solidarity their several public addresses .  In recent months, the Moroccan monarch has established himself as the voice of fraternity between the three Abrahamic religions. In a similar move, King Mohammed VI also ordered the Moroccan government to allocate subvential financial contribution to restore the  Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, one of the holiest sites in Islam. On Monday, Christians, Jews, and Muslims expressed solidarity with France after a fire broke out in the Paris’ iconic Notre Dame Cathedral. In France and across, people mourned the loss of what many described as a great monument of our civilization and our common humanity.  Several billionaires pledge millions of euros to rebuild the cathedral, one of the oldest in the world.

Rabat – While emphasizing the importance of the mining sector in Morocco, Minister of Energy Aziz Rabbah also spoke about the challenges it faces. The official delivered a presentation during the opening of the Marrakech Mining Convention, held April 17-19 in Marrakech, convening officials from 15 African countries and European states. In his presentation, Rabbah said that Moroccan mines produced 35.11 million tons of minerals in 2017. Phosphate, a major pillar in Morocco’s economy, represents 90% of the mining production. The official added that mineral investments amounted to MAD 14 billion, and Morocco has a strategy to develop the sector by 2025. Rabbah said that the main goal of the strategy is to develop investment in mineral exploration to the tune of MAD 4 billion ($416 million). The official remarked that one of the sector’s challenges is to “attract maximum investors.” Rabbah also hopes that the strategy will help create 30,000 direct jobs. “It was necessary to assess what was done, assess achievements and asses the difficulties and impediments that emerged five years after the launching of this strategy,” he said. Rabbah added that his ministry is “working on the preparation and launching of Morocco’s mineral plan,” which aims to make the sector a “model” industry by 2025. Investment can be risky, Rabbah noted, because studies and exploration take a lot of time “and we cannot expect immediate profit.” During his presentation, Rabbah also called for the development of services related to the sector, including transport and logistic services. “We do not focus enough on these services.”

Rabat – The Credit Agricole du Maroc Group (GCAM) has signed a memorandum of understanding with the French Development Agency (AFD) to set up a €50 million credit line to finance agricultural projects. The chairman of GCAM’s board, Tariq Sijilmassi, signed the MoU with the director of AFD’s office in Morocco, Mihoub Mezouaghi, at the 14th International Agricultural Exhibition (SIAM 2019) in Morocco. The credit line will be used to finance agricultural and agri-food projects with a dimension of sustainable development and the protection of natural resources. The AFD supports financing Morocco’s sustainable projects in various fields, primarily fighting land degradation and promoting organic farming, agroforestry use of renewable energies, energy efficiency, and waste treatment. Technical assistance will also be provided as part of the MoU for better structuring, and also for its clients to support their growth and sustainable development. “This new line of credit will help the holders of agricultural projects to more sustainable and less expensive production solutions including the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and the consumption of water and phytosanitary products,” Mezouaghi said.  Mezouaghi added that it is also a question of switching from regular agriculture practices to an alternative agricultural system with higher added value, like organic agriculture, which relies on ecological processes, biodiversity, and cycles adapted to local conditions.

Rabat – Morocco’s Office Cherifien de Phosphates (OCP), a global leader in the production of fertilizers, is gradually positioning itself to take center stage in what the company sees as the coming African agricultural revolution. Having already invested in the latest technologies and state-of-the-art agricultural methods to advance its interests in the rest of Africa, the Moroccan company is setting its eyes on “more ambitious projects” on the continent, a statement from the company’s management indicated. The new project entails investing in artificial intelligence (AI) and “Big Data” to upgrade efficiency in production and prepare for the challenges likely to face African agriculture in a decade. In its statement, OCP Africa noted that, once completed, the new project would allow the company to use satellite imagery, weather forecast, and historical data to predict and respond to the fluctuations and demands of the continent’s agriculture industry. “Thanks to this tool, we will be able to think ahead of market’s changes and evolutions and be operationally prepared to meet our clients’ demands,” the company noted. Also included in OCP’s new vision for its African venture is the establishment of an e-market platform to ease African farmers’ access to global agricultural trends. On the e-platform, farmers will find information about prices of supplies and weather forecasts. To familiarize farmers with its digitization project, OCP Africa said it would increase investments in its agri-booster and agri-promoter projects, two of the four signature projects that have gained OCP its current continental influence. Both are training and expertise-enhancing platforms for African farmers. OCP Africa has used the two projects in the past two years to finance agriculture-linked education. Training involves familiarizing farmers with the types of fertilizers most compatible with the kind of soil they work with. The company has organized contests for agriculture start-ups across the continent. It has also provided university scholarships for agricultural and environment engineering students. Most of the scholarships have been to study at the OCP-linked newly established Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Ben Guerir, central Morocco. In the 16 African countries where it operates, OCP Africa has also organized numerous training sessions for local farmers. Since 2016, when the Moroccan giant launched its OCP Africa label, OCP has become a major actor in many African countries. The company is currently present in 16 countries, including Nigeria, Kenya, Cote d’Ivoire, Senegal, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. Most recently, OCP Africa joined forces with the Ethiopian government to improve the country’s agricultural output. Both actors said that Pan-African Fertilizers, as the $50 million joint project is called, aims to secure the two countries’ prominence in African affairs. At the same time, the project is said to be part of the shared vision for food security and sustainable development in Africa.

Rabat – German football giant Bayern Munich is interested in recruiting Moroccan footballer Hakim Ziyech, who currently plays for Ajax Amsterdam. International news outlets reported that the Bundesliga giant wants to sign the Ajax star for a transfer value of €35 million, which appears to be less than what Ajax expects for one of its stars. Ziyech took part in a spectacular game between Ajax and Juventus on Tuesday when the Dutch football club ousted the Italian giant of the Champions League. According to 90min.com, Chelsea and Arsenal are also keen to secure a contract with the Moroccan footballer. In February, Calciomercato also reported that Chelsea is interested in the footballer this summer. Ziyech joined Ajax in 2017. In April 2018, Ziyech clinched the title of the player of the year in his Dutch team after he led them to a major win against AZ Alkmaar. Born in the Netherlands to Moroccan parents, the 26-year-old is also admired by Moroccan football fans. The footballer made his debut for Morocco’s national team in October 2015 in a friendly match with Cote d’Ivoire. He also played for Morocco in the 2018 World Cup. Ziyech previously played for the Netherlands in the Under 19, Under 20, and Under 21 teams between 2012 and 2014.

Washington, D.C. – Following over two months of massive peaceful protests, the Algerian people have managed to take an important step towards ending the political vacuum their country has experienced for more than six years because of the ailing health of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Bouteflika’s resignation has led many to feel upbeat about Algeria’s political future and foreign policy to the point of speaking of a new era for the country. For its neighbor Morocco, the dynamics of relations between the two regional powers in the Maghreb might be set for a change. While the Moroccan government has been conspicuously silent and steered away from interfering in Algeria’s domestic affairs, many Moroccans publicly lauded the peaceful way in which the Algerian people achieved Bouteflika’s departure. Many Moroccan social media users have expressed hope that Bouteflika’s resignation will result in mended relations between Morocco and Algeria and a lasting political solution to the dispute over Western Sahara. For observers eager to witness the end of the mistrust that has affected Moroccan-Algerian relations and resulted in the closure of their border for the most part of the past 50 years, Bouteflika’s departure may give a glimmer of hope. They hope the two countries will turn the page and work cooperatively to make the dream of a unified Maghreb a reality. For others, including me, such an optimistic scenario is out of reach in the foreseeable future. The trend of confrontational interactions and a history of disagreement on key issues, especially the Saharan problem, might prevent such a rosy outcome. Though Bouteflika was known for his hard anti-Morocco rhetoric, he was just a representative of a political elite that continue to see Morocco as an existential threat to Algeria. That political elite works in tandem with the army, which has played a central role in the country’s politics and foreign policy in the past five decades. When analyzing Algeria’s politics, its future, or its relations with Morocco, one should not lose sight of the fact that the army rules the country, and it is the institution that decides who will ascend to power. Bouteflika’s fall, therefore, is merely a symbolic victory. Army’ not ready to give up its power The best evidence of the army’s unparalleled influence in Algerian politics is that President Bouteflika was forced to step down when the army’s Chief of Staff General Ahmed Gaid Salah brandished Article 102 of the Algerian Constitution. The article stipulates that the Constitutional Council should remove the president if he is suffering from a severe illness that prevents him from fully exercising his duties. To apply the provision, the Algerian Parliament should, in principle, announce it at the request of the Constitutional Council, and the Parliament should vote on it by a two-thirds majority. Salah was the one to announce the possibility of using the article, which clearly highlights the pivotal role that the Algerian army plays in Algerian politics. The way in which the Algerian president stepped down was not democratic. it is rather a peaceful military coup by the army chief of staff against his former boss. It is unlikely that the political movement we are seeing today will create the democratic transformation the people aspire to. Gaid Salah’s decision to force Bouteflika to step down was not driven by his sympathy for the demonstrators or a belief that the time has come to put the country on the path to democracy. It was based on personal calculations and his desire to save the regime. Just before President Bouteflika stepped down, Gaid Salah was among the long-time loyalists who supported his initial decision to run for a fifth term in office. When he realized that the Algerian people were determined to end Bouteflika’s rule, Salah vociferously called for the application of Article 102 of the Constitution. Gaid Salah’s sudden change of heart aimed to make Algerian people think he understood their demands and aspirations, and make himself the hero who rid the country of Bouteflika and his cronies and preserved its stability. Army’s central role in Algeria’s politics Since Algeria’s independence in 1962, the army’s stranglehold over the country’s domestic and foreign policy has manifested itself in the fact that among its five presidents, three came from the army: Houari Boumediene, Chadli Bennjid, and Liamine Zeroual. Although Bouteflika was a civilian, he was elected in 1999 and remained in power thanks to the support of the army. The army also intervened to prevent Islamists from taking power after the democratic elections in 1992. As long as the army controls the levers of power in Algeria, and as long as the same military leaders and their cronies rule the country, it is impossible to predict a significant thaw in relations between Morocco and Algeria, let alone any progress in the political process in Western Sahara. Since its creation more than 50 years ago, the Algerian army’s mainstay has been to weaken Morocco and to avenge the humiliation it suffered at the hands of the Moroccan army in the 1963 Sand War. The dispute over Western Sahara and Algeria’s support for Polisario for more than 42 years is simply a means to achieve that end. When Algeria was under the leadership of the late President Mohamed Boudiaf, who was assassinated in 1992, the Algerian army did not approve of his closeness to Morocco and his willingness to open a new chapter in relations with Rabat. Even if Algerian investigations concluded that Boudiaf’s assassination was an isolated incident, it is likely he paid the price for his intention to rebuild relations with Morocco, where he lived for more than 30 years before returning to Algeria. Boudiaf’s son, Nacer, has challenged the Algerian government’s official version and implied that his father was killed by the same people who had asked him to lead Algeria at the time. In an interview with Algerian news outlet Le Matin D’Algerie in June 2012, Nacer Boudiaf accused the army of being involved in the assassination of his father. He said his father had a falling out with high-ranking army officials who tried to convince him to cancel a long-planned trip to Morocco to attend his son’s engagement party. A psychological barrier that is hard to overcome Five decades of mistrust, mutual grievances, and lack of cooperation and dialogue have created a colossal psychological barrier between Morocco and Algeria that will be difficult to overcome. It would be wishful thinking to believe that the ousting of a president will pave the way to a reconciliation between the two countries. That psychological barrier was made thicker and impenetrable by the fiery rhetoric that Bouteflika and his successive governments have used against Morocco for the past 20 years. In the first speech he delivered upon his election as president in 1999, Bouteflika lashed out at Morocco and said the Algerian political and military elite had still not forgotten the humiliation, or as he put it the “hogra,” that Morocco inflicted on Algeria in 1963. Even if one assumes that the Algerian army no longer controls the country, nothing can guarantee that the political elite and the bureaucracy that has been at the helm of the country in the past five decades will get rid of the anti-Moroccan sentiment that has permeated Algerian rhetoric towards Morocco. The turn of events in Algeria since Bouteflika’s resignation suggests that Algeria’s political, military, and business elites have no intention to give up a system from which they have benefited for decades. Bouteflika was forced to step down only to be replaced by Abdelkader Bensalah, his long-time loyalist. The Algerian regime may benefit from an external environment where regional players such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have seen any democratic momentum in Arab countries as an existential threat to their rule. Unless a miracle happens and the Algerian oligarchy decides to give up its power and privileges for the sake of the country’s future, the Algerian people’s demands may be hijacked in the same way as they were hijacked in Egypt and Libya. Meanwhile, Algeria will pursue the same foreign policy towards Morocco. In the past decade, Morocco has made multiple overtures to Algeria. The latest attempt was made during King Mohammed VI’s speech on the 43rd anniversary of the Green March last November, when he called on Algeria to open a meaningful dialogue without preconditions and in good faith. Morocco’s offer, however, fell on deaf ears. To show more good faith, Morocco should perhaps go further and express regret for accusing the Algerian intelligence services of causing the Marrakech terrorist attack of 1994 and for immediately imposing visa restrictions on Algerians. A former Algerian foreign minister argued that Morocco’s move despite Algeria’s denial of any involvement in the attack has deepened Algeria’s grievances and mistrust of Morocco. Regardless of any Moroccan good faith move towards Algeria, an improvement in Rabat-Algiers relations can only come about when the Algerian elite: gives up its resentment of Morocco, stops using Western Sahara as a card to weaken their neighbor, and admits Morocco’s instrumental role in helping Algeria achieve independence. Algerian leaders will have to realize that both countries share a common destiny and common threats and their people have the same aspirations for democracy, freedom of movement, prosperity, and stability. These goals can only be achieved if Morocco and Algeria work hand in hand to turn the unified Maghreb into a reality and a regional powerhouse to reckon with globally. Thus far, nothing indicates that the Algerian elite is ready to open a new chapter in its relations with Morocco, let alone admit its responsibility in prolonging the Western Sahara conflict. So Bouteflika’s departure is, therefore, unlikely to result in any thaw in the relations between Morocco and Algeria or the resolution of the Western Sahara dispute.

Rabat – Morocco’s leading mining firm Managem is considering raising $200 million through the sale of non-convertible bonds to fund development plans. The bonds will have a maturity of up to seven years.  They plan to have the terms of issuance approved by Managem’s general assembly on May 6.  The company’s annual profit attributable to shareholders rose 2% in 2018 to $38.5 million. But, just last month, Managem revealed that it experienced a 16% decrease in its total 2018 revenue to $454.5 million from the previous year’s revenue. The dip is due to metal prices falling internationally and the company’s Bakkoudou gold mine in Gabon closing.  Managem, which produces gold, silver cobalt, and copper, is controlled by the Moroccan royal family’s holding company, Almada.  The company has been part of the rapid growth seen by Morocco’s mining sector, which ranked second in the MENA region in 2018.  Morocco has consistently seen improved performance in the sector since updating its mining code in 2015 to increase legal clarity and encourage foreign investment.  In addition to Morocco, Managem operates in Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Mali, and Sudan.

Rabat –  The International Committee for the Support of the Palestinian People welcomed King Mohammed VI’s initiative to grant a “substantial financial subvention” to restore Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock compound in occupied Jerusalem. The committee issued a statement to thank the King for his initiative and his commitments as the chairman of the Al Quds Committee within the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. In the statement, the committee emphasized the King’s permanent interest and solicitude towards the site’s civilization and heritage and its  “spiritual dimension for the three monotheistic religions.” The committee also appreciated the constant support of the monarch, the Moroccan government, and the people of Morocco for the freedom of Palestine. On Wednesday, King Mohammed VI pledged his support by announcing Morocco would contribute a “substantial financial subvention” to restore Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of the holiest sites in Islam. The initiative, according to Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is part of the King’s commitment to preserving the historical symbol of Jerusalem. The Moroccan government will also send a team of architects and engineers to help with restoration. The King’s initiative came three days after a fire broke out at the Dome of the Rock compound in Jerusalem. The fire affected a guard’s room near the Marwani Prayer Room, also known as Solomon’s Stables. The Moroccan initiative towards Al-Aqsa Mosque is one of many Moroccan gestures to show solidarity with the Palestinian cause. The initiative also followed the appeal for Jerusalem signed by the King and Pope Francis in March to preserve the city and protect it from all actions aimed at changing its status.

Rabat – The Moroccan Ministry of the Interior has reassured consumers that the current market is “distinguished by an abundant supply that meets all needs” before and during the holy month of Ramadan. All essential goods will be available in stable quantities, according to the ministry, with some changes in the prices of some products compared to the previous year. The ministry’s statement is part of an annual procedure, in which central authorities and provincial and local commissions monitor prices and the goods available ahead of the month of Ramadan. On Wednesday, Minister Delegate to the Minister of the Interior Noureddine Boutayeb chaired a meeting in Rabat to discuss the supply of goods in the national market, especially for products in high demand during Ramadan. Boutayeb urged provincial administrations to regularly monitor markets to preserve purchasing power and product quality. The official also called on relevant parties to deal with vendors and distributors who violate rules on price, the quality of food products, and conditions of storage. Boutayeb also ordered intensive coordination meetings at regional and provincial levels supervised by the governors of all regions. During Ramadan, Boutayeb said, government officials must interact positively and seriously with citizens’ complaints. The minister offered a national hotline, 5757, for consumers to file their complaints regarding the quality and prices of products. The interior minister’s remarks followed a statement from Minister Delegate for Governance Lahcen Daoudi, who said that the national market has prepared foods in sufficient quantities for Ramadan. Daoudi noted a drop in food prices in contrast with last year, “particularly those of chickpeas.” He assured consumers that the prices would not change during Ramadan. A Moroccan astronomer said earlier this month that Ramadan fasting will begin on May 7 in Morocco.

Rabat – At the fifth Session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD) in Marrakech on Wednesday, April 17, delegates elected Morocco president of the forum.  The secretary of state to the Ministry of Energy, Mines, and Sustainable Development, Nezha El Ouafi, will lead Morocco’s one-year presidency over the forum. ARFSD 2019 revolved around the theme “Empowering people and ensuring inclusion and equality.” The forum opened on Tuesday at the Palais des Congres de la Palmeraie in the ochre city of Marrakech. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani noted that the forum would explore how to speed up the implementation of socio-economic development initiatives and environmental protection in Africa, in accordance with the UN’s sustainable development goals and Development Agenda 2030.  Morocco and the UN Economic Commission for Africa co-organized ARFSD 2019, which will conclude April 18.  El Othmani opened the forum with a speech reaffirming Morocco’s commitment, as enshrined in the 2011 Constitution, to put in place the basis for sustainable development in Africa. El Othmani stated, “We hope that this session will make it possible to analyze the current situation and propose solutions likely to achieve sustainable development for Africa and its peoples, in accordance with the spirit of the new UN Agenda 2030.”  He also stressed the significance of sustainable development as a global dynamic and a right for all citizens and Morocco’s role in implementing socio-economic development programs for the enhancement of renewable energies, energy efficiency, water saving, and the sustainable management of solid and liquid waste. The newly elected board of the ARFSD includes Angola as deputy, Chad as second vice-president, Uganda as third vice-president, and Guinea as rapporteur. Morocco takes over from Senegal to take charge of representing the forum’s recommendations to the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in New York in July.

Rabat – In December 2018, the Casablanca-based nonprofit Racines received an unexpected letter from the Ministry of the Interior requesting the organization, a cultural group, appear at court. None of its seven staff knew why. It was the first step in a legal battle that would entangle Racines for the next five months. The case ended Tuesday, April 16, when the Casablanca Appellate Court ordered that Racines dissolve and cease all activity—the first time Morocco has ever formally dissolved an established NGO, multiple sources confirmed to Morocco World News. The court affirmed the prosecution’s stance, which was that Racines had “failed in its actions as provided for in its statues,” organizing work outside of its domain as a cultural nonprofit and offending institutions, a ruling that Morocco maintains is legal both under its Constitution and international law. In the wake of the ruling, Racines’ staff and supporters gathered at a cafe across the street from the court, disbelieving but resigned. They said the pronouncement raised new concerns about Morocco’s commitment to freedom of expression and association, which the kingdom often promotes in its official discourse. “But aside from all the politics, we had this hope for justice that would consider Racines’ work,” Dounia Benslimane, co-founding member of Racines and its former executive director, told Morocco World News after the court pronounced its ruling. “It’s a pity.” The appeal had been their final, tantalizing chance to preserve the association, which for nine years worked to promote culture, the arts, and civic engagement across the country. At a hearing that lasted less than a minute, the judge had swept it away. “We weren’t expecting this,” Benslimane said. She stirred her coffee and shook her head. Beside her, a friend had pulled up footage of flames eating at the Notre-Dame Cathedral the day before in Paris. For everyone at the table, it mirrored their own loss. “We expected everything,” Benslimane continued. “But not this.” But looking back, Benslimane and Aadel Essaadani—another of Racines’ co-founders—admit they could have seen it coming. Since September 2018, there had been signs that the organization was in legal trouble.  Last year, in the months before the initial hearing, the Casablanca authorities had refused Racines their association registration receipt, though withholding such documentation is illegal under Moroccan law. Government officials had made critical comments. The December call to court indicated that the incidents were part of a greater pattern. Racines had attracted the scrutiny of Casablanca’s authorities. On December 12, armed with a lawyer and a growing sense of apprehension, Benslimane and Essaadani showed up at court, where they were informed that Racines faced charges for “political activity that ran contrary to the association’s statutes” and that contained “clear offenses towards institutions.”  The charges referred to a particularly fiery episode of the contentious YouTube talk show “Un Diner Deux Cons,” (One Dinner Two Fools) which was filmed at Racines’ premises in August and contained criticism of the Moroccan government. The episode received widespread condemnation from Moroccan officials and many of the public. Racines mounted its defense. First, they said, “Un Diner Deux Cons” was unaffiliated with Racines. The episode, though political, was not part of Racines’ official activity. And either way, an explicit objective of Racines was to promote free expression, so the episode fell within the bounds of its statutes, they argued.  (None of Racines’s activity reports mention the talk show, and, according to an independent analysis, the talk show’s YouTube channel is not linked to Racines.) Racines presented the arguments at its first hearing and each subsequent appeal, to no avail. But when the world heard of the ruling against Racines in December, there was a swift, clamorous response.  The initial December order raised eyebrows at international organizations like Human Rights Watch and sparked protest from a long line of public figures—from linguist Noam Chomsky to Moroccan director Farida Belyazid.  Morocco rejected the position of Human Rights Watch and other organizations, noting that under international law, the right to association may be restricted “in the interest of national security, public safety, public order, or to protect public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others.” But the campaign by Moroccan journalist Mohamed Sammouni, “In Solidarity with Racines,” amassed the support of thousands. The phrase “Dissolution is not the solution” served as the rallying cry of Racines and its supporters, a variation of the association’s original slogan, “Culture is the solution.” In its Casablanca office, the two mottos crop up everywhere—painted on walls, etched on T-shirts, and printed on stickers.  The office, spacious and spray-painted, was the backdrop for the August 24 episode of “Un Diner Deux Cons” that started the whole case. Racines will give up the space now that they are dissolved, although its staff do not know when. “It’s a beautiful place that reflects really the spirit, the mood of [Un Diner Deux Cons],” said Amine Belghazi, co-creator of “Un Diner Deux Cons.” “This creativity, this liberty, et cetera.” In the episode, titled, “The Epic of the Nihilists,” eight men, including Essaadani and Belghazi, lounge at a long table, eating dinner and bantering about Moroccan politics. Most of the discussion revolves around an August speech by King Mohammed VI, which they criticize. It was the second episode of the program filmed at Racines’ premises. “The Epic of the Nihilists” drew condemnation from media outlets and government officials after its release, both for the inflammatory statements and for the behavior of the guests, some of whom drink alcohol on camera.  Idriss Azami Al-Idriss, a politician with the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD), was one of the episode’s most high-profile critics. In a September 2018 speech, he decried the show, warning that such content could harm Morocco’s society and stability. “The program does not have any real added value in the social debate, as much as it turns around and distracts [people] from social issues that contribute to ensuring justice, development, and dignity,” Al-Idriss said. Some comments on the video from Moroccan viewers strongly criticize the show, arguing it depicts Morocco poorly. Others are supportive. But Belghazi maintains that the intentions of “Un Diner Deux Cons” are only to present an honest depiction of Moroccan society.  “[The show] is like the meetings we organize in private life,” he said. “Just with cameras.” Belghazi claims the show has more supporters than it does critics. But controversy has dogged “Un Diner Deux Cons” since its first episode, and legal retaliation did not surprise him. He intended the show to be polemical. What was unexpected, said several involved, was the action against Racines, as it only hosted the program. “There is a trend of suppression of free speech in this country, and that’s been going on for quite awhile. So in that regard, I was not surprised—that there was a reaction,” Ahmed Benchemsi, communications director for Human Rights Watch’s MENA division and a guest on the August episode, told Morocco World News.  But Benchemsi found the order to dissolve Racines strange.  “Because why attack Racines? They didn’t do anything,” he said. “They could have gone after the show itself. Why didn’t they do that? That’s a question that remains open.” Co-founding Racines marked a radical shift in Dounia Benslimane’s life. She had worked for years in pharmaceuticals—rigid, meticulous work utterly unlike that of Racines, which operates in the messy realm of culture.  Benslimane, Essaadani, and several others started Racines as a side project in 2010. The association soon mushroomed into a much larger endeavor. “It started to be very important for me to have this feeling of being useful to the community, to be part of something bigger,” Benslimane explained at their office back in March, over several cups of tea. At the time, she and the rest of the staff were busy at work on a cultural citizenship project and an incubator for local artists. They were dangling in legal purgatory, but they could still work. Spirits were high. Racines used culture as a medium for social change and civic engagement. It trained artists, created resources on citizenship and civic education, and advocated for social change through diverse mediums—comics, theater, exhibitions, and workshops. Moroccan officials had supported Racines’ work in the past, and the organization has taken some government funding. But Tuesday’s ruling was based on the logic that as Racines was a cultural organization, political activity lay outside of its domain. Essaadani disputes this. “They think we are working in the field of culture because it’s about artistic things,” he said in March. “But when you work on culture, you need the freedom of expression for operation. It becomes political.” Racines, its staff said, was always about more than just art. And it was always about more than just Moroccan society. Racines was part of a vast global web of such civil society organizations with partnerships in dozens of countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Just last week, its staff helped launch a free speech observatory in Paris with several of their partners. “It’s quite huge, the work that we do,” Benslimane said in March. Today, she reckoned with the reality that the work must end. That was particularly difficult to think about, she said, considering the number of partnerships and donors they would lose, both at home and abroad. “It’s a very big step back, because it stopped everything,” she said. “But we are still individuals. We are part of this process also as individuals.” Racines’ staff would continue to work outside of the association, she explained. But a fundamental value of Racines was always collective action. The ruling took away that option. That is the great irony of the case, according to Benslimane and Essaadani. Racines’ spent nearly a decade working towards freedom of association and expression on a global scale, rights they believe the ruling violated. “It’s not only an issue in Morocco, in North African countries. These kinds of obstacles to civil society organizations are really becoming a worldwide issue,” Benslimane said. (A February Amnesty International report gave the example of Racines in its broader critique of Morocco’s human rights track record, although Rabat has strongly opposed Amnesty’s narrative, noting that civil society organizations in Morocco number in the hundreds of thousands.) Racines was always aware of the global challenges facing freedom of expression and association, its staff said. It just never believed it would fall prey to them. But no one at the table voiced regret, just as it was in March, when Essaadani stood surveying Racines’ imperiled office, full of color and morning sunlight. When asked if he would choose to host “Un Diner Deux Cons” again if he could go back, he replied without hesitation. “If we have to do it again, we will do it,” he said. “It’s about freedom.”

Rabat – Although the Moroccan Ministry of Education had said it would not take legal measures against striking contractual teachers if they returned to work on Monday, April 15, the teachers are continuing their strike until April 25. The contractual teachers’ five most representative unions held a first round of negotiations with the Ministry of Education on April 13.  The unions stated that the government failed to meet contractual teachers’ primary demand, which is to be integrated into the public sector and for the government to end employment under fixed-term contracts. On March 9, the government proposed ending contracts, and permanently employing the teachers within regional academies, and guaranteeing them all the rights and labor protection permanent teachers have. Teachers refused the proposal. The next round of negotiations is scheduled for Tuesday, April 23. But the dialogue will likely not result in any agreement between the government and the representatives of “the forcibly contracted teachers,” as they call themselves.  In a statement, the National Coordination of the Forcibly Contracted Teachers (CNPCC) said it believes that the government will not act in favor of the contractual teachers to integrate them into the public sector. The coordination stated that the strike, in this case, will continue beyond April 25.  On Sunday, Morocco’s Ministry of Education announced it had reached an agreement with the contractual teachers following a meeting with the five most representative education unions and human rights representatives. All parties agreed that contractual teachers would resume work starting Monday. However, some teachers are still protesting, but others resumed work. The protests started February 18-20, when hundreds of contractors took to the streets to denounce the government’s “disregard” for their needs, “poor” social dialogue negotiations, problems in education and healthcare, and the deterioration of their situation.

Rabat – Morocco has expressed its commitment to finding a negotiated, lasting exit from the Libyan crisis. Rabat is calling on all parties, including Libyans and regional powers, to keep in sight the “supreme interest of the Libyan people” and to push for a solution that would prevent the already severe crisis from further escalation. Morocco’s foreign minister Nasser Bourita said Rabat’s view has always been that military intervention damages more than it resolves. He made the remarks while speaking to the press on Wednesday after a meeting with Jumaa al-Qamati, the personal envoy of Fayez el-Sarraj, the head of Libya’s internationally-recognized government in Tripoli. “Morocco has been following the Libyan situation with great concern, especially in light of the military escalation at the entrance of Tripoli and the possible consequences in terms of human tragedy and damaging impact on the stability of this fellow Maghreb country,” Bourita said. According to the Moroccan minister, Morocco has consistently believed that only a political process based on dialogue and compromise can bring back stability and restore faith in the possibility of a democratic transition in Libya. “The military option would only further complicate the country’s situation and [negatively] affect the stability and security of citizens,” Bourita explained. The “Skhirat agreement,” a Morocco-moderated peace process which has so far secured the stamp of el-Sarraj’s Government of National Accord and seeks to earn the trust of all the actors in Libya, has been touted by the international community, including the UN Security Council, as a serious endeavor towards democratic transition in Libya. Echoing that sentiment, Bourita said that dialogue has always been the trademark of King Mohammed VI in regional issues. Bourita promised that Morocco will do its utmost to help convince all stakeholders that sustained military confrontations benefit no parties. Also speaking at a press conference following his audience with Bourita, Jumaa al-Qamati, the Libyan envoy, echoed the same enthusiasm for a negotiated exit from the post-Arab Spring crisis in Libya. The Skhirat Agreement, the Libyan official said, should be considered the only legitimate and credible framework to resolve Libya’s political stalemate. Al-Qamati emphasized “the necessity to break away from the cycle of violence and return to peaceful means.” He explained: “The solution for Libya should be political, consensual, and peaceful rather than military.” Acknowledging Morocco’s efforts with the Skhirat Agreement, the Libyan official said that his government is “counting” on Morocco’s expanding geopolitical significance and its “proven interest in the stability and the unity of the Libyan people” to find a solution and “play a positive role” in the Libyan crisis. In addition to facilitating the national dialogue between Libyan actors, Rabat has also campaigned with regional powers to prevent actions that would fuel the crisis in Libya. Last week, Nasser Bourita toured the Gulf to send King Mohammed’s VI message of regional peace and solidarity. In a tour that saw him meet with regional leaders, including Saudi, Qatari, Kuwaiti, and Bahraini dignitaries, Bourita reiterated King Mohammed VI’s plea for joint efforts to uphold “principled” foreign policies on strong “bilateral cooperation” and unity around “the latest developments on the regional scene.”

Rabat – Morocco’s celebrated television actor Mahjoub Raji died of a heart attack on Wednesday, April 17, at the Sheikh Zayed Hospital in Rabat. Born in 1940, the actor was well-known for his impeccable comic roles both on television and the silver screen.  Originally from Casablanca, widely considered the Moroccan cradle for cinematic talents, Raji died at the age of 79 after a long battle with heart problems. Raji had undergone several heart surgeries.  Beginning at an early age, Raji embarked on his career as an actor in 1962 when he acted in the famous play “Al Waqi’a” (the Incident). The comic Raji also played leading roles in soap operas like Mohammed Ismail’s “Allal El Qalda” (Allal, the Sturdy) and Abderrahmane Mouline’s “Men Dar El Dar” (From House to House). One of the oldest actors in the Moroccan artistic scene, Raji also appeared on successful movies like Abderrahman Tazi’s “Lalla Hobbi,” Kamal Kamal’s “La Symphonie Marocaine” (the Moroccan Symphony), and Ahmed Boulane’s “Ali, Rabiaa, et les autres” (Ali, Rabiaa, and the Others).  The television host Atik Benchiguer announced the news of Raji’s death on Facebook Wednesday. Raji’s youngest daughter, Karima Raji, said King Mohammed IV had provided financial support for Raji’s treatment. Raji’s funeral procession was held Thursday in Rabat after the dhuhr noon prayer.

Rabat – Jiri Oberfalzer, the vice-speaker of the Czech Senate, has said that Morocco’s autonomy plan will “undoubtedly” offer a durable political solution to the “artificial” conflict over Western Sahara. The official made his remarks to the press after meeting Morocco’s secretary general to the foreign minister, Mounia Boucetta, on Wednesday in Rabat. Oberfalzer also recalled that his country supports the UN-led political process to find a peaceful, realistic, and durable political solution over the Sahara. The Czech Republic is one of many countries in Europe, Africa, and elsewhere that support Morocco’s autonomy plan introduced to the UN in 2007. The Moroccan government considers the autonomy plan as the only solution to end the conflict. The plan was created to develop the region. The plan also seeks to allow Sahrawis to manage their affairs through legislative, executive, and judicial bodies bodies with exclusive competences, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said in 2018. Supportive of the autonomy plan, the Czech Republic is also interested in business cooperation with Morocco. Oberfalzer said that Moroccan-Czech relations are on the right track, calling for further economic trade and boosting of bilateral diplomatic relations to achieve a strategic partnership. In March, the Moroccan government approved a bill that outlined a framework agreement on economic cooperation with the Czech Republic. The passing of the bill followed the signing of a trade agreement in December 2018 between the two countries as part of the Czech-Moroccan Business Forum in Casablanca. In December, Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani received Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis while he was in Rabat on a two-day business visit with several ministers and 37 business leaders. During his visit, Babis said, “Morocco could become the Czech Republic’s largest economic partner” in Africa at the launch of the Czech-Moroccan Business Forum in Casablanca. He also commented on Morocco’s leading role in the automotive sector. “Morocco is Africa’s largest car manufacturer. We import Renault and Dacia cars from Morocco.” Babis said. He added, “The Czech Republic exports 2,400 Skoda cars a year to Morocco. There is an ambition to reach 4000 soon.”

Rabat – Moroccan police in Oujda, eastern Morocco, arrested a 47-year-old Algerian national who was the subject of an Algerian extradition warrant. Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that the suspect was wanted for his suspected links to a criminal network active in drug and psychotropic tablet trafficking. The operation, according to DGSN, is part of international cooperation to ensure security. Moroccan police placed the suspect in custody for further investigation before studying the extradition request. Morocco’s preliminary investigation indicated that the suspect was involved in a criminal network that forged identity documents and passports. The network, which was helping Algerian nationals get Moroccan documents, was dismantled in Oujda in 2018, according to DGSN. The Moroccan security services arrested four other Algerian nationals who obtained counterfeit Moroccan identity documents, added DGSN, noting that the arrested individuals were brought to justice.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has pledged a “substantial financial subvention” as Morocco’s contribution towards restoring the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, a statement from the Moroccan cooperation and foreign affairs ministry has indicated. As the chairman of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation’s al-Quds Committee, the body pushing for more Palestine-friendly peace terms in the Israel-Palestine conflict, the Moroccan King’s contribution comes as a further demonstration of his commitment to preserving the historical significance of Jerusalem, according to the ministry’s statement. In addition to its financial contribution to the restoration project, Morocco will also dispatch a team of architects and engineers to participate in the reconstruction work. The intervention of the prospective Moroccan delegation, the statement stressed, is set to “preserve the architectural authenticity” of one of Islam’s greatest monuments. The Al-Aqsa mosque is considered Islam’s third holiest site, coming after the Mecca and Medina grand mosques in Saudi Arabia. While this week has seen all major newspapers mourn the tragedy of France’s losing almost one third of its illustrious Notre Dame cathedral to a devastating fire, the historic Parisian monument was not the only iconic building to undergo an unforeseen tragedy. On Monday, a fire also broke out in the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, and the loss would have been just as devastating as in Paris had it not been for the quick intervention of the fire brigade of the Islamic Waqf, local outlets reported. “The fire broke out in the guard’s room outside the roof of the Marwani Prayer Room,” according to Palestinian WAFA news outlet. The newspaper noted that the tragedy was only contained because the “fire brigade of the Islamic Waqf handled the matter successfully.” Palestine’s Mahmoud Abass subsequently called for collective efforts to salvage the iconic mosque, saying that there was a need to preserve the site’s “religious and humanitarian value.” King Mohammed VI’s gesture comes as Morocco multiplies efforts to assert itself as an anchor of solidarity and union in the Muslim world. More than a country’s contribution to the needed restoration project, the King’s gesture was a further consolidation of his unflinching commitment to the preservation of the Islamic heritage of the city of Jerusalem. Just two weeks ago on March 30, King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis signed “al-Quds call” to protect the multi-religious and trans-cultural character of Jerusalem.

Rabat – At the moment he scored a goal against Juventus, Ajax Amsterdam’s Donny Van de Beek looked up to see it was the 34th minute, the same number his friend Abdelhak Nouri wore when he played for Ajax. Van de Beek believes that it was not a coincidence.  “I looked up at the scoreboard after I had scored, saw it was the 34th minute and simply knew that wasn’t a coincidence. It’s something very special. I will never forget that again,” he said after Ajax’s match with Juventus on Tuesday. Morocco’s Abdelhak Nouri is a former Ajax player who collapsed during a friendly match against Werder Bremen in July 2017 because of a cardiac arrest, causing permanent brain damage. Nouri went into a coma and is still receiving care at a hospital. Ajax also tweeted in tribute to Nouri.

Rabat – Abu Dhabi has opened the “Morocco in Abu Dhabi 2019” festival, an event devoted to celebrating the cultural and artistic heritage of Morocco. The UAE’s capital is hosting the festival for the fourth year in a row as part of its objective of “reinforcing ties between the UAE and the Kingdom of Morocco.” Under the patronage of King Mohammed VI with the support of UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the event opened officially Wednesday, April 17. It will be open to the public beginning Thursday, running until April 30, at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre. According to a press release, the festival is set to “enhance political, economic, scientific, touristic and cultural relationships, and introduce the country’s communities to the inherent Moroccan culture and heritage as one of the Kingdom’s cornerstones in history and civilisation.” A journey that “unveils the country’s eclectic traits,” the festival serves as a gateway for visitors to explore “Morocco’s rich heritage in architecture, music, art, and cuisine.” The festival particularly highlights the significant role of the Moroccan woman as an economic and social “co-leader” and a “unique character of generosity, dedication, intuition, vision and creativity.” The festival will also focus on Moroccan architecture and craftsmanship, from copper and brass artifacts to carved wood and distinctive ceramic-glazed pottery and brasseward, saddle making, jewellery, embroidery, raffia shoes, cherbil (slippers), tazwaqt (wood engravings), pottery, amlou (a thick brown paste of nuts and argan oil), and henna tattoos. In a two-day concert at A’l Bahar Abu Dhabi Corniche, the festival will also feature Moroccan pop and music with “traditional, spiritual and tribal Moroccan rhythms under one roof,” including the “Isawa Sufi” genre.  Besides Morocco’s culinary art and haute-couture, the event will offer its spectators the Moroccan theatrical performance of “Bnat Lalla Mennana” (Lalla Mennana’s Daughters) to celebrate feminine heroism. According to Matar Suhail Al Yabhouni, the chairman of the Higher Organising Committee of the event, the festival “will offer the country’s citizens and residents a unique opportunity to learn about Morocco’s authentic history and culture and to educate future generations on the importance of preserving its heritage.”

Rabat – The new Netflix original show, “Huge in France,” tells the semi-autobiographical story of Moroccan-French comedian Gad Elmaleh.  In the show, the French comedian wants to reconnect with his son in Los Angeles, but when he moves to the United States he must deal with culture shock, co-parenting, and dating. “Huge in France” premiered its first season on Netflix on April 12, 2019. The eight-episode season has since received mixed reviews. Sophie Gilbert of the Atlantic calls the show “unconvincing” and criticizes it as a lost opportunity “to say something meaningful about fame.” According to Joel Keller, a critic for Decider, “Huge In France isn’t a laugh riot, but it has an appealing mix of comedy and sincere emotion, and Gad Elmaleh is a compelling lead.” Criticisms of the show stem from the bland nature of the episodes and repetitive jokes. Throughout the first season, Elmaleh’s character struggles making the transition from being a star in the French comedy scene to a nobody in the American comedy scene. However, this storyline is similar to many other comedies. “Huge in France” is the third Netflix show for the Moroccan-French stand-up comedian. His first two specials on Netflix, “Gad Gone Wild” and “American Dream,” were largely successful. “Gad Gone Wild” was performed in French to a crowd in Montreal and “American Dream” was his first Netflix show in English. In his Netflix special, “American Dream,” Elmaleh jokes, “I’m sure you’ve heard this story so many times about the man who moved to America with one dollar in his pocket, and he worked so hard and he made a fortune. I moved here with a fortune. Same story guys, I just did it backwards.” Elmaleh was born in Casablanca to a Jewish family and attended high school in Quebec. At the age of 21, Elmaleh moved to Paris to pursue his dream of acting. The 47-year-old comedian performed comedy in France for over 23 years and gained wide fame there. The stand-up comedian and actor has starred in several feature films, including “Coco” (2008), “Priceless” (2006), and “La Doublure” (2005). He was voted the “funniest person” in France, and France’s Minister of Culture named him knight of the Order of Arts and Letters . Elmaleh also became a knight of the National Order of Quebec.

Rabat – The Moroccan General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR) has announced that 133 prisoners obtained university degrees in 2018. Fifty prisoners earned general university studies degrees; 82 earned a bachelor’s; and one prisoner got a master’s. In order to diversify the ways prisoners could study, DGAPR implemented an e-learning program supported by the United Nations. To do so, DGAPR equipped prisons in Tifelt 2, Khenifra, L’oudaya in Marrakech, Toulal 2 in Meknes, and Ain Sebaa 1 in Casablanca with the necessary material. DGAPR has also announced that it will dedicate spaces for educational courses in different prisons as part of an agreement with Mohammed VI University in Rabat. The program is intended to better integrate prisoners into the labor market. In 2018, 766 prisoners took and passed the baccalaureate exams. The figure represents a pass rate of 22% for Moroccan prisoners.

Rabat – Moroccan security services, in cooperation with Spanish and Moroccan intelligence services, have arrested a Moroccan terror suspect, who was allegedly planning a terror attack in Seville, southern Spain. The Spanish Ministry of the Interior announced on Wednesday that the national police and the Spanish and Moroccan intelligence services “carried out an anti-terrorist operation, which resulted in the arrest in Morocco of an alleged jihadist who planned to carry out an attack in Seville.” Spanish police also raided the suspect’s house in Seville. Euro News said that the suspect was planning to carry out an attack during Easter celebrations in Seville, according to anonymous sources. Spain and Morocco share a strong track record on anti-terrorist cooperation.  In September 2018, Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell said their cooperation “is an example to follow for other countries,” as the globe struggles to confront terrorist movements at home and abroad. The same sentiment was shared by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, who said that the two countries have an “exemplary” partnership in the fight against terrorism. He added that their cooperation is “a model of inter-regional cooperation.” In addition to Spain, the US and France also have counterterrorism partnerships with Morocco. Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) reported in 2018 that Morocco’s security agents are “playing a central role in Europe’s efforts to counter ISIS terrorism.” The organization also said that Morocco’s security services helped Morocco to avoid terror attacks, which increased sharply in the Maghreb region. AOAV’s remarks on Morocco’s efforts were also echoed by other reports, including from the US Department of State, which touted Morocco’s counterterrorism cooperation with the US.

Rabat – Morocco’s position in the 2019 Fund for Peace Fragile States Index (FSI) is no better than its 2018 score.   The report, previously called the Failed State Index, ranked Morocco 78th most fragile out of 178 countries with a total score of 73 points. The score puts Morocco in the “elevated warning” zone. Fund for Peace bases its FSI rankings on 12 indicators in four broad categories: Cohesion, economic, political, and social and cross-cutting indicators. Morocco scored worst in the “group grievance” indicator with 8.5 points out of 10. The indicator focuses on social disparities and “schisms between different groups in society.” Morocco also scored poorly in “human flight and brain drain” with 7.9 points. The category looks at the “economic impact of human displacement.” Morocco scored best in the “security apparatus” indicator with 5.2 points, owing to its reinforced security mobilization. The category considers “security threats to a state, such as bombings, attacks, and battle-related deaths.” The report also looks at nine other indicators: Economic decline, factionalized elites, state legitimacy, uneven development, public services, human rights and rule of law, demographic pressures, refugees and IDPs, and external intervention.  The report spoke about migration issues in North Africa, especially in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, noting that many seek to immigrate for better economic conditions in Europe. “This trend, also known as ‘brain drain,’ and reflected in the Human Flight/Brain Drain indicator on the FSI, can be slow to change, but the effects are no less devastating, particularly to countries aspiring to democratic transitions,” said the report. The argument in the report backs other surveys, which indicate that the majority of Moroccan young people would like to emigrate for better living conditions because of a lack of job opportunities. Moroccan jobs website Rekrute said that 91% of Moroccan professionals aged 35 and younger are interested in working abroad to secure better work conditions and quality of life. In addition to Rekrute, a survey from a Moroccan marketing agency found that 40% of Moroccans want to leave the country. Commenting on the 2011 Arab Spring in Morocco, the index said the North African country “managed to stave off the spiraling violence that gripped much of the Arab world” in the uprising. The report also recalled the mass protests in 2016 and 2017 that Morocco faced, known as the Hirak Rif, after the death of fishmonger Mohcine Fikri in Morocco’s northern Al Hoceima province. The report said that the protests and the arrest of Hirak Rif activists drew thousands of Moroccans to the streets to demand economic adjustments and reforms. The report acknowledged that the government was willing to make some reforms to end the crisis. However, despite the government’s “lip service” to reforms, the general population “has seen little or no benefits.” The crisis in Algeria and Tunisia were also part of the report, which highlighted the ongoing mass protests opposing Bouteflika and the impact of the Tunisian revolution. Algeria ranked 72nd most fragile, while Tunisia ranked 95th out of the 178 countries.  “Morocco, for its rising levels of group grievance, still appears willing to tolerate, and occasionally give into, popular protests and demands for reforms,” said the report.

Rabat – MP Amina Maelainine, whom Morocco’s ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) recently punished for her association with a “scandalous” clothing choice, has said she will not be silenced by insincere criticism. Faced with criticism of hypocrisy from a number of Moroccans after pictures emerged in December of Maelainine walking unveiled while in Paris, PJD’s leadership lambasted the MP, who wears a veil while in Morocco. On Saturday, April 13, the party finally decided to punish Maelainine, also a PJD member, by removing her from her position as seventh vice-president in the House of Representatives. Maelainine, however, did not wait long to respond to what she perceives as an organized campaign against her personality and political convictions. Taking to Facebook on Monday, April 15, the demoted MP reminded her critics that a coordinated attempt to silence and sideline her from the party’s highest ranks will not take away her outspokenness and passion. “That many people have been quick to comment, analyze, and repetitively seek glory on the back of Amina Maelainine is a sign of lack of character,” the MP lashed out. She added that her critics’ behavior since the Paris scandal is “reflective of their inability to take much more heroic roles by espousing more honorable political opinions and causes.” Maelainine rose to prominence in the aftermath of the 2011 general elections as the voice of the educated but virtuous and religious Moroccan woman. To those who have suggested that the PJD’s decision to demote Maelainine will further complicate the MP’s political future, making her gradually irrelevant in national political debates, Maelainine said she will continue her fight. “I want to point out that this is not the first time that the party’s secretariat general has opposed my candidacy for party leadership,” Maelainine wrote. According to Maelainine, the hype has more to do with a desire to use her to advance politicians’ own causes. As far as the MP is concerned, those who attack her only sought to paint her in a bad light to make themselves look more principled. However, while it “is normal” to prefer someone else over her for leadership positions, she stressed that critics’ “constant insinuations and selective condemnations” will not make up for their “lack of noble political convictions.” While Maelainine has remained uncharacteristically silent since mid-January, when the PJD started debating her political fate, it is not the first time that the outspoken MP has taken sweeping aims at her critics, both outside and within the PJD. In an interview with Moroccan weekly Al Ayyam in early March, Maelainine hinted at what other critics have called the “marketization of Islamic ethics.” The idea is that there is an inclination in Moroccan political circles, especially politicians who seek to appeal to a largely conservative and religious electoral base, to take more interest in “smear campaigns” and other “trivial issues” rather than discussing more pressing issues, according to Maelainine. She told Al Ayyam that there is a general tendency to “accord disproportionate importance” to people’s lifestyles and physical appearance rather than their actions and policies while in public office. For all of Maelainine’s defiance, it is unlikely that she will appeal to critics, most of whom were convinced of her “hypocrisy” from the very outset of the Paris scandal. For Moroccan liberals, the PJD has already been discredited as a genuine “Islamist party.” The Moroccan left has consistently held the view that the country’s ruling party only portrays itself—and falsely—as nationalist and Islamist in order to exploit the perceived gap between elites and “everyday Moroccans.” The party’s aim, critics have argued, is to take advantage of the voting capital of low-income Moroccans considered as more attached to the country’s religious and traditional values. Meanwhile, as the party seeks to wash itself of such criticisms of hypocrisy, Maelainine is increasingly viewed by many PJD members as a liability. In an interview with Morocco’s 2M television channel on April 14, justice minister and PJD frontbencher Mustapha Ramid said that “time is up” for Maelainine. Ramid said, “No one has the right to have two faces.” There are also reports that even Abdelilah Benkirane, former PJD leader and Maelainine’s traditional “protector,” is no longer supportive of his longtime “protegee.” Meanwhile, Maelainine, loyal to her feisty and defiant self, is adamant that even unanimous rejection from her party will not silence her. “I have worked hard, with devotion and engagement. I will continue this fight, which is not necessarily linked to holding leadership positions. I will continue fighting with the same passion and enthusiasm as before,” she wrote on Facebook.

Rabat – Italian police arrested a Moroccan resident and an Italian individual who converted to Islam, on Wednesday. Police described them as “lone wolves” suspected of planning to join ISIS. The two suspects, 25-year-old Giuseppe Frittitta and 18-year-old Ossama Gafhir met on the internet, according to Italian news agency ANSA.  Police made the arrests on orders from the Sicilian prosecutor general. The suspects were undergoing “stringent drills” and had posted photos on social media disseminating extremist propaganda.  One picture shows the Italian suspect posing with a 26-centimeter knife calling for the death of all Westerners. Gafhir allegedly lured the Sicilian suspect into extremism, who later changed his name to Yusuf. Frittitta, whom the police captured in northern Italy, was in touch with extremists in Italy and elsewhere. In mid-March, Italy deported a Moroccan imam, Houssam Din Rouzak, for allegedly showing extremist behaviour as well as propagating extremist interpretations of Qur’anic precepts in sermons, according to the Italian news outlet La Voce. Italian intelligence services had kept a close watch on Din Rouzak since 2012, when he adopted a rigid understanding of the Qur’an and showed an “aggressive attitude” towards colleagues at the Center of Islamic Studies in the northwestern Italian city of Novara.

Rabat – Under pressure from continued protests in Algiers, Algeria’s top army chief Gaid Salah has said that time is “running out” to end the escalating crisis in the country before elections. Salah asserted that “all options are open in the pursuit of overcoming the different difficulties” to end the crisis “as soon as possible.” Salah made his comments on Tuesday after the head of the Algerian Constitutional Council, Tayeb Belaiz, resigned. Belaiz responded to the demand of protesters, who have been calling on him and all other top officials to step down. Belaiz had resisted the protesters’ demands for two weeks after former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and his government resigned on April 3. The protesters are now calling on Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah to resign, demanding a radical change in the system. Following Belaiz’s resignation, Bensalah appointed a member of the council, Kamel Feniche, as the new council president. He was a member of the council since 2016. Gaid Salah called on Algerians to be patient ahead of the coming election, which will take place on July 4. On Tuesday, however, protests continued as thousands of students rallied across the country, calling on Bensalah to leave. Some politicians had previously argued that Bensalah cannot run the country due to his former Moroccan nationality. “Mr. Abdelkader [Bensalah] has a Moroccan nationality. He can be a minister, a governor, a director of an administration, but it is impossible for him to be a president,” said Rachid Nekkaz, referring to Algeria’s Constitution. The head of Algeria’s Justice and Development Front Party, Lakhdar Benkhellaf, shared the same position as Nekkaz, opposing Bensalah because he was born in Morocco. “The condition for a [leader] occupying the post of President of the Republic, is that he must have the Algerian nationality of origin. And he [Bensalah] had another nationality until 1964 during which he had obtained Algerian nationality,” he said.

Rabat – The boycott Moroccans launched in April 2018 against Central Danone is still affecting the company’s sales in Morocco and its global performance. The French company said that its sales rose 0.8 percent in the first quarter of 2019 to €6.14 billion, marking a slowdown from its 2.4% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Danone said its low growth was due to “setbacks” in Morocco and China, with less demand for infant formula products in China. The company is hoping for a better performance to finish 2019 strong. “The start of the year is relatively modest, as expected, but this puts the spotlight on very ambitious targets. The second half will be crucial,” said Roche-Brune Asset Management fund manager Gregoire Laverne. In February, the company reported lower growth in 2018 due to the campaign. Danone’s “like-for-like” sales growth was up 2.9% from 2017, but the company calculated it would have been up 3.6% if it were not for the Moroccan boycott. In response to the boycott, Central Danone promised Moroccans solutions to reduce its product prices. The boycott targeted two other companies, mineral water company Sidi Ali and Afriquia Gas oil company. Boycotters claimed the companies were hiking prices and their product prices exceeded boycotters’ purchasing power. Central Danone launched a consulting campaign with consumers in cities across Morocco, including Casablanca, Marrakech, and Rabat. The boycott also led to the visit of Danone’s general director, Emmanuel Faber, who came to Morocco in 2018 to personally speak with citizens and ask them what measures Danone had to take to end the boycott. Senior Moroccan officials urged citizens to end the boycott on Central Danone because it employs many small farmers, who were affected by the boycott. The Moroccan government also said that the boycott would discourage foreign investors.

Rabat – The report ranked Morocco seventh out of a list of 130 countries considered to be premier destinations for Muslim travelers and tourists.  In the Arab world, Morocco came in fourth place after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Qatar.  However, in the Maghreb, it came first, ahead of Tunisia and Algeria, which came in 16th and 19th place, respectively. Globally, Malaysia and Indonesia tied for first place, followed by Turkey in second place, Saudi Arabia in third place, and the UAE in fourth place. Even though Morocco’s tourism sector does not provide services specifically designed for halal travel, the 2019 GMTI took into account the availability of hotel services, halal eating options, and private swimming pools geared towards Muslim families in the country. The report also highlighted the growing contribution of the halal travel sector to the global economy.  By 2026, it is estimated that the sector’s contribution to the global economy will jump 35 percent, reaching $300 billion, up from $220 billion in 2020. By that time, the number of Muslim visitors globally is projected to grow to 230 million people, representing more than 10 percent of tourists worldwide. The 2019 GMTI indicated that Muslim travelers specifically chose countries where hotels provided entertainment facilities for women, prayer facilities, non-alcoholic beverages, and pork-free meals. The GMTI ranking uses various criteria to assess how family-friendly a country and its hotels are.  Some of these criteria include the quality of services and amenities, the ease of checking in and checking out, marketing initiatives, and the number of national and international Muslim visitors a destination receives. Last year, Morocco welcomed more than 12 million tourists, an eight percent increase from the previous season. However, this number still pales in comparison to the government’s ambitious goal of attracting 20 million tourists by 2020.

Rabat – An observatory at a Spanish university recorded a meteor flying over the sky of Morocco at dawn on Sunday, April 14. The Spanish University of Huelva video-taped the meteor crossing the Mediterranean at a speed of between 40,000 to 65,000 kilometers per hour. Detectors set up by the SMART project (Spectroscopy of Meteoroids in the Atmosphere with Robotic Technologies) that captured the fireball. Observers could see the meteor as far as 500 kilometers away. Astrophysicist Jose Maria Madiedo, professor at the University of Huelva, told Morocco World News, “The event began at an altitude of about 84 km above the sea, in front of the coast of Morocco. From that point it moved northeastward, and finished at an altitude of 31 km over the sea, at a distance of about 25 km from the coast of your country [Morocco].” Sucedió a las 3:00 de esta madrugada (14 de abril). La imagen muestra la trayectoria que siguió la bola de fuego. @EFEciencia @abcdesevilla@elCorreoWeb @malagahoy_es @opiniondemalaga @DiarioSUR @elsegundoluz @AstroHita @ideal_granada @miangulo_95 pic.twitter.com/93U6ONm3N2 — Jose Maria Madiedo (@jmmadiedo) April 14, 2019 The meteor disappeared into the Mediterranean in the Strait of Gibraltar, but nearer to Morocco than Spain. The fireball, Madiedo added, was produced by a rock fragment of an asteroid.  The high speed at which the meteor hurtled through the air caused its temperature to rise to 4,000 degrees Celsius, turning it into a fireball, Madiedo told MWN. It is likely that small fragments of the fireball, weighing between 10 and 25 grams, have survived.  Another fireball crossed the sky over the Spanish city of Caceres early on Friday, April 12, at a faster speed at 65,000 kilometers per hour, only to fly apart 35 kilometers above Avila, northeast of Madrid, the same observatory said.

Rabat – In Russia, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita stressed the importance of a realistic political solution to the Western Sahara conflict in an interview with Russian news outlet Sputnik. Having arrived in Moscow for the Arab-Russian Forum, Bourita said that Morocco is not prepared to take into account “positions contrary” to UN Security Council resolutions. The official also urged all parties to show “realism and real will to reach a solution to this conflict.” Bourita said that Morocco has adopted a clear position in the roundtable discussions on the conflict and has long wanted to end the regional conflict which has lasted too long. “If the other parties had a real will, Morocco has presented its initiative of autonomy,” Bourita said, suggesting that the North African country would never accept a replacement to its autonomy plan introduced in 2007 to the UN. Bourita also asserted that some parties are “settling on their obsolete positions,” referring to Polisario and its supporter, Algeria. He added that Morocco offers solutions and “defines its position, but it is not willing to continue discussions on non-practical and non-consensual issues.” Realism is necessary Commenting on March’s second roundtable discussions on Western Sahara, Bourita said that the progress was insufficient because “what is necessary today is that all the parties concerned are motivated by a real desire to move towards a realistic, practical, and consensual solution.” Bourita’s statement is similar to what the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Kohler said by the end of the second roundtable discussion. Kohler acknowledged that the conflict is complex and called on all parties to show realism and constructively work under the UN-led political process to end the conflict. Kohler said, “There is still a lot of work ahead of the delegations. Nobody should expect a quick outcome.” He also urged the parties to build trust between them in order for the talks to start to end the conflict. After the end of each roundtable discussion, the personal envoy showed some hope that the parties would cooperate. However, the parties involved in the conflict use their channels to accuse each other of violations. This month, the Polisario sent two letters to the Security Council to maneuver against Morocco a few weeks ahead of the council’s meeting to adopt a new resolution on the conflict later in April. The front, which has long been backed by Algeria, has also sought support from international powers, including Moscow, an ally of Algiers. Despite the rapprochement between Morocco and Russia in recent years, Algeria remains a stronger ally of Russia because they share technical military cooperation. In July 2018, Russian Ambassador to Algeria Igor Belyaev was quoted by MEMO as saying, “Moscow is keen to take the position in favour of the implementation of the United Nations resolutions.” He added, “Russia supports what the United Nations delegates are doing to organise the referendum in Western Sahara. It also supports the efforts of UN Secretary-General Envoy, Horst Kohler, to re-launch dialogue between Morocco and the Polisario.” In December 2018, Russian Ambassador to Morocco Valerian Shuvayev said that Russia “maintains friendly relations with the parties to the Western Sahara conflict.” He commented that the conflict should be solved under the auspices of the UN, a statement echoed by Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov who said in January 2019 that the conflict should be resolved in accordance with  UN Security Council resolutions. “Both must be resolved and both require strict implementation of agreements committed to paper in the United Nations Security Council resolutions, including efforts to find mutually acceptable solutions with the participation of all parties concerned in this or that crisis situation,” he said in an official working visit in Morocco.

Rabat – Essaouira, a walled 18th-century seafront city 200 kilometers away from Marrakech, will host the annual 19th Printemps Musical des Alizés (Spring Trade Winds Music festival), an event dedicated to classical music. Initiated by the Essaouira Mogador Association, the festival will run on April 25-28.  Much to the delight of lovers of chamber music and opera, the festival will be exclusively dedicated to acoustic music, bringing together young talents and renowned musicians. The concert, which will be open to all for free, will be staged in the various squares of the city, including Dar Souiri cultural centre, El Menzeh square in the medina (walled city), or within the walls of Bayt Addakira.  The festival will furnish the historic city with an “intimate” melody that highlights all its “nobility and depth” in chamber music and lyrical art, Association Essaouira-Mogador said in a press release. “And because lyrical art has always been part of the Festival des Alizés, soprano Marie-Laure Garnier will perform in recital around Brahms,” read the festival’s announcement.  This year’s festival will bring the most prominent artists from previous trade winds festivals. At the same time, a number of sessions will be dedicated to new artists as well. The concert “Beethoven l’impétueux” (The Impetuous Beethoven) will open the celebration with duets, trios, and piano, which will be played by the French laureates, pianist Guillaume Vincent alongside cellist Bruno Philippe, clarinettist Raphael Severe, and violinist Elias David Moncado. The festival will indulge the audience in the magnificent piece Antonio Vivaldi’s “gloria”  while the trio Metral band will play Mendelssohn’s Piano trio.  The festival will also present the audience with Howard Hanson’s String Quartet while Metral-Vincent will pay tribute to Robert Schumann.

Rabat – The International Forum for Agriculture (SIAM) Association in Morocco said that Morocco’s agricultural output reached MAD 125 billion ($13.05 billion) in 2018, recording a 60% increase since the launch of the Green Morocco Plan agricultural strategy in 2008. In a statement issued on the eve of the opening of the International Agriculture Forum in Meknes on Tuesday, the association explained that large resources have been mobilized to improve Morocco’s agricultural output.  The statement added that current figures were reached thanks to the genuine involvement of all actors from both the public and private sectors. Total investment in Morocco’s agricultural sector in 2019 is expected to reach MAD 115 billion ($12 billion). The association pointed out that the Green Morocco Plan supported the gradual deployment of the local irrigation system, which would cover 38% of the national irrigated areas by the end of 2019. The Association emphasized that the plan has been effective and efficient because it has enabled Morocco to triple its agricultural production. The local irrigation system contributed to the flourishing of irrigated agriculture, which contributed by 45% to the gross domestic agricultural product, which creates 50% of the job opportunities in the rural world, according to the statement. The International Forum for Agriculture (SIAM) kicked off on Tuesday in Meknes and will run until April 21. The forum will bring together 1363 exhibitors representing 62 countries. Switzerland is this year’s forum’s guest of honor.

Rabat – The Central Bureau for Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) dismantled a criminal network suspected of robbing large sums of money from several international banks. In coordination with the Directorate-General for Territorial Surveillance (DGST) and Spanish authorities, the BCIJ busted a criminal ring suspected of misappropriating large sums of money through the use of malware and by hacking bank accounts in collusion with some center employees.  A statement from the BCIJ said on Tuesday that the dismantling of the criminal network, based on accurate information provided by the DGST services, is part of efforts to strengthen international security cooperation to fight terrorism and cross-border organized crime. Search operations resulted in the seizure of electronic equipment used in these criminal acts, as well as large sums of money resulting from these criminal activities, according to the same source. The 16 individuals, who come from Moroccan cities, including Casablanca, Meknes, Khénifra, Oujda, Marrakech and El Hajeb, were arrested for their alleged links to the criminal network.  The authorities have placed the suspects under police custody, awaiting further investigation under the supervision of the Public Prosecutor.

Rabat – Saudi Arabia’s Turki Al Sheikh has announced that King Mohammed VI has accepted that the second iteration of the Arab Club Champions Cup be named after him. Al Sheikh, who is adviser to Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammed in Salman and current Chairman of General Authority for Entertainment, shared the news on his Facebook account along with a picture with King Mohammed VI. “In my capacity as president of the Union of Arab Football Associations, I am honored to announced that second Arab Club Champions Cup will be named after King Mohammed VI, who has graciously accepted the offer. The final of the 2020 cup will take place in Rabat,” the former chairman of Saudi Arabia’s sport authority said. Al Sheikh’s post is a far cry from the series of his diatribe-filled tweets his posted against Morocco over the past two years. As a result of Morocco’ neutrality in the Gulf crisis, Al Sheikh used Twitter to strong-arm Morocco and insinuate that it would pay the price for not siding with Saudi Arabia. In many of his tweets, Al Sheikh announced that Saudi Arabia would not support Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup and it would instead lend its support to the United 2026 bid, led by the United States. In the period leading up to the June 2018 FIFA’s meeting to vote on the host of the 2026 World Cup, Al Sheikh did not only side with the United States, but he also lobbied many Arab countries to vote against Morocco. His efforts led many Arab countries such as Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait and Iraq to vote against Morocco. The timing of Al Sheikh sudden change of heart towards Morocco suggests that the two countries may have decided to turn the page of tension and misunderstanding that have affected their bilateral relations over the past two years. Al Sheikh’s announcement comes on the heels of contacts between the leaders of two countries in recent weeks to repair their privileged and longstanding bilateral ties. Last week, Morocco’s foreign minister, Nasser Bourita, meet with Saudi King Salman bin Abdelaziz and handed him a message from King Mohammed VI. During the same Gulf tour, the head of Morocco’s diplomacy also met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The two meetings occurred after the phone call that King Mohammed VI had with King Salman bin Abdelaziz on March 21

Rabat – Polisario leader Ibrahim Ghali sent another hostile letter about Morocco to the Security Council on Sunday. The letter, published by the separatists’ “official” news agency, accused Morocco of “violations” in Western Sahara, citing UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’s report. Ghali also accused Morocco of putting up obstacles to “stop the process of settling the conflict.” The letter comes two weeks before the meeting of the Security Council, whose 15 members are expected to meet by the end of the month to renew the mandate of the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, MINURSO. The letter is the second of its kind this month from the Polisario Front. The “representative” of the front at the UN, Mohammed Ammar, also wrote a letter to the Security Council earlier in April to maneuver against Morocco. “Morocco’s growing violations seriously undermine the new momentum created by the Personal Envoy and contradict the serious spirit we are supposed to have as parties as we engage in the peace process,” said the separatist representative. Both Ghali and Ammar ignored the UN chief’s remarks about Polisario’s violations in the region. The UN report also discussed Polisario’s violations east of Morocco’s defense wall, calling on the Polisario Front to meet in Rabouni, Algeria, with MINURSO members instead of insisting on meeting in Western Sahara. The UN chief warned against major risks of tensions in the region due to Polisario’s military exercises in restricted zones. “I nonetheless reiterate the importance of ensuring that no action, in particular of a military nature, be conducted that could risk creating tensions,” he said.

Rabat – Three of the wealthiest families in France have pledged to help rebuild the Notre-Dame Cathedral that was partially destroyed in a fire Monday. The owners of three international luxury product groups, LVMH Group, Kering Group, and L’Oreal Group have promised a joint €500 million. Both LVMH Group CEO Bernard Arnault and the Bettencourt Meyers family, which owns a 33% stake in L’Oreal Group, have pledged €200 million. The Kering Group CEO and Chairman, Francois-Henri Pinault, has promised €100 million. Other French companies have also pledged to donate. The oil and gas company Total has promised €100 million while tech and consulting firm Capgemini will donate €1 million. Including other donations from French companies, the total amount pledged reached €700 million. Rebuilding Notre-Dame will likely cost billions of euros and take years. LVMH Group is a conglomerate that owns luxury goods brands including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, and Givenchy.  According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, LVMH CEO Arnault is the third richest man in the world. His net worth is estimated at $90.4 billion.

Rabat – Popular uprisings have deposed two long-time rulers in what some termed “the second wave of the Arab Spring,” eight years after the first wave hit North Africa and the Middle East. Algeria’s Abdelaziz Bouteflika and Sudan’s Omar al-Bashir joined Tunisia’s Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak, Yemen’s Ali Abdullah Saleh, and Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi, all overthrown during the popular peaceful and armed uprisings in 2011. Syria’s Bashar Al Assad is the only surviving president of the pre-Arab Spring era, a privilege he largely owes to his Russian and Iranian allies. In 2019 Arab masses seem again to have accomplished the unthinkable: Forcing out of power a leader who ruled for two or three decades after weeks of peaceful protests. The euphoria of the recent uprisings in Algeria and Sudan is reminiscent of the hopes that the toppling of the 2011 rulers generated. Many predicted a second wave of the Arab Spring in the last few years due to the political stagnation and economic hardships in Arab countries—both those that witnessed regime changes but failed to launch a transition to democracy or those spared the 2011 turmoil. But the question remains whether the 2019 uprisings can bring the long-awaited change to a region that has long been plagued by authoritarianism. The first wave of uprisings was largely deceiving. The term “Arab Spring,” coined by an overly-excited European press, was a reminder that revolutions are generally seen from a romantic prism that might turn blinding. The Arab uprisings were celebrated as a historical moment that would usher the MENA region into a democratic era. Not much thought was given to the fact that deposing a long-time ruler is not the end itself, and that his removal does not mean that the political system will change overnight. The militarization of demonstrations in Syria and Libya exposed the two countries to the dangers of foreign intervention and the stoking of sectarian and tribal tensions. In Libya, those who celebrated the fall of Gadhafi overlooked the fact that the regime change came through a military intervention led by France, the UK, and the US under the pretext of protecting civilians. The pretext was dubious in light of allegations against former French President Nicholas Sarkozy, accused of receiving money from Gadhafi to finance his election campaign in 2006 and 2007. This is one reason why Sarkozy wanted to get rid of Gadhafi. Another reason is that the former French president wanted to restore his reputation by appearing as a champion of freedom after he stood by the Tunisian President Ben Ali during the protests that were calling for his resignation. The foreign powers wanted Gadhafi gone regardless of the price the country would have to pay when those who took arms against him would turn their guns against each other after his downfall. The foreign superpowers made empty promises to Libyans that they would help their country during the post-Gadhafi transition. The fact that they did not deliver proves they cared less about the fate of the newly liberated nation. The assassination of Gadhafi at the hands of rebel troops was a perfect example of the direction the country was heading into: A state of lawlessness where militias dictate their will and where the rule of law is totally absent. Libya should have brought Gadhafi to trial for whatever crimes he committed, on domestic or foreign soil. In the case of Egypt in 2011, and Algeria and the Sudan today, we should not cheer the army’s intervention to oust a president after helping to maintain his rule for decades. It is clear that when the military does so, its sole motivation is to regain control rather than stand by the people attempting to set the country on a more democratic track. Uprisings are, to a certain extent, a spontaneous surge of accumulated frustration vis-a-vis a given political and economic situation. During the 2011 Arab Spring and its aftermath, protest movements failed to achieve their goals after a promising start, with the exception of Tunisia. Today, Tunisia is clearly freer, but it is nonetheless facing several political and economic challenges threatening its nascent democracy. On the other hand, the Egyptian army, against whose rule people demonstrated in 2011, is still in power. Gadhafi died, but Libya sank into chaos and a de-facto civil war. Syria is a battle ground between regional and international forces as well as armed groups with nationalist or religious ideologies. Yemen is the stage for a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia which are settling scores while a worsening humanitarian crisis is adding to the misery of the local population. Morocco did not transform into the parliamentary monarchy protestors were calling for. Does this mean that Arab uprisings are doomed to failure? It is clear that those who support revolutions believe that the “Arab Spring” will ultimately succeed after drawing lessons from the failures of past experiences. For them, the current Algerian “Hirak” protest movement, is a source of hope. Demonstrators keep taking to the streets, asking for the dismissal of Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah; Prime Minister Nouredine Bedoui; and the head of the Constitutional Council, Tayeb Belaiz. Demonstrators are aware that the three officials, who were part of Bouteflika’s longtime-rule, cannot be trusted with running the country during this transition period. However, demonstrators’ calls for the removal of the three officials are meeting resistance from the army leadership. After bowing to pressure and giving up their initial plans of supporting a fifth term for Bouteflika, the country’s top generals are unlikely to concede this time. The Sudanese opposition is also facing the challenge of imposing a civilian government on the military council set to lead the post al-Bashir era for a two-year period. In Egypt, the army pulled the strings during the 2011 protests and their aftermath. While the military seemed to give up on Mubarak, a former decorated army officer, they managed to rally citizens and political parties against the first civilian president, Mohammed Morsi. They later deposed Morsi in a military coup and regained the presidency when the former minister of defense, General Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, got elected. Many pro-Arab Spring Egyptians are calling on their Algerian and Sudanese counterparts to take their country’s experience as a warning. The next days and weeks might be an indicator about which direction the “second wave of the Arab Spring” will take: One step forward towards democracy or two steps back.

Rabat – Ahmed Shobair, a former Egyptian football star who now hosts one of Egypt’s most popular football shows, has made a bad joke about Morocco’s 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) prospects. The Egyptian said that he wishes Morocco’s Hakim Ziyech had been injured. Speaking about what to expect from each of the CAN contenders on his “Malaab on” show aired on ON Sport, Shobair asked his guest which Moroccan player would be unavailable for the rest of the season due to a serious injury. The guest correctly answered the trivia question. He pointed out that Achraf Hakimi, who recently suffered a metatarsal injury, is set to miss the remainder of the season with his German club, Dortmund, as well as his national team heading to Egypt for CAN in the summer. Shobair commented, however, that he wished Hakim Ziyech had sustained the injury instead of Hakimi. Since moving to Ajax in 2016, Ziyech has established himself as an invaluable starter. The 26-year old attacking midfielder feels comfortable in almost all positions demanding creativity and technical ease. His consistently stellar performances with club and country have won him a good reputation, with many considering him as the creative mastermind of coach Herve Renard’s attack-minded Atlas Lions. Shobair, however, a diehard Real Madrid fan, is said to be holding grudges against the Moroccan player for his role in the 4-1 home humiliation of the Spanish club during their Champions League second leg with Dutch club Ajax. Ziyech scored Ajax’s first goal in what many Real Madrid supporters will remember as the team’s most spirit-crushing Champions League defeat in decades. But the Egyptian’s comments did also carry a significant echo to the upcoming 2019 CAN to be played in Egypt between June 21 and July 19.
Shobair’s comments came in the wake of the CAN 2019 draw. Morocco has been drawn in the competition’s “group of death,” while Egypt features in a fairly playable Group A along with Congo, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. But the prospects of a Morocco vs. Egypt game remain open for the later stages. Based on their current FIFA standings, past CAN records, and recent matches, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, and Algeria are largely considered to be the tournament’s favorites.

Rabat – Morocco’s Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan chaired the opening ceremony of the 14th International Agricultural Exhibition in Morocco (SIAM) on Tuesday, April 16.  Organized under the patronage of King Mohammed VI, the exhibition began April 16 and will continue until April 21 in the historic city of Meknes 60 kilometers west of Fez.  The salon will revolve around the theme “Agriculture, Lever of Employment and Future of the Rural World.” The event is seeing the participation of 1,500 exhibitors from across 60 countries, nearly four times as many as the 400 exhibitors that participated last year. The National Agricultural Advisory Board (ONCA) will take part in the event “within the framework of a new vision of agricultural advisory.” ONCA’s participation is dedicated to “enhancing employment in rural areas.” Its goal is “ensuring the sustainability of the efforts invested by the State through training actions, accompaniment and support of cooperatives.”  According to the general commissioner of SIAM, Jaouad Chami, the event has proven very successful throughout 14 years of “innovation” and “continuous improvement” of Morocco’s “modern and ambitious” agricultural sector, on which 40% of Moroccans rely, according to Chami.  He added that the annual event of SIAM is a driving force for the Moroccan economy.  As part of the Green Morocco Plan, the ONCA will provide 200 supervised trips for 12,000 small and medium farmers and farm advisors from across the 12 Moroccan regions. ONCA will not only provide a network of advisory staff at the fair but also a virtual communication platform, which it called “Ardna” (our land), open to farmers, farmer advisers, researchers, and professionals.

Rabat – Moroccans will have to reset their clocks to go back to GMT on Sunday, May 5 at 3 a.m., two days ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. A Moroccan astronomer expects the government to announce May 7 as the first day of Ramadan. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani announced the government’s decision to change from the new standard time, GMT+1, back to GMT during Ramadan. El Othmani signed a decree to move to GMT as specified under Chapter 1 of the Royal Decree No. 455.67 regarding standard time. Previously, Morocco switched the clock every summer to Daylight Saving Time, GMT+1, and returned to the old standard time, GMT, for a period when Ramadan fell in the summer. After Ramadan, Morocco switched back to DST for the remainder of the summer and returned again to the old standard time every winter on the last Sunday in October. In October 2018, however, the government adopted Decree 2.18.855, adding 60 minutes to the standard time in Morocco, and moving the country to GMT+1 year-round. The decree moved standard time one hour forward permanently “to avoid many changes that occur many times during the year and repercussions at many levels.” Instead of changing the clocks four times per year, twice for DST and twice for the weeks of Ramadan, Morocco is now changing the clocks only twice for Ramadan. The decision, which came only two days before the expected time change in October, stirred confusion and generated backlash among Moroccan citizens, who called for the government to abolish the new standard time. Citizens, especially parents, were worried about their children going to school during the winter because they had to wake up shortly after the sun rose. The Ministry of Education announced new time-tables for students over the winter to answer complaints. Some students started school at 8:30 a.m. instead of 8. The government also said the decision was based on a study. The study found that the “adoption of ‘doubling timing’ has created a kind of confusion,” according to the government. Although the government promised to release the study, it never did. While Moroccan citizens appeared to accept the new standard time reluctantly, the European Parliament voted to end Daylight Saving Time in March. By 2021, countries in Europe will have to decide whether to remain permanently on summer time or winter time.

Rabat – Morocco’s ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) party has finally decided to punish Amina Maelainine, a female PJD MP at the heart of a party scandal since January for appearing to wear “un-Islamic” clothing. During a party meeting on Saturday, April 14, the party’s majority spoke in favor of stripping Maelainine of her relatively influential position as seventh vice-president of the House of Representatives, PJD’s deputy Secretary General Sliman El Amrani announced on the party’s website. The move is set to complicate the MP’s political fate. Maelainine has also subtly been distanced from her previous party visibility. She will be restrained to her seat at the Parliament as the PJD MP for the Hay Hassani district in the Casablanca-Settat region. Meriem Boujemaa, a member of the PJD secretarial general, will replace Maelainine. Boujemaa is known to support Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. Barring an unforeseen intra-party leadership reshuffling, there are indications that Maelainine will not be considered as a PJD candidate when her current tenure as MP comes to an end. Maelainine, a philosophy graduate and teacher whose articulated defense of PJD’s Islamist discourses and trenchant criticism of Moroccan liberals opened her door after door in PJD’s leadership world, recently came under fierce scrutiny after photographs of a recent Parisian holiday showed her without her traditional veil. The scandal divided the party for weeks. Abdelilah Benkirane, former PJD head and known “protector” of Maelainine, defended her within the party leadership. He argued that she deserved a second chance and forgiveness in line with the Islamic teaching of mercy. Benkirane said the PJD should not leave their own MP “helpless and defenseless” as she faced critics. However, as Maelainine was seen as a Benkirane protegee, the former PJD leader’s intervention in her favor has been interpreted as a desire to keep an influential pro-Benkirane faction within the party’s highest echelons. Benkirane’s plea for his “protegee” came along more as a subtle defiance of El Othmani, the PJD leader who was adamant from the beginning that defending Maelainine ran counter to PJD’s identity. “We must set an example, especially those at the forefront of public opinion,” El Othmani said. He appeared to refer to PJD critics’ labels of “hypocrisy” challenging the party’s commitment to its professed Islamist values. But the PJD’s choice of Meriem Boujemaa, an El Othmani loyal, to replace a Benkirane protegee is set to be interpreted as a rebuttal to Benkirane. Benkirane has recently taken aim at El Othmani on several occasions. He has questioned El Othmani’s ability to lead both the party and the government. Benkirane has also requested that El Othmani resign instead of surrender to external pressures hurting Morocco’s national pride. In response, El Othmani has said that his government’s fate should be the least of Benkirane’s concerns and that only the King has the legitimate authority over whether his government should stay. “As long as the King is satisfied with my government’s performance, I will not resign,” El Othmani has been quoted in Moroccan news outlets as saying.

Rabat – The Amazigh World Assembly and the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH) are planning a march in Rabat on Sunday, April 21, to condemn the judicial system’s treatment of Hirak activists.  On April 5, the Casablanca Court of Appeals upheld the sentences handed down in June 2018 to 54 Hirak activists. The 11 a.m. march will protest what the assembly called the “heavy and vengeful sentences” and “unfair trials” of activists who participated in the 2016-2017 mass protests known as the Hirak Rif. The assembly wrote in a statement on Facebook that it will demand the “immediate release of all Hirak prisoners” and an end to what it called a “masquerade,” referring to the legal proceedings in the imprisoned activists’ trials.  The Hirak movement in Morocco’s northern Rif region, the association said, was the result of 60 years of “marginalization, exclusion, repression, and terror” that has driven the people of the Rif to immigrate to Europe. The Moroccan Association of Human Rights (AMDH) also stated it would join the march on Sunday, calling on activists to also take part. On Sunday, April 14, the “committee of popular Hirak in Tamassint” and relatives of the imprisoned activists marched in Tamassint, a village near Al Hoceima in northern Morocco. The activists received sentences ranging from one to 20 years in prison.  The death of a fishmonger stirred up the protests in the Rif region. Mohcine Fikri died in a garbage truck when trying to retrieve his confiscated fish. Afterwards, mass protests broke out in the streets of Al Hoceima, with hundreds of the city’s inhabitants demanding social and economic equality.  The protests drew the sympathy of a number of international human rights organizations and government officials.  On April 3, 24 members of the European Parliament and one member of the Council of Europe addressed a letter to Morocco’s Minister of Justice Mohamed Aujjar, calling for the release of the Hirak activists.

Rabat – The president of the Council of Mosques of the Rhone, Kamel Kabtane, called on French Muslims to “stand in solidarity with their country” following the devastating fire at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. Kabtane, who is also a leader at the Grand Mosque of Lyon, spoke on Tuesday about the tragic event, promising his support to any future rebuilding efforts and calling all Muslims in France to do the same.   “We call on Muslims in France to show their solidarity by actively participating in the national solidarity campaign that will be launched to find ways to rebuild this place of history of our country and this place of prayer so dear to our Christian brothers.” Notre-Dame, one of Paris’s most symbolic monuments, caught on fire late Monday. Firefighters did not fully extinguish the flames until 15 hours later, in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The fire caused the building’s spire to collapse and destroyed the roof. Firefighters were able to save the main stone structure and the building’s iconic bell towers.  Notre-Dame, “in addition to being a place of worship, is the soul of our country. It is in this place that the French came to celebrate the happiest moments of their history,” said Kabtane.  The cause of the fire is not yet clear although many believe it was an accident connected to ongoing renovation at the cathedral. The incident generated worldwide solidarity as thousands posted emotional tributes to the cathedral on social media. Within hours of the fire starting, there were dedications of money to rebuild from people around the world who feel connected to Notre-Dame and all it stands for. French President Emmanuel Macron made a promise to reconstruct the cathedral on Monday, even before the fire had been put out.

Rabat – French-Moroccan footballer Soufiane Boufal has surpassed Lionel Messi as the player with the most successful dribbles in Spain’s La Liga football league for the 2018/2019 season. With 131 successful dribblings, Celta de Vigo’s Boufal is ahead of Messi (117) and Eibar’s Fabian Orellana (75). Although Boufal made the most dribbles this year, he only scored two goals, one against Girona and one against Sevilla, according to the Spanish sports daily, Marca. The 25-year-old attacking midfielder, who was born in Paris, joined the Celta de Vigo football club in western Spain on a loan for the from Southampton in the UK. In order for Celta de Vigo to keep Boufal, they will have to negotiate a fee of €15 million as the club agreed with Southampton last summer.   Celta de Vigo is currently in 17th place out of 20 teams in La Liga’s standings. The club is having a difficult season, struggling to stay in La Liga with only six matches left in the season. Boufal made his debut with the Moroccan national team in March 2016 in a 1-0 Africa Cup of Nations qualification victory over Cape Verde. He also made two appearances with the Moroccan team in 2017 in friendly matches against Tunisia and Burkina Faso.

Rabat – A fire broke out in the guard’s room in the compound of the Dome of the Rock, home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, in occupied Jerusalem. The room was near the Marwani Prayer Room, also known as Solomon’s Stables. The room caught fire at the same time as Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. Firefighters rapidly put out the fire with no deaths or injuries reported. The cause of the fire has not been determined.  The director general of the Jerusalem Waqf and Al-Aqsa Mosque Affairs Department, Sheikh Azzam al-Khatib, said the fire could have been caused by children who were seen playing in the area. طواقم الإطفاء تخمد حريقاً اندلع على سطح المصلى المرواني في المسجد الأقصى. pic.twitter.com/eMb59JGrsa — شبكة قدس الإخبارية (@qudsn) April 15, 2019

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has expressed deep solidarity with French people after Notre-Dame Cathedral caught fire on Monday. The King sent a message to French President Emmanuel Macron, in which he expressed sympathy with French people over the incident. The message, published by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), reads that the King was moved by the news, expressing his full support and solidarity with Macron on behalf of himself and the Moroccan people. The monarch continued, saying the disaster affects “not only one of the most emblematic historical monuments of the city of Paris, but also a site of prayers for millions of worshipers around the world.” A major fire ravaged the French landmark yesterday, shocking people across the world. The incident resulted in solidarity from Muslims, Christians, and Jews, who expressed solidarity with France. Auxiliary forces in Paris managed to end the fire after 15 hours. The cause of the fire is still not clear. The public prosecutor of Paris, Remy Heitz, tasked 50 people to investigate the incident, the BBC reported. Several other world leaders expressed solidarity with France, including Queen Elizabeth II of the UK and US President Donald Trump. Several French billionaires, including Francois-Henri Pinault, vowed to invest part of their wealth to rebuild the cathedral, which was badly damaged. Pinault, who is the CEO of Kering, said, “This tragedy is striking all the French people, and beyond that, all those attached to spiritual values.” The Notre-Dame Cathedral is an 850-year-old landmark, and the most-visited destination in Paris. The BBC said that the site attracts 13 million visitors annually. The cathedral construction started during the rule of Louis VII in 1163.Workers, however, did not complete the construction until 1345.

Rabat –  The French car manufacturer Renault has shared an on Facebook advertisement showing a map of Morocco without its southern provinces. The advertisement, which promotes Renault trucks under the slogan “Driving for Africa,” seemed to be directed at Morocco, featuring a Moroccan customer praising the company. The advertisement angered many social media users. Some called on the company to make up for the mistake by apologizing to all Moroccans.  It is not the first time advertisements have shown a split Moroccan map or countries with a pro-Morocco stance on the Western Sahara dispute have surprised Moroccans by appearing to condone pro-Polisario claims.  In December 2018, Moroccan transport company CTM broadcast an advertisement with a similar narrative. The  advertisement, which ran for nine months, cut Morocco off its  southern provinces in Western Sahara. The Sahara-less Morocco map fused the wrath of Moroccans who started talking about boycotting the company.  The pro-government Saudi television channel Al Arabia also aired a documentary in February, 2019, describing Western Sahara as a Morocco-occupied territory. The Al Arabiya documentary came in the wake of a much-reported diplomatic friction between Morocco and Saudi Arabia. The Renault Group is a major manufacturer in Morocco. In 2018 only, the plant produced 402,155 cars with considerable export growth.  According to the managing director of Renault Group in Morocco, Marc Nassif, the company exported 90% of the units it produced to 74 countries. The plant’s number of employees grew from 1,600 employees in 2005 in Morocco to 11,000 employees now.

The annual event is organized by Maroc Cultures and drew more than 2.5 million attendees in recent years. Last year’s event included performances from Martin Garrix, Bruno Mars, Luis Fonsi and The Weeknd. The festival’s high profile performers and international popularity has made it the second largest music festival in the world, after Donauinselfest in Vienna, and the largest festival in Africa. Established in 2001, the Mawazine Festival Rhythms of the World is hosted for nine days each year and mixes the world’s and region’s biggest stars. One of the festival’s founding principles is its promotion of Moroccan music, which is why organizers devote more than half of its programming to the national artists. The festival also offers free access to 90% of its guests, with the hope of making it accessible to the public.

Rabat – Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita finished his tour of five Gulf countries, excluding the United Arab Emirates. On March 28, Bourita and his Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi held a joint press conference to address Morocco’s diplomatic relationships in the Gulf as well as the situation in Libya. Bourita focused on the historical roots of Morocco’s relationships with the Gulf countries, especially Saudi Arabia and the Emirates. According to Bourita, Morocco has and continues to seek to preserve and strengthen those relationships. Unfortunately, Morocco does not always agree with those countries with regards to policy. Bourita focused on the message that, to Morocco, foreign policy is a matter of sovereignty and is founded on principles and constants. But Bourita’s speech at the press conference did not specifically address the choice to exclude the Emirates from his tour. The situation in Libya is part of a recent series of policy disagreements between Morocco and its two Gulf allies.  While Morocco has been consistently active in Libya, its actions have been to encourage a political process to solve the Libyan crisis instead of a military intervention.  The Moroccan government has expressed the belief that military intervention is a recipe for disaster which would create chaos and instability, not only in Libya, but throughout the region. Libyan General Khalifa Haftar, who controls much of eastern Libya, launched an offensive against Tripoli early this month. Fighting has since been raging around the Libyan capital. Moroccan fears about instability have increased with the violent clashes. Haftar’s army is funded in large part by Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, a choice which runs counter to Morocco’s policy of non-intervention in Libya. Reports of tensions  Morocco’s relationships with other Arab countries are significant not just for political reasons but for economic ones as well. Saudi Arabia and the Emirates are two of the top sources of foreign investment in Morocco. The Emirates is Morocco’s second largest trading partner in the Gulf region and third largest investor. In the past months, tensions have reportedly increased between Morocco and its Saudi and Emirati allies, although the governments of Morocco and Saudi Arabia have both officially dismissed reports of tensions.  The alleged friction rapidly degenerated after Al-Arabiya, a pro-Saudi government television channel, aired a documentary which challenged Morocco’s Western Sahara claims.  In February, Rabat recalled Mohamed Aitouali, the Moroccan ambassador to the Emirates. The recalling of ambassadors is often used by countries to express disapproval of a country’s policy. Amid reports of escalating tensions with Morocco’s Gulf allies, however, King Mohammed VI recently said Morocco and the Emirates are “sister nations.” The King recalled his father Hassan II’s pride in the close relationship he developed with the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan and expressed a desire to maintain a similarly close relationship in the future.

Rabat – The Moroccan American Network (MAN), an organization dedicated to create business opportunities for Moroccan small enterprises in the US, is preparing a list of Moroccan city candidates for the second annual Morocco Day, in which the culture and heritage of Moroccan cities are celebrated. The network said in a previous statement that it will celebrate one Moroccan city from each of the 12 regions of the North African country every March 29 for the next 12 years in Washington, D.C. The head of MAN, Mohammed El Hajjam, said in a recent press release shared with Morocco World News that a committee of the network is now studying the files of the candidate cities for 2020 Morocco Day. “We are now studying the files of the cities that are expected to be the guest of honor next year, and will be selected from one of the following: Chefchaouen, Essaouira, Marrakech, Rabat, Agadir, Casablanca, Tan-Tan, Laayoune, Tangier, Oujda, Fez, Tata, Ouarzazate, and El Jadida,” said El Hajjam. The network’s goal is to introduce Moroccan cities to America and “open the door for the exchange of experiences between businessmen from the US capital and their counterparts in Morocco, so we are studying all the rationales in order to make the event a success,” he added. The network celebrated the southern city of Zagora as its guest of honor on the first Morocco Day on March 29. The celebration of Morocco Day in Washington, D.C., came about when the mayor of the district, Muriel Bowser, declared March 29 “Morocco Day” to celebrate the country’s culture and diversity. The first “Morocco Day” event will be followed by a festival to celebrate Moroccan culture, music, and history, in Alexandria, Virginia, on June 9, after Mayor Justin Wilson announced the date as a day to celebrate Morocco. El Hajjam said that the festival “is meant to be a window through which the Americans look to Morocco to explore its history and its cultural heritage.”  A business delegation will visit Alexandria during the festival to discuss ways to exchange experiences and investment. The network promised that a group of businessmen and American politicians would also visit Zagora in September to explore the potential of the city. The 2019 Morocco Day program is scheduled to conclude with a field trip to four US cities: New York, Miami, Dallas, and Washington, D.C, where meetings will be held between businessmen, politicians, educators, and investors of Moroccan origin. The Moroccan network, in partnership with a group of doctors from the US, will organize a medical convoy to Zagora to provide medical help to locals. The medical team will consist of pediatricians, internists, surgeons, and a dental team.

Rabat – The King launched the construction of a new Jewish cultural museum and reviewed renovation work performed at the Al Batha museum, a project with a budget of MAD 15.6 million.  The museum of Jewish culture, to be located in Fez Jdid district, has been allocated MAD 10 million and like the Al Batha museum, it is part of a larger development project called “Medina of Fez 2018-2023.” On May 14, 2018, King Mohammed VI led senior government officials to an agreement establishing the monarch’s vision to renovate and restore Morocco’s walled cities or medinas. In July 2018, President of the National Foundation of Moroccan Museums (FNM) Mehdi Qotbi announced that discussions were underway to determine the parameters of the project. For Qotbi, Fez represents “the memory of the country.” The investment of MAD 583 million in 32 projects is meant to support its history, heritage, and traditional arts. These include historical sites, mosques and Quranic schools, public spaces and facilities, as well as areas designated for handicrafts. The King also visited Hammam Seffarine, which was renovated by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs with a budget of MAD 9.6 million, as well as Foundouk Staouniyine, which the Moroccan government and the US partnered to renovate at a cost of MAD 50 million. The restoration of the Foundouk includes a new center for innovation and sharing of ideas on weaving crafts. The King also inspected the Lalla Yeddouna handicraft complex, supported by MAD 333 million in funding, which includes the renovation of 11 traditional buildings, the construction of seven new ones, and the development of the Oued El Jwahir River (Oued Fez). The King reviewed the Lalla Yeddouna Heritage and Information Center of Fez which cost MAD 500,000. The Center seeks to raise public awareness about the importance and value of the heritage of the Medina of Fez. These development projects also include new parking lots, renovating public areas and creating information outlets–all which are in progress.  In addition to Fez, the nation-wide development project to preserve Morocco’s heritage also includes work in Rabat, Sale, Meknes, Tetouan, Marrakech, and Essaouira. In October 2018, Morocco’s Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit announced an MAD 2.35 billion budget for these renovation programs. The Hassan II Fund for Economic and Social Development will contribute approximately 40 percent of the budget. The projects are in line with King Mohammed VI’s instructions to preserve the national heritage.

Rabat – Notre Dame Cathedral, one of the famous landmarks in Paris caught fire Monday evening. The fire broke out over the whole building causing the collapse of part of the cathedral’s roof and spire. Firefighters are now trying to extinguish the huge blaze. French police said that the fire could be related to renovation work and reported no deaths or injuries. Photos and videos of the blaze have spread rapidly over social media networks.     The Notre Dame Cathedral, one of the most historic landmarks in Paris and one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world, caught fire Monday evening and is at least partially destroyed. Police said there were no deaths and it is unclear if there were any injuries. The fire broke out just before 7 p.m., minutes after the cathedral closed to the public. Around 30,000 people visit the church daily.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid said that Morocco does not criminalize apostasy in state-owned channel 2M’s televised “Hadith Ma’a Al-Sahafa” (Discussion with the Press) program on Sunday, April 14. Although the penal code does not criminalize conversion from Islam, Ramid said, it especially criminalizes those who try to “shake” other people’s faiths or convert them into religions other than Islam.  “The victim [who converts] in this case is not culpable,” he explained. He noted that the criminal code especially focuses on proselytizing that exploits people’s “fragility”  and “needs.” He explained that the law criminalizes those who target minors or poor people and talk them into leaving Islam for another religion. Under the Moroccan Penal Code, Article 220 states, “Anyone who, through violence or threat, restrains or prevents one or several persons from worshiping or attending worship, is punishable by imprisonment for six months to three years and by a fine of 200 to 500 dirham [about $20 to $50].” Ramid further argued that if one converted to another religion from Islam out of conviction, the law does not have a case in preventing them from professing another faith. He said the law has its basis on the Qur’anic verse 18:29: “The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills – let him believe; and whoever wills – let him disbelieve.” Moroccan Ambassador to Rome Hassan Abouyoub, stated at a forum that the Italian National Associated Press Agency (ANSA) held that apostates in Morocco do not risk the death penalty and that apostasy is not a crime under Morocco’s Penal Code.  However, the Ulema, the highest body of religious scholars in Morocco, issued an Islamic edict, known as a fatwa, in 2012 declaring that apostasy is punishable by death.  After the fatwa triggered outrage, the Ulema, formally called the Mohammadia League of Scholars, denied that it was making rulings like terrorist groups, which some had said.  The council explained that apostasy does not refer to those who leave their religion for another but what it called political “traitors,” those who desert their groups in favor of the “enemy.” The Ulema quoted a traditional saying of the prophet, known as a hadith, “Whoever changes his religion, kill him.” They described an apostate as “the one who leaves his religion and abandons his people.”  A source within the Mohammadia league denied the council had made a “retraction,” as some called it. He stated that only five scholars held the opinion that apostasy refers to political treason, and they did not reflect the overall opinion of the council.

Rabat – Approximately 200 elements of the Royal Moroccan Navy (MRM) have received training in northern Germany as part of a training trip in Europe. According to German news outlet Kieler Nachrichten, the Moroccan navy arrived Friday in Hamburg, Germany, on the frigate, Hassan II, and corvette “Allal Ben Abdellah.” The two ships are among Morocco’s most modern naval units, built in 2003 and 2012. The Hassan II is 93 meters long and was built for maritime surveillance. It is under the command of Captain Mohamed Fadili, who leads a crew of 90 members. The Allal Ben Abdellah is an even newer 98-meter-long corvette of the Sigma 9813 type of the Dutch Damen shipyard and has modern radar systems for sea monitoring. It is under the command of Captain Khalid Belghazi, who leads a crew of 100 soldiers. The Royal Moroccan Navy is on a training trip in Europe and has already received training in Vlissingen in the Netherlands and Bordeaux in France. The news outlet stated that this is the first time the Royal Moroccan Navy has been in Germany for training. Both ships were due to arrive in Lisbon on Monday morning. A source told Morocco World News that the Special Forces Unit of the Royal Moroccan Navy is receiving training by taking part in maneuvers with friendly countries in the framework of military cooperation.  “These naval maneuvers are generally conducted under the command of AfriCom with the objective to coordinate efforts of the various navies in the field of interoperability, the fight against various trafficking, and illegal immigration,” added the source.  The Europe tour follows the Moroccan-American “African Lion” joint exercises in Morocco which began on March 16 and ended April 7. The annual exercise saw the participation of military units and observers from 15 countries, including Canada, Spain, Portugal, the UK, Italy, Senegal, Tunisia, Mauritania, the US, Austria, and Morocco. The United States Command for Africa (AFRICOM) and FAR jointly planned African Lion 2019 to consolidate cooperation and training and exchange experience between militaries of multiple countries.

Rabat – Marysthell Polanco, an attendee of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s infamous “bunga bunga” sex parties, has revealed that she received death threats during the bribery investigation. The information came to light when Milan-based prosecutors questioned Polanco about the mysterious death of Moroccan-born model Imane Fadil, one of the investigation’s key witnesses. Investigators have also said that Barbara Guerra, another attendee, received similar threats as Polanco did during the investigation. In March, Italian magistrates opened a murder investigation into Fadil’s mysterious death. The 34-year-old Moroccan model was a witness in Berlusconi’s previous underage prostitute trial and his upcoming bribery trial. Fadil, who attended several of Berlusconi’s “bunga bunga” sex parties, was admitted to a hospital in February for severe stomach pain. Her brother and lawyer have said that before falling ill the Moroccan-born model expressed her fear of being poisoned. Fadil died on March 1. The preliminary results of the ongoing murder investigation appear to support Fadil’s claims. A toxicology test established that the former model died of “a mixture of radioactive substances.” According to Huffington Post Italy, Fadil had been working on a memoir titled “I Met the Devil” when she died. The memoir is said to include first-hand accounts of her experience as an attendee of Berlusconi’s parties. Fadil had previously given evidence in Berlusconi’s 2012 trial, in which he was on trial for paying for sex with an underage prostitute. She was also scheduled to provide evidence in his upcoming bribery trial. In January 2011, Berlusconi was placed under criminal investigation when Karima El Mahroug accused him of having sex with her at one of his “bunga bunga” parties when she was underage. Fadil and several other women came forward to provide evidence in support El Mahroug’s claim.  While Berlusconi denied all accusations, the collective evidence led the court to finding him guilty in June 2013 and sentencing him to seven years in prison. Several months later in January 2014, Berlusconi appealed his case and requested complete absolution. The Italian appeals court granted his request, overturning all of the convictions. In March 2015, the Italian Court of Cassation, the country’s highest court, upheld his acquittal. Two years later in January 2017, an Italian court ordered Berlusconi to stand trial again—this time accusing him of bribing witnesses for their silence during the underage prostitute trial. Fadil was never accused of taking bribes and before her death was expected to give evidence in the new case. Berlusconi’s bribery trial is still ongoing.

Rabat – Representatives from the Moroccan government attended the swearing in ceremony of Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto, who has been appointed as the chief rabbinical judge for the Jewish community living in Morocco. International news outlets reported that leaders of the Jewish community and the governor of the Casablanca-Settat region, Said Ahmidouch, attended the special ceremony in Casablanca. Police and military members also attended the ceremony at the Beth-El Synagogue in Casablanca. Morocco, according to the Jerusalem Post, has become the first Muslim country in the modern world to recognize a “Jewish rabbinic authority.” “I would like to thank the Gaon Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto, who has accomplished this venerable project,” said the special Moroccan royal emissary to the event, Serge Bardugo. Bardugo also quoted King Mohammed VI as saying, “the Moroccan Kingdom has never ceased to pursue the love and adoration which exists between the sons of Abraham, an affinity which unites them all.” Expressing satisfaction with his appointment, the rabbi also thanked King Mohammed VI, his family, and the Jewish community in Morocco. Pinto, who is a great-grandson of the renowned Moroccan-born Rabbi Baba Sali, is one of the wealthiest rabbis in the world. In 2017, Pinto was released from Israeli prison after serving a one-year sentence for bribing a police officer. The rabbi started serving his jail term in February 2016. The rabbi appealed his sentence to the High Court, which rejected his request on account “of his health situation,” according to the Times of Israel. The rabbi, who pleaded guilty in a plea bargain, also paid a fine of $260,000. The news outlet said that the rabbi has been the subject of investigations from both Israeli security forces and the FBI since 2011. The 45-year-old rabbi also leads a global organization called Mosdot Shuva Israel. A total of 6.6 million Jews live in Israel, while 8.1 million live outside Israel. Morocco, which had about 250,000 Jews in the early part of the 1900s, is home to only 2,000 Jews currently, according to an Israeli expert on Jewish demography, Sergio Della Pergola, in 2018. Jewish communities have lived in Morocco since Roman days. After the Spanish Edict of Expulsion in 1492, some 20,000 Jews emigrated from Granada to Morocco. At their peak before Israel became a state in 1948, Jews in Morocco numbered over 200,000.

Rabat – A rabbi and a Moroccan Muslim teenaged girl published a joint book of their letters, which cover a variety of topics from personal experiences to religious and political differences, this month.   Lody van Kamp, an orthodox Jewish rabbi who is married with five children, and Oumaima Al Abdellaoui, a Moroccan Muslim high school student from Zaanstad in North Holland, make an unlikely pair. According to Dutch newspaper Reformatorish Daghblad, the two met through a Moroccan colleague of van Kamp and began to exchange letters. As the letters grew in number and depth, they decided to compile them into a book. The book, “Across Walls,” which went on sale at the beginning of the month, looks specifically at Jewish and Muslim culture within Dutch society. The letters, of which there are more than 20, cover a variety of topics, including personal successes and failures, the Palestine-Israel conflict, feminism, religion, and crime. In their discussions of religion, they tried to convince each other of their personal beliefs while staying respectful and friendly. Both feel deeply connected to their respective religions but came to the conclusion that Islam and Judaism have more similarities than differences.   A main sticking point between the two is the issue of Palestine and Israel. While they each express their views on the issue, they refrain from engaging in serious debate or attempts to change the other’s mind. “We could already fill a book about that conflict alone,” said van Kamp. But they both suggested that they will explore the topic in more depth in a second book. The subtitle of the book, “A hopeful correspondence,” illustrates the goals both van Kamp and Abdellaoui have for their letters They want to bridge differences and show that, despite being opposites in many respects, they have a great deal in common. “We do not solve problems in the Middle East, but I hope that the respectful, decent way we treat each other inspires others,” said van Kamp. “If we can do it, others can,” insisted Abdellaoui.

Rabat – Dozens of Algerian mayors have expressed their support for the popular movement seeking a radical change in the current government, saying they will boycott the July 4 election. AFP reported that approximately 40 of Algeria’s 1,500 mayors announced their decision to boycott. The opposition Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD) party said it supported the Algerian “Hirak,” emphasizing that all of its elected personnel would refuse to “organize the election.” The statement also described the election as a farce. AFP reported that RCD controls 37 Communal People’s Assemblies in Tizi Ouzou and Bejaia, two regions 100 and 250 kilometers east of Algiers. The news outlet reported that the two regions are the main administrative regions of Kabylia, a region in northern Algeria. Algeria has 1,541 town councils, mostly controlled by the National Liberation Front (FLN) and its ally, the National Democratic Rally (RND). The two parties faced outrage during the ongoing protests against their management of Algeria during President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s 20-year rule. AFP said that even the FLN mayor of a small town in the Tizi region decided not to participate in the July 4 election. The decision of the mayors not to supervise the election followed a similar announcement from Algerian magistrates, who are threatening to boycott the election. As members of the Algerian “Club of Magistrates,” judges and lawyers staged a strike on Saturday, April 13, at a justice court, saying they refused to supervise the coming general elections.

Rabat – Police forced four Algerian women activists from the Democratic and Social Movement (MDS) and Youth Action Rally (RAJ) political parties to undress on April 13 at a police station 15 kilometers southeast of Algiers after arresting them. Several activists told Algerian news outlet TSA that police arrested the four activists before they started their protests at the Grande Poste in Algiers, home of the 8th week of protests against ousted Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and the current government. Samir Larbi, an activist, told TSA that the four activists were “searched and then forced to undress completely. These women were not consulted by a doctor and no record was established.” The activist added that security forces did not treat male activists in the same way. TSA also interviewed Ines, one of the activists arrested on Saturday, April 13, and she narrated the mistreatment she suffered from at the police station. “Saturday … we were in a cafe next to the Grand Post. As we were about to meet at the stairs for our daily gathering, the police came to arrest Jalal, an activist like us. I started filming the scene. A policeman snatched the phone from me and loaded me up with the others while insulting me. We were taken to the Baraki police station. On the spot, a male police officer searched the bags of the girls, which he does not have the right to do [because] it must be done by a woman,” said the activist. Ines added that the police arrested 10 activists, four women and six men. She explained that a female officer came and summoned the women activists one after another into a room where she asked them to completely undress. “I asked her, ‘Why? I did not do anything serious.’ She replied, ‘Do not teach me how to do my job; take off your clothes, and do not talk to me.’” The activist added that the police did not release them until around 1 a.m. Commenting on the situation with outrage, the president of the RAJ, Abdelouahab Fersaoui,  described the act as “intimidation.” “These kinds of measures should not be reserved for activists but for potential dangerous individuals, delinquents, [or] those caught with drugs,” he said. He added that the activists were targeted “because they were arrested even before the rally began.” Fersaoui asserted that the security forces had wanted to humiliate activists. “I would ascribe this act to an attempt to weaken and break the popular protest movement,” he commented. France 24 reported that the authorities released the 10 activists who had been arrested on Saturday. On Friday, clashes erupted between police and protesters. Riot police fired tear gas and used water cannons to disperse the protesters. Protesters in Algeria have been calling for a radical change to the political system since February 22. The protesters are now calling on the interim president, Abdelkader Bensalah, to step down. Bensalah said that his interim government will hold the 2019 elections on July 4. However, Algerian magistrates and political activists are calling on protesters to boycott the election.

Rabat – Dunes done, mountains crossed and plains covered, the 34th Marathon des Sables (MDS) was all but over. On Saturday, the last steps of the world’s longest desert race, which Morocco hosted in its southern deserts, would be for charity. The sixth stage, nicknamed “the solidarity stage” or “the charity stage,” celebrates not only the end of the competition but the inauguration of The Solidarity Association of the Marathon des Sables’ newest center. Created 11 years ago, the association welcomes 240 children and 40 women each year to participate in physical education and literacy classes. It also provides a space for early sports awakening and handicrafts. The inauguration took place after the six-kilometer run, officially ending the race. “The finish [and] the inauguration, will remind [us] what we have done during this week. All together, without competition, all equal,” French runner Pierre Serfass said right before the start of the sixth stage. The governor of the province of Ouarzazate, Adberzak El Manssouri, joined MDS founder and race director Patrick Bauer for the inauguration. The center took more than three years to build and cost more than €200,000. The heads of the association hope the new center will lead to the association’s greater autonomy and sustainability and allow the organization to host more activities. According to race organizers, solidarity and charity are a core value of the Marathon des Sables. Each year many of the runners “adventuring in the heart of the desert, dedicate their participation to a noble cause.” While all 753 of the MDS participants wore blue during the sixth stage to show support for the Solidarity Association, runners were also representing other charities throughout the race. French runner Julien Lamour wore the colors of the Flavien Foundation, a Monaco-based charity dedicated to treating pediatric cancers and rare diseases. Another French runner, Marc Paniandy, supported Nid’enfants, a charity focused on the development of disabled children. “I’ve been running trail and ultra trail races for years. It’s the first time I’ll be competing in such an extraordinary race, and I’m proud to be able to help the Nid’enfants charity thanks to this participation,” Paniandy said before the start of the MDS. English father-and-son duo Paul and Hector Skipworth ran for Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis (OMS). The two runners chose to support the OMS charity because Paul’s wife and Hector’s mother suffers from multiple sclerosis. The 35th MDS will take place in 2020, April 3-13. The designs for a new course for the 35th MDS are in the works and the release of the course will come the day before the race on April 2, 2020.

Rabat – The Islamic Union in Brussels launched the campaign in the cities of Antwerp, Charleroi, Genk, Liege, and Namur. In Brussels only, approximately 50 young Muslim volunteers took part in the campaign by having conversations with as many as 10,000 people. Omer Sikier, who handles the Islamic Union’s external relations, told Anadolu press that the aim is to combat prejudices against Islam and fight Islamophobic tendencies. Sikier stressed that prejudices and Islamophobia come from ignorance of the religion. Similar campaigns have taken place in cities across Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, France, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Canada, and Australia. Volunteers have distributed a total of 210,000 flyers and many red roses to people in Europe throughout the campaigns. Muslims hope to dispel prejudices with the red roses. The campaign comes two months after a group of Belgian students mocked Islam by wearing Muslim clothes and military uniforms with fake suicide belts as part of a week of celebrations in which one day highlighted Saudi Arabia and Islam. The students were filmed performing Muslim prayers with a fake imam and shouting “Allahu Akbar.” Videos and photos of the practice were shared online. The video angered the Muslim community and even non-Muslims who blamed the school for tolerating such acts. An independent MP of the Brussels Regional Parliament, Mahinur Ozdemir, also strongly criticized the school event.

Rabat – In Morocco’s state-owned channel 2M’s televised “Hadith Ma’a Al-Sahafa” (Discussion with the Press) program, Morocco’s Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid stated on Sunday, April 14, that it is unlikely that Nasser Zefzafi, a leader of the Hirak mass protests, will serve his full 20-year prison term.  Even if the activists appeal their case again, this time to the Court of Cassation, and lost their case there, Ramid expects that Zefzafi will not have to complete his prison term. Ramid expressed his optimism at “the wise approach Morocco usually takes,” noting that the King has given royal pardons to more than 280 people arrested in relation to the Hirak movement. Commenting that Morocco has conducted serious trials throughout its history, prosecutors have tried some people for serious criminal offences, Ramid said that after offenders “made self-criticisms,” the state received them “well.” Ramid hoped that there would be “detente” regarding the Hirak Rif trials. He had posted earlier on Facebook that Morocco’s judicial system is independent, “irrespective of my or others’ opinions, which is also right.” Ramid asserted that the government did not arrest and convict the Hirak activists on the grounds of “public rights offences” or because they were protesting for social justice, but on political grounds relating to state security offences. Omar Balafrej, a politician with the Federation of the Democratic Left (FDG), who has been calling for a general amnesty of all Hirak prisoners, said in an interview with Moroccan news outlet Achkayen that political parties are not exercising their power over the Hirak prisoners’ sentences.  There is a big difference between actually exercising their power and simply making statements to the public, Balafrej said, calling justice in the Hirak case “absurd.” He argued, “If these parties are unwilling to take action on the matter, they have to declare so publicly.” He added, “They justified their inaction by waiting until the Court of Appeals issued its ruling. Now that it ruled, there is no excuse left for them.” In June 2018, the Criminal Chamber of the Casablanca Court of Appeals sentenced 54 Hirak activists to prison terms varying from one to 20 years. The Casablanca Court of Appeals upheld the ruling on April 5, 2019.  It was the death of Mohcine Fikri which sparked the Hirak Rif mass protests in the northern Amazigh (Berber) region of Morocco in 2016 and 2017. Fikri was crushed in a garbage truck while he was attempting to retrieve his confiscated merchandise. Riffians protested for months afterwards, flooding the streets of Al Hoceima and demanding social justice.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita has urged South Africa to work with Morocco to achieve a better climate for cooperation, in an interview with the South African weekly newspaper the Sunday Times. Citing their geographical location and continental sense of belonging, Bourita emphasized that Pretoria and Rabat should not experience bilateral problems. Tension between the two countries climaxed in 2014 when Pretoria recognized the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). South Africa continues to support the Polisario Front. South Africa’s latest move to undermine Morocco’s territorial integrity was in March, when it co-hosted a hostile meeting with Namibia to express support for Polisario’s independence claims. Commenting on the event, Bourita said that the symposium was against the “UN process aimed at finding a solution to the regional dispute over the Moroccan Sahara.” He added, “South Africa, as a member of the international community, must help with the necessary neutrality.”  In a spirit similar to Morocco’s dialogue initiative to Algeria in 2018 to break a political stalemate, Bourita emphasized Morocco’s support for the fight of the South African people “against the apartheid regime.” The Moroccan official also recalled the friendly ties which connected Morocco with South African leader Nelson Mandela. “We do not share the same borders, we do not have territorial problems,” Bourita said. Bourita argued that the problems between Morocco and South Africa are due to Pretoria’s position on a conflict in a “region located hundreds of kilometers away, a position that runs counter those of the United Nations and the African Union.” Ahead of the hostile symposium held by South Africa and Namibia in March, Pretoria’s President Cyril Ramaphosa had vowed to support the “struggle” of the Sahrawi people. Addressing Pretoria, Bourita said: “Normally, if you are a country that works within the framework of the international community, you should help without bias or siding with a party.” In 2017, German news outlet Deutsche Welle said that the “cultural heritage between Morocco and South Africa should enable the two parties to move forward.” Bourita made the same argument, noting the countries have important economies in Africa. Bourita added that both countries are “called upon to join hands to help Africa move towards the continent’s economic emergence.” Western Sahara should not be compared to Middle East issues Bourita argued that the UN had clearly defined the parameters in which a political solution to the conflict over Western Sahara should be fulfilled. Bourita added that the UN framework calls for a “realistic, pragmatic, durable solution that is based on compromise.” Bourita also stressed that the conflict over Western Sahara should never be compared to issues in the Middle East, such as the Palestinian case. “In Palestine, the UN has adopted a resolution calling for a two-state solution. Regarding the Sahara, there is a political process to find a settlement with Algeria,” he said. Bourita added that Israel’s presence in the Palestinian territories is globally recognized as an occupation. Marrakech conference on Western Sahara Morocco recently hosted the African Ministerial Conference on AU Support for the UN Political Process on the Regional Dispute over the Sahara in parallel with South Africa’s hostile symposium against Morocco’s territorial integrity in March. Bourita commented on Morocco’s event held in Marrakech, emphasizing that the conference was a measure to show that 37 African countries support Morocco’s position and that “the Pretoria conference should not be considered as a reference to the African position.” Bourita added that the Marrakech event intended to show that the Pretoria conference was a means to “divide Africa,” recalling the consensus reached at the 2018 31st AU summit in Nouakchott to support the UN’s exclusive role in mediating the Western Sahara conflict.  “Who divides Africa? Who decided that those who oppose Morocco should meet?” the minister asked. “Our message was that unity was in Marrakesh and division was in Pretoria,” the Moroccan official said.

Rabat – Even for somebody with her pedigree in adventure and travelling as well as her religious attachment to what she calls “our shared humanity, common experiences,” Alice Morrison evinces an unyielding refusal to exoticize Morocco. For the BBC journalist, who graciously describes herself as an “Arabian and adventurer,” the North African country, which she has come to see as her second home, is not only appealing because it is different from her native Britain. Rather, what is exciting for Morrison is the daily reminder, even while living with people considered “different,” that “what we have in common far outweighs anything that we may have as differences,” she told Morocco World News. Between January 9 and March 28, Morrison explored the Draa, Morocco’s longest river. The experience, she announced to the many enthusiastic followers of her adventures, was meant to capture the effect of humans on the environment. She wanted to see “what was happening” and how the region has changed in centuries of human life. “I’ll be exploring the rich valley of the Draa and its ancient cave paintings and vibrant agricultural life…. It’s a voyage of exploration and discovery,” Morrison announced. Halfway through her foray into the historical and social intricacies of the Draa valley, MWN spoke to Morrison about the aim of the expedition. Why Draa? What does it mean to crisscross a place for a long period of time? Did the exploration have anything to do with raising awareness about humans’ impact on nature? “No. Not really,” she boldly replied to the last question, seemingly unsettled by the idea of exploration as social militancy. But, she acknowledged, the adventure did have something to do with climate change. “The planet is changing so much that in places where there used to be life, where there used to be water and pottery, there no longer is. And I find that very interesting.” As an adventurer, Morrison seems more interested in “the enriching experience” of witnessing transformations in the world, but most importantly of making exciting discoveries and recounting those stories to other people “to inspire them.” “Thousands of years ago people were living there,” she said of the large surfaces of desert dunes she saw during the expedition. “That makes you wonder … where people will be in a thousand years’ time. Will they be on this planet or somewhere else? Morocco has historically been the darling of waves of Western tourists. From the inspiration and pilgrimage-themed trips of the beat generation pioneers like Jack Kerouac to the field research trips of scholars like Clifford Geertz, the North African country has nourished the imagination and sensibility of generations. Many who have travelled Morocco, including Morrison, confess to having fallen in love with the kingdom. It is difficult to categorize Morrison among those who exoticize the country and its people to justify their love for a place that supposedly looks nothing like their familiar environment. At the same time, it would be little exaggeration to suggest that Morrison’s experience as a decades-long adventurer is mostly occupied by the feeling of having visited “the soul of Morocco.” Despite her efforts to conceal it, Morrison’s voice echoes with enthusiasm when speaking of the numerous encounters she has had while crisscrossing Morocco. “Every single day there’s been something new. Every single day I’m discovering something new about the country,” she said, giving a list of “impressive” discoveries she made just one month into her Draa experience. The list included “a 16,000 km2 nature reserve” and “arrowheads from the Stone Age.” While most travelers’ obsession with history is more associated with self-serving sensationalism, an inclination to exoticize even the slightest differences, Morrison’s notion of discovery is much closer to a sense of genuine participation in the everyday of the people she meets. There is in Morrison a desire to “sense and feel connected to the history” under her feet. Does it help, in the Moroccan context, that she has quite an impressive command of Arabic? “Oh yes,” she answered, excitedly explaining how her knowledge of the language has made it easier for her to “feel home” and to be part of the collective experience of places in Morocco. In his review of Morrison’s 2017 book “From Morocco to Timbuktu: An Arabian Adventure,” Sam Wollaston spoke of what makes the book a fresh window of experience in the world of travel writing. “Alice Morrison is fabulous for not being just another actor-comedian on the travelogue gig and for actually knowing stuff—such as Arabic.” The article’s point is immediately obvious when speaking to Morrison about her numerous experiences. Shying away from prepackaged ideas, her reflections on the High Atlas region, home to the Draa River, are those of someone who has done her homework. She knows her subject. On her blog and in her public talks, history is a recurrent theme. But hers is not a history of past glories and battles. When she speaks of history, she frames it in a sense of the necessity of cultivating a humane closeness to the past. “One of the things that really surprises me is how much history there is just under your feet. In Morocco, you walk on history, and that is a metaphor for the world.” Here, however, attachment to the past is not meant as a way of feeling nostalgic. Rather, it is meant as a pathway towards nourishing humility borne out of the consciousness that where we are living now will not be our eternal home, that “many generations have lived and worked here before us.” For Morrison, exploring is caring. She does not simply visit a place, passively marveling at its natural spectacle of rivers, greeneries, or landscapes. In her view, while the physicality of being in a new place can be gratifying and even therapeutic, it should never be given precedence over the beauty of blending in, of connecting with locals. “I like to be a human animal in the world. In the end, the most important thing for any of us is our relationship with other people.” Morrison’s Morocco is more of a repertoire of faces, smiles, and welcoming words; of people—most of whose names she seems to remember with irreproachable accuracy—who have showered her with their generosity in the course of years spent going to and fro in Morocco. When we spoke about the Draa experience, Morrison was being aided by “two Ibrahims,” both Moroccans, and Jean-Pierre, a Morocco-based French expedition organizer. She described them as “very kind.” At bottom, Morrison’s philosophy is that travelling is didactic because it refreshes our perception, an invitation to see—and gradually unearth—the “pleasures of living.” “Nature, the actual physical and beautiful world we live in, is incredibly inspiring to me. I like to spend the night under the stars. I like to wake up to dawn. I like to feel the earth under my feet. I like to feel the sun on my face.” As she spoke, punctuating her sentences with emphatic enunciations and adorning her pauses with contagious laughter, Morrison’s expression suggested a climactic sense of being part of a universe of acquaintances that keeps expanding. Being a “professional adventurer,” she stressed, has added layers of nuance to her self-definition, in addition to pouring cold water on most of her youthful ideas on the Orient and the Muslim world. “The Forever Adventurer,” perhaps the most lyrical piece of journalism so far written about Morrison’s numerous adventures, presents her as being wedded to risks and challenges, but also to galvanizing humor and joy. Alice Morrison, the article noted, “has painted her life in a way that makes it possible to continue feeding her wandering, nomadic heart with a hearty dose of courage and humor to accompany her ever-roaming soul.” While the description successfully captured the essence of Morrison’s long career, it says very little about her passion for and faith in human fraternity. Her commitment to her calling—that is how she perceives her job—is as much about passion for life as it is about “responsibility for others.” But does not the latter part sound relatively Orientalist? How would Morrison respond to “natives” who may dismiss her “genuine love” for Morocco and Moroccans as another instance of “white privilege,” of Orientalism masquerading as care for others? In immediate response, Morrison took a deep breath, an acknowledgement that this was becoming a slippery playing field. She sighed before quickly saying, “Of course I do understand that some see me as an Orientalist. I do not have control over what people think.” Morrison, who seemingly cannot escape the complicated history between East and West, may be more accurately described as a reluctant Orientalist. Or, more in line with contemporary description, Morrison is “woke” about her unintended Orientalist inclinations. Mindful of the general tendency among Western travelers to “do something” about the world’s problems, a superiority complex which the Nigerian author Teju Cole has called the “White-Savior Industrial Complex,” Morrison refrains from engaging in hyper-intellectual pronouncements about her journeys. An adventurer’s job, she seemed to suggest, is to enjoy the treasures that cross her path, to excavate new meanings, and dive as deeply as possible into making random connections with people whose common humanity is life-enriching. Generosity, empathy, humanity, and responsibility are hallmarks of her vocabulary. “I am not sure that is relevant to our conversation. I don’t think that is related to the Draa expedition,” she said with disarming civility when asked her opinion on Morocco’s current political trajectory. “My job as an adventurer is to share my experiences and inspire other people.” Her suggestion, as she pointed out to MWN numerous times during our interview, is that the story of political success, or failure, of Morocco is Moroccans’ to tell, not hers. Despite her penchant for cautious talk, however, Morrison is unrecognizably effusive when it comes to dissecting stereotypes. She is keen to demonstrate how ill-informed and “stupid” stereotypes of countries like Morocco can be in the West. “We are all human beings. When the sun is hot, we all feel hot and thirsty,” she said. “Cultural differences should be celebrated, not something to part us. That is what I have learned as an adventurer.” But Morrison can get political when speaking about some specific topics. In June 2018, she wrote an elegant piece on the encouraging prospects of women’s rights in Morocco. While nuanced, the article was unmistakably congratulatory. It reads more like a hymn to Morocco, a vindication of what Morocco specialists have called the “Moroccan exception.” “Picture an Islamic nation and women’s rights are probably not the first thing that springs to mind—but Morocco could be challenging that stereotype, armed with a legislation aimed at protecting women and a growing civil society movement…. Change takes time… but Morocco is showing the way,” Morrison’s article hammered. Almost a year after such lavish praise of Morocco’s recent political reforms, does Morrison still hold the same view? “Yes,” she replied without hesitation. But how, why? Could she elaborate? Dodging the question and reluctant to take any position that could easily be seen as a lecture, Morrison took refuge in pointing to universal longings. “I think change takes time, and I think everybody involved in it has to try to work together towards it. I mean not just in Morocco, but my own country is going through a terrible crisis at the moment,” she said. “Politics is difficult; governing a country is difficult… We all are striving for the same things: better life for your country, your children, or yourself. Everybody wants the same things; it is just about how we can get there.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP) has sealed a partnership deal with the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), and the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) to explore new fertilizer systems, and develop “value chains and implement field projects to benefit African farmers,” read a joint statement from the institutions OCP, the world’s larger phosphates exporter, IFDC, and UM6P announced the partnership on April 11 in Washington D.C during the signing of a master agreement between IFDC and OCP. Commenting on the partnership, Chairman and CEO of Morocco’s phosphate exporter, Mostafa Terrab, said that “this important partnership with IFDC confirms and advances our ambition to mobilize world-class resources in research and innovation for the benefit of Africa in general, and African smallholder farmers in particular.” President and CEO of IFDC Albin Hubscher said that the partnership will “accelerate the development and large-scale production of more efficient fertilizers to increase smallholder productivity and incomes while respecting the environment.” The joint  statement from the OCP, IFDC, and UM6P added that the multi-year partnership will seek to enhance the capacity and productivity of African agriculture and farmers via creative fertilizers “that meet the specific needs of the African soil and economic conditions for sustainable development.” In addition to the new partnership with UM6P and IFDC, Morocco’s OCP, which owns 75 percent of the world’s reserves in phosphates, also concluded several other partnerships with international groups. In February, Morocco approved the creation of an OCP subsidiary in Ethiopia to boost the East African country’s agricultural productivity. Firms like OCP Africa have established Morocco as a key player on the African scene.  In addition to Ethiopia, OCP Group seeks also to sign a deal with Nigeria’s Sovereign Investment Authority to build an ammonia plant in Nigeria, and is also considering to build a plant in Ghana in 2020. OCP aims also to build a blending facility in Rwanda, three in Nigeria, one in Ivory Coast, five in Ethiopia and one in Ghana, In January, several reports and news outlets applauded Morocco’s outreach in continental markets. British paper Financial Times wrote that Morocco is spearheading “the emergence of genuinely post-colonial African order.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI addressed a message to the participants of the extraordinary session of the conference of heads of state and government of the Community of Sahel-Saharan States held on Saturday in N’Djamena, the capital of Chad. King Mohammed VI expressed Morocco’s support to provide fresh momentum to CEN-SAD, emphasizing that he supports the strengthening of the group’s activities for the promotion of peace, stability, and development in the region. The Sahel region has been experiencing several challenges in recent years, including terrorism and drug trafficking. Moroccan security services have been calling on joint security cooperation in the Maghreb to counter the challenges facing the region. The Head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) Abdelhak El Khiame warned of security issues in the Sahel region. Khiame said that trafficking circles clearly finance terrorism in the Sahel, which is a “fertile ground for terrorism, posing a threat in the entire region.” In his recent message, King Mohammed VI reiterated Morocco’s commitment to giving a“fresh momentum to the CEN-SAD as a Regional Economic Community of the African Union. To this end, I am in favor of strengthening CEN-SAD’s action for the promotion of peace, stability, and development in the Sahel-Saharan region.”  The King also said that Morocco sought to ensure the emergence of the Sahel-Saharan region through maintaining fraternal relations with all member countries. Morocco, according to the monarch, has been always reaffirming commitments to South-South cooperation that aims to pave the way for an integration that is conducive to investment and trade and that targets co-development.

Rabat – “From Tindouf to Laayoune – Road to Dignity” is an investigative film produced by Moroccan TV Channel Medi1TV documenting the living condition in both sides, inside the Tindouf camps and Morocco’s Southern provinces. The documentary, which will be aired on Medi1TV on Sunday at 9 p.m. (GMT+1), was displayed in front of a delegation of Journalists in Bayt Assahafa (Press House) in Tangier on Friday, The documentary seeks to uncover the untold story about the humanitarian and social conditions of Saharawis in the Tindouf camps, which are often overlooked by human rights watchdogs. In order to get into Tindouf Camps, Medi1TV sought the help of a Spanish journalist, Patricia Madjidi Juez. Medi1TV had to reach out to a Spanish journalist because Algerian officials won’t grant a Moroccan channel the permission to film in their territory. The journalist visited the Tindouf Camps first, where she did not have the right to film or to freely speak with citizens. According to Patricia, Spanish media reports about Morocco and Polisario do not reflect reality. The journalist spoke with a Sahrawi living inside the Tindouf Camps. The Sahrawi, who decided to show his face to the world even though he is at risk of being “tortured” or even “killed”, narrated his own story reflecting the reality of Sahrawis’ living situation in the Tindouf Camps. He stated that the humanitarian aids containing food and medicine never reached their final destination and are instead sold in the market in Rabouni. He added that anyone who speaks to international media or human rights organization is severely punished. A report published by the European Union Anti-fraud Committee (OLAF) published in 2014 documented the embezzlement of humanitarian aid destined for the Tindouf camps 1975. The report, which was conducted between 2003 and 2007 and was only published in 2014, revealed that Polisario leadership and Algerian authorities have been involved in years-long, well organized large embezzlement of the humanitarian aid destined for the camp. “One of the reasons which made such diversions possible is the overestimate of the number of refugees and thus of the aid furnished. This overestimation, well known, made possible and facilitated the diversions. The donors accepted population figures for which numerous witnesses say everyone knows that they are overestimated, without their assistance policy being modified accordingly,” says the report. The man also claimed that he was subjected to torture and punishment. When his father and oldest sister died, he reached out to the Polisario’s so-called Ministry of Health which denied the responsibility and told him to remain silent. Speaking with tears, the Sahrawi said that Polisario took him to an unknown place and raped him for revealing the awful truth about the front breaching international human rights. “The Polisario government is almost inexistent and lives through the selling of the aid,” the Sahrawi told the Journalist. The description of the humanitarian situation given by the Saharawi mirrors the findings of the EU OLAF report, which pointed that that the embezzlement of humanitarian aid is done in an “organized fashion” upon the arrival of humanitarian aid to the port of Oran in Algeria, during the trip from Oran to Rabouni in the Tindouf camps, and once the merchandise is stored in warehouses in the camps. The report also revealed that “good-quality food intended for the refugees is replaced by its equivalent of a lesser quality, the best being sold.” “If one day Western Sahara is independent, the world will witness an Algerian expansion into those areas,” he added. When speaking to Sahrawi people in Tindouf, everyone pretends that everything is normal. But, the journalist could see the “fear” in their eyes, according to the journalist. Hospitals have a serious lack of medicine and necessary medical equipment. The Polisario authorities decline it even though the mortality rate among children is high. The journalist spoke with a former judge at the Polisario Front, Ahmine Ahmadou, who echoed the same declaration made by the Sahrawi. Inside Laayoune city At first sight, the journalist was surprised by seeing a Mcdonalds in Laayoune. She said that “it does not open in conflict zones.” Patricia sat with many Sahrawi women in Laayoune and visited many socio-economic projects. She also met with the municipal president and other officials from the city. Contrary to Tindouf, Patricia did not feel afraid of walking around. The documentary shows that Sahrawi women appear to enjoy all their rights and have many work opportunities. Laayoune has the second biggest library in Morocco with the latest equipment. The journalist visited the regional hospital in the city where patients who have RAMED (insurance card provided by the government) are treated for free, a seawater desalination station working with wind turbines and solar energy, and supermarkets. The documentary, which has sought to dispel Polisario’s allegation about Morocco’s exploitation of the natural resources of the territory, shows that phosphate production in Laayoune represents 2% of Morocco’s overall production. This production net profit is used to fund socio-economic projects in Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra the region.

Rabat – Algerian authorities released ten activists after they were arrested while attempting to continue their protests condemning the police crackdown on peaceful demonstrations on Friday. France 24 reported that activists were arrested and “taken to a security center away from the center of [the Algerian capital] as they were preparing to gather at the Central Post Square,” home to Algeria’s hirak since February 22. Hakim Addad, former Secretary-General of the Algerian Youth Assembly, said that the activists “were released and waiting to be free.” On Friday,  thousands of protesters rallied to mark the eight week of protests against the Algerian government and the appointment of Abdelkader Bensalah as an interim president. Protesters called on the government to leave. Riot police confronted the peaceful protesters, firing tear gas and water cannons to disperse protests. Algerian security forces announced they arrested 108 protesters during Friday’s protests. Senior army chief Gaid Salah warned citizens against further protests, calling on them to stop chanting “unrealistic slogans” and to respect the constitution. The Algerian government announced July 4 as the date for the election to appoint the new president. Several magistrates, however, threatened to boycott the election. Algerian political activist Rachid Nekkaz shared a Facebook post, in which he called on Algerians to boycott the election. “Fourth of July is US Independence day; it is not part of Algeria’s history,” he said. He argued that Bensalah cannot run the country as an interim president because of he is Moroccan. “Mr. Abdelkader Bensalah] has a Moroccan nationality. He can be a minister, a governor, a director of an administration, but it is impossible for him to be a president,” referring to the country’s constitution.

Rabat – FRS ferry service announced that its Volcan del Tauce passengers ship will connect Tangier med and Granada, Spain, in May, according to El Faro de Ceuta. The Spanish news outlet reported that the ferry will provide its services between the two destinations with a capacity of 347 passengers and 320 vehicles. The Vocal del Tauce will change its course as it was serving a sea route between Motril and Melilla. FRS said that they will replace Volcan del Tauce with Golden Bridge, which has a capacity of more than 1,500 passengers, 500 vehicles and cargo. FRS said that the ferry will connect Mortil and Melilla in 5 hours and 90 minutes. The new service, which will connect Granada with Tangier for the first time, will benefit Moroccan expats who arrive in the thousands in Morocco for summer holidays. Every year, Morocco launches an operation called ‘Marhaba’ to welcome home thousands of  Moroccan expats. Tangier-Med authorities said last year that a total of 842,698 passengers crossed the northern port of Tangier-Med to enter Morocco since the beginning of the Marhaba operation in June until August 25, 2018. With Ramadan around the corner, some Moroccans residing abroad might arrive in Morocco before the launch of the 2019 Marhaba operation to spend the holy month with their families. Ramadan, according to a Moroccan astronomer, is expected to begin on May 7 in Morocco.

Rabat – His paw prints tracking for hundreds of miles across the Sahara Desert, the local runner slept, drank, raced and was petted during each stage of the world’s longest desert race. The dog, nicknamed Cactus, found his way to the starting line of the second stage of the 34th Marathon des Sables (MDS)—a week-long, 200-kilometer staged race through some of the world’s most difficult conditions. Side-by-side with competitors from more than fifty nations, Cactus ran through southern Morocco’s desert heat, winds, sand dunes, rocks, stony plateaus, and valleys. More grueling than the environment of the race were the distances Cactus and other competitors ran.  The fourth stage of the MDS, nicknamed “the long stage,” is 76.3 kilometers in distance—the length of two marathons. While some human runners needed up to 32 hours to complete this stage, Cactus only needed a third of that time. A small sandstorm may have slowed him down, but his four legs crossed the finish line in 11 hours and 15 minutes—placing him 76th in the overall stage results and first in the dog category. After the big win, Cactus celebrated by wagging off the sand coating his white-and-black fur and running another few kilometers to cool down. Online coverage of Cactus’ exploits made him the unofficial mascot of the marathon the moment he trotted past the finish line. The MDS’ first furry-faced Facebook post had more than two thousand likes, 500 comments, and 480 shares. As he kept putting one paw in front of the other, his fame only grew. The post announcing Cactus’ first-place finish among dogs has more than five thousand likes, 600 comments and a thousand shares on Facebook. His online popularity and engagement dwarfs that of any of the human finishers. Buried among the abundance of comments was one from Karen Hadfield, the founder and director of Cafe Tissardmine, where Cactus, actually named “Diggedy,” spends his nights in between adventures. The two first met last year during Hadfield’s annual birthday camping trip. Cactus stumbled upon her tent and decided she needed a guardian—he never left. Diggedy is named after the dog of famous Australian writer and explorer Robyn Davidson. After spending more than 30 years in Australia, Hadfield was inspired by Davidson’s nearly 3,000-kilometer trek through the Western Australian desert. In keeping with his namesake, after runners completing the second stage of the marathon passed the village, Diggedy bounded off to keep up. At first, Hadfield tried keeping up with him, but he had soon left her and the village’s roughly 100 inhabitants behind. “I was worried when he didn’t come back and a few people online thought I was terrible for letting him go, but he was having fun and he had a job to do,” Hadfield said. “He is a herder. Here in the village, he is always herding other animals, I think when he saw the runners come by he decided this group needed looking after too.” As Diggedy was given his new nickname, Cactus, and his popularity among the runners and online fans grew, MDS organizers decided he needed some looking after as well. They made him an official participant of the race by giving the dogged four-legged runner an official bib number “000” and his own personalized tracking device so Hadfield, along with his hundreds of followers, could follow his progress. Organizers even created his own hashtag, #CactusTheMDSDog. “I’ve been very proud of him and following him online. My internet connection here isn’t consistent, but I’ve done more social media in the last week than in the last nine years of being here,” Hadfield said. “I’ve been keeping in touch with organizers to make sure he was okay, but I couldn’t bring him back, he was just so inspiring to the runners. I would have been everyone’s worse enemy.” American runner Jay Batchen, a 13-time finisher of the MDS, couldn’t believe how much of an effect Cactus had at the bivouacs each night. “The smiles he brought to people’s faces by just walking around was incredible,” Batchen told Morocco World News. “He would walk up to people roll over on his side and ask for a belly rub and everyone loved it—it added a little more happiness to the race.” Cactus’ love for roaming the desert wasn’t a surprise. According to Hadfield, he can sometimes travel up to 40 kilometers while exploring the area around Tissardmine. “When he does go off for a couple of days, like he just did, I miss him, but I know he’ll always come back,” Hadfield said. Through communicating with race organizers, Hadfield arranged a pick-up time to finally bring Cactus home—but not until he finished the MDS last stage on Saturday. While Hadfield will be bringing home his finisher’s medal, she won’t be keeping the nickname. “It is lovely everyone game him a nickname, but I’m sorry, I can’t go with Cactus. At home he is Diggedy,” Hadfield said, later explaining that cactuses don’t grow in the Sahara Desert and that, in Australia, cactus is a colloquial term used if something goes wrong. Now, safely at home, Diggedy will be spending the next few days resting. But Hadfield knows he’ll be back exploring the desert soon enough. Whenever Hadfield or Diggedy goes near the fridge, they’ll see his finisher’s medal hanging next to it. Whether or not another one will be added next year during the 35th MDS is completely up to the dog.  “I won’t volunteer him for the race, but if it so happens that he starts following all the runners again, that is Diggedy’s choice,” Hadfield said. “It is important for him to have that freedom.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Education said that it has reached an agreement with the contractual teachers, after more than five weeks of protest against their working conditions. The agreement, according to the ministry, was concluded after a meeting with education unions, and human rights representatives. The National Coordination of “the Forcibly Contracted Teachers” confirmed that all educators will go back to their work starting Monday, April 15. Members of the National Council of Human Rights (CNDH) attended the meeting to play a mediation role in accordance with Article 10 of Law 15-76. The press release said that “after serious and responsible discussion among all parties, it was agreed to  suspend all administrative and legal measures taken against some teachers.” The statement added that the ministry will also pay suspended wages and to examine the status of the suspended contractual teachers. The agreement followed weeks of national strikes and protests from contractual teachers, who were seeking permanent jobs. The teachers described themselves as “forcibly contractual educators.” In 2016, the Moroccan government began hiring teachers under annually renewable contacts every year. The contractual teachers, who are not officially part of the public sector, receive the same salary, starting at MAD 5,000 ($520) monthly, as teachers who are permanently on the government payroll but have reduced pensions. Teachers working under contracts will only receive 40 percent of their monthly salary after retirement. If they receive MAD 10,000 while working, the teachers will receive MAD 4,000 monthly after retiring.

Rabat – Political activist and businessman Rachid Nekkaz has called on Algerians to boycott the July 4 presidential election. Nekkaz is one of the most outspoken opponents of Bouteflika’s regime. The activist also attempted to run for the election that was planned for April 18 before the resignation of former Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Nekkaz shared a nine-minute video on his  official Facebook page calling Algerians to boycott the election. Nekkaz also condemned the appointment of Abdelkader Bensalah on Tuesday as an interim president in the transitional period before the election. The politician said, “Mr. Abdelkader Bensalah] has a Moroccan nationality. He can be a minister, a governor, a director of an administration, but it is impossible for him to be a president,” referring to the country’s constitution.  Nekkaz added “we don’t have anything against Moroccans. Those are our Muslim brothers.  I visit Morocco sometimes and thank them. They are working [hard].” “However, the constitution said that anyone who has another nationality is forbidden to be a president.” Addressing Algerian army chief Gaid Salah, Nekkaz said that Algerian officials themselves “do not respect the constitution.” Earlier this week, Salah addressed a speech to Algerians, calling on them to respect the constitution and to stop chanting “unrealistic slogans.” The politician’s remarks were echoed by other political activists in Algeria. The head of Algeria’s Justice and Development Front Party, Lakhdar BenKhellaf, also opposed Bensalah because he was born in Morocco. Ben Khellaf stated earlier that “the condition for a [leader] occupying the post of President of the Republic, is that he must have the Algerian nationality of origin. And he [Bensalah] had another nationality until 1964 during which he had obtained Algerian nationality.” Nekkaz also commented on the day Algerian parliament chose to hold the presidential election. “Fourth of July is US Independence day; it is not part of Algeria’s history,” he said. The politician marched in numerous protests, and in February was beaten and violently thrown out of a protest by police forces. In March, Swiss police arrested Nekkaz when he attempted to check on Bouteflika’s health situation at the Geneva University Hospital. A police spokesperson, Joanna Matta, said that the hospital filed a complaint against Nekkaz for trespassing. In response to his arrest, Nekkaz said in an interview with France 24 that every Algerian has the right to know the president’s health status, and the government should not keep it a secret. Protests in Algeria escalated when police used water cannons and fired tear gas to disperse protests. Authorities later announced that 108 protesters were arrested in Friday clashes. There are also reports that 27 policemen were injured as demonstrations escalated.

Rabat – Morocco’s Atlas Lions have drawn what many see as the most challenging group for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) in Egypt June 21-July 19. Once again, the specter of “the group of death” haunts Morocco as its Lions feature in Group D, where they will take on Namibia, South Africa, and Cote d’Ivoire. The draw brings back memories of other occurrences, like the 2018 World Cup and the 2017 CAN, when the Lions faced the misfortune of being in the most lethal group. While the description “group of death” is sometimes a sporting exaggeration for the least “playable” group, the caution it elicits is real. Most often, in sports at least, exaggerations convey a feeling that the order of things is sometimes unchangeable. The assessment is based on how well each team has played recently. There is a kernel of truth lurking beneath every exaggerated account of events. Namibia, which has no glorious CAN history to call upon, is set to be the underdog of the group. Namibia will also be Morocco’s first opponent. For many, the game is set to be the most “playable” fixture for the Moroccan Lions. But beware of underdogs! If Morocco learned anything in the summer of 2018—remember the hype about Morocco easily beating Iran to boost its morale before the next challenging games against Portugal and Spain?—it is that underdogs are a particularly frightening prospect because they have extra motivation to “make history.” Plus, you do not what to expect when playing them. Also, a 1-0 defeat against an underdog is more morale-damaging than, say, a 5-0 thrashing against an equal or superior side. That means an unexpected poor display is to be avoided at all costs. “This is a very difficult group. But we are used to playing against big teams,” Herve Renard, Morocco’s French coach, said after last night’s draw.
Renard, one of the most successful coaches with CAN, visibly wants to draw on his positive pedigree to help Morocco succeed after more than 30 years of disappointment mixed with occasional brilliance. By “big teams,” Renard may not have been only referring to Morocco’s African games, where the Atlas Lions have constantly been paired with countries like Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Algeria, etc. On the global stage, Renard’s Lions played Spain and Portugal in a World Cup they left with a mixture of pride and disappointment. Most recently, Morocco played Argentina in a friendly, a game in which the Lions were simultaneously overwhelming and underwhelming. So Renard is right: Big teams and least playable games are nothing new to his boys. But that is not the question Moroccans had when they learned the fate of Morocco after the draw. The question is: Can Renard make this year “the year” for Moroccan football? Will Morocco’s Lions finally bring something back home instead of the usual trophy-less good performances that temporarily please fans but never fulfill their ultimate dream? Renard, seeming to guess the apprehension of some Moroccan fans, tried to inspire confidence. He called, as has been his trademark, on the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) and the Moroccan public to trust their Lions and support them. Then what? Renard answered: “I have already played against some of the teams in our group, most notably Namibia, when I coached Zambia. We will start preparing [as soon as possible], with help from the FRMF, which has promised to put everything at our disposal.” The suggestion, for Moroccan fans, is that while Namibia may be an exotic contender for most teams at the 2019 CAN, Renard knows them very well. Renard appeared to be implying that no unpleasant surprises should be expected from Namibia. Except if, as it often happens in the most unexplainable of footballing defeats, the gods of football side with Namibia, making Morocco’s greater pool of talents toothless and irrelevant. But what about South Africa and Cote d’Ivoire? Sensing the unarticulated question of the challenges that Cote d’Ivoire and South Africa are, Mehdi Benatia, Morocco’s captain and perhaps the most high-profile African defender—let’s forget about his incomprehensible decision to ditch Juventus for a Qatari Club—reiterated his coach’s faith in the potential of the Moroccan squad. “This is certainly one of the most difficult groups of [the 2019] CAN. We will have it at heart to do our utmost to represent the Moroccan people,” Benatia offered to his Twitter followers. He added a Moroccan twist to his message, hammering home his and most of Moroccan fans’ sentiment: “See you in Egypt inshallah.” South Africa, a bit like Morocco, has its best memories in the past. With the days of the glorious Bafana Bafana who dominated Africa in 1996 and played decently at the 1998 World Cup in France 20 years behind, South Africa’s closest inspiring moments are of the 2010 World Cup, which they hosted. Pulsating in the opening game against Mexico—ah that delightful Tshabala goal!—the Bafana Bafana were monotonous in their two remaining games. The excitement of their opening match was as big as the devastation of their exit from the group stages. Since 2010, South Africa’s squad has fluctuated between decent and poor performances, with the vuvuzela being the only notable mark they have had on world football. But beware. A side looking to revive its glorious days is still a threat, especially with the subtle political context that may hover in the air as Morocco takes on South Africa. Cote d’Ivoire, meanwhile, is perhaps the most frightening opponent for the Moroccan Lions. The Ivorian Elephants may not be the scintillating side they were when no African team could resist their deadly Didier Drogba-led attacking machine, or when a disciplined Yaya Toure-led and Herve Renard-coached Ivorian side deservingly won the 2015 CAN. Still, the Ivorian side boasts some of Africa’s most revered players. Gervinho, Serge Aurier, Eric Bailey, Max Gradel, and Wilfried Zaha remain behemoths in African football, despite the underwhelming series of seasons some of them have been having of late. In addition, the Elephants will come with the extra motivation of revenging the home humiliation Morocco inflicted on them while qualifying for the 2018 World Cup. Morocco’s squad, while not entirely inspiring in the past few months, do have the quality and depth needed to make a difference. Since Renard came in as coach, the Moroccan squad has met with emphatic praise. The depth and quality of their football have prompted comparisons to the best days of Moroccan football, associating them with a footballing renaissance. Apart from the attacking line, where Khaled Boutaib and Ayoub El Kaabi are easily subsumed by most African forwards to appear at this year’s tournament, Morocco can take pride in having a near-perfect pool of choice in other positions. A big challenge, however, will be to replace Achraf Hakimi, whose recently broken metatarsal has put him in doubt for the rest of the season. The 20-year-old star has been a delightful revelation for Dortmund this season, and his absence is set to hurt Morocco’s damage-inflicting capabilities. When Morocco won the Africa Cup of Nations in 1976, major football tournaments were hardly the glamorous and geopolitics-laden contests they now are. Beyond the glamour, however, the game has kept its emotional and social side for most African countries. On the continent, defining victories in football are capitalized upon to assuage the wrath and frustration of poverty-stricken populations. Even with the constant threat of hyper-capitalism, the beautiful game, as it is called, has stubbornly remained an engine of social cohesion and social mobility. With the number of CAN contenders having been expanded from 16 to 24 and the quality of play exponentially growing on the continent, being African champions is now far more daunting than it used to be. But Renard is optimistic. He believes that Morocco can prevail, and perhaps do better than 2004, when they lost 2-1 to host Tunisia. For those who still have some lingering doubts, unable to forget the series of last-minute goals and might-have-beens that have tainted Morocco’s successive generations of “golden boys” who all ended up being not quite as golden as Moroccan fans had wanted them to be, Renard had a final message of hope. There is nothing to be gained from being pessimistic when preparing for a defining battle, he suggested in an interview with a Moroccan outlet after the draw. “Being in a difficult group will allow us to be focused from the very outset of the competition. When you have ambitions, you should be able to beat any team,” Renard said.

Rabat – Algerians are back to the streets to protest against the Bensalah-led interim government, saying they want an immediate and total break with the Bouteflika regime. On Tuesday, Parliament appointed Abdelkader Bensalah, the 77-year-old former president of the Council of the Nation, to rule the country during the three-month-long transition until the next election on July 4. While Bensalah is barred from running in the “transparent” elections he has promised, Algerians see his rule as an extension of the Bouteflika years. Thousands came out on Friday to mark the eighth week of protest against against the country’s political establishment. While protesters sang “peace, peace,” to suggest they were simply here to express disappointment at the turn of events instead of vandalize, police did not hesitate to fire tear gas. As they faced, undeterred, the riot police’s firing tear gas to contain them, they chanted “they will all leave,” an anti-government slogan suggesting that the youth-led movement want a total rupture from the old regime. But yesterday was unprecedented in the ongoing anti-government fervor in Algeria. According to reports, an estimated hundreds of thousands faced the riot-police in Algiers in what has largely been described as “peaceful demonstrations.” Authorities later announced that 108 protesters were arrested in Friday clashes. There are also reports that 27 policemen were injured as demonstrations escalated. Police claim that the “infiltrators” are using violence to influence the agenda of what started off as peaceful protests against former President Abdel Aziz Bouteflika. But analysts have denied those claims, with suggestions that the remaining Bouteflika clan, still controlling the country, is seeking to delegitimize the anti-Bensalah fervor. Despite perception that authorities will not hesitate to harshly repress protesters should they continue staging demonstrations, Algerians are undeterred because their “demands are clear,” Dalia Ghanem, a researcher at the Beirut-based Carnegie Middle East Center, told Aljazeera on Friday. “They know what they can achieve with their protests every Friday but also their daily protests. The momentum is here and the status quo is winding up,” Ghanem said. Other analysts, meanwhile, have suggested that Algerians have learned from the failed Arab Spring in Egypt and elsewhere. The idea is that Algerian protesters trust neither the army nor the remaining figures of the old regime. They fear that their revolution could be hijacked and will not relent until they cleanse the country of “le pouvoir,” a French word used in Algeria to refer to the restricted circle of generals, businessmen, and technocrats who “confiscated” Algerian politics during the two decades under Bouteflika. “The July 4 election has already been rejected by the people, which also refuses Bensalah’s nomination,” Algerian philosophy professor Mahrez Bouich said. According to Bouich, Algerians will not allow the political establishment to use the constitution to toy with Algerians by removing Bouteflika to only replace him with a kindred leader. “They will all leave,” one of the key slogans of the anti-Bensalah protests, has been interpreted as meaning that demonstrations will continue until Bensalah and all the remaining Bouteflika “gangsters” are ousted. As the youth asks for a fundamental regime change, it remains to be seen how far General Ahmed Gaid Salah, the army chief of staff who has already denounced the crowds’ “unrealistic slogans,” will go in repressing the visibly unfading tide of anti-government protests.

Rabat – More than 300 people from political parties, organizations, and labor unions signed an international petition to condemn the decision of the Casablanca Court of Appeals to uphold sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years for 54 Hirak activists on April 5. The Committee to Support the Rifian Movement in Paris (CSRMP) published the petition on Friday on the Jewish-French Union for Peace (UJFP) website to demand the immediate release of the Hirak activists. Organizations from France, Spain, Belgium, Tunisia, Netherlands, Morocco, and Algeria have signed the petition. “Late in the night of Friday, April 5, 2019, the verdict appeal of the Hirak Rif activists fell: upholding the revolting sentences of up to 20 years in prison,” the petition read. The signatories wrote that the Hirak Rif activities marched in “peaceful” demonstrations for the “most basic social, economic, cultural, and political demands,” including rights to dignity, health access, and the “effective recognition of the Amazigh [Berber] language.” “The ruling pronounced represents the absence of a state of law and social and democratic justice,” said the petition. The signatories expressed “total solidarity with the struggle of the Hirak prisoners and their families for dignity, social justice and democracy.” The signatories added that they support all “peaceful initiatives for the immediate release of the prisoners of Hirak Rif.” The petition followed protests in the Al Hoceima region to condemn the court’s ruling. Nasser Zefzafi, a prominent leader of the movement, received a sentence of 20 years in prison, announced that he had sewn his lips in a hunger strike to denounce his lost appeal. Moroccan media reported that Zefzafi stopped the hunger strike, but his father said that his son would go on a new hunger strike after the prison administration decided to transfer the Hirak activists from Casablanca to prisons farther north. Ahmed Zefzafi wrote this week that his son was jailed with a group of “criminals” in a prison in Fez. On Thursday, Morocco’s General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR) announced the transfer of the Hirak prisoners to prisons near their home cities in northern Morocco.

Rabat – Algerian judges have joined the youth-led protests across Algeria, threatening to boycott the supervision of the July 4 general elections.  As members of the Algerian “Club of Magistrates,” judges and lawyers staged a strike on Saturday, April 13, at a Justice Court. The club expressed its refusal to supervise the coming general elections, expected to be held on July 4.  In a statement to the press, Merzougui Saad Eddine, the club’s spokesman and an examining magistrate at the court of justice, said, “Algeria is going through an unprecedented and historic stage it had not witnessed since independence. We are compelled to take the lead in protecting this country.” At a rally before the Justice Court, Merzougui, announced the club’s “irrevocable boycott the supervision” of the July 4 presidential elections. The judges and lawyers, he said, “refuse to bear false testimony for elections whose results are decided in advance.” The club also called for “the independence of the judiciary system,” “the opening of investigations into corruption” and the end of the “sanctions” suffered by magistrates. Algerians have been protesting for over two months now. The protests started when former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced his bid for a fifth term after two decades in power.  Although Bouteflika has since resigned, Algerians have continued rallying across the country, demanding that Abdelkader Bensalah also step down.  Bensalah, who was appointed by parliament to run the country during the constitutional 90 days of transition before general elections, has promised “fair and transparent elections” in which he will not take part. Algerians, however, see Bensalah’s rule  as a continuation of the Bouteflika regime. They say they will continue protesting until “they all leave,” referring to the entire political establishment that led Algeria in the two decades of the Bouteflika’s grip on power.

Rabat – Sprawled on a rug, under the shade of a street-side tree, Mohammed Aziz began taking his revenge by re-reading one of the nine books he owned. Orphaned at the age of six, Aziz attempted to fish as a means to afford his dream of graduating high school. At 15, Aziz awoke to the reality that he would not be able to finish his education—the textbooks were too expensive. Angry and without a diploma Aziz’s more than half-century career as a bookseller began. “This is how I take my revenge on my childhood, my situation, my poverty,” Aziz told Morocco World News, disturbing a precarious tower of outdated magazines by waving at his shop. After more than 43 years in the same spot, Aziz is the oldest bookseller in Rabat’s medina (old city). The sight of him reading by the door frame of his five-by-five-foot bookshop is a landmark of Mohammed V Avenue, which runs through the heart of the old city in Rabat. In his store customers can find tabloid magazines for MAD 5 ($0.52) and medical textbooks for MAD 700 ($73). Aziz works a 12-hour day. He begins with a walk around Rabat’s neighborhoods searching for book vendors with similarly humble setups to the start of his career. After buying the best from the competition, Aziz heads to the shop and adds his new books to the stacks. When asked how many books he has crammed into his store, he replied, “Not enough.” He then perches himself on his door frame to start reading—only stopping to eat, pray, smoke, and help customers. On average, Aziz makes one or two sales a day. In the 55 years Aziz has been performing this daily ritual, Morocco’s illiteracy rate has decreased from 87% in 1960 to 32% in 2014, according to the High Commission for Planning (HCP), the country’s state-run statistics agency. But all that means to the frustrated bookseller is that roughly three in 10 Moroccans still cannot enjoy his books. The one he wants to share the most is his red Qur’an, which he studies before each call to prayer. Reading the holy words off his Qur’an’s yellowing pages has strengthened Aziz’s faith. By keeping his shop open and giving the public a chance to read, Aziz hopes to strengthen their faith as well—if not in God than in themselves. “I’ll be here till everyone can read,” Aziz said. “I’ve read more than 4,000 books, so I’ve lived more than 4,000 lives. Everyone should have that chance.” But he knows not everyone does. Only two things infuriate the devout 71-year-old—books with missing pages and children working instead of studying. Five times a day Aziz closes his red Qur’an to walk to a nearby mosque and pray. Each day, he passes boys working in shops or playing in alleyways instead of attending school—and each day, that is the first thing he prays about. “Reading is a gift from God and a command,” Aziz said, directly referring to the Qur’anic passage, 96:1 to 96:5, which states, “Read in the name of your Lord who created you. He created man from a clot. Read, and your Lord is the Most Honorable who taught with the pen, taught man what he did not know.” Aziz attributes the country’s continued low literacy rate to the percentage of students, that, like him, do not finish school. According to USAID, only 53% of students enrolled in middle school continue to high school. “This problem isn’t new,” Aziz said. “It happened to me 50 years ago, and it’s happening now.” At the end of each school year, students off to summer send a cascade of used textbooks to Aziz’s shop—forcing the creation of new science, math, religion, and language stacks. Not needing a reminder of how expensive textbooks can be, Aziz marks prices down for future students, in the hope that expensive books are no longer the reason why students cannot attend school. Not being in class however did not stop Aziz from learning. Tiled with the colorful spines of books, Aziz’s shop became a melting pot for people from all over Morocco and the world. Many of them, like those summer-bound students, left their used books at the shop. By engaging with the donors in long conversations and by later reading their donations, Aziz self-taught himself standard Arabic, French, and Spanish. His shop reflects his love for languages, with books and magazines in more than half a dozen languages. Aziz has read them all, or has tried, admitting sheepishly that he is still a novice at German and Italian. Having grown up speaking Darija, the unwritten local Arabic dialect in Morocco, the two languages Aziz worked hardest to learn were standard Arabic and French, the country’s two main languages. To become fluent, he filled his shelves with books in these languages, which to this day make up the majority of his library. Aziz became fluent in French and Arabic without ever having finished school, but he found a new challenge in 2011. In the wake of the Arab Spring, the government established a new Constitution, and Article 5 officially recognized the Amazigh language (Berber) as a national language. In eight years, Aziz has only been able to add one Amazigh book to his collection, a faded 700-word dictionary he does not remember buying, and he uses it as the foundation of a stack of travel guides. “I hope somebody donated this to me,” Aziz said. “It would have been a waste to buy it because no one reads or writes in Amazigh.” According to the sixth General Census of Population and Housing data report conducted in 2014 by the HCP, 26.7% of Morocco’s population speaks Amazigh, compared to the 89.8% that speak Darija and the 66% that speak French. A local Maghreb cigarette dances between his lips as Aziz thumbs through the hard-bound dictionary and sounds out familiar words. He blows embers off a page as he stumbles over a new term. Bringing the book closer, he mouths over the term “lqamar listina’i” — “satellite” in English. Closing the book, Aziz stabilized his travel section by returning the dictionary to its former spot—he admitted to giving up on learning Amazigh because of the language’s lack of literature. The written form of Amazigh has only been in use for the last 16 years, following its creation in 2003 by the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture (IRCAM). Providing books in all of Morocco’s languages is a dream Aziz hopes to one day fulfill as long as he gets a few hours with the books first. “My life revolves around reading,” Aziz said. “In life, I care most about my ability to read and that I can read until the end of it.”

Rabat – Moroccan authorities clamped down on shisha cafes on Friday, on order from Yassine Jarin, the governor of the prefecture of Martil, a city on Morocco’s Mediterranean coast northeast of Tetouan.  The governor ordered authorities to shut down the cafes because they failed to comply with the necessary legal specifications.  Police confiscated a number of shisha pots, also known as hookahs and ordered the shutting down of two cafes, “Bada Club” and “Lily Beach.” Social media users had described the two cafes as “a space for prostitution.” Residents and civil society in Martil expressed pleasure at the news. Some civil society associations have been calling on authorities to withdraw licenses granted to the cafes to end their “nuisance.”  The authorities ordered the closing of the cafes for 30 days before they will take their licenses if they fail to abide by the law. Authorities are pending orders from the governor to take legal proceedings against other hookah cafes suspected of breaching the law.

Rabat – The final competitive leg of the 34th Marathon des Sables (MDS) was the fifth stage of the race nicknamed “the marathon stage,” which took place on Friday. The stage’s 42.5-kilometer course was all that stood in the way of the remaining 756 runners. The world’s longest desert race, hosted in the deserts of southern Morocco, came to an end when the last runners conquered the marathon stage and crossed the finish line. For the seventh time, Moroccan runner Rachid El Morabity took home the men’s first place spot. First time MDS competitor and Dutch runner Ragna Debats kept a double-Moroccan victory out of reach by taking the women’s first place spot. El Morabity, Debats, and hundreds of other competitors ran nearly double the stage five distance the day before—during the fourth stage of the MDS. On average, runners had been covering 33.9 kilometers a day until they took on the 76.3 kilometers of “the long stage.” While the shorter distance was a relief to many, race organizers made sure the terrain of the final stage was equally as challenging as the previous stages. The most brutal parts of the stage were the run through Jebel El Otfal and the climb of a 250-meter-high sand dune with an average slope of 25%. “I loved the ascent,” French runner Vincent Pilet said. “I’m a mountain fan and here, I got my money’s worth.” Runners left the start in two sections, with the bulk of the pack leaving at 7 a.m. and the top 150 runners departing three hours later at 10 a.m. Past the finish line was the MDS’ most scenic bivouac, bordered by the Zireg mountains and surrounded by sandy plains with grass gardens, runners were left sweaty and speechless. “I’ve participated in many events, I’m a jaded guy and I didn’t think I would be so emotional,” French runner Vincent Gaudin said. “But when I crossed the finish line, emotions overwhelmed me … The MDS is a legend.” Also at the finish line was an MDS legend in the flesh, founder and race director Patrick Bauer, who waited for every single competitor to give them their finisher medal. Moroccan runner Rachid El Morabity finished first in the fifth stage and won the men’s competition for the seventh time, inching closer to his goal of equalling Lahcen Ahansal’s record of 10 victories at the MDS. “I’m very happy to win,” Rachid El Morabity said. “The Marathon des Sables remains [a] great adventure I love.” In keeping with the last four stages, Rachid’s younger brother Mohamed El Morabity finished second in the stage and second overall. The two brothers, along with their teammate Abdelkader El Mouaziz, led the Maroc TGCC team to be the overall winning team. “For me, it was important to finish, and that Rachid won, and the TGCC team too,” Mohamed El Morabity said. “We achieved this result thanks to our hard work.” 34th Marathon des Sables: First Five Men After a week of dominating the competition, Dutch runner Ragna Debats came in first for the fifth stage and officially won the women’s competition.  The 40-year-old 2018 Trail World Champion powered through her severe back chafing and took home another prestigious first place victory. Not far behind her was Moroccan runner Aziza Raji, who has finished second to Debats during four of the MDS’ five stages. Raji dreams of one day taking after Touda Didi, the only Moroccan woman to have won the ultra-marathon. 34th Marathon des Sables: First Five Women The final stage of the MDS is known as “the charity stage” or “the solidarity stage,” and its six kilometer distance is what matters the least. The stage allows first and last place runners to celebrate the end of the MDS together, while supporting the Marathon des Sables Solidarity Center.  The stage began in the morning of Saturday, April 13. Morocco World News will continue to provide updates on the marathon throughout this last stage.

 Rabat – Moroccan authorities stopped Nawal Benissa, an activist in the 2016-2017 Hirak mass protests of Al Hoceima, at the airport, preventing her from boarding her flight. Spanish news agency Lavanguardia reported on Friday, April 12, that the was banned from leaving the country. Along with her child, Benissa was headed for Amsterdam to attend a conference on social justice hosted by the Netherlands’ Socialist Party (SP). Benissa told the Spanish news agency EFE that when she arrived at passport control in the Nador airport, northern Morocco, they told her that the Ministry of the Interior had invalidated her and her child’s passports and that they can not travel. She said their passports only expire in 2023. Contrary to EFE’s article, Moroccan news outlets reported that police did not ban the activist from leaving the country but stopped her because her child’s passport was invalid. Known as a successor to the prominent Hirak leader Nasser Zefzafi, Benissa was among the Hirak activists arrested in 2017.  She was arrested four times the same year before a Casablanca court sentenced her to a 10-month suspended prison term for comments on Facebook.  She was charged with protesting in an unauthorized demonstration, insulting law enforcement officers, and incitement to commit criminal offences.  Amnesty International denounced the charges brought against Benissa, demanding that her case be overturned. The organization also reported that authorities harassed and intimidated Benissa into silence after police asked her to stay silent and remove her Facebook account. Last December, Benissa traveled to France and Italy. Fifty-four activists involved in the mass protests in the northern Rif region of Morocco, received sentences ranging from one to 20 years in prison, which were upheld by the Casablanca Court of Appeals on April 5. On Thursday, April 11, the General Delegation of Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR) decided to transfer the activists from a Casablanca prison closer to their families in northern Morocco.

Rabat – A judge in a French court has ruled that rape was not “absolutely characterized” in the case of Laura Prioul, the first French woman who filed a rape complaint against Moroccan pop star Saad Lamjarred. According to French news outlet Le Parisien, the judge redefined the charges against Lamjarred. The singer will face sexual assault charges instead. Prioul has appealed the judge’s verdict, Le Parisien added. The judge made her judgement after DNA test revealed the absence of material evidence to prove Lamjarred guilty. Prioul accused Lamjarred of rape and sexual assault in October 2018. The French woman said that the singer “ruined” her life, claiming that Lamjarred raped and beat her after she “refused him.” Police arrested Lamjarred, who then spent six months at the Marriott Champs Elysees in Paris before he was released in April 2017 on bail under electronic surveillance. Police arrested the singer once again in August 2018 in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France, after a new rape complaint was filed against him by a young French woman. Following the Saint-Tropez incident, Lamjarred paid €150,000 bail and was let out on probation. On September 18, the singer went back to jail after a prosecutor appealed the release and the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeals’ ruled he should return to jail. The court then released Lamjarred in December. The singer had faced rape accusations previously. The first accusation dates back to 2010 in New York. US prosecutors later dropped the case when the plaintiff withdrew. Lamjarred is one of the most popular artists in Morocco and the Arab world.

Rabat – Spanish police have arrested a 38-year-old Moroccan in Tarifa, southern Spain, who was the subject of a European warrant. French authorities, according to Europa Press, issued a European arrest warrant for the Moroccan who is suspected of committing “crimes of drug trafficking and participation in a criminal network.” The network, according to Spanish media, is suspected of trafficking cannabis between Morocco and European countries, such as France, Spain, and Belgium, by bus. La Vanguardia reported that the suspect was stopped by the police when he was planning to leave Spain for Morocco. The port of Tarifa operates daily ferries to Morocco. The police said in a statement that the suspect could receive a sentence of 10 years in prison if convicted, for crimes of trafficking drugs and for a connection with a criminal network. Morocco and Spain share strong cooperation in countering terrorism and fighting transnational criminal networks. In March, Moroccan police arrested a Spanish national in Tetouan, northern Morocco, who was the subject of an international arrest warrant from the Spanish judicial police and an Interpol red notice. After King Felipe VI of Spain’s visit to Morocco in February, Spain and Morocco signed an agreement to combat terrorism; track down terrorist financing; and fight drug trafficking, human trafficking, arbitrary arrest and detention, property crimes, money laundering, illicit trade of firearms, explosives, and nuclear materials.

Rabat – A Belgian member of the European Parliament, Kathleen Van Brempt, has proposed the prominent leader of the Hirak Rif protests, Nasser Zefzafi, as a candidate for the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize. On her Facebook page, Van Brempt said she had been honored to meet the parents of Zefzafi. “Last year I had the honor and pleasure of welcoming the parents of Nasser Zafzafi to the European Parliament.” She added, “We dedicate Nasser Zafzafi for the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize.” Van Brempt also condemned the ruling of the Casablanca Court of Appeals that upheld the sentences of 54 Hirak activists on April 5. The sentences range between 1 and 20 years. Zefzafi was one of four Hirak activists to receive a 20-year prison sentence in June 2018 for participating in unauthorized protests in the Al Hoceima province. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) awards the prize annually in partnership with the Vaclav Havel Library and the Charter 77 Foundation to “reward exceptional actions of society in the defense of human rights in Europe and outside the continent,” according to PACE. The prize, which is €60,000 and a diploma, is dedicated every year to commemorate Vaclav Havel, a playwright and former president of Czechoslovakia. Zefzafi was also a finalist for the Sakharov “Freedom of Thought Prize” in 2018. Members of the European Parliament in the foreign affairs and development committees voted to choose the three finalists of the Sakharov Prize. Nasser Zefzafi, along with Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian filmmaker, and NGOs working to save migrants in the Mediterranean sea, were the three finalists. Sentsov won the prize.

Taourirt – The other night I was watching a television series in Spanish with English subtitles. I did not enjoy the series as much as I could have, though, because I had to follow the subtitles and move my eyes up and down like a robot. I was trying to understand every single word of the dialogue. Though my English is good, I was not really enjoying the series. Needing to work to catch the dialogue without having to look at the subtitles was an incentive for me to pick up Spanish.  I was irritated that I could not understand words in the original language. More importantly, I was deprived of cherishing the beauty of that language. Probably most of us experience some similar frustration, whether it is watching television or something else, before taking up a language. This may sound ridiculous to some, but it really is not. It always starts like this! You only start learning something when you really need it. Everybody has their own motives for learning a language, but the most important is securing a job or maximizing chances of getting promoted in a current job. One of the languages in most high demand in today’s world is English. Getting a job requires that you have a good command of English; otherwise, you will not be selected by the largest employers around the globe. This may seem less important in countries where industrialization does not exist or is still in its infancy. However, this language is in high demand in industrialized and technologically advanced states because it meets the demands of the job market. Almost all companies prefer employees who can speak more than one language, especially those dealing with clients from non-English-speaking countries. Seemingly, you cannot build cross-cultural friendships and explore other cultures without being able to express yourself in the target language. People who can effectively express themselves in more than one language have a wonderful insight into the myriad of cultures that constitute the world and get the best of both worlds. Think of how many friendships you lose out on every minute you spend on social networking platforms caging yourself into the one language you know, especially if it is not spoken outside your country. By adding one more language to your repertoire, you can establish more relationships, have more friends in your life, and most importantly enjoy the diversity and the beauty of world cultures. What is it like to have an outside perspective about your own culture? People who can speak more than one language know how interesting it is. If you step outside your own circle, you will be amazed at how much you are missing about your own culture. The things you were once familiar with will seem different to you when you read about them from another perspective. The point of reading is not getting more knowledge but asking more questions about the beliefs and the “truths” you have always taken for granted. Getting the outsider’s perspective not only opens your eyes to new things, but it also helps you change your perspective on issues around you. Why watch videos on YouTube about becoming a better learner when the answer is as clear as day? Learning one more language helps you spot your weaknesses and turn them into strengths. There is no better way to know the things that work best for you than picking up a language. You will figure out more efficient methods to make your learning more interesting and less stressful. For example, simply devoting some time every day to learning will make you a more disciplined learner, and you will be able to make the best of your time along with doing something that will be of great use to you in the years to come. Once you have learned one language, you know the “formula,” and it gets easier with the next language. In addition to all of the above benefits, translations of creative art often fail to convey the real meaning of the original. Reading in the original language makes you more appreciative of the authentic products and able to understand them better. Let’s take for example great literary works such as Daniel Defoe’s “Robinson Crusoe,” Charles Dickens’s “Oliver Twist,” and George Orwell’s “Animal Farm,” which were all written in English and have since been translated into many languages. People who can read the original versions will better appreciate their charm. If you are still deciding whether you should pick up a new language or not, you are wasting your time.  Get ready for a journey that will boost your morale and change the way you see the world.  It is not something you have to pay for or something that will take too much of your time—one hour a day or less can do wonders. What are you waiting for? It is time to get started! The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Morocco World News’ editorial views. © Morocco World News.

Rabat – A judicial source quoted by state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) has confirmed the conviction and sentencing of a Swiss suspect, the second Morocco arrested in connection to the Imlil murders. The source confirmed that the criminal chamber affiliated to the Sale appeal court sentenced a Swiss national on Thursday. The judicial source said that the “computer advertising technician” received 10 years in prison. Swiss outlets identified the suspect as Nicolas P. The court convicted the suspect of “the setting up of a gang to prepare and commit terrorist acts aimed at seriously undermining public order, and defending, organizing and failing to report terrorist crimes and acts.” The public prosecutor at the Rabat appeal court said that police arrested 22 other suspects, including another Swiss national, presumably referring to Kevin Zoller Guervos, arrested on December 28.  Moroccan prosecutors tried Nicolas’s case separate from the other 22. According to Swiss Info, Nicolas did not know the four primary suspects, but the court based his conviction on his relationship with Genevans who went to Syria to fight with ISIS. The other Swiss national was “prosecuted in the same case for ‘setting up a gang to prepare and commit terrorist acts as part of a collective project aimed at seriously undermining public order and promoting terrorist acts and organizations, as well as the failure to report terrorist crimes.’” Swiss news outlet 24 Heures said that the suspect was living in Rabat for some years with his wife and children. Another Swiss news outlet said that both Swiss suspects knew each other. The bodiers of  Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland were found on December 17, 2018, near Mount Toubkal, causing national and international shock. The Moroccan police confirmed that the victims were beheaded.  Following the incident, Moroccans expressed their solidarity with the families of the victims with several gestures. While some rallied in the streets to condemn the murders, others used emotional words to express their support for the victims’ relatives on social media.

Rabat – Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) has shared new statistics revealing Moroccan households’ concerns about their standard of living. The index of household confidence (ICM), dropped to “79.1 points” in the first quarter of 2019 from “79.7 points” in the previous quarter, and “87.3 points” a year earlier. Meanwhile, 43% of households say that their standard of living deteriorated last year. Only 28.2% said that their standard of living had improved, while the other 28.6% believe that their standard of living remained stable. HCP noted that the balance of the index “stood at a negative level of -15 points, recording a deterioration either in comparison with the previous quarter or with the same period last year, when it recorded -13.3 points and -6.2 points, respectively.” The report added that 26.5% Moroccan households expect a deterioration in their standard of living in the next year, while 39% of them predict stability. The other 36.5% of the households expect improvement. “The balance of this index reached 10 points, compared with 9 points recorded in the previous quarter and 16.6 points during the same period last year,” said HCP. Lower expectations on employment The survey also reveals that 82.5% of households surveyed in the first quarter of 2019 expected a rise in unemployment in the upcoming 12 months. “The balance of this index stood at a negative level of -75.6 points, marking a decline either in comparison with the previous quarter or the same period last year.” In recent years, the Moroccan government has been facing pressure to increase youth employment. A recent survey conducted by Afrobarometer said that 87% of Moroccans believe that the government is not doing enough for employment. The report added that more than 66% of Moroccans rated unemployment as the most serious issue facing the country. Negative index throughout HCP’s recent report HCP’s report said that 63.6% of the households believe that their incomes are sufficient to cover their expenses, while 32.6% of them said they are spending their savings or borrowing to cover their expenses. HCP said that the balance of the households’ view on their financial position “remained at a negative level of -28.9 points compared to -28.4 pints during the previous quarter and -25.2 points during the same period last year.” According to the report, 32.8% of the households said that their financial position improved in the past 12 months, while 11.6% said that their financial situation deteriorated. “The level remained negative, reaching -21.2 points compared to -20.7 points recorded during the previous quarter and -18.1 points recorded during the same period of 2018,” according to HCP. The survey of HCP indicated that 30% of households expect improvement compared with 12.4% who expect further deterioration.

Rabat – Morocco’s head of government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, is facing aggressive intra-party scrutiny as a number of influential members of Morocco’s ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) increasingly view some of his policy preferences as a “fatal blow” to the party’s Islamist and nationalist reputation. As PJD’s party solidarity fades, sources in the inner circles of the party’s highest places have been quoted in numerous Moroccan media outlets as indicating that the majority of the party leadership wants El Othmani out. Those calling for El Othmani to be ousted are mostly former PJD ministers who still exert a considerable clout in the party’s executive board, according to reports. Too conciliatory Citing the party’s identity, which they say is anchored in securing national pride, party hardliners are calling for a much stronger figure “capable of managing the party when faced with controversial issues.” The suggestion is that El Othmani has agreed to policy recommendations that do not reflect the PJD’s nationalist platform. El Othmani is seen as too conciliatory and impressionable. Reporting on the issue in its April 12 edition, Moroccan Arabic newspaper Assabah cited Habib Choubani, who between January 2012 and Mai 2015 served in the Benkirane-led government as minister of relations with Parliament and civil society, as being a prominent figure of the anti-El Othmani faction. According to Assabah, Choubani has requested an extraordinary party congress as soon as possible. PJD’s charter indicates that extraordinary meetings are normally held when preparing for election or when discussing government formation. In his letter requesting the party congress, however, Choubani said that he wanted the party to discuss “three issues of utmost importance.”  The internal disagreement about draft Law 51.17, an education bill which has been dividing the party, is among Choubani’s questions.  Another important name reprimanding El Othmani is Abdelilah Benkirane.  Said to be planning a return to politics, the former head of government has been harshly critical of El Othmani in recent days. On the parliamentarian project to replace Arabic with French as Moroccan schools’ language of instruction for scientific subjects, which El Othmani has approved, Benkirane has said that sidelining Arabic for a foreign language is a “crime” against PJD’s founding philosophy.  While collecting supportive voices to sink El Othmani, Benkirane is reportedly poised to emerge as a strong and nationalist leader for PJD.

Rabat – Based on data from the Sleep Cycle app, Morocco gets the longest night-time sleeping hours among the five MENA region countries included and another 28 countries, including China, Poland, Russia, and Italy. The data shows that Moroccan users of the app get an average of seven hours and 15 minutes of shut-eye per night.  In the MENA region, Morocco is followed by the apps users in the United Arab Emirates with approximately seven hours, Israel with approximately six hours and 50 minutes, Egypt with about six hours and 40 minutes, and Saudi Arabia with just under six hours and 30 minutes. According to the World Economic Forum, sleep-deprivation damages the economy. New Zealand topped the list of 55 countries with Sleep Cycle users there clocking in more than 7.5 hours, along with Finland, the Netherlands and Australia. Users of the app in Japan are the most sleep-deprived of the 55 countries, with only a little above six hours and 15 minutes.  Sleep deprivation in Japan has led to the phenomenon of karoshi—death from sleeplessness—impelling Japan to take measure to address it, like installing napping rooms at offices. The average sleeping hours the American National Sleep Foundation recommends is seven to nine hours per night. According to the Rand Corporation, the US loses approximately 1.2 million working days each year due to sleep deprivation, amounting to a loss of $411 billion a year, or 2.28% of its GDP. Japan loses approximately 600,000 working days per year, with an overall loss of $138 billion.

Rabat – Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz has said that closed-door negotiations on the Western Sahara dossier are more in favor of Morocco than the settlement brokers would like to admit. The statement is a challenge to the ongoing UN-led process, which the UN has placed under its traditional banner of neutrality and mutually agreed upon terms. In an interview with Palestinian journalist Abdel Bari Atwan, Aziz suggested that the most crucial deal brokers for Western Sahara would not like to see a Polisario-governed state in Western Sahara. Mauritania has recognized the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic.. “The West, Europe and the US, do not want another state geographically separating Morocco and Mauritania,” President Aziz said. “Everything you hear outside of this frame is not correct.” The Mauritanian leader’s statement comes as Mauritania takes part in the UN-led political process.  Under the auspices of Host Kohler, the personal envoy of the UN Secretary-General for the region, Mauritania joined Morocco, Algeria, and the Polisario Front in discussing terms of a gradual trust building.  There have so far been two roundtables in Geneva, with Kohler saying after both events that there is increased hope that the parties will incrementally make comprises for a lasting political solution. President Aziz’s “surprising” statements, Atwan suggested, are a veiled challenge to the UN process. By saying that powerful countries completely oppose a new state, the Mauritanian president is clearly hinting at perceived Morocco-friendly lobbying in the ongoing settlement debates. But President Aziz is hardly the first in recent weeks to suggest that Morocco’s recent diplomatic gains will result in a settlement more in tune with its position. Polisario demands ‘unrealistic’ Citing a “diplomatic source” briefed on the UN process, Middle East Eye (MEE) reported on April 5 that the ongoing talks are “in danger of becoming a show” because the US, Kohler, and a number of European countries with a substantive say in the conflict’s prospects—an allusion to France—are pushing a pro-Morocco agenda. MEE’s source claimed that all the major sources of influence in the Sahara dispute are working against Polisario’s aspirations for a self-determined and independent Western Sahara.  “A behind-the-scene intervention from the Americans” is threatening to “put an end to hopes of Sahrawi independence,” MEE claimed , based on its source. When Kohler met with the Polisario delegation in Berlin after the first Geneva meeting in preparation for the second roundtable, he allegedly told them that independence was unrealistic and “off the table.”  “Take this plan and sell it to your people,” the source quoted Kohler as saying, an indirect reference to Morocco’s autonomy plan. Morocco calls for a negotiated settlement rather than self-determination through referendum. The statements may have been motivated by Kohler’s calls in recent weeks that settlement would only be possible if all parties show “a strong and genuine political will” to negotiate a “a feasible, realistic,” and compromise-based solution.  As conflicting parties engage in diplomatic efforts to garner support for their Western Sahara claims, a more outcome-defining development has been the revelation from a US government document, written by a former Moroccan ambassador, claiming that Washington was the inspiration for and strongest supporter of Morocco’s 2007 Autonomy Plan.  According to the document, Washington, which considered that a referendum was a “dead end,” called for a “political solution” based on a “negotiated, political solution to the problem” which would subsequently see “continued Moroccan sovereignty in the Sahara, but with the granting of a broad and substantial (by international standards) autonomy for the territory.” While the revelation is far from a vindication of the claims that Washington is set on skewing the Kohler-moderated process to Rabat’s liking, the language of the document is set to please Moroccan circles. In the meantime, Morocco, which sees in the UN’s settlement guidelines aspects of its own call for pragmatism, has been quick to argue that settlement will only be possible when all parties show genuine commitment to a politically-negotiated solution.

Rabat – Today, Morocco offers a model for the alliance of civilizations, the UN high-representative for the Alliance of Civilizations, Miguel Angel Moratinos, said on Thursday in Rabat. During talks with the speaker of the House of Representatives, Habib El Malki, Moratinos praised the insightful vision of King Mohammed VI as well as the recent official visit of Pope Francis to Morocco. Moratinos noted that Morocco has distinguished itself over the centuries through its tradition of religious tolerance and multiculturalism. According to a statement by the House of Representatives, the former Spanish foreign minister said that his visit to the lower house testifies to the important role of parliaments in upholding the values of the UN Alliance of Civilizations, which are reflected in the promotion of tolerance, openness, and respect for others. Moratinos said that an international parliamentary forum will be held to raise awareness among international representatives of the importance of the alliance’s principles, the fight against hate speech and intolerance, while highlighting the main aspects of the alliance’s action program for the upcoming period. For his part, El Malki lauded the commitment of parliaments to the United Nations’ efforts to consolidate the Alliance of Civilizations, stressing that the House of Representatives is ready to promote peace and understanding among peoples. “The Kingdom, under the leadership of HM the King, is distinguished by cultural diversity and respect for all religions and Morocco is committed to the principles of peace, stability and dialogue on which the UN system is based,” he underlined. During the meeting, the two officials exchanged views on a number of issues and discussed the role of dialogue in preventing wars and spreading a culture of peace and stability in the world.

Rabat’s Mawazine Festival has announced that “the best of the African scene will be once again on the mythical Bouregreg stage.”  Opening the festival on Friday, June 19, is South African band Bantu Continua Uhuru Consciousness (BCUC). The seven-person group mixes the indigenous sounds of their country with funk, hip hop, and rock influences for an eclectic and experimental style, which they describe as “afropsychedelic.” BCUC are known for their dramatic performances, which move the audience “both physically and emotionally.” Saturday, June 22, promises another high-energy performance, with the Kokoko collective taking the stage. The group brings together artists from Kinshasa, Congo, who are known for turning unlikely objects into instruments to create their electronic sound: One string guitars, typewriters, and water bottles, just to name a few.  Next up is South African rapper Sho Madjozi, who has taken her Xitsonga and Swahili music global in an unprecedented way. All her tracks are upbeat, simple, and danceable, and Sho Madjozi is all about staying true to her roots and is committed to neo-pan-Africanism. Sunday, June 23, will see Kery James take the stage, a French rapper born in Guadeloupe to Haitian parents. James, who has been dominating the French rap scene since his first release in 1992 at just 15, will perform his latest album “J’rap Encore,” released last year. On Monday, June 24, African Amazons will perform. The all-female group gathers 12 West African musicians using their star power to campaign for women’s rights. They deliver their message in French, English, and Mandinka using traditional African styles mixed with funk and jazz. The group includes Grammy-winning Angelique Kidjo, Mariam Doumbia of the legendary duo Amadou and Mariam, and international pop star Nneka. The following night, French blues trio Delgres will rock the Bouregreg stage. Although influenced by Mississippi Delta blues, Delgres holds their Guadeloupean roots at the heart of their music, with the vocals all sung in Creole. Their songs explore cultural and political history in the Caribbean, with frequent tributes to freedom fighters. On Wednesday, June 26, Congolese rapper Youssoupha will take the stage. The Francophone artist is known for his conscious style of rap, often focusing on his youth and life in the suburbs of Paris. On Thursday, June 27, renowned American saxophonist Kamasia Washington is up. Washington’s progressive music aims to bring jazz to young audiences by mixing in elements of hip hop and R&amp;B. Although only having released his first LP in 2015, Washington has already received wide acclaim and collaborated with artists such as Kendrick Lamar and John Legend. Friday, June 28, will see the Togolese singer Peter Solo and his group Vaudou Game take the stage. The group combines voodoo rhythms, raw afro-funk, and soul, with a heavy influence from the musicians of these genres who marked African music in the 1970s. Peter Solo’s voodoo upbringing in Togo and his ancestry is central to the group’s music.  On Mawazine’s final night, Saturday, June 29, French rapper of Congolese origin Koba LaD will perform. At just 19, Koba LaD’s achievements are remarkable. His latest album, VII, released in late 2018, has already been certified gold and his music videos have amassed millions of hits on YouTube. Koba LaD is already a force to be reckoned with in the French rap game. Mawazine, a festival in Rabat with six venues, will take place from June 21 to June 29 and is organized by Maroc Cultures under the patronage of King Mohammed VI. Having drawn over 2.5 million attendees in recent years, Mawazine is the second largest music festival in the world, after Donauinselfest in Vienna, and the largest festival in Africa. The festival brings in artists from countries all over the world as well as highlighting local Moroccan musicians. Last year, the festival saw major international acts perform such as Martin Garrix, Bruno Mars, Luis Fonsi, and The Weeknd. The festival lists the democratization of culture in Morocco as one of its initiatives and provides free access to 90% of its shows each year.

Rabat – After months of protests, state television and radio all over Sudan interrupted regular programming on Thursday to allow the military to make a statement. Defense Minister Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf announced that President Omar al-Bashir had been taken to a “safe place” after the “toppling of the regime.” After 30 years of authoritarian rule, Bashir is out.   Tens of thousands poured into the streets of Khartoum, many chanting, “It has fallen, we won.” In his broadcast, Ibn Auf announced the formation of a military-led transitional government set to rule for two years. In the short term, the military has also instated a three-month national state of emergency, a ceasefire, the closure of Sudanese airspace for 24 hours, and closure of the borders until further notice. According to AP, eyewitnesses said the military has deployed units at key sites around Khartoum with armored tanks and vehicles early Thursday morning. The military has also imposed a nationwide curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. which defiant protestors have largely ignored. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), speaking for thousands of protestors, have rejected Ibn Auf’s move as a “military coup” and vowed to continue their demonstrations until a civilian transitional government is established and given power. The chants on the streets have quickly turned to include, “Fall, again,” an indictment of the new military leadership as no different from al-Bashir’s regime. Culmination of months of protests The protests in Sudan began on December 19 in the northern town of Atbara and rapidly spread throughout the country. Initially sparked by economic issues, including increases in food and fuel prices and cash shortages, the protests quickly began calling for al-Bashir to step down. The SPA has led the protests in association with a number of smaller groups and has managed to keep them highly organized. Women, in particular, have been at the forefront of the protests. An image of a woman in Khartoum leading a crowd of protestors in a chant of “Revolution” has become the identifying image of the movement after going viral on Twitter. In February, al-Bashir declared a year-long state of emergency and replaced all state governors with members of the army and security forces. The demonstrations reached their climax on April 6, the 34th anniversary of the nonviolent Sudanese uprising against dictator Gaafar Nimeiri. In the four months of protests, government forces have killed between 45 and 60 people by firing on protestors and has arrested hundreds more. Last week, protesters in Khartoum converged on the compound housing the Ministry of Defense, army headquarters, and al-Bashir’s personal residence. With their numbers growing daily, they kept a 24-hour presence at all three locations, alternating shifts when necessary. Al-Bashir ordered his forces to disperse the demonstrators, but, according to the leak-prone security elite, there were internal divisions about how to do so. Security and paramilitary forces fired into the crowd while some army units rallied to defend the protestors. Since Saturday, security forces have killed 22, including 5 soldiers who were defending the protestors. At least one officer defected to join the protestors—an early sign that the army would turn against al-Bashir. Fears of civil war Sudan has two precedents of peaceful popular uprisings which removed military rulers: The removal of Ibrahim Abboud in 1964 and that of Gaafar Nimeiri in 1985. Both managed to stay peaceful in large part because of swift and decisive action taken by the army which chose to side with the people. But, the situation has the potential to go differently today. The divisions within military forces could make the coming weeks messy. There are numerous groups in addition to the army operating within Khartoum alone, each with separate commands and many with ties to foreign countries. These groups include the National Intelligence and Security Service led by “ruthless spy chief” Salah Gosh with ties to the UAE, an Islamist militia with ties to Qatar, and at least two separate paramilitary groups. There is real danger of opposing forces in security and militia turning their weapons on each other, said BBC World Service Africa editor Will Ross. Amidst uncertainty, the international response has primarily encouraged calm. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for “utmost restraint by all” and expressed hope that the transition moving forward would meet the democratic aspirations of the Sudanese people. Both the African Union and UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt condemned the military takeover while Amnesty International Secretary General Kumi Naidoo said he is “alarmed by the raft of emergency measures” the military instituted.  But there are some who worry that the international community will fail to intervene to the extent which is necessary. The executive director of Tufts University’s World Peace Foundation, Alex de Waal, expressed fears that the caution shown by Western powers in the wake of conflicts in Libya, Syria, and Yemen “risks missing the slender opportunity for snatching solution from the teeth of potential calamity.” Fears are especially high because Sudan already has roughly five ongoing civil conflicts and was only held together by tightly controlled power in the hands of an authoritarian leader. Who is al-Bashir? The 75-year-old al-Bashir ruled for 30 years, ever since he seized power in 1989 in an Islamist-backed coup. A former military leader who came to power in the midst of Sudan’s 21-year civil war between the North and South, al-Bashir always focused his public image around his military power. He often dressed in military uniform when appearing in public. The large part of his power base lies with the armed forces—so it makes sense that he was forced to step down as soon as he lost the military’s loyalty. The International Criminal Court indicted al-Bashir in 2009 for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. The crimes include counts of genocide, murder, extermination, forcible transfer, rape, torture, attacks on civilians, and the pillaging of towns and villages. After the ICC indicted him, it issued an international arrest warrant. Now that al-Bashir is no longer in power, there are many questions in the international community about whether he will finally have to face the ICC. Naidoo called for him to be held responsible, saying, “Al-Bashir is wanted for some of the most odious human rights violations of our generation and we need to finally see him held accountable.” The overthrow of al-Bashir marks the second time in less than a month that a North African leader has been removed from power. President Bouteflika of Algeria stepped down after two decades in power following mass protests.

Rabat – The Independence or Al Istiqlal Party (IP) , a Moroccan opposition party, held a mass event for its followers in Laayoune in southern Morocco on Tuesday. The event, which Sahrawis attended, angered the Polisario Front, whose news outlets condemned the political meeting. The secretary-general of the party, Nizar Baraka, gave a speech, emphasizing Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara and the viability of the Moroccan autonomy plan. “The meeting comes in special circumstances, considering that the issue of territorial integrity is discussed today in the United Nations Security Council.” The Security Council met to consult on the Western Sahara conflict and the MINURSO mandate on Tuesday, April 9, and Wednesday, April 10. IP seized the opportunity to express determination to mobilize itself to defend the territorial integrity of Morocco. Baraka also commented on the importance of sustainable development to benefit Sahrawi people. “The Istiqlal party is defending the interests of the people, so that equity will be achieved in the country and the disparities will be narrowed,” added Baraka. Yenja Khettat, the president of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region, who attended the mass gathering, said that the meeting took place in conjunction with “sensitive circumstances regarding the territorial integrity.” Khettat added that the “people chose development rather than living in dreams,” referring to Polisario’s independence claims. “We want realism and concrete choices, we have always been at the forefront to defend territorial integrity, especially autonomy, which is a realistic solution that can be applied to reality,” he asserted. Following the event, pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara published a statement from the “Ministry of the Affairs of Occupied Territory,” which condemned the event. “In the framework of its attempts to perpetuate the reality of its occupation of our land, the Moroccan State is sparing no effort at all times, using the means of repression in various forms to silence the voice of the intifada [uprising],” said the self-styled ministry. While Polisario is protesting PI’s event, people in Rabouni in Algeria are protesting the front’s restrictions on free movement. On Wednesday, protesters carried separatist flags and banners reading: “Freedom of movement.” The protests put pressure on the front as some Sahrawis have left the camps in Algeria for Morocco. Recently, a member of the Polisario, named Sidahmed, deserted Polisario and presented himself to the Moroccan Royal Gendarmerie in Smara in Western Sahara. In March, 12 other soldiers also presented themselves to the Moroccan army near Mahbes, north-eastern Western Sahara.

Rabat – Swiss news outlets have reported that Morocco convicted a Swiss suspect in connection to the Imlil murders, where two Scandinavian tourists were killed in December 2018 in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains. 24 Heures, RTS Info, and Swiss Info reported that the Swiss suspect, the second Morocco arrested in connection to the Imlil murders, received a sentence of 10 years in prison. “Nicholas (sic) P., arrested last January in connection with the investigation of the murder of two Scandinavian tourists in Morocco, was found guilty on Thursday of participation in a terrorist association,” according to 24 Heures. The Swiss news outlets said that the 33-year-old lived with his wife and two children in Rabat for some years. RTS said that the suspect’s lawyer, Khalil Idrissi, confirmed his sentence. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) announced the arrest of a first Swiss suspect in the case, Kevin Zoller Guervos, on December 28. Nicolas, according to RTS, “knows the other suspect, Kevin.” Moroccan police made nearly two dozen arrests in the case, but only four were thought to be directly involved in the murder. “Nicolas says he did not know the Islamists who beheaded the two tourists,” said the news outlet. According to Swiss Info, the court convicted Nicolas based on his relationship with Genevans who went to Syria to fight with ISIS. RTS said that Nicolas’s lawyer will appeal the verdict on Friday. Idrissi told RTS, “All charges have been withheld while the only piece of the accusation is a police statement written in Arabic, which Nicolas does not speak.” In January, a source told Morocco World News that Morocco’s National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) arrested an English-Swiss suspect for alleged ties with ISIS. The source, however, did not indicate that the suspect was arrested for an alleged connection with the Imlil murders. Days after the news on the arrest of a British-Swiss national, the head of BCIJ, Abdelhak Khiame, denied the arrest of another Swiss suspect. Khiame told Moroccan television channel 2M that BCIJ did not make any arrests on January 10. Several media linked the alleged January arrest to Nicolas. The bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland were found on December 17, 2018, near Mount Toubkal. Police have arrested 23 suspects in connection with the murders. Suspects convicted of terror-related crimes typically receive 10- to 15-year prison sentences.

Rabat – Morocco is celebrating International Day of Human Space Flight, also known as Yuri’s Night, the milestone journey of a Russian astronaut, the first human who entered outer space.  The Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Services of the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region is hosting a photography exhibition to commemorate Yuri’s Night. Astronaut Yuri Gagarin, born on March 9, 1938, became the first human to journey into outer space on April 12, 1961. Gagarin died in 1968 in a tragic plane crash near Moscow in an MiG-15. The Russian ambassador to Morocco, Valerian Shuvaev, and the chamber’s treasurer, Houssain Ben Taib, co-chaired the opening of the exhibition. The exhibition displays pictures of the young Russian astronaut and Russian artisanal handicrafts.  Shuvaev said the exhibition is an occasion to highlight the Russian-Moroccan relationships that are “moving in the right direction.”  He also underlined the cultural and historical ties between Morocco and Russia, improved by visits of King Mohammed VI to Russia and President Vladimir Putin to Morocco. Ben Taib in turn said that the event comes in a “context marked by a considerable development of relations between Morocco and Russia in many areas.”  Referring to bilateral trade, Ben Taib expressed desire “to open up more to Russia, especially through boosting economic visits” between the two countries.

Rabat – A scientific experiment at a Chinese University put human genes into the brains of 11 monkeys, which showed human like brain development.  In the experiment, the Chinese scientists implanted human genes into the brains of rhesus monkey as part of a series of studies on the evolution of human intelligence. After implanting 11 monkeys with different versions of MCPH1, a gene considered key to the development of the human brain, the scientists concluded that, like humans, the brain of the tested monkeys took longer to develop and performed better in short-term memory and reaction time tests compared to wild monkeys.  The size of the monkey’s brains, however, did not grow bigger.  The authors of the study explained, “Our findings demonstrated that transgenic nonhuman primates (excluding ape species) have the potential to provide important – and potentially unique – insights into basic questions of what actually makes humans unique.” The chinese scientists, affiliated to the institute of the Kunming Institute of Zoology and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, worked in collaboration with US researchers at the University of North Carolina. . Outrage in the scientific community The study, which was published on March 27 in the beijing-based peer-reviewed journal National Science Review, has raised concerns over medical ethics. James Sikela, a geneticist and professor in the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Colorado, Denver, said that experimenting on transgenic monkeys to understand human evolution is a “classic slippery slope … and a very risky road to take.”  Only five monkeys made it to the last stages of the experiment.  Jacqueline Glover, a bioethicist at the University of Colorado, invoking the sci-fi movie “Planet of the Apes,” said humanizing animals is causing them harm and creating “a being that can not have a meaningful life in any context.” In another experiment in January, a group Chinese scientists also cloned 5 macques, monkeys that split from the evolutionary path of humans about 29 million years ago. They were replicated from one single animal, which was genetically engineered to have sleep disorders.  This experiment did not turn out well as the animals suffered mental problems including depression, anxiety, and behaviors linked to schizophrenia.

My Algeria Don’t you worry this time victory will be ours.#Algerie_manifestation pic.twitter.com/kk8LGWoCWA — braaap_stututu (@SabeurCherif) April 12, 2019  “If you think we are going to stop now, think again because we just started. My Algeria don’t you worry; this time victory will be ours,” tweeted one of the protesters.  Algeria’s Bensalah announced on Wednesday that the election, which was planned for April 18 will take place on July 4, a transition period of 84 days after Bouteflika’s resignation. After his appointment on Tuesday by the Parliament, the interim president said that the election will be free and transparent. Bensalah is said to have the support of the army, especially the Algerian senior army chief Gaid Salah, who has warned Algerians against further protests. During the protests against the appointment of Bensalah, police dispersed protesters using water cannons. Salah warned protesters over “unrealistic slogans” chanted during the protests. He also said that there are “foreign” hands that seek to incite people against the stability  and security of Algeria as it faces a post-Bouteflika crisis.

Rabat – The executive bureau of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) had named Morocco’s Mouad Hajji as CAF’s new secretary-general. The executive made the nomination on Thursday when they gathered in Cairo. Before the appointment, Hajji was CAF’s administrative general coordinator. The director of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), Fouzi Lekjaa, reacted positively. “Mouad has the abilities and energy to excellently fulfill his duty. It is an honor for Morocco and Moroccan football,” said Lekjaa to Moroccan sports channel Arryadia. #فوزي_لقجع رئيس الجامعة الملكية المغربية لكرة القدم حول تعيين المغربي #معاذ_حجي كاتبا عاما للكاف ‘لمعاذ كل الكفاءات كي ينجح في مهمته’@caf_online_AR @FRMFOFFICIEL #الإتحاد_الإفريقي_لكرة_القدم #الكاف @hajji_mouad pic.twitter.com/py5kfriOjd — Arryadia TV officiel (@arryadiatv) April 11, 2019

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has sent a message of good wishes and fraternity to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar, several Moroccan news outlets have reported. The gesture is the latest in a series of similar moves towards other MENA countries. The royal message, according to Morocco’s official outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), is consistent with the Moroccan monarch’s insistence on the need for collective action to solve the MENA region’s most urgent matters. King Mohammed VI’s “friendship and brotherly” message to the Qatari emir was carried to Doha by foreign minister Nasser Bourita, who has been on a tour in the Gulf to reiterate Rabat’s belief in regional geopolitics without internal conflicts. King Mohammed VI’s message is that the region needs concerted efforts to facilitate “collaboration on the most crucial issues of security and human and economic development,” reports have concurred. While reports have so far not indicated the content of the sealed letter to the Qatari emir, it is understood that the message contains the usual Moroccan calls for more unified MENA responses on some of the “most crucial regional issues.” On the bilateral front, King Mohammed VI expressed satisfaction at the strong ties between Rabat and Doha, promising the Qatari emir that Rabat wants to preserve the historical and cultural bonds between the two nations, MAP suggested. In response, Qatar, which has increasingly been a source of financial and moral support for a number of Moroccan interests, promised to further the positives of the Rabat-Qatar cooperation. So far, Bourita has attended audiences with the highest echelons of power in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and now Qatar. In all instances, MAP has stressed, the Moroccan minister “extended the King’s good wishes and brother greetings” to his hosts. Bourita’s meetings with many regional leaders in a brief time span fall within the frame of King Mohammed VI’s insistent calls for basing regional politics on a culture of “shared responsibilities.” Cohesion has been the distinctive mark of Morocco’s “royal diplomacy” in the past decade, and Bourita’s tour will come as no surprise to watchers of Morocco’s foreign policy. But even in the current context, the recent story of Qatar and Morocco’s shift towards each other has had features of being an outlier. Morocco’s policy of “constructive neutrality” in the latest Gulf crisis has been particularly useful in cementing the Doha-Rabat relations. Rabat, deciding to reject the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar to uphold what it called Morocco’s right to an independent foreign policy, was there for Qatar at the outset of the crisis, sending humanitarian aid to the nation. While the humanitarian support was symbolic in many regards—Qatar has considerable financial resources—the move bore fruits in cementing Doha-Rabat ties. In the process, Saudi Arabia has reportedly accused Rabat of siding with Qatar while feigning neutrality. Morocco has dismissed the claims and insisted that its “historical” ties with Saudi Arabia did not necessarily mean it had to blindly follow Saudi interests at the expense of its own regional agenda, which it said envisions building a strong, rather than a fragmented, MENA. The neutrality policy has won Morocco plaudits in Qatari media and Doha-friendly circles, leading the Gulf country to emphatically embrace Rabat. In Qatari media discourses following Morocco’s “principled” refusal to side with the blockade, King Mohammed VI was touted the “first blockade breaker.” This may have prompted the Qatari emir to be the first world leader to call King Mohammed VI after Morocco failed to win the hosting rights of the 2026 World Cup. Appearing to take upon himself the responsibility of soothing a blow after “betrayal” from a number of Arab and African countries during the FIFA voting process, Emir Al Thani promised King Mohammed VI that he would personally finance another Moroccan bid to host the World Cup. The Qatari leader said that he understood that hosting the footballing masterpiece event was a “national dream” for Moroccans and that Qatar would throw its financial might and “brotherly support” behind Morocco to help it materialize that aspiration. For all the reported Doha-Rabat bromance story, there have been suggestions that while the growing bilateral partnership is genuine, Qatar’s own ambitions to emerge from the shadows of Turkey, Iran, and the now-weakened Gulf Council crisis have shaped its heightened focus on Morocco. The idea is that while Doha is an established financial power, it can barely claim Morocco’s level of strategic importance in number of global issues, ranging from migration to security and anti-terrorism. Through a solid presence in Morocco, the argument goes, Qatar wants to gradually make for itself a place in African affairs, a field where Rabat has recently grown as a trend-setter and invaluable partner for many governments. Foreign policy often is a story of communication theatrics where events are exaggerated, understated, or altogether shunned, depending on who is telling the story. And while all the hype—positive or negative—around the Rabat-Doha romance should be taken with a grain of salt, the two countries have been adamant about their “commitment to common interests and principles.” Qatar, the speaker of the Qatari Advisory Council said in March of this year, has a “special respect” for Moroccan interests.

Rabat – The United Nations Security Council expressed hope that the parties involved in the Western Sahara conflict will remain engaged in constructively in the UN-led political process to end the conflict. The 15 members of the Security Council met in a closed meeting on Wednesday which the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, attended. During the meeting, the members of the Security Council discussed the newly released report of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on the situation in Western Sahara. AFP quoted a diplomat following the Security Council meeting, who said that the participants said that the parties “must continue the discussions in a constructive manner.” The German Mission to the UN shared a tweet on Wednesday, announcing that Kohler briefed the Security Council. “Solution to the conflict must be mutually acceptable, realistic, practical and enduring &amp; allow for self-determination by its people,” the mission added. Timely briefing by PESG Köhler on #MINURSO today. Full support of 🇺🇳#UNSC for his efforts to advance the political process in #WesternSahara Solution to the conflict must be mutually acceptable, realistic, practical and enduring &amp; allow for self-determination by its people. pic.twitter.com/hparASeyPM — German Mission to UN (@GermanyUN) April 10, 2019  The German ambassador to the UN, Christoph Heusgen, said that the Security Council meeting was “very positive.” In a statement to press, the ambassador said that both Kohler and Guterres’s special representative “gave a very realistic assessment on the situation.” In his latest report, Guterres said that both roundtable discussions held in 2018 and 2019 on the conflict were characterized by a “positive spirit and respectful and constructive atmosphere.” He also urged the parties involved in the conflict to “actively make gestures of good faith that demonstrate their willingness to make progress.” The members of the Security Council also discussed the mandate of the UN peacekeeping mission in the region, known as MINURSO. The Security Council will meet again in two weeks to decide whether to extend the MINURSO mandate beyond April 30. On October 31, the Security Council extended the MINURSO mandate for six months, half of the period requested by Guterres. The Security Council is likely to extend the mandate of MINURSO for another six months at the end of this month.

Rabat – Runners completed more than a third of the entire 34th Marathon des Sables (MDS) on Wednesday and Thursday in what is nicknamed “The Long Stage.” On average the previous three stages have been 33.9 kilometers long, but the fourth stage is more than double that with a distance of 76.3 kilometers—nearly the length of two marathons. Organizers broke up the stage into six checkpoints equipped to help both the runners needing rest and the ones that wanted to continue to race through the night to make it to the fourth bivouac. “The long stage, it scares me … It is necessary to go as gently as possible to avoid injuries and dehydration,” said French runner Laurence Braastad. “I do not want to stop for the night, but if I have to, I’ll sleep. And I must also find someone about my pace to finish [with], otherwise the last twenty kilometers is hell.” As the world’s longest desert race continues, fewer runners have been taking to the starting line. At the beginning of stage one, the MDS had 783 competitors—the fourth stage saw only 768. While its length was the stage’s main challenge, temperatures also reached up to 33.2 degrees Celsius—the hottest runners have encountered so far. With Rachid and Mohamed El Morabity taking the first and second spot for the fourth stage in a row, the two Moroccan brothers have all but cemented their overall victory in this year’s MDS. “I started slowly, then I tried to accelerate and make a difference,” Rachid El Morabity said. “Tomorrow, we have 42 kilometers left, so I will start slowly and try to follow my chasers until the end, because my lead is enough to win the race.” The time it took competitors to finish each stage is added together to create their final time and determine the ultra-marathon’s overall winners. To improve his score, French runner Merille Robert raced is way back to the top five for the first time since stage two. “I started with all the Moroccans, at their quiet pace for the first part of the stage, until K45-50. Than, they accelerated,” Robert said. “But I managed to keep my steady pace and felt good throughout the day. Training has paid off.” The Long Stage’s top five women finishers saw both new and old blood. Dutch runner Ragna Debats decisively took first place for her fourth stage in a row, finishing nearly 25 minutes ahead of Moroccan runner Aziza Raji—who finished second behind Debats during the first and third stage. With her continued dominance, Debats has all but secured her overall first place finish in the competition. But the rest of the podium still remains uncertain. Raji, along with British runners Gemma Game and Lauren Woodwiss and American runner Meghan Hicks, are all vying for the second to fourth spots. This long stage also saw Spanish runner Monica Guilera Sala finish in the top five for the first time—whether or not this will be enough to push her into the overall top five women will depend on tomorrow’s race. Other than its nickname “The Marathon Stage” and its distance of 42 kilometers, complete details about the fifth stage have not yet been released. Runners began this stage on the morning of Friday, April 12.  The 34th MDS began on Sunday, April 7. The first stage was mostly mixed terrain while desert dunes defined the second stage. The ultra-marathon’s halfway point was reached at the end of the third stage, which runners raced on Tuesday. Morocco World News will continue to provide updates on the marathon throughout the week.

Rabat – The minister of Moroccans living abroad (MREs)and migration affairs, Abdelkarim Benatiq, has stated that Morocco is a land of co-existence between the three monotheistic religions and saluted Pope Francis’s historic visit to Rabat March 30-31. Benatiq made the remarks in his speech during the opening of this year’s Spring University, under the theme: “Plural Morocco, Land of Living Together.”  The event is being held in partnership with Sultan Moulay Slimane University in Beni Mellal, central Morocco, and meeting in a small village called Foum Joumae, April 10-14. “We salute the success of this visit which was marked by the talks between the sovereign and Pope Francis,” said Benatiq. He also noted that Morocco is not only a transit country on a migratory route but also a settlement destination for migrants.  The ministry hosts the Spring University to increase ties between Moroccan youth living abroad and their motherland by introducing them to Morocco’s cultural wealth and plurality. Benatiq stressed that MREs should be involved in the development of their country. He argued that Morocco’s continuous development relies partly on them.  The participants will attend several activities, including one about religion, themed “Tolerant Islam as advocated by our religion,” led by the secretary-general of Morocco’s highest Islamic body, the Mohammedia League of Scholars, Professor Ahmed Abbadi.

Rabat – The head of Morocco’s Central Bureau for Judicial Investigations (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, has denied that Morocco repatriated eight of its nationals in coordination with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in an interview with Atlantic Radio station.  A member of the US-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, Morocco repatriated the Moroccans fighting for ISIS in collaboration with the international coalition, Khiame stressed. Mustafa Bali, the SDF spokesman, told Reuters the SDF “have handed a group of people with Moroccan nationality who were in the camps in northern Syria over to the Moroccan government.” “It is usual that Morocco works together with its allies,” Khiame stated. “But it is particularly the concern of Morocco only to repatriate its citizens and to take legal proceedings against them in accordance with the Moroccan law.” The SDF, a coalition of militia forces fighting ISIS, has reportedly been involved in trading families for money. A Moroccan human rights organization accused the SDF of taking married Moroccan women from refugee camps to ISIS-controlled areas in Eastern Syria. As part of its extensive counter-terrorism strategy, Morocco repatriated the eight Moroccans, aged between 21 and 36, who left the country to allegedly join ISIS in Syria. Morocco did not take legal proceedings against the wives and children of repatriated fighters. Khiame stated that the women did not intend to leave Morocco to join jihadi movements.They only accompanied their husbands. Abu Dhabi news agency Erem stated that Morocco’s Interior Ministry put the numbers of Moroccans who left the country to flashpoints in the Middle East at 1,666, 929 of which joined ISIS. It reported that 596 have died. The US Department of State applauded Morocco’s “commitment to countering terrorism” that should “encourage other nations.”  Khiame stated in October 2018 that since the creation of the BCIJ in 2015, Morocco had dismantled 57 terrorist cells. It arrested 3,129 people, 292 of whom had a criminal record, and foiled 361 terrorist actions. In combating terrorism, Morocco has carried out a number of deradicalization measures. One of them was the creation of the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams, Morchidines, and Morchidates in March 2015. And on July 24 of the same year, Morocco launched the Mohammed VI Foundation for African Ulema dedicated to supporting African theologians and scholars to promote religious tolerance. Morocco’s deradicalization policy has also targeted the country’s prison system. It has mobilized authorities from the Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs and members of regional and local religious councils. These officials visited approximately 5,000 incarcerated offenders in 2013 only.  Out of the 74,000 inmates in Moroccan prisons in 2013, only 600 were extremists.

Rabat – Kim Kardashian West, an American reality television star and beauty mogul, made waves by revealing she plans to add “lawyer” to her resume by 2022. Kardashian can become a lawyer despite not having a college degree as California is one of four states in the US that allows residents to take the bar exam without having graduated from college or law school. Residents can follow a method called “reading the law” instead, meaning they can do a four-year apprenticeship with a lawyer or a law firm instead of taking the traditional pathway through higher education. Kardashian revealed to Vogue that she began the four-year apprenticeship program last year and has two lawyer mentors who help her study for 18 hours a week at a law firm not far from her home. This summer, Kardashian will take what is known as the “baby bar,” an exam which will deem her eligible or not to continue the apprenticeship for the final 3 years.  The star seems to be on the right track to pass so far; telling the magazine “crim (sic) law I can do in my sleep. Took my first test, I got a 100. Super easy for me. The reading is what really gets me. It’s so time-consuming. The concepts I grasp in two seconds.” Kardashian’s decision has surprised some, as the media often paints her as simply a one-dimensional reality star. However, what spurred her to become a lawyer reveals there is more than meets the eye. In May 2018, Kardashian learned via social media of a 63-year-old grandmother, Alice Marie Johnson, who had been in prison on a nonviolent drug charge since 1996. The story deeply touched Kardashian. “Here’s a grandmother who took part in her first-time nonviolent offense and received the same sentence as Charles Manson. I just thought, This is so wrong and so bizarre, and how could that be? I sent it to my attorney and said, ‘What can we do?’” she told the magazine. Kardashian’s desire to help the woman led her to the White House. She arranged a meeting with Donald Trump to discuss prison reform, and after meeting with Kardashian, Trump commuted Johnson’s life sentence.  This ignited Kardashian’s passion for prison reform. “I just felt like I wanted to be able to fight for people who have paid their dues to society,” she told Vogue. “I just felt like the system could be so different, and I wanted to fight to fix it, and if I knew more, I could do more.”  Even Kardashian’s mother and manager, Kris Jenner, was caught by surprise by her daughter’s decision to commit to four years to becoming a lawyer. “I did not see this one coming.”  However, a passion for criminal law runs in the family. Kardashian’s father, who died in 2003 when she was 23 years old, was famously a member of football player O.J. Simpson’s defense team, while Simpson was on trial for the murder of his ex-wife, one of the most-discussed criminal cases in Hollywood history.  Kardashian explained she was always intensely curious about her father’s work, recalling in her interview: “My dad had a library, and when you pushed on this wall there was this whole hidden closet room, with all of his O.J. evidence books. On weekends I would always snoop and look through. I was really nosy about the forensics.”

Rabat – Moroccan astronomer Hicham Elaissaoui has said that Morocco will celebrate the first day of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, on May 7. The astronomer shared his Ramadan post on Facebook. In March, the Moroccan Science Initiative also shared the same expectations, emphasizing that the North African country is expected to begin celebrating the holy month of Ramadan on May 7. The initiative, quoted by ArabiaWeather said that Morocco and Saudi Arabia will begin their look out for the new moon on two different days this year. The initiative said that Saudi Arabia would begin an observation of the crescent moon on Saturday, May 4, but does not expect to see the moon until May 5. Morocco will begin its observation of the new moon a day after Saudi Arabia, if Morocco and Saudi Arabia saw the new moon for the month of Sha’ban, the eighth in the Islamic calendar, on different days. However, both Morocco and Saudi Arabia announced Sunday, April 7, as the first day of Sha’ban. Before the Moroccan Ministry of Islamic Affairs announced Sunday to be the first day of Sha’ban, Elaissaoui had predicted the same day as the first day of the eighth month.   Months in the Islamic year, which follow the lunar calendar, last for 29 or 30 days. The month only begins with the sighting of the new moon. In 2018, both Morocco and Saudi Arabia celebrated the first day of the holy month on May 17. During Ramadan, Muslims fast from all food and water between dawn and sunset. In addition to fasting, Ramadan is also an opportunity for Muslims to open their hearts and engage in spiritual reflection. After breaking the fast, men and women of all ages head to mosques across the country to perform taraweeh prayers, which are extra prayers performed by Sunni Muslims every night throughout the month of Ramadan.

Rabat – Global executions fell by 31% to the lowest figure in at least a decade, Amnesty International reports in its 2018 review of the death penalty worldwide. The review, published Tuesday, assesses all recorded executions worldwide, excluding China. Without accounting for China, the estimated number of executions in 2018 was 690. This marks a dramatic decrease from 2017 which saw 993 executions. China is the world’s top executioner with estimated execution figures in the thousands. But, as the executions in China are a state secret, the government never officially releases data.  After China, the most executions took place in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, and Iraq. With at least 253 in Iran, 149 in Saudi Arabia, at least 85 in Vietnam, and at least 52 in Iraq, the four countries claim 78% of all reported executions.   While Iran still reports the highest number of executions, the country saw a staggering 50% decrease after executing more than 500 people in 2017. Amnesty attributes the reduction to changes in the country’s anti-narcotic laws. A number of other countries known for high numbers of executions, such as Iraq, Pakistan, and Somalia, also saw their numbers decrease in 2018. In December 2018, 121 countries at the UN General Assembly voted to support a global moratorium on the death penalty. Only 35 countries voted against. Morocco was among the countries that abstained.  “The dramatic global fall in executions proves that even the most unlikely countries are starting to change their ways and realize the death penalty is not the answer,” said Amnesty International’s Secretary General Kumi Naidoo. However, not all of the report was positive. Thailand joined Botswana, Sudan, and Taiwan in resuming imposing the death penalty, holding the country’s first execution since 2009. Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena also announced he would resume executions for the first time in 40 years. Sirisena even posted an advertisement in February seeking executioners.    By the end of 2018, 106 countries had abolished the death penalty for all crimes and 142 had abolished the death penalty in practice or law. But, instances of people being sentenced to death increased to 19,336. Although Morocco has the death penalty and had at least 90 people on death row in 2018, it reported no executions. Amnesty noted that Morocco was among the 29 countries which recorded commutations or pardons of death sentences in 2018. The last execution in Morocco was that of Mohamed Mustapha Tabit, convicted of hundreds of counts of assault and rape, in 1993.  Naidoo implored countries around the world to end the practice: “To all the countries that still resort to the death penalty, I challenge you to act boldly and put a stop to this abhorrent punishment now.”

Rabat – The Polisario Front is experiencing several protests in Rabouni, Algeria, in which dozens of Sahrawis are demonstrating against tightened restrictions. Former Polisario officer Mustafa Salma Sidi Mouloud shared a photo of the protests on his Facebook on Wednesday and captioned it: “The demands of today’s continuous demonstrations in the Tindouf refugee camps in Tindouf [that have been ongoing] for a week now.” According to Mustafa Salma, the protesters are “only demanding their right to move freely, which is guaranteed universally.” A video posted on YouTube on Monday also shows vehicles lining up on  road while protesters wave separatist flags and shout slogans, such as “Freedom of movement” and “Freedom.”  The protesters describe Polisario’s restrictions as “forced detention” and a “violation of the right of movement.” In addition to the protests in Rabouni, dozens of Sahrawis also carried out a sit-in in front of the headquarters of the self styled “Sahrawi Ministry of the Interior” against lack of freedom of movement. The protesters also denounced Polisario’s decision to hand over a list of those who leave the camps to the Algerian security services. Polisario allegedly limits cars to leaving the camps only once in 20 days.  Commenting on the ongoing protests, Mustafa Salma wrote in a previous Facebook post that demonstrators are unaware that they have chosen the “right place to protest because if they checked under their feet they would find the first underground prison built by the Polisario to detain” anti-Polisario activists at the interior ministry prison in 1976.

Rabat – Moroccan police, in coordination with customs officers in Guerguerat at the Mauritanian border, seized 11 tons and 940 kilograms of cannabis on a truck bound for “an African country” on Wednesday. The operation was made on the basis of information from the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST), Maghreb Arab press (MAP) reported. A statement from Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that search operations at the borders helped to identify the drug, which was concealed inside kitchen furniture on the trailer of a Morocco-registered truck. Police also arrested the truck driver and the officer in charge of the customs clearance at the border post with Mauritania. “The illegal substance was transferred to the customs administration as it falls under its jurisdiction, while the suspects were remanded in police custody to complete the probe conducted by the judicial police in Dakhla police district, under the supervision of the competent public prosecutor,” added the statement. Moroccan police have seized counterfeits and illegal products in the region before. Moroccan customs seized 8,300 unused mobile phones of different brands at the Guerguerat border with Mauritania in 2017. The mobile phones were hidden on a truck registered in Mauritania. The buffer zone of Guerguerat witnessed many instances of illegal smuggling in recent years, under heightened tensions between Morocco and the Polisario Front due to Morocco’s increased security intervention in the area. Moroccan authorities had intensified security measures to combat illegal activities.

Rabat – Algerian army chief Gaid Salah has warned Algerians against continuously protesting with “unrealistic slogans aimed at destroying the institutions of the state.” Salah also expressed support for the newly-appointed interim president, Abdelkader Bensalah, who will run the country until elections on July 4. Salah also claimed that there are “foreign attempts” from some “foreign parties” to “destabilize the country” without pointing out any specific culprit. Some news outlets reported that Salah might be referring to France as Salah mentioned the “historic record of “certain foreign parties.” He added that the Algerian military “categorically rejected” foreign intervention. In March, French President Emmanuel Macron called for a “reasonable duration” to the transition period after former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika postponed elections indefinitely. Salah’s remarks imply that he may be speaking of any country with an unfriendly history with Algeria, which would include Morocco. Morocco, however, has remained silent on the situation in Algeria. Throughout the crisis in Algeria, Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi refused to comment on the situation. In March, the Moroccan government said that it stands for non-interference in Algerian protests. While Gaid Salah’s remarks did not directly touch Algeria’s neighbor, other Algerian officials publicly expressed hostile statements towards Morocco. Former major-general Abdelaziz Medjahed referred to Morocco as an enemy of Algeria. Sharing similar comments as Gaid Salah, Medjahed said that “there are those who want to harm the Algerian state from when we gained independence to the present.” “They think we are divided, but it must be proved that Algerians are united together to deter all external threats,” he added. The statements followed escalated protests against the appointment of Bensalah, when police cracked down on protesters using water cannons to disperse demonstration

Rabat – Read My World, Amsterdam’s international literature festival, is entirely dedicated to Morocco this year. Read My World finds this year a fitting time to highlight Morocco, as 2019 marks 50 years since Morocco and the Netherlands signed a recruitment treaty, leading to an influx of Moroccans immigrating to the Netherlands.  The festival will “not only cover stories about labor migration, but also the stories about social life, culture, traditions and the future. Stories from and for all Dutch people with and without a migration background.” Read My World will examine how these stories are portrayed in literature, theater, poetry, music, and film. The seventh annual festival will gather a wide range of poets, novelists, artists, and activists to “explore the boundaries between literature and journalism, between here and there – and draw attention to everything in between.” Two Moroccans have been appointed curators of the festival, novelist Mahi Binebine and journalist Fedwa Misk. As curators, they will propose a list of authors to invite and create the program. Misk will be heading a festival preview on April 16, with a focus on feminism in the Maghreb. Misk will also announce which writers and poets will attend the festival and discuss what topics will be addressed during the festival, such as feminism in Morocco and the role of the female voice in contemporary literature. On April 18, Misk, who has worked as a journalist for Le Courier de L’Atlas (The Atlas Courier) and runs the popular feminist blog Qandisha, will hold a meet and greet. Misk will discuss the impact of the written word in Morocco today and what her own work has brought about in the past year. The festival will preview for the third and final time on May 28. The preview will focus on the “Maghreb and Prose” and bring together writers and performers for “inspiring talks and conversation.” The official festival will take place from October 10 to 12, 2019, at the Tolhuistuin in Amsterdam. Each year, the festival focuses on a different region of the world and asks local curators to introduce writers and poets who can tell “stories beyond the superficiality of day-to-day news.”

Rabat – Morocco is relocating the Hirak prisoners to prisons in their native northern Morocco, after mass protests over the activists’ losing their appeal of their heavy prison sentences last week. The General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR) announced the transfer in a statement Thursday, April 11. DGAPR stated that it intends to bring the activists from Oukacha prison in Casablanca to prisons closer to their homes and families in Morocco’s northern Rif region. It stated this is part of a plan “to preserve prisoners’ family and social ties.” The general delegation said the criteria it has adopted are based on the length of the prisoners’ sentences, though there are exceptional cases. On April 5, the Casablanca Court of Appeals upheld the sentences of 54 prisoners, ranging from 1 to 20 years in prison terms, on charges of “attacks on the internal and external security of the state, violence with premeditation,” and “disturbing public order.” On April 3, 24 members of the European Parliament a member of the Council of Europe addressed a letter to Morocco’s Minister of Justice Mohamed Aujjar, calling on him to free the Hirak prisoners. The MEPs raised concerns over “the suffering of the activists’ families.” “The families of the prisoners have made us aware of the suffering of attending the court in Casablanca, which is 600 kilometers away from their homes and which has already lasted 18 months.” The MEPs also raised concerns over the “deteriorating” health of Hirak leader Nasser Zefzafi, a statement that Morocco’s National Human Rights Council has denied. In protest, Nasser Zefzafi sewed his lips after the Casablanca Court of Appeals upheld his 20-year sentence on April 5. The Hirak protests erupted in October 2016 in the wake of the tragic death of Mohcine Fikri, a fishmonger, who was crushed to death in a garbage truck, allegedly on orders from a policeman. The man was killed when attempting to retrieve his merchandise, which the police had confiscated.

Rabat – Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir has stepped down from his office after nearly four months of protests against his rule. International media reported that the 75-year old former president is under house arrest as heavy law enforcement circle his presidential palace.  Al-Bashir’s decision followed a statement from Sudan’s state-owned television, which said that the army will make an “important statement” on Thursday. While state media gave no further details, officials confirmed al-Bashir’s resignation. An official told al Hadath news television channel that consultations started to set up a transitional council after the resignation. The resignation came after after months of protests and serious clashes between law enforcement and energetic, determined anti-Al Bashir protesters.  On Tuesday,  at least 13 people were killed in anti-government protests in Khartoum.  Despite the resignation, protesters issued a press release where they promised to continue protests until the “regime steps down completely and power is handed to a civilian transitional government,” according to the Guardian. The situation in Sudan is similar to Algeria, whose people managed to convince former Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to step down.  Despite the resignation of Bouteflika, protesters continued to demand full reforms, calling on the whole system to leave. Fall after 30 years of heavy-handed rule Speaking on conditions of anonymity , Sudanese officials told AP that the army was a determining factor in Al Bashir’s resignation. They stressed that Generals forced the president to leave.  Al-Bashir, seventh president of Sudan,  ruled the country for 30 years.  Bashir was confirmed as president of Sudan in 1993 after the revolutionary council was disbanded. The president, however, was the country’s de facto ruler even before leading a coup d’etat in 1989, which resulted in his appointment as the president of the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation.  During his chairmanship at the council, Bashir disbanded the parliament and had the press roughly monitored. Even in those early years of Bashir’s rule, political opposition was banned and freedom of speech and association was stifled. That heavy-handed style of rule would later become the hallmarks of Bashir’s more decades-long grip on his country’s political power.  The protests in Sudan started in December 19 to condemn al-Bashir’s government economy mismanagement. The protests in Sudan were backed by several international powers, including the UK, US and Norway. In a joint statement on Tuesday, the countries urged Sudanese officials to “deliver a credible plan” for a political transition. “Failing to do so risks causing greater instability. The Sudanese leadership has a grave responsibility to avoid such an outcome,” the statement emphasized.

Rabat – Morocco’s head of government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, has reacted to his predecessor’s suggestion that he resigns from premiership. In a statement as trenchant as the attack he received from former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane, El Othmani said that he would never resign from his “mission” as head of government. “I will never resign from the government,” El Othmani said at a party meeting on Monday, Moroccan Arabic-language newspaper Assabah reported April 10. The PJD leader subsequently added, addressing the man who had suggested that the current government resigns, “Only the King, who has appointed me to this position, can force me out it.” According to the newspaper, El Othmani’s speech came in a tense atmosphere: PJD’s party solidarity is increasingly under duress as the party’s two most senior figures aim at each other in public statements. El Othmani’s response came after news emerged that most PJD members tended to side with Benkirane in the pair’s current arms wrestle. While Benkirane and El Othmani have not particularly been allies, with the former head of government said to be plotting a return at the helm of the party and national politics, their current friction is rooted in disagreement over Draft Law 51.17. The law, introduced to Parliament by education minister Said Amzazi, aims to reform the Moroccan education system. Arguing that we live in a globalized knowledge economy where most scientific subjects are produced in languages other than Arabic, proponents of the law are pushing for the adoption of French as the language of instruction in scientific and technical subjects in Moroccan schools. El Othmani supports the law, which Benkirane has called a “crime” against national pride and identity. As Benkirane and El Othmani air their dirty laundry in statements questioning each other’s loyalty to PJD’s “vision” for Morocco, PJD ministers and MPs increasingly find themselves caught in the middle. Benkirane is believed to inspire more fervor than El Othmani in PJD ranks. The former party leader styles himself as the bastion of ideological and national purity who will save PJD from attacks by liberal—and apparently Westernized—Moroccans. Meanwhile, many perceive the current El Othmani-led PJD as soft-spoken and impressionable on issues of “national pride.” In his condemnation of Law 51.17, Benkirane capitalized on the reportedly popular perception that giving foreign languages preeminence over Arabic is an attack on one of the core pillars of Moroccan identity. The project law, Benkirane has said, is a “betrayal” of PJD principles and a “fatal blow” to Moroccan national pride. He warned the government to resign rather than support the passing of a law that challenges Moroccanness. “Do not accept to be false witnesses, even if it requires the fall of this government and the appointment of another.” However, many PJD members made it known that they do not stand with Benkirane on the language reform project, according to Assabah. By the end of the Monday party congress, many PJD leaders argued that the draft law is good for Morocco because proficiency in languages like English and French would make Moroccan academics and students more competitive on the global stage. The supportive statements are aimed at preventing a more major blow to the PJD and the current government. The PJD has been at the forefront of the parliamentarian project to adopt Law 51.17, and it would be a major defeat for the ruling party to throw all its weight behind a draft and fail to have it pass Parliament. Meanwhile, with Moroccan conservative circles, the PJD’s electoral base, opting for Benkirane’s take on the language issue, PJD’s internal crisis is set to have deeper ramifications than the party leadership would like to admit. Political scientist Omar Cherkaoui recently told Moroccan outlet Le 360 that Benkirane is tapping on Moroccan conservatives’ enthusiasm for nationalism and identity to reclaim his lost political prestige. “Benkirane is on course to win an identity and social battle,” Charkaoui said. “He wants to re-establish his reputation by stigmatizing what he views as a coalition of lobbies that want to harm the country.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported earlier today that King Mohammed VI has sent a message of good wishes and “fraternity” to King Salman of Saudi Arabia. Even as news ran earlier this week that Morocco and its Saudi ally were again on course for tense relations over Saudi Arabia investing in Mauritania to upset Morocco, the Moroccan and Saudi governments are sending mixed messages set to confound. MAP reported that the King’s message was warmly received by the Saudi Monarch, who in turn told Morocco’s foreign minister Nasser Bourita, the bearer of the Moroccan royal message, that the Saudi kingdom is poised to uphold the “historical and brotherly” ties with Morocco. Bourita’s Saudi visit was an opportunity to discuss wide-ranging issues in the MENA region, according to MAP. The Moroccan minster’s audience with King Salman was marked by the presence of high-ranking Saudi officials, including the Saudi interior and foreign ministers. Prior to his meeting with the Saudi monarch, Bourita met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known asMBS. The two discussed “bilateral cooperation and the latest developments on the regional scene.”
Relations between Rabat and Riyadh have been rocky lately. The two kingdoms’ alliance has been mired in “scandals” as statements from a Saudi news outlet challenged Morocco’s interests on issues, including Western Sahara, that Rabat considers key to its sovereignty and territorial integrity. In Riyadh, meanwhile, Morocco’s apparent withdrawal from the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen and refusal to take part in the Saudi-led blockade against Qatar did not sit well with the Saudi establishment. But Bourita’s Saudi trip is set to contradict news of seemingly irreconcilable geopolitical disagreements as a result of what some analysts have called the “MBS factor.” The visit may not be enough to counter a perception in Moroccan circles that Saudi Arabia has not been a reliable ally since MBS rose to political prominence.

Rabat – The Clean City app is full of trash. Scrolling through its feed unearths photos of overflowing dumpsters in Casablanca, couches on the side of a Meknes highway, and piles of plastic waste in Marrakech.  The app’s goal? Clean it up. On April 1, the World Economic Forum and the Bahrain Economic Development Board placed Clean City among their top 100 “most exciting Arab startups.” The company was the only Moroccan startup to be named—hinting at a less-than-flourishing ecosystem for Morocco’s entrepreneurs. But Clean City, so far, has managed to find success.  The app is the brainchild of Mouhsin Bour Qaiba, the CEO of Marrakech-based coding agency M3KOD. His company has churned out several similar social innovation projects since he founded it in 2015, but it’s Clean City that has gotten Bour Qaiba’s team a global reputation. “It’s like Facebook or Instagram, but for the problems citizens are seeing in their cities,” Bour Qaiba said in an interview with Morocco World News. The idea for Clean City came to Bour Qaiba as he observed piles of uncollected trash on curbsides in Moroccan cities. He always had felt “very affected” when he saw them, he said. The app accelerates trash collection—as well as other maintenance services, like filling potholes—by allowing its users to post pictures of waste and other problems they encounter in cities. The pictures upload to a public feed with a location tag, which the app then shares with authorities.  Submitting pictures rewards users with points they can spend on free coffees and movie tickets, and lets trash collectors swiftly locate and clean up the mess—so everyone wins. Clean City’s website says it is the first social network for environmental protection. “Protecting our cities is now a shared responsibility,” it reads. And the idea has caught on. The app has 30,000 users around the globe, from France to India to Egypt. “Meet the 100 Arab startups shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution,” the World Economic Forum announced on their website, listing the selected startups.  The forum selected a kaleidoscopic range of companies. Among them is a startup that has created a substance that turns desert into fertile soil, a community-building app for soccer players, and an online flower marketplace. They represent 17 countries in the Arab world. On April 7, the UAE granted five-year visas to all startups selected, as well as financial assistance, which is “good news for Clean City,” Bour Qaiba said.  The recognition from the World Economic Forum, as well as other awards that Clean City has received, has allowed Bour Qaiba to set lofty goals for the company. He hopes to have 2 million active users on the app by 2021, he said. He has new ambassadors for the app in Austria and Cameroon and is focusing particularly on expanding the app’s already-significant presence in France. But for many Moroccan entrepreneurs, such fortune is out of reach. “A lot of startups in Morocco start and don’t have funding, don’t have access to big corporations to continue,” Bour Qaida said. “Morocco doesn’t help startups accelerate.” Bour Qaida got around this by leaning on his more established company, M3KOD, to fund Clean City initially. That is not an option for many Moroccan startups, who struggle to find initial investors in the country’s risk-averse investment landscape. Only 8% of MENA region startups hail from Morocco, according to an exhaustive survey of startups in the Arab world by MAGNiTT, an online resource for startups. The UAE and Egypt led the region in nurturing innovation, at 35% and 19% respectively. “[Startups] create their own jobs and offer employment opportunities for the growing young population,” Mirek Dusek, head of the MENA committee of the World Economic Forum, told MAGNiTT.  For that reason, he said, startups provide solutions to the region’s most pressing problems. In Morocco, their number may be growing, as the kingdom has moved technology and innovation to the top of its economic priority list. Morocco’s finance minister Mohamed Benchaaboun said in October he planned to ease the administrative hurdles to funding that startups face. And in March, the Moroccan Innov Investment Fund announced it had financed 68 startups between 2017 and 2019—and plans to finance a total of 300 by 2022.

Rabat – Police in Indonesia have uncovered four human trafficking networks that sent over 1,200 Indonesians to work in Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Syria. The network promised the majority of the victims jobs with salaries, but upon arrival to the countries the victims were abused and forced to work without pay.  Indonesia arrested eight suspects in connection to the case. The recent discovery is Indonesia’s largest human trafficking bust. Among the networks, one trafficked Indonesians from West Nusa Tenggara, a province in the south of Indonesia, and Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, to Morocco. Police arrested two suspects, Mutiara and Farhan, linked to the network between Indonesia and Morocco. The traffickers took the victims from Sumbawa in West Nusa Tenggara to Jakarta and then sent them to Malaysia via Batam. From Malaysia they sent the victims to Morocco. “These migrant Indonesian workers realized that they had been duped after they were forced to suffer many abuses including violence, rape and unpaid salaries. They ran away and reported their cases to the embassies or consulate general offices,” said the Indonesian criminal investigation director general, Herry Rudolf Nahak. Indonesian police will charge the eight suspects who orchestrated the trafficking networks under Articles 4 and 10 of Indonesian human trafficking law, which carry a maximum punishment of 15 years in prison.  State of human trafficking in Indonesia According to the US State Department’s 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report, Indonesia is a “major source … for women, men, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking.” Beginning in 2015, Indonesia prohibited women from going to 21 Middle Eastern countries after a series of abuse cases. However, due to high demand from Middle Eastern countries, traffickers have discovered ways to avoid the law.  “The government has tried to address this issue, but the latest arrests show a lot more needs to be done and it is still a major problem,” said Anis Hidayah from the non-profit Migrant Care, which campaigns for migrant domestic workers. Human trafficking in Morocco According to the 2016 Global Slavery Index, 45.8 million people worldwide are victims of slavery. Morocco ranked at number 18 out of the 167 listed countries with the most cases of modern slavery, including human -trafficking. The U.S. State Department’s t2018 Trafficking in Persons Rreport, says that Morocco “does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking.”  The same report cites “criminal networks operating in Oujda on the Algerian border and in the northern coastal town of Nador” asto be some of the regions where traffickers “force undocumented migrant women into prostitution and begging.”

Rabat – Algeria’s presidency announced Wednesday it will hold the 2019 presidential elections on July 4, 86 days into Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah’s custodianship. Bensalah had reassured Algeria that the next election will be free during a televised speech on Tuesday after the Parliament appointed him interim president following President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s resignation. The interim president was required to hold an election within 90 days, in accordance with Article 102 of the Constitution. “The important thing is for our people to choose the person and the program that best suits their aspirations for a new political system able to meet the country’s major challenges in an Algeria wedded to modernity, democracy, to justice and development,” Bensalah said. The interim president, a loyalist to Bouteflika, continued: “I expect everyone, a greater mobilization than the one they have shown so far, to face the multiple and urgent challenges that our country must inevitably face.” Protesters, who have been protesting since February 22, promised to continue their demonstrations against the system with slogans such as “System degage!” or “System, get out,” “Leave means leave!” and “The people are the only hero.” On Tuesday, protesters rallied across Algeria to contest the appointment of Bensalah. Police cracked down on protesters, using water cannons to disperse the protests. Who is Bensalah? The 77-year-old interim president was born in Tlemcen, near the Moroccan border. Bensalah had been the head of the upper house of Parliament since 2002, three years after Bouteflika became president in 1999. AFP said that the president has represented Bouteflika in international and local events since Bouteflika’s stroke in 2013. The official held several other high-ranking positions, including senator and ambassador. Bensalah served as ambassador to Saudi Arabia 1989-1993. Following that, the politician served as the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The interim president joined the National Liberation Army (NLA) which began fighting French colonialism in 1954. The president then secured a scholarship in 1962 to study law in Damascus, before returning to Algeria to join Al Shaab (The People) newspaper as a journalist in 1967. After serving pro-government media, the president was elected as MP in 1977. The interim president also served as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPC). Bensalah, who received criticism for his former Moroccan nationality, also served as the head of the Transitional National Council (CNT) in 1994, before  he joined the Council of the Nation in 2002, where he has been systematically re-elected every three years. Recently a group of politicians criticized Bensalah, arguing that he should not become interim president because “he was “Moroccan.” The president of Algeria’s Justice and Development Front Party, Lakhdar Benkhellaf, said that Bensalah has a “problem with his nationality of origin. The condition for a [leader] occupying the post of President of the Republic, is that he must have the Algerian nationality of origin,” quoting the Algerian Constitution. “He had another nationality until 1964 during which he had obtained Algerian nationality,” he added.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister Delegate for the National Defense Abdellatif Loudiyi has received Spanish Secretary of State for Defense Angel Olivares Ramirez, who arrived in Morocco for a two-day working trip. Ramirez is leading a large Spanish delegation, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).The officials held talks about defense cooperation. The officials also discussed the “satisfactory results achieved in the fight against terrorism and the management of the migration crisis.” Spain participated in the international African Lion military exercise, which took place in Morocco from March 16 to April 5 in several southern provinces, including Ben Guerir near Marrakech. The event, attended by military officials from the US and Canada, featured training and joint exercises to counter extremism and terror attacks. Loudiyi and Ramirez agreed on the presence of promising prospects for “bilateral and regional cooperation in the field of defense industry.” In addition to counter-terrorism, Morocco and Spain also cooperate on migration issues. Recently, Spanish news outlet El Diario quoted the Spanish navy saying the Spanish government would further increase its cooperation with its Moroccan counterpart against undocumented migration. The news outlet added that Spain will offer rescue training and boats to Morocco to stop undocumented migrants. Recently, Spain has expressed eminent support for the Moroccan government and has been Rabat’s steadfast supporter at the European Union. The partnership strengthened after the recent visit of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to Morocco in November 2018. Promises to strengthen the cooperation increased after the visit of the Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI, and his wife, Queen Letizia, to Morocco in mid-February 2019.

Rabat – Over 150 Moroccan figures signed a petition calling on the government to abandon a proposed education bill, Law 51.17, that would replace Arabic as a language of instruction for scientific subjects in schools with French.  Among the 150 were politicians, activists, linguists, academics, and public figures who took part in signing the petition, which was handed to a number of MPs, including Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. The petitioners call on the government to have public schools use the constitutionally-recognized national languages of Arabic and Amazight (Berber).  The signatories call for “linguistic equality,” denouncing the provisions of Law 51.17 for the education system, particularly its provision that public schools can teach scientific and technical subjects in French.  The petition calls on the government to “enter into an open national dialogue” involving all parties, from civil society activists and students to linguists, and to put aside all “feigned conflicts” in Morocco’s interests.  The petitioners want Arabic or Amazigh to be used for instruction of scientific subjects at lower levels of education, saying “scholars in the areas of multilingualism have proved that Arabic is capable of functioning as a language of instruction, and in all domains.” Universities teach most of their courses in French, but primary and secondary schools teach in standard Arabic. Fouad Bouali, the president of the coalition, stated that the petition also aims to denounce the “Frenchification” of public schools.  The National Coalition for Arabic Language initiated another petition on Avaaz.org with the same goal, which has so far received over 1,800 signatures. While government was expected to meet on April 8 to discuss the draft law, the dispute over language is still creating heated debates and widening the divide, especially between proponents of Arabic and French. On March 31, former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane appeared on a live video on Facebook and denounced the proposed adoption of French as a language of instruction at public schools. Though the final version of the draft law was agreed by the leaders of political parties in Parliament, the government has delayed a vote on the bill several times.

Rabat – New Zealand’s Parliament voted almost unanimously on Wednesday to reform the country’s gun laws, less than a month after the devastating Christchurch massacre, in which a terrorist shot and killed 50 people in two mosques.   The country’s governor-general must grant the bill royal assent, at which point it could come into force as law as early as Friday.  The gun reform bill, the first substantial change to New Zealand gun law since 1983, passed with 119-1 votes.  The bill bans the circulation and use of semi-automatic firearms, the parts that convert regular firearms into semi-automatic ones, magazines over a certain capacity, and some shotguns. Members of Parliament emphasized the implementation of a buy-back scheme which will keep gun owners from bearing the financial burden. The bill grants gun owners amnesty until September 20 to surrender the prohibited weapons. After this date, those found to be breaking the new law will face between two and 10 years in prison. A lone gunman carried out the Christchurch terror attack on March 15, using semi-automatic guns to kill 50 people in two of the city’s mosques. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called March 15 the “darkest of days in New Zealand history.” She announced a ban on the sale of military style semi-automatics (MSSA) and assault rifles just six days after the massacre. Ardern also announced plans to tighten gun laws, a goal she accomplished in part with the passage of the reform. The government has already begun working on another arms amendment bill. The bill, which lawmakers hope to introduce in June, will address issues like the introduction of a gun registry. The sole dissenting voice in Parliament was David Seymour, a representative of the libertarian ACT Party. Seymour said he felt the process was rushed, saying the bill was “not an attempt to improve public safety” but “an exercise in political theatre.” Despite Seymour’s dissent, New Zealand’s Parliament was nearly unanimous in agreement on the country’s need for the bill. During her address to Parliament, Ardern said that the sense of unity was necessary: “We are ultimately here because 50 people died, and they do not have a voice. We in this house are their voice, and today, we have used that voice wisely.”

Rabat – In a recent maneuver, the Polisario Front has sent a letter to the Security Council accusing Morocco of violating the ceasefire agreement in Western Sahara. Pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara reported that the representative of the Polisario Front, Mohammed Ammar, sent the letter. “Morocco’s growing violations seriously undermine the new momentum created by the Personal Envoy and contradict the serious spirit we are supposed to have as parties as we engage in the peace process,” said the separatist representative. The letter also quoted paragraph 32 and 35 of the draft report of the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, in which Guterres wrote of a “new sand wall of more than 110 kilometers and parallel to the current military wall in direct violation of Military Agreement No. 1.” The report recalled that the Moroccan army built a sand wall near Mahbes, northeastern Western Sahara. The report, however, said that Morocco stopped the work after  MINURSO’s intervention. “As urged by MINURSO, work has now stopped on the wall, and observation posts along its length have been abandoned by the Royal Moroccan Army,” reads the report. Polisario’s letter came on the eve of a Security Council meeting Wednesday morning. The Security Council is meeting April 10 to discuss Western Sahara and to consult on the UN peacekeeping mission, known as MINURSO, and Guterres’s draft report. The front also called on Morocco to remove all its “illegal facilities.” Ignoring parts of the report in which Guterres mentioned Polisario’s violations, the Polisario Front seized the opportunity before the meeting to make its position against Morocco known. The UN draft report also discussed Polisario’s violations east of Morocco’s defense wall. The report also called on the Polisario Front to meet in Rabouni with MINURSO members instead of insisting on meeting in Western Sahara. The Secretary-General’s draft report also mentioned images taken by Morocco’s high resolution satellite, which Morocco gave to the UN to enable MINURSO to identify and confirm new violations by Polisario, including the construction of several buildings east of Morocco’s defence wall in Western Sahara. “Over the course of the past year, Morocco has provided MINURSO and the Secretariat with various satellite images of alleged construction and military activities east of the berm, which, they suggest, may be in violation of military agreement No. 1 or paragraphs 7 or 8 of Security Council resolution 2414 (2018),” reads the report. The UN chief confirmed that MINURSO has “assessed all of these allegations. Some of them had previously been recorded as violations by the Mission.” The report added that MINURSO identified two new violations and “declared, pertaining to two sites in Mehaires: a logistics unit and a cluster of still-unoccupied buildings.” Guterres also warned against major risks of tensions in the region due to Polisario’s military exercises in restricted zones. “I nonetheless reiterate the importance of ensuring that no action, in particular of a military nature, be conducted that could risk creating tensions,” he said.

Rabat – Friday, June 21 is not only International Music Day but the opening night of the 18th annual Mawazine festival in Rabat. In honor of the event, Mawazine has some big names on the roster. Spanish singer Rosalia will be the first artist to take the “international” OLM Souissi stage. Rosalia is best known for taking a modern on urban twist on the age-old style of flamenco.  Since releasing her debut album “Los Angeles” in 2017, Rosalia has garnered unprecedented praise on the global stage. She has collaborated with Pharrell Williams, James Blake, and reggaeton heavyweight J Balvin, as well as being nominated for Best New Artist at the Latin Grammy Awards in 2017. After Rosalia’s performance, reggaeton megastar J Balvin will take the stage. The Colombian-born singer entered the Latin music scene in 2009 and only continues to rise in fame a decade later.   This week, J Balvin topped Billboard’s Latin Airplay charts for the 13th time with his single, simply titled “Reggaeton.” J Balvin’s music videos, often featuring stars such as Selena Gomez and Cardi B, have amassed a whopping 11 billion views on YouTube. On Saturday, June 22, French-Moroccan hip hop artist Lartiste will perform. Lartiste combines rap, RnB, and dancehall styles for an original sound. His hit “Mafiosa” with Brazilian singer Carolina forms his fourth studio album, “Grandestino,” which reached number 2 on the French charts last year. After Lartiste, one of the biggest DJs of the century, French-born David Guetta, will take the OLM stage.  Guetta began his DJ career in 1983 but made his big international breakthrough with his 2009 album “One Love” which featured Akon, Rihanna, and Kelly Rowland, among other stars. Since then, Guetta has sold over nine million albums and 30 million singles worldwide. Mawazine, a festival in Rabat with six venues, will take place from June 21 to June 29 and is organized by Maroc Cultures under the patronage of King Mohammed VI. Having drawn over 2.5 million attendees in recent years, Mawazine is the second largest music festival in the world, after Donauinselfest in Vienna, and the largest festival in Africa. The festival brings in artists from countries all over the world as well as highlighting local Moroccan musicians. Last year, the festival saw major international acts perform such as Martin Garrix, Bruno Mars, Luis Fonsi, and The Weeknd. The festival lists the democratization of culture in Morocco as one of its initiatives and provides free access to 90% of its shows each year.

Rabat – In February, King Mohammed VI called on the government to recruit 10,000 Moroccans into mandatory military service in 2019, to be increased to 15,000 in 2020. Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit announced on Monday that the government has finalized the list of draftees who will be obligated to fill out the census form for 2019 military service. The government will require those called to serve for 12 months, under penalty of sanctions. On February 7, the Council of Ministers adopted two draft decrees which established processes for identifying, selecting, and enlisting those subject to compulsory military service. This draft will affect men between the ages of 19 and 25. Women and Moroccans Residing Abroad (MREs) are exempt but encouraged to voluntarily enlist. Parliamentarians and members of the government are also exempt from military service. Draft process Those people who are on the list of draftees will receive a notification. They must complete the census form on tajnid.ma website within 20 days of receiving that notification. In the form, draftees must enter their first and last name, CIN number, personal name of parents, and census number (included in the notification) before completing the rest of the form. Even if no notification is received, anyone can check whether they are subject to military service by going to tajnid.ma and filling out the form with everything but the census number. If their name appears, their census number will load automatically, and they can continue completing the form. Those not called to military service can still choose to voluntarily register by completing the census form. They must do so before the end of the census period on June 7 to be taken into account. The government especially encourages women and MREs to voluntarily register. If there are problems accessing the site or completing the form, the government encourages draftees to reach out to local administrative authorities. These administrations have computers connected to the website and can aid in filling out the form. After the form is complete, a receipt should be printed and emailed to the person. The receipt informs the conscript that they can file an application for temporary or definitive exemption. Filing for exemption In order to file for exemption, a conscript must submit an application within 20 days of completing the census form. The application is to be submitted to local administrative authorities who will transfer the request to the prefectural commissions which make decisions about exemption applications. There are four main reasons a person can receive an exemption, and each requires the person to submit supporting documents in the application. For reason of physical or medical incapacity, a person must support with a medical report from public health services. For reason of family support, a person must submit a certificate issued by the governor of the district or province providing the status of family support. For reason of continuing studies, the person must have a certificate issued by an authority in the relevant sector proving continuation of studies in educational or vocational training institutions, public or private.  The final reason for receiving an exemption is the presence of a brother in service as a conscript or the presence of one or more brothers and sisters who can be summoned simultaneously for military service. This case can be confirmed with a document from the military confirming the relationship. People over 25 who receive an exemption can be called until the age of 40 if at any point the reason for the exemption no longer stands. Being called to military service On June 7, the recruiting office of Royal Armed Forces (FAR) staff will prepare a recruitment order to summon conscripts. Anyone who receives a recruitment order will also receive a specific date and place where they must report to the prefectural commission. The commission, which includes a military doctor, examines the conscript’s health. If found to be healthy and able, FAR will register them for service. According to the FAR Morocco Forum, the military has created three new training centers, including one in El Hajeb, between Rabat and Fez, and one in Kasba Tadla, in central Morocco. Each of the training centers have an annex for female staff. The army created the centers with the goal of improving living conditions of conscripts to move away from “cliches and bad ideas that surround the military service.” Additionally, the army created supervision commissions to oversee improvements in living conditions and to assure equality in the treatment of conscripts. FAR will assign the conscripts ranks according to hierarchy based on their level of education. Those with a bachelor’s or equivalent will become “officers;” those with at least a baccalaureate will be “sub-officers;” and those with less than a baccalaureate will be “military rank.” Basic training will last four months and include both general and military training. General training includes national education and civil and military history while military training includes military regulation, general discipline, and physical education. At the end of four months of basic training, conscripts will receive an assignment in either a combat, support, or logistics unit, which lasts for the duration of their service. Once assigned, they will undergo an eight-month period of specialized training. The first month involves technical military training which is followed by apprenticeship training which promises the development of skills in no less than 25 trades.    Those with an academic background will have a shorter period of basic training. They will be assigned positions based on their previous qualifications. For example, a conscript who studied medicine would be assigned to a FAR hospital or other medical structure. Benefits and sanctions All conscripts will receive salaries based on rank. Per month, soldiers receive $109, non-commissioned officers receive $156, and officers receive $218. All conscripts sent to the southern provinces will get a bonus of $31. Conscripts will also get tax-exempt allowances which include free clothing, accommodation, and catering. Medical benefits include medical coverage, death and disability insurance, and free medication in military hospitals. Those who do not comply with the draft will face sanctions. Those subject to military service who do not answer the call will face one to three months in prison and a $210-520 fine. A punishment of one month to one year in prison and a $210-1,040 fine will be applied to those who do not respond to an individual or general conscription form as well as those who hide a conscript or forbid them from military service. Public opinion   Since Morocco’s ministerial council reinstated compulsory military service last year for the first time since 2006, there has been a great deal of discussion about the policy. There have been some concerns from the public about the draft being applied unequally, especially across social classes. The King attempted to assuage the fears by assuring the public that the law will apply to citizens from all social classes. In August 2018 the Royal Cabinet said that the compulsory “military service aims to promote patriotism among the young, within the framework of the correlation between the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.” In this regard, the law is seen as a way to encourage loyalty to the state among young people. Others see the expansion as a way to limit protest movements. They see the conscriptions as a way to widen the military’s reach and to recruit youth who have been involved in protests such as those in the northern Rif region. Some see the conscription as an opportunity for youth who have had trouble finding jobs. Others would rather the government invest in education as the policy of compulsory service will cost $52 million, according to Minister Delegate for National Defense Abdellatif Loudiyi.

Rabat – Both far-right and left-wing political parties in Spain have taken hard foreign policy stances with Morocco as Spain’s general election at the end of the month draws nearer. Most recently, Podemos, a left-wing political party whose name translates to “We Can,” has promised to recognize the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) if elected.The party is also calling for the Spanish government to establish diplomatic ties with so-called SADR in the hopes of allowing Saharawi residents into Spain in the future. In tandem with the other two foreign policy goals, Podemos’s electoral platform is also urging the extension of the mandate of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara (MINURSO).  The party has been pro-Polisario since its founding in 2014. However, in the last general election the party’s support for Polisario fell by the wayside. In 2016, the term “Western Sahara” did not appear once in the party’s 95-page electoral platform document. While Podemos has reaffirmed its support for Polisario during this election season, Jorge Verstrynge Rojas, one of the party’s political advisors, has recently said otherwise. During the 2019 Crans Montana Forum, Rojas said, “Western Sahara is and has always been part of Morocco.” Later, he explained that many in left-wing Spanish parties “are still not ready to come to terms with the fact that the territories are Morocco’s.” Rojas joined Podemos in 2014 as a political adviser and despite his support for the party he suggested that he values historical facts more than “ideological consistency” and “revolutionary fervor.” “Although I feel very close to Podemos, I am obliged to say things as they are,” Rojas said. Political parties on the other side of aisle have also taken tough stances on Moroccan foreign policy. Last month, Santiago Abascal, the leader of Spain’s right-wing party Vox, requested Morocco pay for the new border walls he plans to build around Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish enclaves  in Morocco’s territory. In a book published last month titled “Santiago Abascal: Espana’s Vertebrada,” (Santiago Abascal: Spain’s Backbone), Abascal made his intentions to build a new wall around the two enclaves  clear. He accused Morocco of not doing enough to stop the waves of irregular migrants that have crossed the border into Spain. According to the book, Abascal believes “the great wall that we should be building is a psychological one and consists of informing immigrants that those who enter illegally in Europe will never be able to regularize their situation.” Along with 10 other political parties, Podemos and Vox will be vying for seats during this year’s general election which will determine Spain’s 13th government. On the ballot during this upcoming election are all 350 seats of Congress and 208 of the 266 seats in the Senate. Parties will be competing for the majority on voting day, Sunday, April 28.

Rabat – Morocco’s butane gas distribution companies are threatening to go on strike during the holy month of Ramadan. The distributors want to put pressure on the government into meeting their demands during a month that typically sees high consumption rates. Distributors stated, according to sources speaking to Moroccan outlet Assabah, that the 2019 finance law “raises concerns among investors” because it stipulates that distributors must give invoices and financial statements to grocer’s shops.  The regulation, they claim, does not take into consideration their confidentiality.  Distributors reminded the government of Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani’s promise in January that small grocer’s shops would be exempt from “electronic billing.” Minister Delegate of Public Affairs and Governance Lahcen Daoudi and an association of butane gas distributors have held several meetings in the past but have not come to a mutual understanding.  According to Moroccan media outlets, there has since been mounting tension between the government and butane gas distribution companies.  The companies said they would go on strike particularly to denounce the new finance law, entered into force this year. Distributors are complaining of the law’s provisions, imposing taxes, requiring electronic billing, and, according to them, reducing their profit margin.  Distribution companies planned to go on strike on January 8, but delayed their plan. Rumors circulated social media in late February saying that the government would cut butane gas subsidies, which Daoudi denied. Morocco subsidizes butane gas, flour, and sugar. Many Moroccans use butane gas for cooking and heating.

Rabat – The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the global economy to lag next year, it said in a report Tuesday—but predicted that Morocco will see increased economic growth. Morocco’s real GDP growth rate, which was 3.1% in 2018, will increase to 3.2% in 2019 and reach 4.5% by 2024, the IMF projected. That rate is higher than its predictions for any advanced economy, including the United States and European Union countries, which the IMF said will experience an overall growth rate of only 1.8% in 2019. Stuttering growth in advanced economies is the primary reason behind the IMF’s grim economic forecast for 2019. The global growth rate will lag to 3.3% this year—a downgrade from the IMF’s January forecast for 3.5% growth. Though the slowdown will hit MENA region economies as well, the region’s growth rate will increase significantly by 2020, reaching 3.2% after 1.8% last year. “We’re challenging the region to embrace ambitious reforms,” Ferid Belhaj, World Bank vice president for the Middle East and North Africa region, said last week. He explained that despite the seemingly good economic prospects, the region must address its structural challenges before it can see long-term improvements. But Morocco remains one of the region’s most robust economies, the report affirmed. It is the only economy in North Africa expected to see consistently accelerated growth through 2024. Morocco’s projected 2024 growth rate was the fourth-highest of all MENA region nations, behind only Egypt, Djibouti, and Mauritania. And Morocco’s unemployment will also go down, the report said. Morocco’s expected 2020 unemployment rate is 8.9%, compared to 9.8% this year. Morocco has long boasted one of the region’s most stable economies, and recent financial reforms and increased economic diversification have helped it regain its footing after several years of slowing growth. The IMF lauded such reforms after a two-week visit to the country in April but warned that high unemployment and enduring social inequality threaten sustainable growth in Morocco.

Rabat – A horde of Atlantic Portuguese man o’ war jellyfish, the Physalia physalis species, showed up near Moroccan beaches over the weekend.  Four people received stings by man o’ wars, according to Moroccan newspaper Almassae. The man o’ wars’ venomous tentacles are capable of killing fish and, in extreme cases, humans.  The newspaper reported that Portuguese man o’ wars have appeared on the beaches of Al Hawziya, near El Jadida; Souiria, near Safi; and in Essaouira. The violet jellyfish, which have reportedly been swept into the Moroccan waters by the wind, have been reported on Moroccan beaches for several years now, though they particularly emerge in the months of March and April.  The National Fisheries Research Institute (INRH) in Laayoune, a city in Western Sahara, has issued a communique warning people against the invasion of jellyfish along the coasts of Laayoune and Casablanca.

Rabat – A video showing Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo wishing Moroccan international footballer Abdelhak Nouri a happy birthday is going viral on social media. “ Hi Nouri, I am Cristiano, just to wish you a happy birthday, I wish that you recover fast and … all the best for you man .. take care,” said Ronaldo with a wide smile, blowing a kiss after the message. Abdelhak Nouri’s birthday was on April 2. Nouri’s family warmly appreciated Ronaldo’s gesture. Deltelegraf quoted Nouri’s brother, who said that the family is “very fond of Ronaldo.” “Cristiano is of course not just anyone, but one of the best football players in the world,” he said. The Dutch-Moroccan footballer suffered severe brain damage following his collapse and he went into a coma. The 22-year old Ajax midfielder suffered heart rhythm issues during the friendly game, which took place in July 2017. Abdelhak’s brother, Abderrahim, said that his sibling’s condition was improving in 2018. He is now “quieter” and able to recognize and communicate with his family, who “stays with him 24 hours a day,” said his brother. In February, former manager of Ajax Danny Blind emotionally expressed solidarity with the footballer. “You never know [how good he could have been],” he said. Blind added that the footballer was a “real Ajax player,” in an interview with CNN. “At that time as an eight-year-old, you could see that he was a very good player. He was technical. He always had a solution — always one step [ahead] with what he was going to do,” he added.

Rabat – Following news about the death of 3 to 6 premature babies at the Rabat Souissi maternity ward, the Ibn Sina University Hospital issued Wednesday, April 9, a statement for clarification.  The administration at the hospital denied yesterday’s news that the premature babies’ death had been a result of a power outage. It argued the outage occurred at 6:45 a.m. on Saturday, April 6, and could not have caused yesterday’s deaths. It stated, however, that there were only three deaths due to poor health conditions. The first baby, who weighed no more than 1.5 kilograms, died at 4 p.m., nine hours after the power blackout.  The second and third babies, weighing less than 680 and 850 grams, respectively, died at 8 p.m., 13 hours after the blackout. The administration also stated that the hospital did not witness a full power outage. It was only partial and affected just three socket outlets.  The outage lasted for 7 minutes only, read the statement.  The administration also stressed that the hospital is equipped with two standby power generators.  Rabat’s hospital in ‘catastrophic’ state A nurse at the hospital linked the deaths of several prematurely-born infants on Saturday, April 6, to a power outage. A member of the Moroccan Network for the Defense of Health Rights, Lehbib Kerroum, questioned the hospital’s director Said Tayer’s claim that the babies’ deaths was due to health issues.  “How come four deaths happened at the same time?” asked Kerroum, describing the state of the hospital as “catastrophic.”  Kerroum also said that a “black report’ had been issued last year on the conditions of the hospital but was not published.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) has dismantled a four-member terror cell in Taza, 120 kilometers east of Fez. Morocco’s Ministry of Interior announced that the extremist terror cell is led by a former terrorist who was active in conflict zones in Iraq and Syria. The ministry said that the four suspects were aged 27 to 40.  The leader of the terror cell planned to use his experience in the conflict zones to plot terror attacks against sensitive institutions across Morocco, according to the ministry. He is also believed to have contributed to the recruitment of the other suspects. One of the suspects “contributed to financing the operation allowing some Moroccan fighters to join the cell,” the statement noted. BCIJ placed the suspects in custody for further investigation. Today’s arrest followed a similar operation, when BCIJ dismantled a six-member  terror cell on March 14 in several cities around the Casablanca area, including Mohammedia, El Jadida, and Sidi Bennour. In February, BCIJ also dismantled a five-member terror cell in Safi, western Morocco. In recent years, the Moroccan counter-terrorism office has arrested several terrorists. The body’s success has gained Morocco a strong reputation for security and anti-terrorism, despite the constant threat of ISIS returnees-sponsored plots. In December 2018, the head of BCIJ Abdelhak Khiame said that 1,668 Moroccans had joined ISIS and other terror groups in Syria and other conflict zones. Morocco has strengthened its security strategies since  2003 after the terror Casablanca attacks and the 2011 terror attack in Marrakech. BCIJ promised to tighten security after the Imlil murders, when at least 23 terrorists were arrested for their involvement in the killing of two Scandinavian tourists near Mount Toubkal in the Atlas Mountains.

Rabat – Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received today in Riyadh Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. According to Maghreb Arab Press, the Moroccan official conveyed a message from King Mohammed VI. King Mohammed VI’s message “touches on bilateral cooperation and the latest developments on the regional scene,” added MAP. The meeting of the Moroccan foreign minister and MBS comes after a recent statement from Bourita, who recently said that Morocco’s relations with Saudi Arabia should be based on mutual respect. The statement was made on the heels of alleged frictions between the two countries over the past two years. Morocco’s decision to remain neutral on the Gulf crisis was not well received in Riyadh, which was expecting Rabat to support the blockade against Qatar.  Though on the surface the relations between the two countries did not suffer any major change, tension between Rabat and Riyadh had been simmering ever since. The first sign of that silent tension was Saudi Arabia’s decision to turn its back on Morocco and support the US-led 2026 World Cup bid.  The last hostile move was from a pro-government television channel, which aired a pro-Polisario documentary against Morocco’s territorial integrity. Following the broadcast, media reports said that Morocco had summoned its ambassadors from Saudi Arabia. Bourita denied the news, and emphasized the strength of the Moroccan-Saudi diplomatic ties. In March, however, Bourita’s appeared to be retracting his previous statement when when asked about the alleged friction between Rabat and Riyadh. In a press conference held in Rabat during the visit of King Abdullah II of Jordan, Bourita said that cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the UAE will be based on reciprocity and mutual respect. “It may happen that we do not agree on certain issues. Foreign policy is a matter of sovereignty, and in Morocco, it is also based on principles and constants,” said Bourita. He added that diplomatic ties should be a “concern on  both sides, and if not, it would be normal for all alternatives to be examined.” It remains to be seen whether this meeting will pave the way towards easing tension between the two long-standing allies and bring them back to normal.

The London-based development organization Developing Markets Associates sent a delegation to Morocco on Monday to investigate business and educational opportunities firsthand. The visit is a sign that even as contractual teachers protest across the country, Morocco’s education sector continues to attract international interest. The delegation, the Morocco Trade and Investment Mission, consists of representatives primarily from education-focused organizations in the United Kingdom. It arrived in Casablanca April 8 and will stay until April 10, after two days of meetings with key government ministries. While the delegation will focus primarily on education, the mission will also investigate other promising areas of Morocco’s private sector, including renewable energy and finance. The itinerary includes meetings with Minister of Education Said Amzazi, the Education Council, and briefings on business from Moroccan officials and big-name corporations like the OCP Group. On Monday, delegates met with a World Bank country representative for Morocco and British Ambassador Thomas Reilly. Morocco and the UK have enjoyed particularly friendly economic relations in recent months. In January, Morocco and Nigeria selected British engineering company Penspen to plan the first phase of the Nigeria-Morocco Pipeline Project. Penspen is just one of many British companies working in Morocco’s energy sector. Overall, more than 200 Moroccan companies export to the UK, and about 100 British companies have set down roots in Morocco, partly as a result of financial incentives from the British government. Morocco imported $993 million in British exports in 2017, according to United Nations data, making up a small but still significant share of British trade. The British under-secretary of state for foreign affairs, Simon McDonald, highlighted this trade during his visit to Morocco in January, calling the partnership a “burgeoning economic relationship.” The delegation offers both Morocco and the UK another opportunity to further build their partnership.

Rabat – When Amnesty International published its latest annual report on Morocco on February 28, Morocco hit back at what it called a “biased,” “unsubstantiated,” and “partial” reading of the reality. Morocco’s challenge of Amnesty’s scathing assessment of the country’s “bleak” human rights record should come as no surprise. Since 2012 at least, when the advocacy group used the same language in its Morocco section, Rabat and Amnesty have been at odds. As far as Morocco is concerned, the group’s reports are reflective of a high school bully whose sole pleasure is found in bullying. Bent on criticizing, it lambasts and bemoans, regardless of improvement. Whatever Morocco does, it is doomed by Amnesty, according to the kingdom’s official response to Amnesty. Just as some are denied presumption of innocence in the court of public opinion, Morocco’s improved democracy in the last decade is “ignored” by Amnesty. For Morocco, the advocacy group is more interested in stressing the handful of persisting negatives than in highlighting the substantial progress since the 2011 Constitution. But what exactly is in Amnesty’s assessment of Morocco’s human rights record? Overall, Amnesty said freedoms have declined in Morocco as the government has cracked down on dissent. The report’s Morocco section also suggested political manipulation of the judiciary. Citing the case of the conviction of journalist Taoufik Bouachrine, the government’s response to the Hirak Rif demonstrations, the silencing of peaceful protests, and the reported crackdown on sub-Saharan migrants, Amnesty spoke of a culture of “blatantly grossly unfair trials” sustained by the use of “unwarranted force to disperse peaceful demonstrations,” especially in the northern Rif and southern provinces. There were also mentions of restrictive measures on the freedom of associations, with Amnesty reproaching Rabat on the closure of the Racines Association, as well as its high-handed approach to other advocacy groups like Amnesty Morocco and the Moroccan Human Rights Association (AMDH). The report gave the impression of a country where nothing has notably budged in decades, despite a near-universal perception that Morocco’s recent reforms—either on women’s rights or religious and political overtures—have heralded an era in which the country seems determined to leave behind the ghosts of the “years of lead.” After Morocco expelled two Amnesty staff members, Jihane Bergaoui, a Morocco “specialist,” wrote on Amnesty’s website: “Morocco’s recent misguided campaign against Amnesty International and other civil society groups has only made it clearer that it is not the regional bastion of progressivism, and human rights protection it wants the international community to believe it is.” Until Morocco reverses its “antagonistic pattern” towards human rights workers and civil society organizations, Bergaoui added, it will not be “the regional human rights model it proclaims to be.” Hardly impressed by the group’s continued calls, Rabat has persisted in defending itself against an organization preaching what it apparently does not follow. In its response to Amnesty’s appeals to free “political prisoners” whose trials were all apparently marked with disregard for due process, Morocco said it was “very surprised” that Amnesty called the Moroccan judicial system a “charade marred by torture complaints and other fair trial violations.” In addition to ignoring the country’s progressive reforms, Amnesty was engaging in “blatant interference” and a “clear violation of the most basic international standards,” Morocco’s information ministry said.  More poignant, however, were Morocco’s complaints against the lack of context and nuance in Amnesty’s report. In questioning Amnesty’s neutrality and lack of context, Rabat was hitting on one of the advocacy organization’s weakest spots. While Amnesty remains widely applauded for its work on the global stage, the organization’s own reportedly dubious neutrality has not gone unnoticed in recent years. In December 2018, an article in France’s Le Monde newspaper reproached Amnesty for its perceived focus on producing theatrical assessments aimed at galvanizing rather than contextual reporting. Le Monde described Amnesty’s reports as hastily produced “market products,” without nuance, published in the “hope of having more funding from donors.” While attractive in its description of the world’s “repressive” and “authoritarian” regimes, Le Monde suggested, Amnesty’s reports would be far less “attractive” if they took time for more thorough analyses of the data they obtained during field trips. Instead, the group is much more invested in “communication performance,” where the goal is to exaggerate in order to shock, more often than not at the expense of a more complex reality. More damning still is a June 2012 report by NGO Monitor. After documenting Amnesty’s finances, NGO Monitor stressed the body’s tendency to bend its data to the will of its biggest donors. Amnesty’s credibility as a leading human-rights advocacy group was tied to the group’s principle of non-acceptance of government funding. The general perception is that, government-funded nonprofits cannot claim independence. Government funding almost always comes with guidelines by which the funded entity is expected to abide. While Amnesty’s guidelines emphasize that the organization does not accept or ask for support from governments so it “can freely criticize,” NGO Monitor documents how Amnesty has received considerable funding from the Netherlands, the US, the UK, and the EU commission. “Breaking its own rules” by accepting external funding from governments and private interest groups, Amnesty has become a mouthpiece for the opinions of donors, according to the report. Beyond trenchant external criticism, the most ruinous findings to date came from Amnesty’s London-based Secretariat. In early February of this year, Amnesty commissioned a wellbeing report after two of its staff members committed suicide. After a thorough review of Amnesty’s workplace culture, the report, which was compiled by KonTerra Group, found a lethal “us versus them dynamic” which it said was the major cause of psychological distress for many Amnesty employees. “Although Amnesty employs many talented and caring individuals, Amnesty as a working environment is often described as ‘toxic,’” the report found. “Organizational culture and management failures are the root cause of most staff wellbeing issues.” Further elements of Amnesty’s “toxic” work environment included complaints of racism, sexism, and bullying. Amnesty, according to KonTerra, suffered “a serious failure of management.” Abuse of power led to some “workers made redundant without due process.” Being called out for a toxic work environment was a major blow to the group’s reputation, raising serious doubts about Amnesty’s founding mission from within the ranks of senior employees. So devastating were the findings, the Guardian reported on February 6, that seven senior members of Amnesty’s London-based Secretariat said they would resign. The report reminded Amnesty that it should not expect governments to take its findings seriously when its own human rights record is just as dubious. “As organizational rifts and evidence of nepotism and hypocrisy become public knowledge they will be used by government and other opponents of Amnesty’s work to undercut or dismiss Amnesty’s advocacy around the world, fundamentally jeopardizing the organization’s mission,” read part of the KonTerra report. Perhaps more critical in the ongoing Amnesty-Morocco arms wrestle, the report had warned that Amnesty needs substantive change in its management philosophy if it is to win back credibility. Whether the Moroccan government’s side of Morocco’s human rights story is reflective of the reality is yet to be established. The burden of proof for Morocco’s emphatic rejection of Amnesty’s findings rests with the Moroccan government. In the meantime, however, as more reports hint at donors using Amnesty as a tool to advance their own political agenda, wrongly painting some governments in a bad light, it will be increasingly hard for journalists, government officials, and academics not to question the organization’s integrity.

Rabat – The National Rally of Independents (RNI) has called on the government to speed up the voting process for draft Law 51.17, which seeks to make French the language of instruction for scientific and technological subjects in Moroccan schools. RNI, a member of the government coalition, issued a statement after a meeting of its political bureau, chaired by its secretary-general, Aziz Akhannouch, on Friday, in which the RNI expressed support for the proposed law. The party’s members said that the draft law is a fundamental reform of Morocco’s education system, emphasizing that it will ensure equal opportunities for all Moroccans. RNI’s political bureau also called for the government to adopt “living languages” in the teaching of scientific subjects, alluding to French. Currently, science is taught in standard Arabic. In the meeting, the party said that their position is not questioning the indisputable importance of Arabic and Tamazight (Berber), Morocco’s two official languages as stated in the Moroccan Constitution. Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi said that the vote on the framework law on education was postponed due to lack of consensus. In a Facebook post, the minister said, “Unfortunately, the consensus reached on the proposed amendments for the third time was lost and the vote was postponed for a later date.” The minister has strongly defended the draft law. Amzazi said the draft law is in line with the Strategic Vision for the Reform of the Moroccan School launched by the Higher Council for Education, Training, and Scientific Research in 2015. Amzazi argued that “some subjects should be taught in a foreign language.” While RNI supports the draft law, the opposition Al Istiqlal (Independence) Party and the Islamist ruling party, the Justice and Development Party (PJD) emphasized the importance of preserving Arabic, as an official language in Morocco, in Moroccan schools. A member of Al Istiqlal and former minister, Mohammed El Khalifa, said that the battle of people who defend the Arabic language is a “battle of existence, which will last forever.” In the 1970s, the Independence Party urged the government to Arabize the educational system. El Khalifa added that French is like any other language “trying with all its might to impose its presence in the countries that it colonized.” The PJD former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane called the members of his party to vote against the bill. Benkirane said that the bill is a serious “betrayal of the principles of the [PJD] and the Constitution and its vision.” Recently, the National Coalition for Arabic Language has been campaigning against the draft law, calling on the government to abolish any action that would remove Arabic from Moroccan schools. The coalition also launched a petition against the draft law, which generated 1,810 signatures.

Rabat – Minister of Energy, Mining, and Sustainable Development Aziz Rabbah has emphasized that Morocco is interested in a joint venture with Germany in the energy sector. “Morocco is a promising destination for German energy investors,” said Rabbah. Rabbah made the remarks in a meeting with German energy officials during the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue on Monday. Rabbah informed German officials of Morocco’s ambition to have, in the coming years, an electricity exchange between Africa and Europe.   The minister stated that although Morocco is a “small” country, it contains plenty of opportunities. He supported his declaration by highlighting Morocco’s continuous reforms to establish a business climate conducive to foreign investments. Germany, a world leader in renewable energies, industrialism, and sustainable development, pays particular attention to forging partnerships with Moroccan enterprises to get into African markets, especially to promote efficient energy solutions, Rabbah noted. Recognizing Germany’s expertise in the sector, Rabbah spoke about Morocco’s potential and its focus on renewable energy. Morocco launched an energy strategy in 2009 to reduce the country’s electricity consumption levels. Morocco’s first center for the development of renewable energies dates back to 1982 and its first wind stations date back to 2002, said Rabbah. Since launching the national energy strategy, Morocco’s reliance on foreign countries for electricity reduced from 98 percent to 92 percent. Khaled Al Hussaini, in charge of Moroccan embassy affairs in Berlin, reviewed cooperation between Germany and Morocco.  Al Hussaini stressed that the various reforms Morocco established, its presence in African countries, and its many free trade agreements all make Morocco suitable as a major destination for German investments. He added that the German Siemens group is active in Morocco’s solar energy program through significant investments in wind energy. The group has industrial units in Tangier and production projects on the Atlantic coast in southern Morocco. The aim of the meeting was to enable a dialogue between German businessmen and Moroccan officials on the business climate and investment opportunities in Morocco. Noor project to generate 35% of Morocco’s electricity needs Morocco’s energy bill is estimated at MAD 70 billion ($7.3 billion) annually, of which MAD 14 billion ($1.5 billion) is spent on subsidies for butane gas. Morocco has a long-term strategy to switch to the use of photovoltaic solar panels in for energy instead of using gas. To do so, Morocco has launched the world’s largest solar energy project, the Noor Solar Plan, in the Sahara desert, 10 kilometers from Ouarzazate. The Noor project has three phases and four parts: Noor I, Noor II, Noor III, and Noor IV. The three solar stations have cost Morocco MAD 24 billion ($2.5 billion).  The projects are set to generate 35 percent of Morocco’s electricity consumption by 2020. The German Development Bank (KfW) has helped finance the project with an estimated MAD 659 million ($68.5 million) loan. Morocco also received a $400 million loan from the World Bank and $216 million from the Clean Technology Fund.

Rabat – The Institute of the Arab World (IMA) in Paris is putting on an exhibition titled “Football in the Arab World: The Revolution of the Round Ball.”  Through eleven iconic stories, whether centered on a player, a match, a movement, or a team, the exhibition highlights football and the special role it plays in the Arab world. The exhibition also examines the impact of the Arab world on football. The exhibition includes a tribute to Moroccan national football legend Haj Larbi Ben Barek. Ben Barek began his career in 1928, quickly rising to fame in the French league. He is widely recognized as the first African footballer to gain success in Europe.  Ben Barek was also the first football coach for Morocco’s national team after it gained independence from France. IMA says it intends to pay “tribute to this extraordinary character, who illustrated the greatness of Moroccan sport.”  Moroccan outlet H24INFO quoted the president of IMA, Jack Lang, as saying, “In this extraordinary history of football in the Arab World, Morocco occupies a distinct place, both by great players, including Larbi Ben Barek, who remained in collective memory, but also by its clubs and the commitments made, even today, in favor of this discipline.” According to IMA, visitors will discover through an immersive experience, like a player entering a football field, key moments and people in football history, such as Ben Barek, the team of the National Liberation Front (FLN) of Algeria, the rise of women’s football in Jordan, and the city of Cairo as a football capital.  As well as displaying iconic objects from the football world, such as balls and trophies from world cups, IMA offers several interactive experiences, such as allowing visitors to “compose their ideal football team virtually and to slip into the skin of a sports commentator.” French Minister of Foreign Affairs Jean Yves Le Drian; IMA President Jack Lang; and the president of the French Football Federation (FFF), Noel Le Graet inaugurated the event on Monday night. Abdellatif Zaghnoun, director general of Morocco’s state investment institution (CDG), one of the Moroccan partners of this exhibition, and Saad Bendourou, the deputy head of mission at the Moroccan embassy in France, attended to represent Morocco. The exhibition, which will be open from April 10 to July 21, comes amidst public anticipation for the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt which begins in June.

Rabat – Former Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki commented this weekend on the attack on Tripoli by Libyan General Khalifa Haftar, saying it is a final attempt to destroy the spirit of the Arab Spring and a threat not only to the security of Libya, but to Tunisia and Algeria as well. Haftar’s advance on Tripoli is the latest installment in Libya’s ongoing crisis. Libya has been plagued by instability since 2011 when the Arab Spring sparked a civil war and the death of long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi created a power vacuum.   On April 4, Haftar announced his intention to take over Tripoli in a voice recording circulated online. The Libyan National Army (LNA), which Haftar commands, advanced on the capital of Libya that day.    Tripoli is the seat of the internationally-recognized government, the Government of National Accord (GNA). The GNA Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj accused Haftar of launching a coup and scrambled to mobilize militias under GNA to launch a counterattack. In a Facebook post on Saturday, Marzouki expressed his concern for the people of Libya and fear that Haftar would destroy Tripoli. He said the attack on Tripoli targets not only the internationally-recognized GNA but also the very spirit of the Arab Spring. According to Marzouki, Haftar’s actions threaten both Tunisia and Algeria by destabilizing the region and threatening the uprising in Algeria. Algeria is currently in the midst of country-wide protests which have succeeded in forcing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to resign and are now calling for the removal of all symbols of his regime. Marzouki’s fears may be based on Haftar’s previous comments. In September 2018, Al Jazeera published a video of Haftar threatening to “spread war” to Algeria, increasing tensions between Algeria and Haftar’s forces. But Marzouki does not believe that the threat comes from Haftar alone. The world’s great powers are conspiring with the “Arab axis of evil,” led by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt to encourage Haftar’s attack on Tripoli, Marzouki told Al Jazeera. He emphasized the need for Arab people to rely only on themselves to retain their rights, saying the Western powers have no concern for Arab freedoms. Haftar’s rise to prominence Khalifa Haftar, commander marshall of the LNA, holds significant influence in Libya, with his base of power in the east of Libya. The 75-year-old military man has presented himself as a solution to Libya’s violence and instability. But, many within and outside Libya fear that if he takes power, Libya will quickly become an authoritarian state.   Haftar, who returned to Libya from exile in 2011 after the fall of Gaddafi, kept a relatively low profile until 2014 when he launched Operation Dignity. The military operation sought to cleanse the country of terrorist militias. He quickly became popular in Benghazi, eastern Libya, for his role in driving out Islamist groups, in particular the Al Qaeda affiliate Ansar al-Sharia. After a bloody three-year battle, Haftar’s forces took full control of Benghazi in July 2017. Following this success, he rapidly expanded his sphere of control in eastern Libya. The LNA seized control of Derna, the last foothold of opposition in the east, in 2018 and Fezzan, an oil-rich city in the southwest, in January 2019. The UN, taken aback by the LNA’s rapid movement south, mediated a meeting between Haftar and Prime Minister al-Sarraj in Abu Dhabi in February. At the meeting, both parties agreed to hold elections before the end of the year as well as a national conference from April 14 to 16 to discuss a timetable for elections and move toward the unification of the country. However, Clingendael Institute researcher Jalel Harchaoui said that it is likely that Haftar only agreed to the proposed elections in order to buy time for his long-planned attack on Tripoli. International involvement   Just before the launch of this most recent military campaign, Haftar met with King Salman in Saudi Arabia. Egypt and the UAE have also been named as backers of Hafter. France has also provided tacit support for Haftar and the LNA, while Italy backs the GNA, leaving the two European countries at odds. Both see Libya as the key to stopping waves of migration coming into Europe from sub-Saharan Africa. Haftar understands that migration is key to his international recognition, and, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations’ senior policy fellow Mattia Toaldo, Haftar intends to play on the issue to garner support and legitimacy. In response to the invasion of Tripoli, the UK called an emergency UN Security Council meeting on Friday. The meeting resulted in a statement which called on Haftar to “halt all military movements,” expressed concerns about the escalation of violence throughout the country, and promised that those responsible for the conflict will be held accountable.   Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has previously expressed Morocco’s support for a Libya-led solution moderated by the UN. According to Bourita, a stable Libya is essential to the security of the Maghreb.

Rabat – Scores of Algerians took to the street on Tuesday in protest against the appointment of the president of the Council of the Nation, Abdelkader Bensalah, as Algeria’s interim president. Algerians have been protesting across multiple cities since February 22, and last week their protests resulted in the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Local news agencies reported that protesters are rallying in rejection of Bensalah. Protesters are demanding that Bensalah, a 77-year-old loyalist of Bouteflika’s, also leave, calling for total regime change. As called for by Article 102 of the Algerian Constitution, which states that the leader of the upper house of Parliament will take over in a caretaker capacity after the presidency becomes vacant, the Algerian Parliament appointed Bensalah as interim president. Bensalah will take office for a maximum of 90 days until new elections are held. Some Algerians, including the head of Algeria’s Justice and Development Front Party, Lakhdar Ben Khellaf, oppose Bensalah because he was born Moroccan. Ben Khellaf stated earlier that “the condition for a [leader] occupying the post of President of the Republic, is that he must have the Algerian nationality of origin. And he [Bensalah] had another nationality until 1964 during which he had obtained Algerian nationality.”

Rabat – A nurse at Ibn Sina University of Rabat has blamed the deaths of several prematurely-born infants on Saturday, April 6, on a power outage. The babies were relying on medical ventilators at the hospital’s Souissi maternity ward to breathe, and the power outage allegedly caused their deaths, according to the nurse’s Facebook post. The hospital did not respond to Morocco World News’s calls. The director of the hospital, Said Tayer, according to one report, claimed only three died and denied that the babies’ deaths were related to the power outage.  Tayer said the power outage took place at 7:00 am on Saturday and lasted for only seven minutes. He stated the hospital’s standby power generator kicked in immediately and can supply power for 30 minutes in cases of blackouts. According to another report, Tayer said four premature babies died, and each weighed between 600 grams and 1 kilogram. The normal weight of a newborn at full term ranges from 2.5 to 4 kilograms. Tayer said all the babies were in incubators and died because of their critical state of health.  However, Lehbib Kerroum, a member of the Moroccan Network for the Defense of Health Rights, questioned Tayer’s claim. “How come four deaths happened at the same time?” Ascribing the death of the premature babies to the power outage, Kerroum described the conditions of the hospital as “catastrophic.”  He said a “black report” was carried out last year, but the report’s recommendations have not yet been published.

Rabat – Prominent Hirak activist Nasser Zefzafi has started another hunger strike after the Casablanca Court of Appeals upheld the heavy sentences on all Hirak activists on Friday, April 5. The activists are serving sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years. Ahmed Zefzafi, Nasser’s father, announced on Monday that he received a message from his son announcing he had sewn his lips. “Having this battle (stitching the lips) resulted from my faith in my right to freedom and rejection of the militarization and assassination and abduction of children and Riffians.” Zefzafi, who is serving 20 years, added that he decided to go on hunger strike to condemn the refusal of the prison administration to give him his medical file. Mohammed El Haki, a Hirak activist who received 15 years in prison, also stitched his lips to go on a hunger strike. On Friday, April 5, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals upheld the heavy sentences handed down by a Casablanca court against 54 Hirak activists in June 2018. The court’s ruling received backlash on social media from people who have been demanding the release of all Hirak activists. The government imprisoned the activists after they participated in unauthorized protests. In addition to Zefzafi, three other Hirak activists received 20 years in prison. The court’s ruling resulted in protests in the northern city of Al Hoceima, where the Hirak protests broke out in 2016 and 2017. At the time, protesters condemned social disparities and the death of Mohcine Fikri, a fishmonger who was crushed in a garbage truck in 2016 while he was trying to retrieve confiscated goods. Zefzafi, along with other Hirak activists, has gone on several hunger strikes throughout his imprisonment to condemn alleged torture and mistreatment in the prison.

Rabat – On Sunday, April 7, inhabitants of the city of Al Hoceima, the main city of northern Morocco’s Rif region, took to the streets by the hundreds to demand the release of Nasser Zefzafi, the leader of the popular mass protests in 2016 and 2017 known as Hirak. Waving Amazigh (Berber) flags, protesters chanted slogans such as “Death instead of humiliation,” “The state is corrupt,” and “We want prisoners freed!” Incarcerated in the Casablanca Oukacha prison since May 2017, Nasser Zefzafi lost his appeal on April 5 at the Court of Appeals in Casablanca, which upheld his 20-year sentence. A Casablanca court found Hirak activists guilty on charges of “attacks on the internal and external security of the State, violence with premeditation,” and “disturbing the public order.” The court handed down sentences from 1 to 20 years for 54 Hirak activists in June 2018. Human rights organization Amnesty International deemed the guilty verdicts “unfair” and said they must be overturned. Three other prominent Hirak activists, including Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid, like Zefzafi, received 20 years in prison. Hirak leaders like Zakaria Adehchour, Mohamed Haki, and Mohamed Bouhenouch received 15-year sentences. The journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui received a 3-year prison sentence on a charge related to national security threats. Human Rights Watch described the charges against Mehdaoui as “dubious.”  The activists appealed the sentences, but Zefzafi refused to attend an appeal hearing in January 2019, claiming there was an “absence of the minimum requirements for a fair trial.”  On April 3, 24 members of the European Parliament and an MP from the Council of Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly addressed a letter to Morocco’s justice minister Mohamed Aujjar, calling on him to free Nasser Zefzafi and “all the prisoners of the popular movement of the Rif.” The letter also expressed concern for Zefzafi’s deteriorating health and the distance between the court in Casablanca and the prisoners’ families in Al Hoceima.  Moroccans protested outside the court to decry the ruling and call for the immediate release of the Hirak activists.  The Hirak protests broke out in October 2016 following the tragic death of a fishmonger, Mohcine Fikri, who was crushed in a garbage truck when he attempted to retrieve his confiscated merchandise.

Rabat – The Algerian Parliament has appointed the president of the upper house, Abdelkader Besalaha, as interim president following President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s resignation. The interim president will take office for a maximum of 90 days until new elections take place, announced Algeria’s national television channel. Bensalah will serve in accordance with Article 102 of the Algerian Constitution. Article 102 says that the president of the upper house “shall assume the functions of the head of state for 90 days maximum during which presidential elections shall be held and the head of state appointed.” On Saturday, the Council of the Nation, the Algerian upper house, said that “it was decided to hold a meeting of the two chambers of Parliament” on Tuesday to name the interim president. The appointment is expected to escalate tension between the current government and protesters, who are demanding reforms and a sweeping change to those in power. Demonstrators, who have continued to protest even after Bouteflika’s resignation on April 2, are calling for the whole system to leave. Other Algerians argued that Bensalah cannot serve as an interim president because he was born a Moroccan. Recently, the president of Algeria’s Justice and Development Front Party, Lakhdar Benkhellaf, said that Bensalah has a “problem with his nationality of origin. The condition for a [leader] occupying the post of President of the Republic, is that he must have the Algerian nationality of origin. And he had another nationality until 1964 during which he had obtained Algerian nationality.” The protests, which are mostly led by young people, are also drawing the attention of Algerians residing abroad. On Saturday, AFP quoted an Algerian woman who decided to come back home to join the protests. “Since February 22, I have not been able to sleep, I am addicted to the internet to follow the events 24 hours a day and do not miss anything on social networks,” Algerian citizen Chahrazade Kaci said. Kaci said that she has been “exiled” in the UK for 25 years.

Rabat – The end of the 34th Marathon des Sables’ (MDS) third stage marks the halfway point for the world’s longest desert race hosted in Morocco. Nearly 800 competitors have spent the last three days racing through the dunes to established bivouacs, where they spend the night preparing for the next day. So far, runners have covered over 100 kilometers and have faced sand dunes, stony plains, rocky valleys, and the unbearably hot desert sun. Of the 783 competitors that began the race on Sunday, April 7, only 773 have made it this far. The third stage was 37.1 kilometers long, and runners survived the hottest temperatures yet—with the heat hitting as high as 30.8 degrees celsius.  With nearly 150 kilometers of the ultra-marathon still to go, runners were able to rest at the third bivouac, located roughly 15 kilometers west of the village of Taouz. The results of the third stage have been nearly unchanged from the last two, with a consistent display of prowess from Rachid and Mohamed El Morabity, who have ranked first and second respectively. After dominating the third stage, the brothers are safely sitting on first and second place overall. “I’m delighted to have made a difference. I increased the gap and have enough experience to manage tomorrow’s Long Stage,” Rachid El Morabity said. This stage also saw the return of a completely Moroccan men’s top five, an identical finish to the first stage. Stage Three: Men’s Top Five Like the El Morabity brothers, Dutch runner Ragna Debats has been the unchallenged victor of the contest, finishing first for her third time in a row. However, even as she dominated the third stage, Debats made it clear after crossing the finishing line that the day hadn’t been the easiest. “My stomach was feeling bad, but more importantly, I had to run with a crooked backpack—it’s been extremely hard,” Debats said. Despite the difficulties, Debats dominated the desert heat by finishing nearly an hour and a half ahead of Moroccan runner Aziz Raji, who placed second. The third stage’s top five finishers were the same as the second stage’s, with just Raji and British runner Gemma Game overtaking American runner Meghan Hicks. The end of the third stage brings the halfway point of the marathon. The time it has taken runners to finish each stage is added up and the total time is what affects a competitors overall ranking. Marathon des Sables: Overall Top Five  Mens Womens Other than its nickname the “Long Stage,” complete details about the fourth stage have not yet been released. The race is expected to have an eventful staggered start, with the top 50 men and top five women starting later in the day. The main pack of runners is expected to begin the stage at around 8 a.m., Thursday, April 11. Morocco World News will continue to provide updates on the marathon throughout the week.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit has announced that the lists of draftees summoned to fill the census forms for the 2019 obligatory military service have been finalized. The minister said in a statement published by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) on Monday that the lists were finalized by the ad hoc central committee during a meeting held on April 2. The minister, according to the statement, advises  young people aged 19 to 25 to fill out the form on the website tajnid.ma upon receipt of a notice from local administrative authorities. The statement added that the minister also instructs those who were summoned to check their names in the lists of recruits on the website. The minister suggests that  young people who were not summoned for the service this year and wish to enlist, including young women, submit the form. The minister also invited Moroccan expats willing to perform the military service to fill out the form. “Young people could get information related to the military service from the nearest local administrative authorities or from the information service set up in prefectures, provinces, and district prefectures, or from the website,” the minister said. In February, King Mohammed VI asked the government to recruit 10,000 Moroccans in the mandatory military service in 2019. The number of conscripts will increase to 15,000 in 2020. Men aged 19 to 25 would be subject to a 12-month military service, in accordance to Law 44.18. However, people over the age of 25 who were eligible for an exemption can still be called up until the age of 40 if the reason for their exemption is no longer relevant. Many Moroccans expressed concerns over the law, with some saying that the would not be equally applied.  Some Moroccans have said that all young people, including those of wealthy families, should be subject to the law. King Mohammed VI, however, reassured the public that the law will be applicable to all citizens from all social classes.

Rabat – The president of the Arab World Institute (IMA), Jack Lang, expressed his “absolute support” for the Maghreb joint bid to include couscous on UNESCO’s intangible heritage list. “I am very pleased that the Maghreb countries have come together to nominate this iconic dish that is inspiring millions of people from around the world,” Lang told the Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The former French minister of culture added that “it is fantastic that the countries and peoples of the Maghreb have come together on a cultural issue.” In March, UNESCO representatives from Morocco, Mauritania, Algeria, and Tunisia submitted a joint bid, calling on UNESCO to include the traditional dish on UNESCO’s heritage list. Morocco’s Permanent Representative at UNESCO, Zohour Alaoui, emphasized “the knowledge and the know-how of the practices related to the production and the consumption of couscous.” She added that the move comes in an effort to recognize “the tremendous wealth the Berber culture [has] transmitted, not only to the Maghreb countries but also in Africa, the Mediterranean, and today in the world as a whole. ” Recently, a “couscous war” broke out between Morocco and its eastern neighbor, Algeria. In December 2018, former Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia insinuated that Morocco has wrongly claimed  couscous as its own. “A neighboring country has taken credit for couscous,” said the former official. Ouyahia continued: “We have to prove them wrong. We are not saying that couscous is Algerian, but Maghrebi. We have to promote Algerian couscous, though.” The spokesperson of the government, Mustapha El Khalfi, reacted to the Algerian claims, emphasizing that “everyone knows the origins of couscous.” He added that “no one can deny” the origins of the traditional dish, implying that couscous is Moroccan through and through.

Rabat – Dozens of contractual teachers are back on the streets beginning a three-day strike in protest of the government’s refusal to meet their demands. The strike, planned to take place from April 8 to 10, was organized by the Coordination of Teachers Forced into Contracts (CNPCC). It is in response to the Ministry of Education’s threats to dismiss teachers and cut pay if they do not return to their jobs. The threats have only led to unions promising to double their protesting efforts, some going as far as to claim they will continue to strike for the rest of the year. “If the government doesn’t work with us to find a solution, then we will be forced to protest all year,” Aziz Njakh, a contractual teacher from the city of Sidi Slimane, 100 kilometers northeast of Rabat, told Morocco World News. “This isn’t a personal problem, it’s a national one. It is the problem of every person in Morocco and that is why we will continue to protest until we find a solution.” The three-day strike marks the second week of demonstrations in April—the current round of protests began in February. The contractual teachers are protesting the government’s refusal to eliminate the use of annual contracts. The documents give contractual teachers the same salary as teachers permanently on the government payroll, but offer a smaller pension and less job security, which are the two main reasons many have been protesting. Njakh spent 13 years teaching in a private school before becoming a contractual teacher, a transition he says was incredibly difficult. “There is no comparison between the two jobs, being a contractual teacher is so much worse,” Njakh said. He later mentioned the difference of job security, pension, supplies, infrastructure, and treatment. Despite the continued protests, the Ministry of Education has remained resolute in its decision to avoid giving in to all of the contractual teachers’ demands. At the end of March, Minister of Education Said Amzazi announced the government’s plans to begin firing contractual teacher protestors. After receiving a warning letter last week stating that his contract would be terminated if he continued protesting, Nabril Chamssi took the nearly 700-kilometer trip from Sidi Ifni north along the Atlantic coast to Rabat to take part in this week’s protest. The 28-year-old English teacher was accompanied by more than 150 of his colleagues from Sidi Ifni—many of them having received the same warning. “I felt terrible receiving that letter because I’ve spent years studying and have put so much effort into teaching and now here they are telling us that we have to either work under terrible or conditions or be unemployed,” Chamssi told Morocco World News. Chamssi has less than 60 days to return to the classroom before his contract is terminated. But the looming deadline has done nothing to stop Chamssi. “We have been protesting for too long to accept half of our terms,” Chamssi said. “If all of us go back to our jobs than all that we have done will have been in vain.”

Rabat – The director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said that the organization is ready to support the action plans Morocco is implementing in the health sector. Ghebreyesus made the remarks in a working session with the health minister, Anass Doukkali, and the WHO regional director for the eastern Mediterranean, Ahmed Salim Saif Al-Mandhari, on the eve of the celebration of World Health Day in Rabat, under the theme “Health for all and by all.” Ghebreyesus stressed that the WHO will support Morocco in the areas of training of health professionals, universal health coverage, health sector governance, and sharing of good practices. He noted that thanks to practical measures over the years, Morocco has made considerable progress in health, as many indicators are improving, such as on maternal and child health, on emergency management, and on communicable diseases.  While highlighting Morocco’s reforms, Ghebreyesus underlined that Morocco still faces challenges in the health sector. Ghebreyesus also stressed the need for optimal human resources management in all regions of the kingdom. For his part, Doukkali expressed satisfaction with WHO’s choice to celebrate World Health Day in Morocco, considering the event an opportunity to highlight Morocco’s achievements in the health sector at all levels.

Rabat – Tensions are again running high between Morocco and its Emirati and Saudi allies following geopolitical moves that have concerned Moroccan diplomatic circles.  According to widely circulating news in both Moroccan and Mauritania media circles, Riyadh has recently decided to bolster diplomatic ties with Mauritania. Citing “well connected” diplomatic sources, news articles in recent days talked of how Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are increasingly turning their gaze to Nouakchott to sabotage Moroccan interests.  “Despite remaining a committed ally, Rabat is deeply attached to its independence,” a Moroccan diplomatic source told Maghreb Intelligence.  The paper, which days earlier had reported that the UAE and Saudi Arabia were investing in economic and military cooperation with Mauritania, was now announcing a Saudi and Emirati-sponsored “media conspiracy” to tarnish Morocco’s reputation internationally. In most cases, the reports were vague and tentative.  Based on the timeline provided, however, one perceived mark of simmering tensions may have been Morocco’s Nasser Bourita’s first muscular public statement on lack of reciprocity from Saudis and Emiratis in their relations with Morocco. Speaking on the issue at a press conference on March 28 for the first time since reports of friction between Morocco and its Saudi and Emirati allies, Bourita appeared to rebuke the two Gulf countries’ perceived refusal to uphold principles which Morocco considers the basis of a working relationship.  Bourita spoke of “constants” and “reciprocal loyalty,” suggesting that Rabat could not indefinitely provide its diplomatic good-will to allies that did not respect their alliance.  Alliances, Bourita suggested, work best when partners takes each other’s principles seriously. Successful partnerships take into accounts all aspects of the relationship, instead of cooperating just when it feels convenient. “It may happen that we do not agree on certain issues. Foreign policy is a matter of sovereignty, and in Morocco, it is also based on principles and constants,” the Moroccan minister said.  He added the most critical part of his statement by explaining that “cooperation must include all important matters of the MENA region” and that preserving diplomatic ties should “be a concern on both sides.” If not, Bourita warned, “It would be normal for all alternatives to be examined.” Whether Mauritania is the “alternative” to Morocco for Riyadh and Abu Dhabi is yet to be established.  For now, though, Rabat’s usage of strong language suggests that the many “diplomatic sources” quoted in Moroccan media may have put their fingers on an actual rise of diplomatic temperatures between Rabat and its two Gulf allies. According to one such source quoted in various outlets, Bourita’s “sudden anger” on March 28 stemmed from Riyadh’s and Abu Dhabi’s increase investments in port and military facilities in Mauritania. The two countries, the source explained, want “greater cooperation” with Nouakchott, “at the expense of Morocco.” Included in the coordination are projects of Saudi military bases and a UAE-funded project to enhance port facilities in Nouadhibou, considered a major and growing Mauritanian business hub, according to Maghreb Intelligence.  While there are no details available about the projects, the newspaper explained that realization would be a major blow to Morocco’s regional and continental aspirations. Reconstruction work at Nouadhibou is an insult to Morocco’s ultramodern Atlantic Dakhla and Tangier Med projects, two initiatives Morocco counts on to cement its rising reputation as the future African leader for port transactions. None of the countries mentioned in the reports have issued a statement to refute or confirm the news.  However, judging by the recent tumultuous relations between Rabat and its Gulf allies, and their decision to remain silent in the first days of reports of gradual friction, it is hard to sideline current reports as baseless rumors.

Rabat – Retired Algerian Major-General Abdelaziz Medjahed used a recent interview with Radio Algerienne to criticize the Moroccan government. Invited to comment on the situation in Algeria after the resignation of Abdelaziz Bouteflika Medjahed said that the “threats are many and varied, because we live in an unstable and a dangerous world.” As an example, the former senior military officer referred to Morocco as an enemy of Algeria.  He then accused Morocco of “violating the resolutions of the United Nations and going outside of their limits to attack a Sahrawi territory.” According to Medjahed, Algeria has to choose friends, allies, and partners to isolate its enemies after the crisis. Without commenting on Algeria’s actions in the conflict, Medjahed said that “there are those who want to harm the Algerian state from when we gained independence to the present.” He continued, “They think we are divided, but it must be proved that Algerians are united together to deter all external threats.” It is not the first time Medjahed, or other former Algerian officials, has criticized the Moroccan state. In 2018, the general accused Morocco of drug trafficking and providing Algeria with “all the negative consequences of the consumption” of drugs for young Algerian people. The former official downplayed Algeria’s role in the Western Sahara conflict for years. The Moroccan government has emphasized the importance of Algeria’s involvement to finding a mutually acceptable and agreed upon political solution to the dispute. The Algerian government is, however, taking part in roundtable discussions on the conflict. Dialogue initiative Despite Morocco’s firm position that Algeria should take responsibility in the conflict, Algeria believes that the solution should be found between Morocco and Polisario. The Algerian government also ignored Morocco’s dialogue initiative in November 2018 from King Mohammed VI, who called on Algeria to engage in a frank and direct dialogue to break the stalemate hindering Maghreb unity. Amid Algeria’s silence on the Moroccan initiative, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita summoned the Algerian ambassador in Rabat last year to ask him for his country’s position on the King’s offer. The meeting did not result in any statement from Algeria. The minister also issued a statement saying that the royal initiative “stems from a sincere desire to create a framework for direct and inclusive bilateral dialogue to resolve all disputes between the two countries.”

Rabat – Sahrawis have gone on a march from the Tindouf camps to Rabouni in Algeria in a protest against their living conditions and Polisario’s restrictions inside the camps. The protests took place during the weekend in the Tindouf camps. Protesters went to Rabouni, near Tindouf, on dozens of vehicles, chanting slogans that call for liberty and dignity.  This comes a day after a 33-year-old Polisario soldier presented himself to the Moroccan defense line in Western Sahara on Saturday. The soldier, who arrived wearing a military uniform and carrying his gun, expressed his will to join the motherland, escaping from years of living in inhumane conditions. Moroccan military sources told Le360 that the soldier, named Sidahmed, was transferred to the Moroccan Royal Gendarmerie in Smara, a city in Western Sahara, as stipulated in the Moroccan army’s procedures for Polisario deserters. Last week, a group of 12 soldiers presented themselves to a Moroccan Royal Armed Forces (FAR) unit near Mahbess, north-eastern Western Sahara. The soldiers belonged to a group of 19 Moroccan soldiers Polisario has held in custody 100 kilometers south of Mahbess in the Tifariti area, alleging that they are drug dealers, according to the former Polisario leader Mustapha Salama.  Many former Polisario members have returned to Morocco from the Tindouf camps in Algeria, including Yenja Khattat, current president of the Dakhla region, and Bachir Dkhil, one of the founders of the Polisario Front. Sahrawis have conducted several protests against poor living conditions inside the Tindouf Camps. In the most recent protest, they conducted a sit-in at the United Nations Square in Geneva on March 17, to denounce the recruitment of children in the Tindouf Camps into armies and terrorist groups by Polisario.

Rabat – US Under Secretary for Political Affairs David Hale has arrived in Morocco for a working visit. The US official had his preliminary meeting with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita today, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The official’s working visit will continue until April 10.  The news agency added that Bourita and Hale discussed how to strengthen the strategic dialogue between both countries. The Western Sahara conflict will be at the heart of Hale’s meetings, a source told Moroccan news outlet Le 360. The Moroccan state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press has not posted any update on Hale’s visit to Morocco. Hale took part in a meeting between UN Secretary-General Guterres and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in October 2018 to discuss the conflict over the region. Prior to the meeting, Morocco’s Ambassador to the US Lalla Joumala also met with Hale in Washington, D.C., to discuss the mandate of the UN peacekeeping mission, known as MINURSO, before its renewal on October 31. In addition to the conflict, Hale is expected to discuss Moroccan-US bilateral ties as part of the strategic dialogue between the two countries. The US-Morocco Strategic Dialogue will take place in Washington later this year, Pompeo and Bourita agreed in September 2018. The US-Morocco Strategic Dialogue was first launched September 13, 2012. During the meeting, Moroccan and US senior officials discuss regional and international issues, including the economy, politics, security, and cultural affairs. Morocco’s security partnership is one of its strongest cooperations with the US. The US and Morocco cooperate heavily on counter-terrorism. From March 16 to April 7, Morocco’s southern region hosted US senior army officials, who provided military training with the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces and military units from around the world. The joint exercise, called African Lion, included a simulated raid against violent extremists. The African Lion military exercise brought military units from countries such as Canada, Spain, Senegal, and Tunisia.

Rabat – The Moroccan army has opened an investigation to look into instances of bribery by Fresenius Medical Care between 2006 and 2012, said the major general of the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces (FAR) on Friday. The investigation will involve hearings of all those involved in the case, including a doctor who worked in the military health service at the time. According to FAR, the investigation is acting on the presumption that the corrupt acts would have tainted public markets. The decision to open an investigation comes after a report published by the United States justice department on March 29 which announced that Fresenius would pay approximately $231 million to the US government in a settlement in response to accusations that the company had bribed officials in numerous countries to secure contracts. Fresenius paid over $84.7 million to the justice department as a penalty to keep the department from prosecuting and another $147 million to the US Security and Exchange Commission to settle civil charges. The US found Fresenius to have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by participating in corrupt schemes to obtain business in 13 countries, including Morocco, Angola, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Spain. The company profited from illegal activities by more than $140 million. In addition to paying $231 million, as part of the settlement, Fresenius admitted to bribing officials in foreign countries from 2006 to 2012 as well as failing to maintain proper internal accounting controls. “We are pleased to have concluded these investigations and to have resolved the issues that we identified and voluntarily disclosed to the U.S. authorities,” said Fresenius CEO Rice Powell in a statement. In Morocco, Fresenius bribed state officials to obtain a contract to develop kidney dialysis centers at Moroccan state-owned military hospitals. Fresenius paid the bribes through a sham commission which promised 10% the contracts’ value to relevant state officials. The company disguised the payouts as bonuses to Fresenius employees. According to US court documents, a “top executive of FMC Morocco” and a “Moroccan official nephrologist” are guilty of developing the circuit of corruption which allowed for the bribery to occur. Although the US documents do not mention the officials by name, a Le Desk investigation pointed to Zouhir Oualim as the military official. Professor Zouhir Oualim, who has since left the army for the private sector, was the head of the nephrology department at Rabat Military Hospital at the time and in charge of developing the project with Fresenius. The FAR’s investigation will look into the individual’s alleged involvement through its hearings. As of yet, it is unclear what actions FAR or the Moroccan government will take if their investigations reveal the same corruption found by the US justice department. For their part, Fresenius has agreed to retain an independent monitor for a minimum of two years to prevent future corruption.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Library in Rabat inaugurated a solar power plant on Thursday, which will provide the library with up to 40 percent of its energy needs and reinforce its commitment to clean energy. The solar power plant is the fruit of a partnership with the BMCE Bank Foundation for Education and the Environment. The BMCE Bank Foundation fully funded the project, which cost MAD 2.6 million ($270,000).  The plant includes 600 solar panels covering an area of 2,400 square meters, the installation of solar inverters, a DC junction box, and a remote monitoring system. Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the power plant, Minister of Culture and Communication Mohamed Laaraj commended the partnership between BMCE Foundation and the national library.  The public-private partnership reinforces the foundation and the ministry’s commitment to the preservation of the environment and energy and the promotion of cultural spaces, he said. The BMCE Bank Foundation was founded in 1995, and since then, 4 percent of the BMCE bank’s gross profit has gone towards the foundation which works to improve education and environment sustainability, not only in Morocco but other African countries.  The president of the BMCE Bank Foundation, Leila Meziane, echoed Laaraj’s statements, saying that the partnership reflects the common values and goals of both institutions. The national library’s director, Mohamed El Ferrane, said that the construction of the solar plant aims to reduce the library’s energy consumption and optimize its resources. He added that, thanks to the project, the library has taken a big step towards becoming green.

Rabat – Dutch-Palestinian supermodel Gigi Hadid sported a hat that Moroccan milliner Youssef Lahlou designed on Sunday night to Marc Jacob’s wedding along with her sister and fellow supermodel Bella. Hadid paired the black Youssef Lahlou hat with a green tailored suit and a sheer top for an elegant evening look. “Gigi Hadid‘s style is simple and sophisticated. Not only she is beautiful but she is also very nice. To see her wearing one of my creations today is obviously a moment of pride for me!” Youssef Lahlou told Moroccan outlet Le360.     @gigihadid in my PANAMA BOA silver hat for @themarcjacobs ceremony. Styled by @mimi #gigihadid A post shared by  Youssef Lahlou (@yousseflahlou__) on Apr 7, 2019 at 1:25am PDT It is not the first time an A-lister has worn the Moroccan designer’s hats; American singers Usher and Janelle Monae have also repped custom Lahlou headwear. The Casablanca-born designer is still fresh on the fashion scene, only having launched his namesake hat brand in January 2017, making his accomplishments so far especially notable. Within three days of Lahlou’s launching, Vogue Arabia dubbed his the “breakout brand to watch.” Hat design was not Lahlou’s original passion; he moved to New York initially to study film making. His short film, “The Tablecloth,” was featured at prestigious International Film Festivals before he found his calling for design in New York. All of Lahlou’s hats are painstakingly handcrafted, and every single one is unique, with some of them taking up to to 12 months to complete. Prices for Lahlou’s one of a kind pieces start at $785. Lahlou told fashion magazine Buro247 that he hopes to expand his brand to more than hats in the future, to also design shoes, bags, and even furniture. He added that even though his current work does not use Morocco as an inspiration, it “absolutely will in the future.”

Rabat – The Moroccan League for Citizenship and Human Rights (LMCDH) has filed a complaint against the Moroccan government to the international Committee of Experts on the Application of the Recommendations concerning Teaching Personnel (CEART).  As the government and teacher unions continue to argue over the situation of contractual teachers after six weeks of strikes and sit-ins, the LMCDH is calling for the CEART, jointly founded by the International Labor Organization (ILO) and UNESCO (the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), to intervene.  The LMCDH, an NGO, declared in a statement on April 4 that it filed a complaint against the Moroccan government for not following UNESCO’s recommendations on the status of teachers. LMCDH argues that Morocco is not applying the the 1966 ILO/UNESCO Recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers, particularly Articles 45 and 46. Article 45 stipulates, “Stability of employment and security of tenure in the profession are essential in the interests of education as well as in that of the teacher and should be safeguarded even when changes in the organization of or within a school system are made.” Article 46 sets out, “Teachers should be adequately protected against arbitrary action affecting their professional standing or career.” LMCDH accuses the Moroccan government not only of not following the recommendations but also of abusing power and “distorting the right to peaceful protest.”  The complaint comes in response to statements by Minister of Education Said Amzazi that he would fire teachers and cut their pay if they did not return to work. The president of LMCDH, Driss Sedraoui, holds the Moroccan government accountable for the current education situation. He especially blames the government for failing to find a mutual agreement and for making “unilateral” decisions.  LMCDH has also failed a complaint against Said Amzazi to the Rabat Court of Cassation, accusing him of abusing power and using “unconstitutionally sweeping power” to threaten contractual teachers.  The NGO is calling on syndicates, labor unions, groups, and civil society associations—especially parents’ associations, to “create a popular front to join forces in the battle to protect the public education sector.” Six successive weeks have gone by since contractual teachers took to the streets on February 20, in commemoration of the Arab Spring’s 20 February movement, in protest of  the government’s failure to meet their demands for job stability, integration into the public sector, and abolishing employment under fixed-term contracts.  Contractual teachers, who say the government has ignored their demands, have been striking for weeks. Some, like MP Omar Balafrej, stated that politicians do not want to solve the current issue because of conflicts of interest. He claimed that a “private sector lobby” of MPs who own private schools, do not want education reform. “These people [private schools owners] belong to powerful political parties like the PJD and the PI,” he said. “Some of these MPs even call for privatizing education even in marginalized and rural areas.” He said private schools generate as much as MAD 1 billion profit, with 1 million students attending private schools.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has seized the celebration of World Health Day, convening health experts in Rabat in 2019, as an opportunity to instruct the government of Morocco on issues facing the sector. The King gave a message to the participants of the World Health Day symposium today, in which he called for a reform of the primary healthcare system. The state-run news agency, Maghreb Arab Press, published his full address. According to the King, “Reforming the primary health care system should be one of the main pillars of this drive, together with the Kingdom of Morocco’s commitment to press ahead with efforts to achieve universal health coverage by 2030.” A report from the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) issued in November 2018 showed that only 16.2 million of Morocco’s 34.8 million people have healthcare coverage. Another 2018 report from Morocco’s Court of Auditors also shared alarming loopholes in medical services, such as lack of specialized doctors and specialized medical services. In his message, the King said that ensuring effective health insurance plans requires “innovative financing for the services these plans provide, especially at this time of rising costs, populations aging at a faster rate, [and] the increase in chronic diseases.” The King added that a mechanism should be put in place to reduce “the squandering of funds and tackle low efficiency.” The monarch also called for the creation of a “new dynamic in order to overcome the various obstacles and constraints faced.” While public hospitals in Morocco provide some free or low-cost medical services, healthcare insurance is often needed for more extensive treatment, especially for private clinics. The King has said that Morocco has been making efforts to “ensure the gradual achievement of universal primary health coverage, making sure it benefits citizens from all social strata.” The King also recalled that Morocco put in place a strategy to grant health coverage for migrants in 2014 as part of Morocco’s efforts to integrate migrants willing to stay in the country. “Compulsory health coverage was introduced in 2005, and medical assistance for all was achieved in 2012. Moreover, health coverage for migrants was instituted in 2014 and was followed by a health coverage scheme for students enrolled in higher education institutions, both in the public and vocational training sectors,” said the monarch. The sovereign then concluded his message by urging the government to speed up the “promulgation of legislative, regulatory and implementation instruments concerning the reform of primary health care, and to continue expanding compulsory insurance plans.” The King believes that the strategy should enhance accessibility to healthcare services in Morocco.

Rabat – The Ministry of Economy and Finance published new data on Morocco’s debt structure March 29 that displays debt increases in both public external debt and overall government debt.  External debt as a percentage of Morocco’s gross domestic product (GDP) declined, however. Morocco’s public external debt stood at MAD 326.5 billion ($33.9 billion) in 2018, according to the documents, which the ministry updated on March 29. That makes up 29.2% of Morocco’s GDP, the same documents show—down from 31.3% in 2017. The central government owes 45.4% of the public external debt. Morocco’s total central government debt increased by 4.39% in 2018, now sitting at MAD 723 billion ($75.1 billion). The figure still represents a decrease in central government debt as a percentage of GDP: 64.6% in 2018 as compared to 65.1% in 2017. Morocco’s national debt has grown consistently in recent years, despite calls from some government officials to implement policy to slow down debt accumulation. The World Bank signed an agreement with Morocco in 2018 to help reduce the kingdom’s overall public debt (82% of GDP) to 60% of GDP. But Morocco has continued to borrow, most recently accepting a $400 million loan from the African Development Bank to support domestic industrialization projects. Supporters of the loan say that despite the debt such loans rack up, their benefits for Morocco’s economy outweigh the risks.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Trade and Industry has said the North African country has reached nearly 81 percent of its goal in the Industrial Acceleration Plan (IAP) to offer new job opportunities through industry. The ministry said that, between 2014 and 2018, industries created 405,496 jobs, 49 percent of which are held by women. The automotive industry recorded the strongest job creation. The sector created 116,611 jobs in the time period, representing 28.8 percent of all new jobs in the time period. The ministry said that the sector is still growing. The automotive sector is followed by textiles with 79,300 jobs created (19.6 percent), offshoring  with 69,932 jobs (17 percent), and agribusiness with 63,198 jobs (15.6 percent). The metallurgical and mechanical industry created 19,776 jobs or 5 percent, while the building materials industry created 11,302 jobs. Despite the importance of the sector in Morocco, the aeronautics field created only 8,636 jobs. Morocco’s IAP set a target for the aeronautics sector to create 23,000 new jobs by 2020. In October 2018, the industry ministry argued that the aeronautical industry in Morocco is a promising sector,  emphasizing that it is “fast moving,” and counting the international companies that have built plants in Morocco. In addition to listing the most impressive sectors in Morocco’s economy, the study, quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), said that Morocco’s exports increased from MAD 161 billion in 2013 to MAD 240 billion in 2018, an increase of 50 percent in five years. Integration of youths through vocational training, a must “The strong positioning of the industrial sector as a lever for job creation and the professional integration of young people is now strongly supported by the deployment of Vocational Training, driven by King Mohammed VI,” added the ministry. Throughout recent years, King Mohammed VI suggested that vocational training might be an important solution to reduce unemployment and integrate youth into the job market. On Thursday, the King chaired a meeting at the Royal Palace of Rabat, in which Minister of Education Said Amzazi made a presentation about the government’s plans to offer vocational training hubs for youth. Amzazi informed the King of a roadmap for the development of vocational training and the creation of “cities of professions and skills” in every region in Morocco. The cities of professions will include multi-sectoral facilities where youth can receive training on several fields. The Ministry of Industry said that the “roadmap, which restructures the offer of vocational training and equips the 12 regions of the kingdom with ‘Cities of Professions and Skills’ will meet a growing need for targeted profiles in the industrial sectors.”

Rabat – Dutch members of Parliament have summoned the Moroccan ambassador to the Netherlands to discuss the Casablanca Court of Appeals’ decision to uphold the sentences of Hirak Rif activists.  Pending the approval of Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Stef Blok, the MPs will officially condemn the court’s ruling. The summons comes days after members of the European Parliament signed and sent a letter to Moroccan Minister of Justice Mohamed Aujjar, urging the Moroccan government to end the suffering of the activists. The letter also called for the immediate release of all political prisoners. This issue was also discussed in April 2018, during Blok’s last visit to Morocco. He met with his counterpart, Nasser Bourita, and discussed several issues, including the treatment of the Hirak Rif activists.  During a press conference, Blok addressed the unresponsiveness of Moroccan officials during the uprising, suggesting that the government had not been effective in responding to the protestors’ grievances. Blok’s comment received an immediate response from Bourita who firmly drew a line between diplomatic and internal affairs. “[The situation in the Rif] is not a diplomatic question, and cannot be subject to a diplomatic discussion; it is an internal affair and under no circumstances can it be dealt with through discussions or interactions with foreign states,” Bourita said. Bourita concluded by saying “Morocco does not need lessons from anyone, nor should discussions on this topic involve other countries.” In the evening of April 5, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals upheld the sentences of 54 activists, imprisoned for their participation in the Hirak Rif protests. Last June, a Casablanca court gave activists sentences varying from 1 to 20 years for participating in the protests, which broke out in the northern Al Hoceima province in 2016 and 2017. Nasser Zefzazi, a figurehead of the protests, and three others received 20-year sentences. The ruling, which the court delivered around midnight on Friday, was met with protests in front of the Casablanca court. Demonstrators were demanding the immediate release of the activists. The Hirak Rif protests began in October 2016, after the death of Mohcine Fikri. Fikri, a local fishmonger, was crushed to death in a garbage truck while attempting to save swordfish that local police had confiscated and discarded. Fikri’s death sparked months of marches where protesters demanded a range of reforms from the Moroccan government. The reforms generally included: Respecting Amazigh (Berber) identity, the release of political prisoners, an investigation and trial for those responsible for Fikri’s death, demilitarization of the northern Rif region, development of the region’s infrastructure, and input in the spending of local investments. The Moroccan government quelled the protests after responding with force, arresting hundreds, including the movement’s leadership.

Rabat – The Algerian parliament is expected to meet on Tuesday to officially name Abdelkader Bensalah as an interim president after the resignation of Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Quoted by Algerian news agency APS, an official statement from the upper house of parliament said that “it was decided to hold a meeting of the two chambers of parliament” on Tuesday. The statement also quoted Article 102, which stipulates that the president of the upper house can take over the presidency in the event of the death or the resignation of the president. The article also rules that the president of the Council of the Nation, the parliament’s upper house, can “assume the functions of the head of state for 90 days maximum during which presidential elections shall be held and the head of state appointed.” Several politicians  argued that Bensalah could not serve as an interim president because he was Moroccan.  The head of Algeria’s Justice and Development Front Party, Lakhdar Benkhellaf, has said that Bensalah has a “problem with his nationality of origin. The condition for a [leader] occupying the post of President of the Republic, is that he must have the Algerian nationality of origin. And he had another nationality until 1964 during which he had obtained Algerian nationality.” Protests continue Despite Bouteflika’s decision to plie to protesters’ demands by resigning before the official end of his term, Algerians are continuing their demonstrations against the current government, demanding a full reform. On Friday, protesters took to the streets chanting slogans such as, “Leave means leave” and “System get lost!” The protests in Algeria started on February 22 after Bouteflika announced his decision to run for a fifth term. The anti-Bouteflika and anti-system mood got wild after Bouteflika decided to withdraw his candidacy, but decided to postpone the 2019 election, which was planned for April 18. Friday marked the seventh week of protests in Algeria. On Saturday, AFP reported that some Algerians residing abroad chose  to return to their country to join the protests against the government. “Since February 22, I have not been able to sleep, I am addicted to the internet to follow the events 24 hours a day and do not miss anything on social networks,” Algerian citizen Chahrazade Kaci said. Kaci said that she has been “exiled” in the UK for 25 years.

Rabat – The minister of Energy, Mining, and Sustainable Development, Aziz Rabbah, underlined that Morocco has made notable development in the field of scientific research related to the energy sector, particularly renewable energy.  Rabbah made the remarks during a two-day press conference at Green Park Energy in Benguerir on Friday and at the Moroccan agency for Energetic Efficiency (AMEE) on Saturday.  He said that Morocco cannot keep investing in the energy field only to respond to the citizens’ needs without a national industry and scientific research. The Research Institute for Solar Energy and New Energies (IRESEN) allocated MAD 200 million for the creation of 17 scientific research and innovation laboratories in universities across the country, in addition to two startups, and five in the creation phase, according to Rabbah. IRESEN also plans to further research, development, and innovation in the energy sector by allocating a portfolio of MAD 300 million for the co-financing of renewable energies collaborative projects and an extra MAD 500 million for new research infrastructure. Rabbah added that Morocco’s advancement in the field, in addition to its strong potential, has prompted world-leading companies in the energy sector to put their faith in Morocco and contribute to developing its energy sector.  He declared that Morocco’s reliance on foreign countries for electricity reduced from 98 percent to 92 percent thanks to the national energy strategy adopted in 2009. The strategy seeks to reduce the country’s energy consumption levels, which currently stand at an estimated at MAD 70 billion per year The minister pointed out that 70 percent of scientific research funding comes from international development cooperation, with 15 percent coming from the national fund and the remaining percentage from other institutions. Morocco’s achievement in the sector Morocco emerged as a prominent example of a country that has put in place advanced policy frameworks in support of sustainable energy. Over the past 20 years, Morocco has succeeded in providing electricity to 98 percent of the population. Before that, it was only 20 percent.  Approximately 28,000 small and medium farmers have adopted solar irrigation pump systems, which will help them reduce their electricity consumption bill. The farmers have benefited from a 50 percent subvention for the installation of the photovoltaic panels while the irrigation system profited from a subvention ranging from 80 percent to 100 percent. The financial aid has cost the government MAD 1 billion for the photovoltaics system and MAD 1.5 billion for irrigation. Morocco produces 28,000-gigawatt per hour of electricity, with the rest being imported from Spain. Rabbah pointed out the importance of raising awareness among Moroccans and companies about how to reduce electricity bill while sticking to the same consumption level.  He said that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has presented a MAD 1.2 billion project extended over three years to help companies reduce their energy bill.  Included in the EBRD bill’s portfolio are 260 projects, ranging from clinics, hotels, and small businesses.  The project involves changing electric cables and the way they are installed to be adapted to international standards. The concerned companies noticed a 20 percent decrease in their electric bill.

Rabat – The dunes of Erg Chebbi defined the second stage of the Marathon des Sables (MDS) as runners spent nearly a third of the stage’s 32.5 kilometers racing through Morocco’s largest dune field. Competitors left the starting line at 8:30 a.m. and by noon temperatures had reached 29.5 degrees celsius—3 degrees hotter than the first stage. The dunes and heat caused half a dozen competitors to drop out of the MDS by 2 p.m. Only two competitors dropped following the mixed terrain of the first stage, bringing the total number of runners from 781. In general, 11 hours is the maximum time expected to complete the stage. The race’s top finishers for both the men’s and the women’s race made it it in less than five hours. The El Morabity brothers firmly held on to first and second place, with Mohamed El Morabity finishing just six seconds ahead of his brother, Rachid, who won the first stage of the marathon on Sunday, April 7. Abdelkader El Mouaziz remained in the top five by coming in less than four minutes after the El Morabity brothers. The three runners, all members of the Maroc TGCC Team, worked together to stay orientated in the dunes. “I did a great job for our team,” Mouaziz said. “I was in charge of the compass in the dunes.” The end of the second stage also brought the MDS’ first international top five men’s finishers.  Fourth and fifth place were taken by Antonio Alongi, from Italy and Merile Robert from France—a stark contrast from the Moroccan dominated stage one. Stage Two: Men’s Top Five Dutch runner Ragna Debats continued to dominate the women’s race, finishing the second stage nearly 45 minutes ahead of the next runner. “Thirteen kilometers of dunes, that was a first for me. I loved it,” Debats said. Behind Debats was American runner Meghan Hicks, who won the MDS in 2013. Hicks climbed to second place after finishing fifth in the first stage—overtaking Moroccan runner Aziz Raji and finishing more than six minutes ahead of her. “I didn’t have the opportunity to train on this type of terrain,” Raji said. “Still, I was able to make it to the Top 3. I hope to perform even better in the next stages.” Stage Two: Women’s Top Five Details about the third stage have not yet been released, but it is expected to start at 10 a.m., Tuesday, April 9. Morocco World News will continue to provide updates on the marathon throughout the week.

Rabat – The first stage of the Marathon des Sables (MDS) was a challenging course through 32.2 kilometers of stony plains, dune fields, rocky valleys, and hills. Patrick Bauer, the founder of MDS and acting Race Director, was present when the starting pistol went off at 9 a.m. By noon, temperatures had reached as high as 26 degrees celsius. In general, 10 hours is the maximum time expected to complete this stage. All of the top finishers for both the mens and women’s race made it in less than four hours. Moroccans dominated the men’s competition for stage one, taking the first five finisher spots.  Rachid and Mohamed El Morabity, two brothers with years of experience in the MDS, finished a minute a part. They came in first and second respectively. The result is a slight change from last year, when Mohamed El Morabity took the top spot for the first stage. “I’m very happy. The first stage was very tough: despite several flat sections, there were many dune fields. But thanks to my experience, I was able to win the stage,” Rachid El Morabity said. The two brothers have dominated the last several years of the Marathon des Sables, consistently placing in the top five. In stark contrast to the men’s competition, the top five women finishers were all from different countries. Ragna Debats, from the Netherlands, finished first, completing the race more than 25 minutes ahead of Moroccan runner Aziza Raji, who came in second place. “It’s important for me to be happy and have good feelings, but this is a race and when I [take] part in a race, my objective is to win,” Debats said in an interview after the race. Details about the second stage have yet to be released, but stage two is expected to start at 9 a.m., Monday, April 8. Morocco World News will continue to provide updates on the marathon throughout the week.

Rabat – Almost a decade has passed since Morocco’s Mohammed VI Foundation for the Publication of the Holy Qur’an began preparing a new version of the Qur’an. The new Qur’an is written in a special font and recited in such a manner as is best suited to the Moroccan context and the Maliki school of Islam, which Morocco follows. The King ordered the Moroccan version, which came to be called the “Mushaf Mohammadi,” in 2010 purportedly to counter Wahhabism, the conservative interpretation of Islam many Saudis follow. Different methods of recitation How would the Mushaf Mohammadi have an impact? Morocco World News consulted several Rabat imams after the director of the Mohammed VI Foundation, Hamid Hammani, claimed in 2017 that Morocco needs to combat Wahhabism because students who pursue their Islamic studies in Saudi Arabia come back home transformed into “bombs.”  Hammani made his remark to an ethnographer at the Jacque Berque Center in Rabat, Anouk Cohen, who examined the implementation of the project in a 2017 article titled, “Seeing and Hearing the Book. A Moroccan Edition of the Quran.” Local imams did not have clear answers as to how the Mushaf Mohammedi is consolidating the Maliki school of thought or confront Wahhabism in Morocco. “By teaching the oriental recitation of the Quran,” argued Hamid Hamani, “children will end up distanced from the Maliki school.” The leading imam at the Hassan Mosque in Rabat told MWN how Saudi and Moroccan readings of the Qur’an differ, saying, “With regard to Qur’anic recitation, Morocco adopts the Warsh ‘an Nafi’ canonical method, unlike Saudi Arabia, which adopts Hafs ‘an ‘Asim. These readings differ in recitation, utterances, and sometimes in meaning.”  The changes resulting from the different readings are relatively small and have little to no bearing on the unanimous understandings of the Qur’an among Sunnis. “Adhering to this reading [Warsh] will clear up the confusion Moroccans have in this regard,” asserted the imam. The recitations do not differ on “contentious verses” pertaining to jihad or martyrdom. They also do not differ on verses relating to the five pillars of Islam: The statement of faith, pilgrimage, prayer, charity, and fasting.  Despite the differences, the Hassan Mosque imam, like others MWN spoke to, did not expound on how the different readings can prevent Moroccan pupils from embracing the Wahhabi-inspired thought. The primary objective, Hamani said, is “not to propagate the Mushaf Mohammadi. It’s about politics, that is, extremism.” Hamani argued that pointing children toward what he believes is the proper way of reciting the Qur’an will have an influence beyond recitation: “It’s a dogma without being a dogma.” Hamani explained that almost all Qur’anic schools (called msids) in Morocco currently teach Oriental recitations. “These schools attract orphans who end up absorbing the Wahhabi version of Islam.” Cohen’s article noted that calligraphers and clerics would have to decide on the details of the writing style and letter shapes, balancing between highlighting the text through a typically “Moroccan script” and the necessity of clarity and justice to the recitation. The Mohammed VI Foundation said it would limit the distribution of other versions of the Qur’an, subjecting them to strict printing laws. The foundation would also impose import restrictions on all Qur’ans except those produced in Egypt and Lebanon, where companies are capable of designing “unique models.” According to Minister of Endowment and Islamic Affairs Ahmed Taoufik, there were approximately 14,000 Qur’anic schools in Morocco in 2017. The schools had more than 450,000 pupils, of whom 40 percent were women. The foundation publishes nearly 1 million copies of the Qur’an every year to supply mosques and to export to countries adopting the warsh method of reading, especially African countries. One way Islam in Morocco differs from Saudi Arabia is through the collective recitation of “hizb,” one out of 60 sections of the Qur’an, specially divided for ease of learning and memorization. Historically rooted in Morocco, reciting hizb in mosques is rarely practiced in the Middle East where orthodox Muslims regard it as “bid’a,” a novelty disapproved of by a large number of scholars. Some imams in Morocco even refuse the recitation of the hizb in their mosques, even though it is part of a specific program put in place by Morocco’s Islamic ministry. However, Morocco is determined to push for its “Moroccanization” policy. The state has dedicated television and radio channels to teaching the proper recitation of the Muhammadi Qur’an and introduced literacy courses on Islamic studies in Qur’anic schools and in kindergartens. With an overwhelming number of Qur’anic seats of learning, authorities want to make sure the policy is well-implemented. If organizations fail to adhere to the policy regulations, the state cuts its public subsidies for them. In coordination with the Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs, the foundation initiated the printing of 51,160 copies of the Qur’an in the English language, 3,000 copies in Braille, and 2,335 for near-sighted people as well as overseeing a Qur’an teaching and memorization program and organizing Qur’anic recitation competitions in prisons.

Rabat – At the request of King Mohammed VI, the Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani flew to the Rwandan capital, Kigali, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide. He was welcomed by the Rwandan Minister of State in charge of Transport, Jean de Dieu Uwihanganye, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s office. In a statement to the press, El Othmani said Morocco’s participation in the event is a testament to “his compassion and solidarity with the people and leaders of Rwanda.” He commended the country for the progress it has made since, calling it a “renaissance that turns the page from the shock of genocide.” El Othmani also emphasized Morocco’s commitment to strengthening relations between the two countries. He said Morocco aims to “develop its cooperation with this country at all levels, economic, political, as well as in the exchange of expertise”.  He added that “the two countries play an important role in their region and in Africa.” The Rwandan minister echoed El Othmani’s sentiment, saying that Morocco’s participation shows “the strong relations between the two countries and its great development.” This isn’t the first show of friendship between the two countries. In 2016, King Mohammed VI visited Rwanda to strengthen bilateral relations and increase cooperation. While there, King Mohammed VI visited the memorial dedicated to the victims of the Rwandan genocide in Kigali.   The King also laid a wreath of flowers and paid tribute to the victims of the genocide by writing a message in Arabic in the commemoration book at the memorial.  The King’s message in 2016 read: “The genocide is a dark period in history and memory of the Rwandan people. It is a human tragedy that will always question the conscience of humanity. Today Rwanda opens its arms to life, with confidence in the present and optimism and hope for the future, which promises to be marked by love, coexistence, security, and stability.” The Rwandan genocide in 1994 led to 800,000 deaths, a tenth of the country’s population, in just a 100 day period. The genocide was part of a civil war in which the ethnic Hutu extremists targeted members of the minority Tutsi community. The commemoration began on Saturday with a flame lighting ceremony at the memorial in Kigali where 250,000 victims of the genocide are buried. The flame will burn for 100 days.  Paul Kagame, who led a rebel force that ended the slaughter, was the one to light the flame.  “In 1994, there was no hope, only darkness,” Kagame told the crowd gathered at the Kigali Genocide Memorial. “Today, light radiates from this place. How did it happen? Rwanda became a family once again.”

Rabat – The President of the House of Advisors, Hakim Benchamach, is leading a large delegation to represent Morocco during the 140th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), which opened on Saturday in Doha. The symposium is convening the speakers of 80 parliaments from around the world, in addition to more than 2270 MPs from 162 countries, including Morocco. Before the opening of the symposium, Morocco’s delegation introduced a proposal to establish  a mechanism to ensure international protection for the Palestinian people. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the Moroccan proposal is part  of Morocco’s efforts and with “the positions it has always expressed in favor of Arab issues, notably the Palestinian cause.” The proposal is in line with the instructions of King Mohammed VI, Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee. In addition, a committee was formed to draft a unified article containing the proposals from Morocco, Kuwait, Indonesia and Turkey under the title “Protection of the Palestinian people, rejection of the recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan and strengthening of the values of coexistence between peoples and religions.” Morocco is on the list of the countries which has long expressed unwavering support for the Palestinian cause. On March 30, King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis signed the Jerusalem Appeal during the papal visit to Morocco. The appeal said, “We believe it is important to preserve the Holy City of Jerusalem (Al-Quds Al-Sharif) as a shared heritage of humankind and to safeguard it, above all for the believers of the three monotheistic religions, as a symbol of peaceful coexistence and as a meeting place where mutual esteem and dialogue are fostered.” The decision to sign the appeal received applause from several countries and institutions, including the European Union and the United Nations. The spokesperson of the United Nations Secretary-General, Stephane Dujarric, said that the Jerusalem appeal signed by King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis “goes along the lines of what the Secretary-General has been saying for a quite long time, that Jerusalem has a sacred character for Jews, for Christians and Muslims and that it needs to be preserved.” The 140th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union is expected to address several issues, including international peace and security for international humanitarian law.

Rabat – Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said he has no intention to run for presidential election again. The 92-year old president said on Saturday in a meeting of the ruling Nidaa Tounes party: “I do not have the intention to be nominated for a second term.” The president added that the constitution gives him the right to run again, but he believes that Tunisia “deserves change.” Essebsi added that Tunisia is “full of qualified men,” adding that it is “necessary to clear the way for the youth.” The president, who was quoted by state-owned news agency TAP, said that it is “too early” to comment whether he will run or not, opening the door for speculations. The presidential election is expected to take place in November. Essebsi has been in power since late 2014. According to Al Jazeera, no members announced their bids or intention to run for the election. Essebsi’s statement comes four days after former Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced his resignation. Bouteflika’s decision was preceded by mass protests, which contested Bouteflika’s decision to run for a fifth term. Although Bouteflika announced his resignation, protesters took to the streets on Friday, which marked the seventh week of protests across Algeria.

Rabat – Historically, Amazigh (Berber) women tattooed their faces, feet, arms, and other body parts for beauty, health, and protection. However, as Morocco’s cultural dynamics and traditions change with time, globalization, and the influence of Islam in society, the ancient tradition is quickly disappearing. Amazigh women with tattoos today were born in a time when tattoos were highly encouraged, celebrated, and an integral part of their lives. Within their lifetimes, the women witnessed an unexpected transformation within Morocco and North Africa, where their tattoos, which once made them sought after, became a source of shame.  Tattooing is an ancient tradition practiced in cultures around the world. In North Africa, the tradition of tattooing dates to pre-Islamic times, and Amazigh populations across Morocco have practiced it consistently since then. Historically, the tattooing aided nomadic Amazigh tribes in distinguishing members of different groups. Symbols within the tattoos served as a unifying force, deeply rooted in each group’s history and purpose. Beyond beautification, tattoos told the stories of tribes, tied women to their land, and conveyed familial ties.  As a result of a new stigma due to the occupation of the French and the rise of Islam in Morocco, this practice is now quickly disappearing. At the moment, the tattooed elderly Amazigh women of today are the last generation to have taken part in the tradition. Traditionally placed on women, Amazigh tattoo designs are extremely symbolic and are believed to induce fertility, to cure illnesses, and to protect against spirits or jnoun. Much of the time, Amazigh tattoos are placed near the eyes, mouth, and nose. The markings, tattooed on Amazigh girls beginning at a young age, acted as a rite of passage. After an Amazigh girl was tattooed, she became a woman with the potential of motherhood.  Tattoos followed Amazigh women throughout their lives. The first facial tattoo is called the “siyala” and is placed on the chin for fertility. At an early age, women also applied tattoos to protect from death and disease. Along with important milestones, such as with the onset of puberty or for fertility, women received more tattoos. Tattoos were also used to convey one’s social or marital status and portray beauty.     Later in life, if a woman’s social status changed, her tattoos would evolve with them. If a woman was widowed, she may have a tattoo from one ear to the other, symbolizing the beard of her dead husband.  However, when asked about the purpose of their tattoos in interviews, many tattooed women and their family members told Morocco World News the purpose was solely decoration and to make them beautiful. Fatima, an elderly women with many facial tattoos stated her tattoos were “the same as makeup.” When asked about the meaning of the symbols on her face, another woman from Khemisset, a city east of Rabat, stated they are “just for decoration.” Many tattoo symbols have relationships with vegetation. The palm tree is a common facial tattoo, drawn as a straight line surrounded by dots that represent seeds. It is placed between the bottom lip and chin of a woman as a “siyala.”  The tattoo correlates with the Carthaginian goddess Tanit, who is the fertility, war, and lunar goddess to the Amazigh people. The tattoo is a symbol of fertility and regarded as one of the most beautiful symbols a woman could have on her face. Tattoos relating to the animal world are correlated with female sexuality. Additionally, tattoos with diamond shapes, such as the eye or flower, were seen as a source of protection against evil spirits. One of the most important facets of the designs was the way they connected women as they were passed from mother to daughter and between generations. A tattoo artist, usually a middle-aged woman from within or near a girl’s town, came occasionally to tattoo the young women of different villages. Tattoo mistresses would have their own signature twist on the designs special to the artist and region. When tattooing, the artist used the opportunity to deliver advice, answer questions, and share news with the woman being tattooed.  The women tattoo artists created the ink for the tattooing in several ways. One of the most common of these preparations was to squeeze the leaves of broad (fava) beans. Along with the dye, the tattooist would also use sharp needles, incense, black coal, and aromatic herbs. However, this supportive tattooing process was not always the case. One elderly woman, Hama, who spoke to MWN in Khemisset, stated that a tattoo artist came to her town and forcefully tattooed her face despite her cries for help. She was only 12 years old, and after the encounter she ended up with a tattoo between her eyebrows and a line down her chin for the rest of her life.   The role of tattoos began to shift at the beginning of the 20th century with the French occupation of Morocco. For some Amazigh women, the occupation encouraged them to get tattoos, since they believed that the tattoos could protect them from rape. According to Professor Ahmed Aassid, during the time of the French colonization, women used tattoos to show their independence and exert freedom. The tattoos were also used to inspire Moroccan men to work harder.  During the occupation, the French established brothels around Morocco and abducted Amazigh women from rural regions to work as prostitutes in these brothels. Since many of the Amazigh women had tattoos, a relationship grew between prostitution and facial tattoos. Slowly, Moroccan society began to judge women with facial tattoos, associating them with prostitution. Another factor in the eradication of the practice of tattooing in Amazigh culture was the modern Islamization of Morocco. Following the Iranian revolution in 1979,  Middle Easterners, mainly influenced by the extremely conservative Salafi branch of Islam, were encouraged by King Hassan II to travel around Morocco to counter the influence of the left wing. According to Amazigh specialist Michael Peyron, as a part of the Salafi preachings, the teachers conveyed that tattoos were “haram” and therefore forbidden. The teachers who were trained in Saudi Arabia endorsed a rigorous, fundamentalist interpretation of Islam. While Wahhabism existed in Morocco since the 19th century, it did not benefit from government support until the 1980s. During their teachings, in addition to condemning tattoos, the teachers also preached about the importance of wearing the hijab, in turn significantly impacting the practice of wearing the hijab in Morocco. Although in the Qur’an there is no mention of tattooing, one hadith, or story about the Prophet Muhammad, does condemn the practice. According to the hadith Sahih al-Bukhari, narrated by Abu Hudhayfa, “The Prophet cursed the one who does tattoos and the one who has a tattoo done.” This is because the process of tattooing changes the body, thus altering God’s creation. Another claim against the tradition is that tattoos prevent water from reaching the skin and in turn obstruct “wudu” or the ritual ablutions of purification. However, in reality, tattooing is done several layers beneath the skin, so it does not affect the water touching the skin. Despite Islam being the main reason the tradition has disappeared, tattooing has been traced to the time of the Prophet Muhammad, when most women were tattooed. Lalla Fatima Zahra, the daughter of the prophet, likely wore the siyala tattoo on her chin. According to Amazigh activist, Ahmed Assad, in areas with religious influence, the tradition no longer continues because tattoos are seen as “haram.” However in some regions with less religious influence like Khenifra in the central Middle Atlas Mountains, the Zayanes Amazigh population continues the tradition. Since the mid-1980s, the tradition of tattooing has ceased to continue in most of Morocco. The disappearance of the tradition is not only linked to the French occupation of Morocco and the role of Islam, but also to urbanization and modernization of Moroccan society. Traditional tattoos, such as those of Amazigh women are now seen as unbecoming and non-modern. In turning away from traditional Amazigh tattoos, Moroccan women now channel this form of expression and beauty through henna. Additionally, some youth in Morocco are turning to modern tattoos, despite it being “haram.” In urban regions of Morocco, such as Rabat or Casablanca, it is rare to see women with facial or body tattoos. Some women, especially those in large cities, have opted to get their tattoos removed through a painful and costly process.  In rural regions, the tattooing tradition rarely continues. There are no longer young women getting tattoos in most regions, but many of the women in the older generation still have the tattoos on their faces, hands, and feet.  Several women MWN spoke to in the city of Khemisset stated that they used to be proud of their tattoos and thought they were beautiful, but now they are deeply ashamed of them and feel guilty because their tattoos are “haram.” Fatima in Khemisset stated she feels guilty and believes having the tattoo is like a crime. Husbands and families who encouraged or forced women to get tattoos at a young age now suggest they get their tattoos removed or covered. Tattoo symbols which were passed down between generations will not continue past their skin.  The tradition of tattooing connects the Amazigh people of Morocco to many communities of indigenous people worldwide who use tattooing as a form of expression, healing, and protection. Around the world, traditions of indigenous groups face the growing threat of globalization and modernization, which has in turn led to the disappearance of many indigenous tribes and practices. In Morocco and North Africa, this is no different. It is up to the Moroccan people to decide what will be lost with the end of a centuries-old tradition. How will Morocco preserve the photographs, symbols, purposes, and stories of the tattooed Amazigh women for the future? How will Morocco protect the ancient traditions that remain?

Rabat – Dozens of paintings by the iconic Moroccan artist, Hassan El Glaoui, are on display at the Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Rabat, offering a rare chance to see many of the works of a man who left an indelible mark on Moroccan art. Hassan El Glaoui died on June 21, 2018, at the age of 94, after a long and fascinating life. His works at the exhibition, titled, “The Salt of My Earth,” are mostly never before seen portraits, allowing visitors to better understand what made El Glaoui the man he was. Touria El Glaoui, Hassan El Glaoui’s daughter who curated the exhibition and is an influential figure in the art world in her own right, told Morocco World News that the exhibition is called “The Salt of My Earth” because many of El Glaoui’s paintings “gave the true flavor of Morocco,” perfectly representing day to day life in Morocco in his time.   “The term salt of the earth is also used to describe something altruistic and humble, and that’s something my father was, so it just made sense.” The title is also a callback to the family’s illustrious history, as the El Glaoui family traded salt when it was one of the most valuable minerals. The iconic painter has one of the most fascinating family histories in Morocco: Hassan was born in Marrakech in 1923 to Thami El Glaoui, the last Pasha of Marrakech, also known by other formidable names such as “the Lord of the Atlas”  or “the black panther of Morocco.” Thami was, for a time, one of the richest men in the world and the most powerful man in Morocco. Thami, having lived the life of a powerful warlord, expected his sons to fill respectable roles. He was hesitant about his oldest son pursuing a career in art until one of the most significant men in history recognized Hassan’s talent and convinced his father to let him follow his passion. That man was Sir Winston Churchill, a close friend of the Pasha. When visiting Thami in his office one day in 1943, Churchill spotted some of Hassan’s sketches and instantly recognized Hassan had a talent.  On display upon immediately walking into the “Salt of My Earth exhibition” are colorful sketches of domestic servants in his father’s garden, the kind of sketches Churchill would have seen. Churchill persuaded the pasha to send his son to Paris to receive a formal education in art. He attended the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and went on to spend 15 years in Paris.  From there, El Glaoui’s artistic career began to take off. His paintings of fantasia horsemen and classical Moroccan scenes gained acclaim both in his home country and abroad, and his work was exhibited in London, Paris, New York, and of course, Morocco. These paintings are what Hassan El Glaoui is most known for, but “The Salt of My Earth” exhibition seeks to show a more personal side of the artist that has rarely been seen before.  Many of the artworks on display are not of horses but of Hassan El Glaoui’s wife, Christine Legendre, a former French Givenchy model he met during his time in Paris, and the three daughters they had together.   Fantasia horses are how Hassan made his name, but when asked what served as his biggest inspiration and muse, Touria told Morocco World News: “For a long time I think it was my mother. She has one of the most painted portraits in the family house. For him, it was always people dear to him and near to his heart.”   These portraits were very special to Hassan El Glaoui and were rarely on display during his lifetime. The exhibition offers new insight into who Hassan El Glaoui really was and what mattered to him most. “Salt of My Earth” will run from April 2 to August 31.   Touria El Glaoui is carrying on her father’s art legacy, having founded the 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair, which takes place in London, New York, and Marrakech every year to bring visibility to African artists on the global market. Another one of his three daughters, Ghizlane, also followed her father’s footsteps into the art world. Ghizlane mixes traditional oil painting techniques with customizable LED lighting to create illuminated mosaic pieces.

By Najoua Bijjir Rabat – In 2003 Moroccan-Dutch musician Hind Laroussi first became known when she attended the Dutch music competition series Idols, where she reached the semi-finals. Later that year, her first single “Summer All Over Again” was released. In 2004 Laroussi received an Edison Award, an annual Dutch music prize for outstanding achievements, and a golden record for her debut album “Around the World.” In 2005 she released her album “Halfway Home” and in 2010 the album “Crosspop.” Now, sixteen years after being introduced to the Netherlands by Idols, Laroussi entered the American Billboards’ Top Dance Music Charts at number 5 with “Lost.” She spoke with Morocco World News about her journey to the charts, loneliness, and both Dutch and Moroccan roots. You left the Netherlands as an established artist to start a new career in the US.  What motivated you to make such a big step? My relationship at the time ended and I decided to go to Nashville to record country music and try something new. When I was in Nashville I unexpectedly received a phone call from the well-known songwriter Philip Lawrence. He asked me whether I could come to Los Angeles. It’s Philip Lawrence, so I got on the plane and met him in a studio in L.A. He had just finished rehearsing with Beyonce and Bruno Mars for the Super Bowl. Being in that environment had so much impact on me that I decided to change my approach to music, from country to pop. From that point on I started flying back and forth between Los Angeles and Amsterdam. Philip and I began collaborating and he helped to build a team around me. I danced 5 days a week with Kyausha Simpson, a former Beyonce dancer who also worked with Earth Wind and Fire. Along with that, I worked with vocal coach Rob Stevenson, who also coaches Rihanna, Justin Timberlake, Pharrell Williams, Dave Matthews and many more.   I decided to settle in Los Angeles. For over two years I worked on improving myself as an artist and channeling my creativity into my work. I left everything behind me: my family and my friends. I started all over again from scratch, and I felt alone in a strange country. To make matters worse, Philip and I decided to go our own way – all that hard work and I had to start over yet again. What was the most challenging part of your journey?  I guess all the endurance you need to stick with it while putting up with many disappointments. You have no idea how many times I dealt with rejection. At some point doors just weren’t opening for me. Everyone comes to L.A. to live his or her dreams. I may be well known in Holland, but in L.A. no one had ever heard of me. I struggled to deal with people that didn’t believe in me. I had to rely on myself and keep the faith. Even though my family is far away, they supported me all the way. Didn’t you think at some point: I’ll quit? Oh, yeah, many, many times. I often cried on the phone when I was talking to my parents. At some point, I almost lost my confidence. My hair started to fall out from all the stress. My mother told me to come back home, but I told her that I believed in my songs and that I had to stay and give it a shot. How did you re-build your career? My lawyer, Channing Johnson, introduced me to Adrian Miller and we talked about music. I was impressed with how he helped Anderson Paak build his career as an independent artist. That matched up well with what I wanted for myself. Adrian introduced me to DJ Chris Cox, who has over 60 number 1 hits on the Billboard Dance Chart. He made the remix for my single “Lost.” In January of this year my single “Lost” was released. The second week after my single was released, I made my debut on Billboard. You’re currently fifth on the Billboard Top Dance Music Chart. How does that feel? It feels like a great reward! All that hard work is finally paying off! I was in an Apple store when Chris Cox tried to call me to congratulate me. My phone, laptop, and tablet happened to crash that day. I sat there for hours waiting in the Apple store for my devices to be repaired. When I was able to check my email, I saw Chris’ note. I think everyone in the Apple store must have thought I was crazy, when I suddenly started jumping and dancing around the store. When I arrived home I thought: Okay, what am I going to do now? I was alone and I missed being able to celebrate with my family. What made the single “Lost” such a success? This single tells my personal story. It tells everything I’ve been through. Lost is an honest song. It’s about the conflict I had with myself, and the video clip reflects this. It’s about fighting your inner demons. The song is about that moment you think you can’t do it anymore. It’s about the voices in your head telling you to give up and when you’re about to give up, that little bit of hope sees you through. How different is the single “Lost” from your previous songs? I completely rediscovered myself musically. My focus is pop music, but I remain true to my roots. Philip Lawrence embraced my Arab background, and that was a great start! In Holland, I felt misunderstood. Although I collaborated with great writers and producers there, it was as if they didn’t appreciate my Arab background or understand me. How Arab are you? I’m a Dutch cheese &amp; Moroccan couscous type of person. My mother is Dutch and my father is Moroccan. I was born and raised in the city of cheese, Gouda. I’m from a big Dutch family and I also have my family in Morocco. When I joined Idols, I performed in a Moroccan custom-made outfit and henna tattoos on my hands. My parents raised us to speak Dutch as well as Moroccan. We celebrate all holidays, from “Sinterklaas” (a Dutch holiday for Saint Nicholas) to Ramadan. My parents have been together for 45 years. The way they love each other and respect each other has been a great example for me. They gave me and my sisters so much love and support, not only when I played athletics but also when I took singing lessons or joined several contests. How did your Arab background influence your singing career? I grew up with Fayrouz and Oum Khaltoum. Arab strings and percussions always touched me. When I started singing and writing my own songs, I always thought about how to include my background in my songs. It’s all about finding the right balance. What are your future plans? Right now I’m working on my tour and the release of my next single “Cinnamon.” It’s all about my Arabic background and culture. I can’t wait to share it with everybody!

Rabat – Senegalese football legend El Hadji Diouf said that the Moroccan national football team is one of his favorites to win the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). Diouf told Goal that he hopes to put Senegal at the “top” because it is his country. “I hope they win the title as there are many other good teams -Egypt will be at the forefront with Morocco and Nigeria.” The former footballer, however, acknowledged that Egypt is “the strongest candidate” in the competition as they will play in their own country, and will be backed by many fans. “They have very good players led by Mohamed Salah.” The head coach of the Moroccan national football team, Herve Renard, also shared the same thoughts as Diouf. Renard said that Egypt and Senegal are his favorites to win the continental competition. There are two popular favorites: Egypt of course, and Senegal. Morocco, with Algeria, Tunisia, Cote d’Ivoire, and others, are among the outsiders.” “To say that we will win is something else. We must not forget that nothing is easy during a CAN. We will face highly motivated teams. We will not be at home and we know that playing away, it is always more complicated,” said Renard. While Renard said he does not believe that his team will win the competition, the head coach of the Nigerian football team, Gernot Rohr, said that Egypt and Morocco are his favorites.  “According to the last FIFA ranking, Morocco is currently the best in Africa, while Egypt will play at home and enjoy the support of their fans, and for this reason, both teams are the closest to the title,” he said. CAF’s flagship tournament will be held in June 2019 in Egypt.

Ouarzazate – All eyes were on Jay Batchen as he began unpacking his bag to show a cluster of runners what he would be using to survive the Sahara Desert for a week while running the Marathon des Sables (MDS) in Morocco. The 49-year-old’s bruised rib throbbed as he tugged out a venom extractor, knife, signal mirror, compass, and an assortment of other tools. Each item Batchen pulled from his bag came with a story from one of the 14 times he had run the MDS. “You can never pack too much toilet paper. It’s a lot less embarrassing to throw it out than ask other runners on the side of the trail for some of theirs,” Batchen said, speaking from experience, as he showed-off a four-pack of toilet paper. As the US representative of the MDS, Batchen’s job is to make sure each of the 32 runners, who were in the US just days ago, were ready to tackle the world’s longest desert race. But the veteran runner knew that tools and gadgets could only get you so far—what mattered the most was attitude. “Your goal should always be just to finish,” Batchen said to the runners attending his pre-race bag-check. “Do what works best for you. Learn from each of your mistakes and try not to make them again. And if you ever think about quitting, tell yourself you’ll quit tomorrow.” The first time Batchen finished the MDS was in 2000. Since then he has earned 13 finisher medals. But that’s not why the race has changed his life. In 1999, Batchen attended the MDS as a documentarian for Discovery Channel. He was following the story of Lisa Smith, a female participant of MDS, who that year became the first American to win the women’s race. Several years later she became Lisa Smith-Batchen. “This race has become a part of who I am,” Batchen told Morocco World News. “I’m not the same person I was when I first came. And in a few days, when I hopefully finish this race, I won’t be the same person I am right now—it changes you.” The MDS was founded in 1984, after Patrick Bauer spent 12 days alone crossing 350 kilometers of the Sahara Desert on foot. Bauer wanted to share his experience with any willing to join him. “The MDS is a powerful inner journey, a true introspection and a life path where you will find answers to questions you had never even thought of asking yourself before the start,” Bauer said in a press release. The MDS’s inaugural race in 1986 had just 23 runners. More than 30 years later, the race has had more than 20,000 participants. This year during the 34th MDS, there will be nearly a 1,000 people representing 51 countries running the marathon.   Many, like Batchen, keep coming back for more. Which is why Bauer spends months charting a new race course each year. No two MDS routes are ever the same. “This is really a course that pays tribute to the great diversity of terrains of the Marathon des Sables. We will cross all the wonders the region has to offer…” Bauer said in a press release. “…And the icing on the cake: two brand new stages, capable of satisfying those competitors who are returning again and again.” In keeping with tradition, the course is kept a closely guarded secret until the day before the starting pistol goes off. The 250-kilometer race is broken down into six timed stages, each stage ranging from 30 to 90 kilometers. At the end of each stage, runners spend the night in tents together. “Tent time” each night is Batchen’s favorite part of the MDS. “Every night in the tent is spent bonding as a family. There are people from all over the US, coming from very different walks of life sharing the same highs and lows as you each day,” Batchen said. “The fact that you help pull each other through is what separates this ultra-marathon from other running events. You rely on them to make you laugh and keep you going.” Another unique aspect of the race is its last leg, known as the “solidarity stage.” This section is timed, but does not count in the overall ranking of the race, allowing the fastest and slowest runners to tackle the end of the MDS together. Batchen believes the way the race is structured allows elite marathoners and weekend runners to share the same experience of pushing themselves to their limits. Each person running the race inspires their loved ones at home, and, according to Batchen, this is a huge source of motivation during the hardest days of the marathon. “When I’m running up the highest dunes or facing the hottest days, I just keep reminding myself to be a good example to my kids,” Batchen said. “Just by being here, I am showing them that with perseverance and dedication you can do anything you want.” Placing the venom extractor neatly into its pouch and burying it back in his bag, Batchen wrapped up his pre-race bag-check. Early the next morning, the group would be taking a six-hour bus ride to the still-unknown location of the race’s start. As he continued packing up, all the runners split off to buy some last-minute items and double check their equipment. All but one. Despite being an experienced ultra-marathoner, Juliet Brundige wanted to perfect how to use a compass before entering the desert and starting her first MDS—she asked Batchen to help her practice.  Her first attempt failed. Her second followed suit. As Batchen took the compass to demonstrate again, he reminded Brundige of how tricky compasses could be. Especially when running in the dunes of the desert. “The important thing is to stay relaxed and not to give up,” Batchen said. “We will all make mistakes out there. But if we keep learning from each mistake, eventually we’ll stop making them.” He gave Brundige back the compass. “Now, try it again,” he said.

By Abdul Hafiz Ali Rabat – Kashmir is a veritable paradise on Earth, nestled between the Himalayan Mountains. Before my travels, I was warned of the many risks and dangers associated with traveling through the area. Thankfully, I ignored these warnings and ended up spending an incredible month in beautiful Kashmir.  As an avid traveler of Spanish and Filipino heritage, I often grapple with questions of identity and my own relation to different spaces when traveling around the world. I was excited to see how exploring Kashmir for a month would allow me to delve into this even more.  On January 10, 2019, I finally landed in the place I had spent seven years thinking about. The soundtrack for my journey was exclusively Kashmiri songs and I landed with classics like “Harmuk Bartal” and “Tamanna” playing in my ears.   Srinagar, a tenacious city of dreams. Dreams that the city’s streets would someday be filled with children playing cricket or football and adults sharing cups of “noon chai,” rather than seeing streets filled with camouflage uniforms instead.  As I pass through the streets of Lal Chowk, Srinagar’s famous center, I cannot help but notice that the guns do not seem at home in this beautiful winter landscape.  “Hafiz, come here!” my host Murtaza shouted enthusiastically, waving from the other side of the road as he saw me for the first time. He greeted me with a huge smile on his face, and I returned his salaam with excitement. As I was warmly welcomed into the vibrant city, I wondered to myself if I would soon be leaving a piece of my heart here when it was time to leave a month later.   As I passed through the various checkpoints, I began to see winter in a new light. I saw people with perfect beards, standing tall. I found myself in a city where the Islamic way of life and family values were completely part of the social fabric even while young Kashmiris were grappling with globalization and modernization.  I wore my first “pheran,” a traditional Kashmiri cloth and cozy winter tunic, which resembles the “gandora” of Morocco. During the coldest moments of my trip, I would frequently wrap myself within the protective layers of my “pheran,” tugging down the hood to trap the heat. While Murtaza was teaching me the basics of the Kashmiri language, I loved practicing how to say expressions like “Varai chu?”(How are you?) and found myself repeating them constantly.   My first week living with my host family was one of the most rewarding experiences in my life. Kashmir had been calling me since I first visited Al Aqsa in Palestine, Alhambra in the Andalucia region of Spain, and Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. And the trip did not disappoint; my time in Kashmir was fast becoming one of the happiest experiences I had ever had. The warmth and hospitality of my host family made my first experience of snow in Kashmir a magical experience. I had my first taste of “noon chai,” a traditional Kashmiri tea which is salty, an Iranian-influenced saffron tea dating back centuries, and “wazwan,” a delicious meat dish.  Overlooking the mountains surrounding the valley, I was overwhelmed with emotion as I took in the breathtaking views and pondered upon the rich cultures and history that these mountains had seen over the years. I yearned to know more about the people who have inhabited and continue to inhabit this beautiful corner of the world, as well as learning more about the place itself. I wanted to immerse myself in the culture, food, and ideas and then capture and share my incredible experiences and learnings. Unfortunately, the world has limited knowledge about Kashmir and it features commonly in sensationalist headlines when atrocities and political conflicts occur. But Kashmir was not created to have this narrative overshadow its warmth, positivity, and beauty.  Kashmiris deserve their own identity and to be appreciated for their rich culture and history, not just seen through the negative lens of conflict. It was February 9, and I was performing my last fajr prayer in the colony. My wonderful month with Murtaza was about to end, and I was really going to miss all of our incredible conversations.  However sad I felt, I knew that it was not goodbye. After all, goodbyes are only for people you will never see again, for experiences you know you will never live again. Kashmir had stolen my heart and I knew it would not be long before I came again. Kashmir truly changed me for the better. Until next time. Hasta la proxima vez.

Safi – The great South African struggler, Nelson Mandela, once said: “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” If we think through this proverb enough, we will surely conclude that there is no other way to achieve progress or change at any level of our life—socially, economically, politically, and intellectually. Many developed countries give education primary importance among all other sectors. Unfortunately, Morocco does not prioritize education. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 2018 international report about the quality of teaching, Morocco ranked 103rd out of 138 countries in the index for quality of teaching in universities and 74th for quality of teaching in elementary school. This very bad rank indicates that the Moroccan government does not value education in terms of human resources or financial support. The government does not provide enough teachers in different specialties and administrative assistants nor give sufficient funds to satisfy the requirements of the sector. A gradual breakdown in education in Morocco began nearly immediately after Morocco gained so-called independence in the late 1950s. The Moroccan government has launched several policy reviews to improve quality and access to education since then. Rebuilding the educational system in Morocco has gone through many stages, starting with the three and five-year plans in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s; then the National Charter for Education and Training in 2000; then the staging plan (2009-2012); and finally the strategic vision for reforming education and training (2015-2030). However, the series of “reforms” led to no reform at all; things just got worse. Students’ competence went down, and many other problems related to teaching came out. Many actors share the responsibility behind this failure, including the government, parents, teachers, and students, too. However, the biggest part of the responsibility lies with the government, specifically the Ministry of Education. The number of thorny problems and issues of teaching in Morocco is uncountable. To begin with, the government does not provide even the basic requirements of teaching for teachers and learning for learners. Most schools in every single region of Morocco are not well-equipped: They do not have contemporary technological devices which play an essential role in integrating students and making them eager to learn, such as laptops, video projectors, printers, etc. Taking this into account, many teachers, especially those of foreign languages like French, Spanish, and English, find many difficulties doing their work. For example, many teachers of English find themselves not teaching speaking and listening skills. Speaking and listening are crucial to the development of students’ pronunciation and offer a chance to be indirectly exposed to native speakers and the ability to extract information from speech. On the other hand, many schools and universities in Morocco are over-crowded; at schools, there are sometimes more than 44 students. Consequently, teachers have trouble controlling so many students, communicating with them, identifying each’s weaknesses and strengths, and designing tests and correcting them. In addition to this students cannot communicate and learn from each other. Group work, oral presentations, and project work becomes harder. This problem of over-crowding can be due to lack of teachers or enough classrooms or because schools are built small. Thirdly, teachers in Morocco lack motivation; they get low salaries which cannot cover even their own families’ basic needs. Teachers are then always looking for other sources of income, like doing part-time jobs, setting extra autonomous projects, or working in private schools. Their teaching in class then suffers. In the same vein, 55,000 Moroccan contractual teachers do not have psychological stability. They are always afraid of getting fired at any time, affecting the quality of their teaching negatively. They suffer from society’s lack of respect for them because of their administrative case and the annoyance and harassment of their bosses and colleagues at work sometimes. In the 2018-2019 academic year, many other problems floated to the surface. Students all over the country demonstrated to abolish summer time adopted by the government year-round. Students claim that this timing is harmful for them because they have to wake up early in the morning when it is still dark. They also claim that the period of time between the morning class and the evening class is not enough for them to have their lunch, change their books and copybooks, and do other necessary activities, especially for those who live far from schools. Another issue which obstructs our educational system is the wrong guidance and orientation of students. In the first 12 years of learning in Morocco—elementary, middle, and high school—students must study and pass a huge number of different scientific and literary subjects. Then they get their Baccalaureate degrees. After that, they must choose only one subject to specialize in. So why should we bombard students with so many subjects from the very beginning if at the end they must choose only one? In my opinion it is a time and effort consuming orientation. I suggest we instead help students choose their favorite field of study in which they excel immediately after primary school. That would help improve their performances and achievements in the specialty they choose. Finally, we have a problem with textbooks. As a teacher of English, I want to talk about the textbooks used to teach English in our schools. There are many criticisms to mention. First, the majority of the textbooks are outdated in content. For example, some passages and grammar example sentences talk about celebrities that are long gone from the public consciousness. Consequently, students find the exercises uninteresting and get bored. Second, there is a real problem in the distribution of textbooks used in different regions of Morocco. The degree of difficulty in textbooks differs from one to another, so why does the government set a certain textbook for all teachers to use in a specific region? Why not allow them to choose the textbooks they like or even design their own with worksheets according to the students’ abilities? Of course this should be done in accordance with the main guidelines of teaching English in Morocco. An additional problem concerning the textbooks is that different streams use the same textbooks. This is illogical because each stream has its own specifications. For example, students doing scientific majors have three hours a week to study the book, while students doing literary majors have four or five hours a week. Not only this, but teachers have difficulty covering the whole textbook, especially with second Baccalaureate classes because they are so intensive. Finding a real solution to recover our Moroccan educational system is as hard as finding a cure for a serious chronic disease or trying to revive a dead person. Any kind of change must focus most on both teachers and students since they are the essential elements in the teaching/learning process and the backbone of the educational system. As for teachers, the government has to provide them with enough training. Training should last for at least one year in the regional centers of training. It should not be superficial but rather strong enough to equip teachers with the basic pedagogical methods and styles of teaching and learning to make their teaching effective. Moreover, even after their appointment to a post there must be continuous accompaniment and supervision over teachers to assess their work regularly and ensure that the job is done well. The government should also give teachers more privileges to motivate them and to value their jobs, such as increasing their salaries, reducing the age of retirement, and others to improve their social and economic circumstances. At the same time, teachers, too, should work on themselves and realize that they are real leaders in the classroom and in the whole school. They should act as facilitators, supporters, and guides for their students. They should not use their symbolic authority negatively but instead, they should accompany students, befriend them, and give them the chance to speak their opinions, suggestions, and feelings about the learning experience. Teachers must engage students as possible in the teaching/learning context, taking into consideration what they need and what they like and dislike. At the end, students are the center of the educational system. For students, the state should really work hard to lower the drop-out rate because it is one of the most dangerous phenomena that threatens education in Morocco. This can be done through the real implementation and generalization of the “Tayssir” facilitation program that gives funding to parents to formally enroll children aged 6 to 15 in schools. The state should also distribute free books, school bags, and bikes; build more boarding schools for those who live far away from schools; and start schools in rural areas to provide a means of access to public high schools. Parents also take a very influential part of the responsibility concerning the current situation of education. Parents do not play their real role anymore. They are the first and continuing educators of their children, so they should invest in early childhood education, trying to firmly implant basic life principles, public ethics, and social values. Parents must educate their children with passion and love for learning. Not only this but parents should always support and encourage their children’s education by providing a clean home, exposing them to cultural activities, and keeping books and other educational materials available. Needless to say, students are the center of the learning process. But many Moroccan students like to go to school just to waste time and make trouble with teachers and the administration. Others go to school to show off their muscles in front of their friends. This causes many conflicts with their teachers, obstructing learning since the focus never stays on learning for students and on teaching for teachers. The majority of students’ main concern is to get good grades in the exams to pass from one level to another, even if that means cheating instead of concentrating on acquiring new information, knowledge, and skills. In a nutshell, reforming our educational system is very complex and will take a lot of time to accomplish. The government, parents, teachers, and students should all work together to develop education in Morocco. The state and policy makers should also prioritize education over everything else like in many developed countries which believe education is the starting point for any kind of progress and change. Eventually, I hope that everyone involved in education will stop blaming each other because responsibility for the degradation in schools lies with all of us.

Rabat – Morocco’s increased purchases of military equipment has caught the eyes of its Spanish neighbor, with the European country’s military circles sounding an alarm bell about Rabat’s increasing “military might.” While Spain has no reason to fear strikes from Morocco, Spanish military officials reacted in a mix of worry and fascination at the recent announcement of Morocco purchasing 25 US-manufactured F-16s, according to El Confidential, a Spanish outlet said to be close to the country’s military circles. According to the Spanish newspaper, Morocco is on course to match Spain’s military capabilities, especially in air striking capacity. The paper especially cited the newly-acquired F-16s and Morocco’s “growing jet fighters fleet,” noting the purchases have “modernized” and “sophisticated” Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces (FAR). While the big investments in FAR have especially attracted the attention of the Spanish military establishment, the newspaper explained that previous purchases for other military departments did not go unnoticed. It said that top Spanish army officials have been closely following Rabat’s investments in “last generation equipments to modernize” its land, air, and marine forces. Prior to the colossal investments in upgrading its air forces, Rabat had spent a considerable amount on its infantry and navy. In April 2018, Morocco received 162 third-generation US-made Abrams tanks as part of a 2017-agreed $115 million deal with the Pentagon. In the same year, Rabat purchased over 1,200 state-of-the-art antitank missiles, according to the Spanish paper. Topping the list of Morocco’s security-related efforts are, its first and second Mohammed VI satellites, launched within a very short interval of time. El Confidentiel said the two satellites will provide Morocco with cutting-edge accuracy in territorial surveillance. Commenting on El Confidentiel’s article in its April 5 edition, Moroccan outlet Al Ahdath Al Maghribia remarked, “As it continues expanding its military basis, Morocco can now face any challenges.” Taking pride in the Spanish newspaper’s assessment of Morocco’s “growing might,” Al Ahdath Al Maghribia explained that one factor that may give Morocco the upper hand in any prospective confrontation is the “sheer size” of Moroccan forces. While Spain and Morocco have similar air capabilities, Morocco’s number of military personnel is by far the highest. At the same time, however, the Spanish navy is better equipped and far stronger than the Moroccan navy, according to both newspapers. Morocco’s active personnel was estimated at 195,000 in 2018, compared to over 121,000 for Spain. The papers noted that Morocco has not invested much in its naval forces in recent years. Instead, Rabat has overwhelmingly focused on its infantry and air forces. The choice, the papers asserted, suggests that Polisario and Algeria are Morocco’s most urgent preoccupation. Morocco is on good terms with its European neighbor and has only traditionally been engaged in an arms race with neighboring Algeria, which it accuses of financing and training Polisario troops. While the paper’s assessment of Morocco’s “security preoccupations” is backed by evidence from the country’s most recent history of military actions, it remains to be seen whether confrontation will Polisario and Algeria will come any time soon. Despite their perceived irreconcilable disagreements on the Western Sahara territorial dispute, there are indications that neither side is prioritizing confrontation, in spite of threats of military action. Fearing that confrontation may cause more harm than good for the region—and for local Sahrawis—the parties are currently engaged in a UN-moderated settlement process for a “negotiated and mutually acceptable” solution.

Rabat – At the sixth annual conference on insurance and reinsurance in Casablanca April 3-4, participants vowed to pave the way for the digitalization of insurance in an age of “unprecedented and relentless technological disruptions.” Initiated five years ago as a platform for networking and collaboration on insurance and reinsurance policies, especially for practitioners from emerging countries, the Casablanca event has incrementally become a meeting point to discuss the latest advances and challenges facing the industry globally. This year’s event, themed “The New Borders of Insurance,” featured panels on the threats of artificial intelligence, cyber-criminality, and other new challenges unnerving insurance professionals. In a press release shared with MWN, the event’s organizers highlighted the critical changes that “relentless digitization” has brought to the global insurance and reinsurance conversation. With new changes come new opportunities and challenges, the statement noted. It stressed that themes like climate change, cyber-crimes, and Artificial Intelligence, which were once marginally mentioned in the reinsurance world, “have become the new challenges of the industry” and were “the essential themes of the 16 panels” of this year’s Casablanca gathering. Speaking at a panel on “Financial stability in the MENA Region” on April 3, Ibrahim Obaid Al Zaabi, head of the UAE’s Insurance Authority, echoed the general sentiment, saying that the industry should integrate new emerging risks. “Yesterday’s risks are irrelevant today. The world is constantly shifting, and so are risks,” Al Zaabi said. Other discussions revolved around “regulation vs. innovation,” “developing resilience in the face of cyber-criminality,” “managing global health and climate hazards,” and “the current and future challenges of insurance in Africa.” While addressing the topics from what looked like fundamentally different perspectives, the large majority of speakers agreed that the industry’s emerging trends should not be solely viewed as challenges or threats. However disruptive, they argued, the digital age also comes with enormous opportunities. As the industry looks to grow and thrives despite numerous emerging challenges, the task of insurance professionals lies in minimizing the cost of technological advances while capitalizing on profits and opportunities. “As insurers, risk is our primary material,” said Stephane Pennet of the French Insurance Federation.

Rabat – Eleven Amazigh (Berber) associations and groups have backed the government’s proposed bill to use French as a language of instruction for scientific subjects in schools.  The associations and groups gave a joint statement regarding the draft Law 51.17 for education, arguing that those who stubbornly advocate for the teaching of scientific and technical subjects in Arabic are driven by ideology.  “Their move,” read the join statement, “will have adverse effects on the the quality of education.” The groups stressed that attempting to maintain the teaching of science in Arabic contradicts the essence of science and is only for political point scoring.  The controversy surrounding the language of instruction, which has up until now been standard Arabic, at middle and high schools has created a wide rift between decision makers.  The draft Law 51.17 was set to be voted on in the first meeting of an extraordinary session on Monday, April 1, but it was later put off indefinitely. Members of the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) turned against the bill, which had already been approved by the heads of political parties. PJD deputies especially dispute Article 13 of the draft bill, and do not want scientific subjects to be entirely taught in French.  On the grounds of opening up to other languages and cultures, the groups and associations expressed support for embracing foreign languages at lower levels of education, while endorsing the teaching of literary subjects in Morocco’s two official languages, Arabic and Tamazight (Berber). The organizations are calling on the Ministry of Education to ground their curricula in what best highlights Morocco and the Moroccan identity, while giving primacy to the two official languages without favoring one over the other.  It especially emphasized free education to ensure equal access to education to all members of society, while protecting the dignity of all teachers.  Former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane has publicly condemned the draft law calling it the “Frenchification” of Morocco’s education system, urging the government to abandon French and continue using Arabic instead.  He considers the bill a dishonor to the decades-long Arabization process that began after independence in 1956.

Ouarzazate – With the goal of connecting creative young minds with business experts, the Morocco Youth Association will be hosting the sixth Moroccan Entrepreneurship Forum April 10-13. The forum will be held in its annual location of Ouarzazate, a desert city roughly 200 kilometers southeast of Marrakech. Because of capacity constraints, the forum can only host a limited number of participants—in order to attend, individuals must have applied and been accepted. This year, the association received more than 1,000 applications from nearly a dozen cities across Morocco. Only 180 gained admittance. By using the forum to bring together young minds with professionals, the association hopes to cultivate entrepreneurial ideas that will benefit Moroccan society in the future. “We want to develop the spirit of entrepreneurship in the youth today because this could lead to the growth of all other industries in Morocco,” Marieme Thomson, a communications coordinator at the association who has helped plan the last four forums, told Morocco World News. “Entrepreneurship is at the heart of many Moroccan cities. If we can cultivate this, all of Morocco will grow.” At the forum, participants will have the opportunity to meet employers and business experts one-on-one. During these meetings, participants are expected to pitch new ideas and develop relationships with potential employers. All of the opportunities the forum provides are available to both Moroccans and migrants. “Through entrepreneurship, everyone can be a benefit to society,” Thomson said. “We hope to give all people the same foundation in order for them to create the best businesses.” Twelve of this year’s participants are originally from sub-Saharan African countries. While this is only roughly 7% of the participants, Thomson hopes the number will grow as the event does. While the Morocco Youth Association’s focus is on growing in Ourazazate and spreading to other cities, the association has already received several invitations to host entrepreneurship forums in other African countries. According to Thomson, this potential international partnership is still in the earliest stages of development. “Our dream is that the forum will be held every month in every major city in Morocco and than eventually across all of Africa,” Thomson said. “We know this is a big dream, but we remind ourselves that everything the forum is right now, was also once just a big dream.”

Rabat – Vivo Energy Maroc, an oil company that owns the rights to market Shell brand fuels and Butagaz brand liquefied petroleum gas in Morocco, has announced the introduction of a “revolutionary” new fuel, “Shell-V Power Lead Free,” into the Moroccan market. On Thursday, the company said that the new Shell fuel generation is designed for improved engine performance and efficiency, featuring Dynaflex technology to clean and protect key engine components, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. The new generation is also recommended by Scuderia Ferrari. The fuel contains three times more cleaning and friction-reducing molecules to improve engine efficiency and performance molecules to improve engine efficiency and performance. During the launch of the new fuel generations, the CEO of Vivafar Energy Morocco, Asaf V. Sasaoglu, said that the new fuel meets their “commitment to offer Moroccan drivers the best-perfromaning fuels of Shell to make them live a unique driving experience.” He added that his ambition is to maintain the company’s position as a leader in Morocco for innovation and quality. The company added that the fuels are also the result of several years of research and development by Shell international experts with intensive testing over more than 3 million kilometers and more than 250 cars. Created with Dynaflex technology, the product depends on formulas developed specifically to preserve the efficiency of the engine and help get the most energy from each drop of fuel, Sasaoglu said. The fuel is also designed to meet the demands of modern and older vehicles. In December 2018, Viva Energy Maroc inaugurated a new service station in Bouskoura Park in Casablanca. Founded in 2011, Vivo Energy Maroc has 330 service stations and 600 employees. The Shell brand has been present in Morocco since 1922.

Japanese car supplier Mitsui Kinzoku ACT launched the construction of a plant that will produce door lock mechanisms on Tuesday at Tangier Automotive City. The first of its kind in Africa, the 20,026-square-meter plant will cost the company €12.5 million. The company said that the project will benefit from the “strategic geographical position in Morocco.” The plant seeks to supply the company’s customers based in Morocco and Europe, including car manufacturing sites of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance. The Japanese group chose Tangier also for its proximity to the Tangier Med Port complex and the maritime connectivity it offers. The first phase includes the construction of a 5,600-square-meter production center with assembly lines and a 1,200-square-meter administrative building, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. The factory will produce the latest generation of door locking mechanisms in the automotive industry. The project is set to offer 100 people jobs in its initial phase and is expected to reach 300 people eventually. Morocco’s Minister of Industry and Trade Moulay Hafid Elalamy and the governor of the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region, Mohamed Mhidia, attended the launching ceremony. Elalamy said that this opening will achieve certain success, noting that the Japanese group “is one of the key suppliers of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, and will have to contribute to the reinforcement of the added value of the automotive sector in Morocco.” The Moroccan official emphasized “the strategic objective of enhancing local integration,” emphasizing that Morocco, thanks to the King’s royal instruction, is in a position “to offer high quality services to support investment and establish an integrated industrial ecosystem.” Mitsui Kinzoku ACT Corporation has more than 10 industrial sites worldwide and some 6,400 employees. The company’s customers include Toyota, FCA, Honda, Ford, and Subaru. Morocco is also becoming a key supplier for European auto factories, attracting several investors to build plants making car parts, including Nexteer, Gestamp, Ficosa, and Fiat subsidiary Magneti Marelli.

Rabat – The Spanish cabinet will provide rescue training and boats to Morocco to stop undocumented migrants between the two countries. Spanish media outlet El Diario quoted sources from the Spanish navy on Thursday, who said that the operation is part of a “cooperation project financed by the European Union,” to increase the “search and rescue capacity of Morocco.” The strategy aims to help Morocco get undocumented immigrants back to their point of departure before reaching Spain. The news outlet added that Morocco and Spain had a series of negotiations in recent months on how to stop undocumented migrants’ boats from reaching Spain. The Spanish general director of the merchant navy, Benito Nunez, and former director of maritime rescue Ignacio Lopez discussed migration issues, emphasizing Spain’s intention to provide training and help to the Moroccan navy, according to the outlet. Madrid has been Rabat’s most steadfast supporter at the EU. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called on the EU last year to give Morocco more funding. Sanchez also visited Morocco in November 2018, his first official trip to Morocco. During the visit, Sanchez held several meetings with senior Moroccan officials to consolidate their collaborations, including their fight against undocumented migration. A royal visit followed Sanchez’s political visit. In mid-February, the Spanish monarch King Felipe VI visited Morocco with his wife, Queen Letizia.

Rabat – Contractual teachers in Morocco are planning to stage another three-day strike in Rabat on April 8-10.  After the Ministry of Education threatened to dismiss teachers and cut their salaries if they did not return to their jobs, the teachers said they would keep striking.  The self-proclaimed Coordination of Teachers Forced into Contracts (CNPCC) threatened to extend the strike for another week.  Contractual teachers have been leading protests for more than a month against what they perceive as the government’s neglect of their demands. They condemn the government’s “punitive and retaliatory measures,” referring to the cutting of wages, presumably during the time teachers were not working, as well as the government’s threats to fire them.  The CNPCC called on the Ministry of Education to rehire dismissed teachers and those who failed qualifying exams but are retaking them. They also requested  suspending qualifying examinations until their demands are met. Contractual teachers are demanding to be hired into the public sector through the Ministry of Education. They also called on the government to sort out the problem of teachers who have not been promoted from the 9th pay grade, known as “cell 9 teachers.” Although Minister of Education Said Amzazi stated on multiple occasions that Morocco would abolish recruitment of teachers under fixed-term contracts and integrating of teachers within regional academies, the teachers are doubtful of the decisions.  The education ministry promises to ensure equality among all teachers and abolish recruitment under contract. The ministry also stated it would guarantee contractual teachers automatic integration and the possibility of attaining off-scale salaries. However, the CNPCC has expressed outright rejection of government proposals.  Following the education minister’s warnings, contractual teachers are doubling on their commitment to strike, going so far as to say they may strike all year, making it a “blank year.”  Amzazi accused the protesting teachers of hindering education. He also questioned the legality and legitimacy of the CNPCC, discrediting the organization as a source of “incitement.” In late March, police used water cannons to disperse protesting teachers. Some teachers reported the use of excessive violence, which left some wounded. Government Spokesperson Mustapha el Khalfi stated at the start of the protests that the government would not relinquish recruitment under fixed-term contracts.  But the minister of education has most recently contradicted that position, stating that the government will abandon recruiting teaching personnel on fixed-term contracts. In the meantime, the country’s education system is caught in a tug of war between proponents of standard Arabic and French as languages of instruction for scientific subjects.

Rabat – The interception was possible thanks to information from the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST). The bust, which was carried out 45 kilometers southwest of the city of M’hamid El Ghizlane, took place following preliminary investigations and searches, according to a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). A judicial inquiry was subsequently conducted under the supervision of the prosecutor’s office, with the aim of identifying the suspects and establishing links to drug trafficking rings.  This is the latest in a string of drug busts that the DGSN and DGST have undertaken in recent months. In December, authorities arrested seven individuals linked to a criminal network that smuggled cocaine between Morocco, the US, Latin America, and Europe. Boubker Sbik, the spokesperson for Morocco’s security services, said coordination between DGSN and DGST enabled the seizure of more than 65 tons of cocaine and 43 tons of cannabis last year. Security services are also cracking down on ecstasy drugs. On Tuesday, April 4, Tangier prefectural police arrested four suspects on Thursday for possession of 30,00 ecstasy pills. The DGSN stated that the arrests are part of its intense search operations to combat drug dealing.

Rabat – In the wake of a global coalition against ideology-linked violence and intolerance, several senior UN officials have touted Pope Francis’ visit to Morocco as an important step in the fight against religious intolerance.   They have argued that beyond its symbolic significance of the papal visit, the papal visit could had perceptible impact on the North African country and may hopefully prove as important for interfaith dialogue and peace beyond Moroccan borders.  The High Representative of the UN Alliance of Civilizations, Miguel Angel Moratinos, commented on  Pope Francis visit to Morocco, emphasizing that the trip was “historic.” “This visit is also part of the will of two great personalities, His Holiness Pope Francis and His Majesty King Mohammed VI, who both have a roadmap to show that belonging to a religion and to a culture should not be an obstacle, but on the contrary, an element of mutual understanding and respect for each other’s part,” Moratinos said. Pope Francis visited Morocco on March 30-31. During his two-day stay in the North African country, the pontiff met with King Mohammed VI and several senior Moroccan officials. On March 30, the King and the Pope signed a Jerusalem appeal, a document meant to raise awareness on the Palestine-Israel crisis and preserve the multi-religious status of the city. Jerusalem is considered a holy site for all three Abrahamic religions. Earlier this week, Stephane Dujarric, the spokesperson of the United Nations Secretary-General, commented on the pope’s Moroccan visit. In his comments, Dujarric joined the chorus of voices that have hailed the historic significance of the papal visit in terms of advancing earlier this week. According to the UN spokesperson, the Jerusalem appeal reflects the UN’s position on the status of Jerusalem.  The document, Dujarric noted,“goes along the lines of what the Secretary-General has been saying for a quite long time, that Jerusalem has a sacred character for Jews, for Christians and Muslims and that it needs to be preserved.” The pope’s visit to Morocco is “extremely important and extremely symbolic,” he added.

Rabat – Casablanca’s Court of Appeal has upheld the sentences against the 54 activists detained for their participation in unauthorized protests in the Hirak Rif, which broke out in the Al Hoceima province in 2016 and 2017. The court made its ruling its on Friday night around midnight. Dozens of Moroccans protested in front of the Casablanca Court of Appeal to show solidarity with the activists on Friday before the appeal session. The protesters demanded the immediate release of the protesters . In June 2018, a Casablanca court gave sentences varying from 1 to 20 years to 54 Hirak activists for participating in  “unauthorized” Hirak protests. Nasser Zefzafi, prominent Hirak activist, received 20 years. Activist Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid also received 20 years in prison, while Zakaria  Adehchour, Mohamed Haki, and Mohamed Bouhenouch received 15 years in prison. Moroccan journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui was sentenced to 3 years in prison. Today, before the judges in the courtroom, El Mahdaoui said, “I am your son and your brother, the song of this country.” “When I get out of prison, I will not hate anyone. I love this country with all its institutions.” Addressing the judges, Mahdaoui said “issue a fair judgment.” In 2016 and 2017, police arrested about 400 activists and protesters involved in the Hirak Rif protests in northern Morocco. The Hirak began in October 2016 after the death of Mohcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Islamic Affairs announced on Friday that the first day of Sha’ban, the eight month in the Islamic or Hijri calendar will be on Sunday, April 7 (Sha’ban 1, 1440). In a statement, the ministry said that it observed the lunar crescent of the eight month of the Islamic calendar after the sunset. Other countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt also announced that the first day of Sha’ban will be on Sunday. The eight month of the Islamic calendar is the month that precedes the holy month of Ramadan. Morocco is expected to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan on May 5 or 6. In 2018, Ramadan started in Morocco on May 17.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI called for collective action in remarks he sent to the annual meeting of the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) in Marrakech, which opened officially on April 5.  The King’s message explained that IsDB member countries face a multitude of challenges and must collaborate to surmount them. “The aim is to serve our nations and contribute to economic development and to our peoples’ social advancement,” the King  said. Each year, IsDB’s annual meeting gathers politicians, development specialists, and bank staff to deliberate on the latest matters of development. This year’s theme, “Transformation in a changing world,” is a reference to IsDB’s call for a new development strategy—one that intersects with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). IsDB is based in Saudi Arabia and has 57 member countries, though it works with Muslim communities worldwide. On April 3, it announced it would create a Global Muslim Philanthropy Fund for Children with UNICEF, in another sign of increased collaboration with the UN. The announcement that its 2019 meeting would take place in Marrakech cemented Morocco’s status as one of the bank’s strongest partners. Last year, the bank launched a multimillion dollar fund in Rabat for science and technology, and has since promised to increase its financial assistance to the kingdom over the next three years. While the IsDB has done much to promote solidarity and development in the Islamic world, the King said in a message his advisor Omar Kabbaj read to attendees, it must do more to push collaboration. “We believe that our progress and our development cannot be envisaged without the advancement of sister nations on the African continent,” he said.

Rabat – A Marrakech National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) unit has arrested two Israeli nationals carrying fake Moroccan documents, including a national ID card and a travel document, a statement from the police has indicated. In the press release, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) explained that the two suspects are believed to have links with a Moroccan birth and travel documents forging network which a joint BNPJ and DGSN operation dismantled in March in Casablanca. The statement noted that the two suspects carried a Moroccan national ID and a passport, with both documents believed to have been delivered by the network the authorities dismantled last month. In addition to the fake Moroccan documents, police investigations have also found that one of the suspects held “a residency card of a Latin American country.” The residency card’s authenticity is being verified, according to the DGSN statement. The two suspects are currently in police custody as investigations continue to shed further light on the document-falsifying network. When it was dismantled in March, the network thought to have provided the two suspects with the Moroccan documents had been active in selling fake Moroccan birth documents.   Earlier police investigations have established that that the network is headed by Moroccans, including a Moroccan Jew, who have been active in selling fake Moroccan IDs to non-Moroccan Jews.

Rabat – Brazilian superstar Neymar Junior has accepted an invitation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to visit Israel, receiving backlash from his fans supporting the Palestinian cause. Both Netanyahu and Bolsonaro recorded a video from the Western Wall in Jerusalem to invite Neymar and other athletes, including the two-time surfing world champion Gabriel Medina. Read Also: Moroccan, Catholic Representatives Submit Jerusalem Appeal to UN Chief Neymar, who currently plays for the Paris Saint Germain football club, responded to their invitation through a recorded video. “Hello Bibi and Bolsonaro.

The invitation came as part of celebrating the opening of a new trade mission from Brazil to Israel in the region, which Palestine also objected to. – Netanyahu, Bolsonaro, Neymar e Medina pelo Sucesso de Brasil e Israel. pic.twitter.com/ixoyspZEyI — Jair M. Bolsonaro (@jairbolsonaro) April 2, 2019  According to Reuters, Palestine is considering recalling its ambassador in Brazil after the move. The Palestinian ambassador in Brazil, Ibrahim Alzeban, told Reuters that Palestine might recall him.  Brazil may also follow the US’s path in moving its embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Brazilian Presidential Spokesman Otavio Rego seemed to deny the rumors on a potential embassy move, emphasizing that the trade mission would not be a diplomatic representation. “Our president continues to evaluate this possibility [of moving the embassy], but that is not what we decided at this time,” said the Brazilian spokesman. Palestinians, according to Reuters, were also angry that Bolsonaro did not “consider a visit to the Palestinian territories and did not coordinate his trip with Palestinian authorities.” Bolsonaro and Netanyahu visited the Western Wall on Monday. Bolsonaro became the first head of state to do so with an Israeli premier. In December 2018, Barcelona star Lionel Messi was criticized after he decided to join the Beitar Jerusalem fan club. Messi has long faced scrutiny for his relationship with Israel.  In 2013, Messi and his club, FC Barcelona, visited Israel on a peace tour, where a photo emerged of him kneeling at the wall with a Jewish yarmulke. The photos drew criticism from many Arabs who said he was alienating many from his Muslim fanbase with his actions.

Rabat – Crowds in hundreds of thousands flood Milan each year for the Salone del Mobile, the world’s premier furniture and interior design fair. The event fills the city with top-of-the-line designers and their newest, most extravagant collections. This year, April 9-14, the renowned Moroccan designer Hicham Lahlou will exhibit alongside them, as he flies to Italy to display his design project “African Sounds.” The work is a collaboration with Italian brand CITCO—a leading designer in marble—and, like many of Lahlou’s designs, it celebrates African art and diversity. “African Sounds” constructs an African continent using marble castanets, like those of Moroccan Gnawa music. The piece is a tribute to Moroccan identity and, at the same time, the wealth and breadth of African culture, the many castanets interlocking to form a single whole.  The Medinit Expo in Casablanca featured “African Sounds” in 2018, but April will be its first venture onto the world stage. The exhibition solidifies Lahlou’s reputation as one of Africa’s most significant designers. Museums like the Vitra Design Museum, the Guggenheim Bilbao, and the Kunsthal Rotterdam have all shown his work, and he serves on the board of the World Design Organization. But despite Lahlou’s international success, Morocco remains at the heart of his craft. Most recently, he worked with local craftsmen to design and furnish the elegant interiors of Morocco’s new high-speed train stations, which launched late last year. The Salone del Mobile will further recognize Lahlou next week at a concert by the Filarmonica della Scala orchestra, where he will be a guest of honor.

Rabat – The culture and traditions of Morocco’s gate to the Sahara Desert, Zagora, charmed the attendees of the first Morocco Day in Washington, D.C. The Moroccan American Network (MAN), an organization that creates opportunities for Moroccan small businesses in the US chose the city of Zagora as the first guest of honor of the symposium, which will be held annually. In addition to Zagora, the Moroccan American Network is seeking to spotlight several other cities to honor the twelve regions of Morocco. The CEO of the MAN, Mohamed Hajjam, said that the program will be “extended” until the network goal is achieved. The network’s goal, according to El Hajjam, is to highlight regions unknown to Americans. The program seeks to contribute to the development of the regions for the interest of its residents. Discover the beautiful southern city, Zagora Moroccan musician Nouamane Lahlou attended the symposium, where his song “Beautiful Zagora” was played. The song describes Zagora’s traditions and hospitable people. Zagora is known for its palms and the river which passes through the city.  The region is home to many palaces and fortresses, called ksours and kasbahs, which attract local and international tourists. Moroccans and US citizens celebrated Morocco Day on March 29, after the mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser, declared the day “Morocco Day.” On that day Mayor Justin Wilson of the nearby city of Alexandria, Virginia, announced that he would make June 9 an annual day to celebrate Moroccan culture and history. The event will feature Moroccan Gnawa music and jazz.

Rabat – Morocco’s Atlas  Lions dropped two more places in the most recent FIFA ranking, now sitting at 45th out of all international football teams in April. The football team also lost places in the African regional ranking, sitting in fourth behind Senegal (first), Tunisia (second), and Nigeria (third). FIFA’s February ranking put Morocco 43rd globally and third in Africa. Morocco’s position was impacted by the Atlas Lions’ latest two games in March. The Atlas Lions recently played their last Africa Cup of Nations qualifier match against Malawi, which ended 0-0, on March 22. The Atlas Lions also lost their friendly game against Argentina 0-1 on March 26. The Atlas Lions are now preparing for the continental championship, known as AFCON or Africa Cup of Nations (CAN), which will begin in Egypt in June.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI is expected to visit the city of Fez on Sunday, April 7.  Civil services members are preparing for the royal visit by cleaning and setting up flags in preparation for the monarch’s visit, a source told Morocco World News Friday.  The source added that the King is expected to inaugurate socio-economic projects in the city.  The visit may also include the inauguration of an aeronautics economic free zone, the first of its kind in the Fez-Meknes region. The industrial zone will be inaugurated in Ain Cheggag, a town in the Fez-Meknes region, according to MWN’s source. The state-owned news agency has not reported any updates about the possible free zone, a project that was unveiled by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani in January 2018. El Othmani said that the government is “reflecting on the subject in collaboration with the Ministries of Industry, Investment, Finance as well as Education and the local officials.” He also expressed hope that the project’s implementation would offer more job opportunities. “All the parties concerned by this project will work together to make it come true, and convince investors of its importance and urgency,” El Othmani stated. In addition to the automotive industry, the aeronautics sector has been fruitful for Morocco, as it boosted its economic performance. The geographical strategy of the kingdom attracted several international firms to build factories in Morocco, using it as a gateway to Europe and Africa. The Oxford Business Group said in March in an overview about Morocco’s economy that Morocco’s plans to promote economic development through investment “has witnessed success, in particular in the automotive and aeronautics sectors.” Oxford said that industry contributed an average of about 19 percent to GDP, and “in 2017 this increased, raising the sector’s contribution to around 25% of GDP.”  In March local media reported that the King would visit the city to launch socioeconomic projects. The King’s last visit to the cultural and spiritual capital of Morocco was in August 24, 2018.

Rabat – Members of the European Parliament are urging Morocco to release Nasser Zefzafi, a leader of popular protests in 2016 and 2017 known as Hirak, in the Amazigh (Berber) northern region of Morocco.  The MPs also recognized the Hirak leader as one of the three finalists for Europe’s 2018 Zakharov Prize for Freedom of Conscience. Police arrested Zefzafi in May 2017, and a court sentenced him to 20 years in prison in June 2018. The MPs delivered the letter  to Morocco’s justice minister Mohamed Aujjar on Wednesday, April 3, to express their concern “about the conditions of imprisonment of all the activists of the popular movement of the Rif, especially Nasser Zefzafi.” #Rif_Military_Territory
MEPs are calling Moroccan justice to order!
In a letter sent to Moroccan Justice Minister Mohamed Aujjar, Members of the European Parliament demanded that the suffering of Nasser Zafzafi.@xabierbenito @MiguelUrban @mattcarthy @LolaPodemos @MCVergiat pic.twitter.com/9ySKRtwY28 — Arif Tweets 🎗️ (@Arrif_Tweets) April 3, 2019 While Morocco’s National Human Rights Council states that “Mr. Zefzafi’s health does not raise any concerns,” the 25 MPs are especially concerned about his state of health, which they claim “has seriously deteriorated in recent weeks.” Urging the Moroccan government to allow for dialogue between all parties involved, the MPs called attention to the suffering of the activists’ families.  “The families of the prisoners have made us aware of the suffering of attending the court in Casablanca, which is 600 kilometers away from their homes and which has already lasted 18 months.” Nasser Zefzafi and three other activists are serving 20-year prison terms. A Casablanca court sentenced 54 Hirak activists to prison terms ranging from 1 to 20 years on June 26 and 28, 2018, 11 of whom received a royal pardon in August 2018.  The Hirak activists were convicted of plotting to undermine the security of the state.  The activists appealed their sentences, and their trial began in January. The Casablanca Court of Appeals is expected to return a verdict today after the original court date of March 26 was delayed. When the appeal trial began, Zefzafi accused the court of carrying out an unfair trial and vowed to boycott upcoming court hearings.  Amnesty International also deplored the “unfair trials” and “heavy prison sentences.”  Amnesty’s Middle East and North Africa Director Heba Morayef stated, “These convictions are unsafe given the extremely unfair nature of the trials.” The Hirak protests started in October 2016 when a garbage truck, allegedly on orders from a police officer, crushed fishmonger Mohcine Fikri to death as he tried to retrieve his confiscated fish in the northern city of Al Hoceima.

Rabat – Othman Benjelloun, the chairman of Morocco’s BMCE Bank, has criticized the $1.1 billion deal between the Moroccan company Saham Finances and the South African insurance company Sanlam. Benjelloun, an influential voice in Morocco’s financial services industry, cited the political position of Pretoria on Western Sahara as the reason for his dissatisfaction with the deal. According to Bloomberg, Benjelloun told reporters in Casablanca Tuesday, “We end up with a South African investor, owning a company that was Moroccan, on our own territory.” The 88-year old businessman continued, “We aren’t going to hide that we have not appreciated this gesture.” Benjelloun’s anger stems from Pretoria’s support of the Polisario Front. The Moroccan billionaire stated the deal will garner his support if South Africa changes its stance on the conflict in Western Sahara.  “We will applaud the fact that Saham stays South African” when Pretoria changes track regarding Western Sahara, he said. “Until they do, they are not getting our support.” Sanlam is South Africa’s biggest insurance country. Sanlam acquired Saham Finances in its largest acquisition on October 11, 2018.  We’re pleased to announce the conclusion of SAHAM Finances acquisition, our biggest acquisition to date, transforming us into a leading financial services player in Africa. The next 100 years start today. https://t.co/xnPvuEshLH pic.twitter.com/0BYrEj3pcP — Sanlam (@sanlam) October 11, 2018 In 2016, Sanlam acquired a 30 percent stake in Saham Finances and increased its stake to 46.6 percent in 2017.The $1.1 billion deal turned over the remaining 53 percent stake in Saham Finances to South African Sanlam. Sanlam is now present in 33 African countries. The company’s most recent acquisition establishes its presence in North Africa. Sanlam will take over Saham Finance’s 65 subsidiaries, 700 branches, and more than 3,000 employees. Saham Finances recorded a turnover of $1.2 billion in 2017. At the end of 2017, Saham Finances consolidated net assets worth $850 million and earnings of $77.4 million. The South African company Sanlam responded to Othman Benjelloun’s most recent criticism of the deal.  “Sanlam is confident about the strength and sustainability of its partnership with Saham Finances, which commenced in early 2016. The Saham Finances’ board, Sanam (Sanlam’s partner in Morocco), the executive team and staff are fully supportive of the partnership and our efforts to build a Pan African insurance group,” the group said in a statement. Morocco and South Africa have long had tense diplomatic relations. In 2004, Pretoria recognized the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) as the legitimate government of an independent Western Sahara. Morocco’s ambassador to Pretoria hurriedly left his post in protest against South Africa’s decision. In early March of 2019, Pretoria and Rabat made advances in restoring diplomatic relations. South Africa accredited Morocco’s months-long-appointed ambassador, Youssef Amrani, to Pretoria, breaking nearly 15 years of diplomatic stalemate.

Rabat – Algeria is marking the seventh week of protests on Friday despite the resignation this week of former Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who faced backlash after announcing his intention to run for a fifth term and later to extend his fourth term and postpone the election. Facebook posts showed protesters carrying Amazigh (Berber), Algerian, and even Palestinian flags, demanding full victory over the political system.  Algerian demonstrators chanted in Arabic: “Leave means leave;” This is our country and we should impose our opinion;” “You robbed the country, you thieves;” and “One hero, the people.” On Wednesday, April 3, the government’s Constitutional Council confirmed Bouteflika’s resignation. Bouteflika’s resignation Tuesday followed nearly six weeks of mass protests throughout the country. The official Algerian news agency APS reported on Wednesday that the president of the Constitutional Council, Tayeb Belaiz, chaired a meeting in accordance with the Constitution’s Article 102. According to the news outlet, the article provides that “in the event of the resignation or death of the President of the Republic, the Constitutional Council shall meet and confirm the final vacancy of the presidency [office].” Who’s running now? The article also stipulates that the president of the Council of the Nation, the Parliament’s upper house, shall “assume the functions of the head of state for 90 days maximum during which presidential elections shall be held and the head of state appointed.” As head of the upper house, Abdelkader Bensalah will take over as an interim president. While observers were concerned about what might happen after the resignation of Bouteflika, some politicians argued that Bensalah could not serve as an interim president. The head of Algeria’s Justice and Development Front Party, Lakhdar Benkhellaf, emphasized that Bensalah cannot replace Bouteflika until elections as an interim because he was once Moroccan. Benkhellaf said that Bensalah has a “problem with his nationality of origin. The condition for a [leader] occupying the post of President of the Republic, is that he must have the Algerian nationality of origin. And he had another nationality until 1964 during which he had obtained Algerian nationality.” Military still in politics On Sunday, Bouteflika appointed a new government one day before his resignation on Tuesday. The new government is still in charge under the leadership of the interim president. Despite the Constitution’s text, which stipulates that the army should stay out of the government, the top army chief Gaid Salah has been re-appointed as deputy defense minister. Gaid Salah, a loyalist to Bouteflika, turned on the former president last week by demanding Bouteflika be called unfit for office in accordance with Article 102, leaving people scratching their heads. Salah also argued that Bouteflika should resign and meet the demands of the people. Critics and journalists expressed shock over Salah’s statements. Algerian journalist Hafid Derradji shared concerns on his Facebook, questioning Salah’s position to make such statements. For Derradji, Salah should not have a say because he had resigned after Bouteflika’s decision to not run for a fifth term. But when Bouteflika made his major reshuffle this week before resignation, Salah regained his post as deputy defense minister. The protests, which started on February 22, demanded complete reforms in the government, calling on those in power to step aside with slogans such as “Leave” and  in French, “System degage!” or “System, get lost.” It remains to be seen whether the current government will take control over the country or the people of Algeria will convince those in power to leave.

Rabat – Mustapha El Khalfi, the spokesperson of the Moroccan government, has emphasized that the UN Secretary-General’s draft report on the Western Sahara conflict proves Polisario’s violation of Security Council resolutions, including Resolution 2240. “The report, which establishes truths that were challenged by some parties, has clearly settled the issue” of Polisario’s violations, according to El Khalfi. On April 3, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) published extracts from the draft report, in which UN chief Antonio Guterres noted further violations in the region. The UN chief also addressed Polisario, emphasizing that their meetings with the UN peacekeeping mission, also known as MINURSO, should be in Rabouni, Algeria, and not east of the defense wall in Western Sahara. The report also recorded Polisario’s violations through building facilities in some regions it claimed as “liberated territories.” According to El Khalfi, the report refutes the propaganda maintained by the separatist group on its “liberated territories” claims. The report, according to the spokesperson, also “enshrines the sovereignty of Morocco on the Sahara as well as the exclusive role of the United Nations in the settlement of this artificial conflict.” El Khalfi said that the report discussed the positive impacts of Morocco’s significant investments in its southern provinces. In the UN draft report, Guterres informed the Security Council of Morocco’s investments in the southern provinces, recognizing the efforts towards socio-economic development for the benefit of the people. “Morocco will continue to defend its just cause in accordance with the mechanisms and parameters of the United Nations,” he added.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has chaired a meeting in which officials presented a roadmap for the development of vocational training and the creation of “cities of professions and skills” in every region in Morocco. The meeting, which convened Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and other senior officials on Thursday at the Royal Palace in Rabat, completes the series of previous meetings held to upgrade vocational training, the statement from the royal office said. Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi said during the presentation that a “city of professions and skills” will be created in every region of Morocco. He added that “there are multi-sectoral and multi functional structures that will become a strategic lever for competitiveness and a major factor of the integration of the youth into working life.” Amzazi noted that the new cities will focus on training in line with each region’s potential. The official said that the project will give important focus to “tomorrow’s jobs including digital-offshoring.” The program will offer training on digital offshoring jobs in the 12 regions of Morocco. Artificial intelligence related training will be offered in the regions of Rabat-Sale-Kenitra and Casablanca-Settat, Amzazi said. Amzazi added that the cities will include centers and technological halls to recreate a professional environment. The new cities will also host programs to empower young people working in the informal sector. King Mohammed VI has been calling on the government to ensure better education and to open up job opportunities for youth after graduation. The monarch also ordered the upgrading of vocational training programs, which he believes could increase employment. “Vocational training is a powerful lever for employment, provided it receives the attention it deserves and as long as it is given a new status as well as a broader scope,” said King Mohammed VI in 2018. Previously, the sovereign chaired several meetings to urge the government to find concrete solutions to unemployment through vocational training. In March, the King chaired a working meeting to discuss the programs to upgrade vocational training to improve working opportunities for youths.

Rabat – A three-member delegation from the Polisario Front paid a working visit to Reykjavik, Iceland, on Wednesday, April 3. The move comes as the self-proclaimed Sahrawi government seeks a broader support base for its self-determination claims in Western Sahara. According to articles in pro-Polisario outlets, the delegation, which was headed by Brahim Ghali, the president of the self-styled Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), met Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir to give her a letter of friendship and cooperation. In the letter, Ghali reportedly requested support from Iceland for the front’s struggle for the “decolonization” of Western Sahara. In response, Prime Minister Jakobsdottir “expressed her government’s interest in Western Sahara,” according to Polisario-owned Sahara Press Service. The Icelandic prime minister, the newspaper added, said that her country was closely following the Western Sahara territorial dispute and was “committed to settlement efforts, in line with the UN resolutions and Charter.” In addition to discussing the ongoing UN-led process spearheaded by Horst Kohler, Jakobsdottir and her Polisario guests spoke about recent “decolonization efforts,” according to Sahara Press Service. The separatist delegation sought to use the meeting as an opportunity to convince the Nordic state, which has not recognized SADR as a state, to join its base of supporters. The group particularly lambasted the human rights record in Western Sahara, which, they told the Icelandic prime minister, are due to Morocco’s heavy-handed and restrictive rule on the territory. The Polisario delegation allegedly fumed at the EU-Morocco agriculture and fisheries deals, telling Jakobsdottir that Brussels went ahead in renewing its commitment to Morocco in spite of evidence about Rabat’s “imposed rule” on Sahrawi locals. At the end of the meeting, the Polisario delegation thanked their host, promising the separatist front’s “desire to reinforce friendly ties and bilateral relations” with Iceland. Morocco’s increasing hope Morocco has traditionally lashed out at perceived partner countries that welcome Polisario envoys and give them a platform to express their separatist claims. But whether Rabat rebukes Iceland remains to be seen. The North African country has recently been busy sharpening its US and Africa-oriented public relations to secure support to discredit pro-Polisario narratives. In the meantime, Rabat has shown signs of satisfaction with the ongoing UN-led process in Western Sahara. At the end of the latest Geneva roundtable on Western Sahara, foreign minister Nasser Bourita, who headed the Moroccan delegation at the Geneva meeting, said that the international community is gradually waking up to the “historical truth” that self-determination and referendum are illusory and unfeasible in the Sahara context. Urging pragmatism from other stakeholders in the dispute, Bourita argued that the latest UN requirements for a negotiated settlement are increasingly in tune with Morocco’s 2007 Autonomy Plan. Rather than a referendum on self-determination, the UN is now pushing for a compromise-based political dialogue to broker a mutually acceptable solution, a position closer to Morocco’s, Bourita pointed out.

Rabat – The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has praised Morocco’s improved fiscal management and economic diversification which have strengthened its economy. However, unemployment remains high, especially among the youth. The IMF published an end-of-mission press release on Tuesday of an IMF staff team visit to Morocco from March 19 to April 3. The team, led by Nicolas Blancher, met Moroccan authorities for the IMF’s required “2019 Article IV consultation” as well as the first review of the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) arrangement between Morocco and the IMF approved in December 2018. Blancher stated that “the Moroccan economy continues to benefit from the prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that have been pursued.” He added that Morocco should implement structural reforms to “increase productivity gains, create jobs, and raise growth potential, in line with the government’s medium-term objectives.” In order to achieve the objectives, the IMF advised that Morocco improve the quality of education, the functioning of the labor market, female labor force participation, and the business environment. According to the report, Morocco’s economy grew 3 percent in 2018, while inflation rose 1.9 percent and government debt growth remained steady at 3.3 percent. Morocco’s reserves of international currency remained “comfortable,” sufficient to buy five months worth of imports.  The team predicted that economic growth should stabilize in 2019 to reach 4.5 percent over the medium term with the implementation of structural reforms. However, the forecast “remains subject to risks related to lower growth in advanced and emerging economies, world energy prices, and volatility in the global financial markets.” The IMF staff team approved of Morocco’s gradual transition from a regulated currency exchange to a more flexible exchange rate, which the IMF believes will improve the economy’s ability to absorb external shocks and maintain its competitiveness.  The IMF attributed Morocco’s business environment growth to the activation of the Competition Council and the implementation of a new financial inclusion strategy to promote competition and support small and medium-sized enterprises. Morocco improved its governance, the efficiency of the public sector, and combating corruption by adopting a law on access to information and publishing its first report on the implementation of the national anti-corruption strategy, concluded the press release. The fund also emphasized the need to better target social programs to improve their impact and reduce social inequalities.

Rabat – The National Coalition for the Arabic Language remains determined to oppose the draft framework Law 51.17, a bill Parliament is set to vote on which will replace the Arabic language with French in classes teaching scientific subjects in Moroccan schools. After launching a petition against the law, the coalition held a press conference in Rabat on Wednesday to condemn the government’s plans to prioritize French in some subjects in Moroccan schools. The draft law, backed by Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi, aims to make students proficient in foreign languages.  ‘It is a crime, face it’ The coalition argued that the law is in violation of the Moroccan Constitution, which established Arabic and Tamazight (Berber) as Morocco’s official languages. The head of the coalition, Fouad Bou Ali, said in the press conference that what is happening in the Parliament is a “crime” against Morocco, which serves the interests of the “French lobby.” Bou Ali, who was quoted by Elaph Morocco, added that excluding the Arabic language from Moroccan schools will “reap failures and setbacks experienced by the public school.” The chairman of the coalition described the situation as a “surreal scene that we did not want to to imagine that it might happen for decades.” He also regretted how Moroccans are questioning a language that “established our common existences and our belonging and progress.” Al Istiqlal continues campaign against Francophone movement The former leader of the opposition Istiqlal (Independence) Party (PI), Mohamed El Khalifa, said that the battle of people who defend the Arabic language is “a battle of existence, which will last forever.” The former official also expressed his categorical rejection of the law. Istiqlal has long defended the Arabic language, especially after Morocco’s independence from the French colonization. In the 1970s, the party campaigned on an urgent need to Arabize the educational system. The party aimed to curb the then perceived threat of the predominance of French in Morocco’s educated circle. El Khalifa added that French is like any other language “trying with all its might to impose its presence in the countries that it colonized.” Addressing the government, the former minister said, “This is not your right” to violate the Constitution. “You can not agree on something against the Constitution,” he said, adding that Article 5 of the Constitution emphasizes “the importance of the protection and development of the Arabic language and its use.” The draft law received backlash from several other politicians, including former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane. Last week, Benkirane warned the members of the Justice and Development Party (PJD) from voting on the draft law. Benkirane also advised his fellow PJD member, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, to resign if necessary. Benkirane’s statement followed a parliamentary meeting on March 25, when the majority of Moroccan political party leaders agreed to pass the draft law. Commenting on the draft law, Benkirane told PJD members that it would be a “shame” to undo the  three-decades-long “honor of the Arabization of scientific subjects.” The current tension is not the first debate on languages in Morocco. Last year, with the beginning of the 2018-2019 academic school year, Morocco witnessed a large debate regarding the usage of Darija or the Moroccan dialect of Arabic in Moroccan schools. Politicians and scholars condemned the use of Darija, saying that it would confuse students and they would not master the Arabic language. Arabic critics, including Noureddine Ayouch, criticized scholars who defended standard Arabic over Darija. Months after the first Arabic vs. Darija debate, another tension erupted among scholars who defended English and Arabic. While some said that English should take over French in Moroccan schools, others prefer to defend both English and Arabic as languages that should be prioritized in Moroccan schools, dropping French. Commenting on the draft law on French teaching, the president of the International Union for Muslim Scholars, Ahmed Al Raissouni, said that “if science should be taught in a foreign language, it must be taught in English.” Government seeking a consensus Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said after the weekly government council that the draft law was at the heart of the meeting. In the weekly press conference, El Khalfi said that there is a need for consensus, “because it is a major reform that concerns our country and the current and future generations.” El Khalfi added that the issue will be managed with the majority’s agreement, “and if there will be difficulties, they will be solved.”

Rabat – The Moroccan Forum for Modernity and Democracy (FMD) in Fez will hold a conference on Friday, March 5, to discuss the languages used in Moroccan schools. The conference comes at a time when Parliament is set to vote on draft Law 51.17 which will replace standard Arabic with French in high school classes on scientific subjects. While politicians and educators have been hotly debating the merits of Arabic versus French instruction in schools, the role of English, Tamazight (Berber), and Darija (Moroccan Arabic) has also come into play. The FMD’s symposium in Fez will focus its discussion on: “What Should Be the Language of Instruction in Morocco?” The symposium will bring together three speakers known for advocating different languages, none of them European. Among them is the outspoken activist and controversial scholar Ahmed Assid who has been a staunch advocate for the institutionalization of Tamazight (Berber). Noureddine Ayouch, a member of the Standing Committee on Curricula, Programs, Training, and Didactic Tools, will also be a speaker. Ayouch is well-known for advocating the integration of Darija, the unwritten Moroccan dialect of Arabic, as a language of instruction in schools. He is also known for compiling a dictionary of Darija. The third guest speaker is Fouad Bou Ali, a linguist and the president of the National Coalition for the Arabic Language. With government schools currently teaching most subjects in Arabic, Bou Ali’s position is the least disruptive to the status quo. The government introduced the draft Law 51.17 last month. After months of lengthy discussions, the government has opted for “the principle of language alternation” in the education system, approving of the use of both French and standard Arabic. On March 25, the Ministry of Education and government officials negotiated a mutual agreement to teach scientific subjects in French, instead of standard Arabic, in secondary and high schools. The proposal has met opposition, including from former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane. Benkirane stated that he would never approve of the decision if he were still in power, claiming that the draft law comes from the French colonial lobby. The National Coalition for the Arabic Language has also expressed disapproval of the government’s proposal, calling it “a coup on the constitution and the country’s achievements.” The Constitution recognizes Arabic and Tamazight as the two official languages of Morocco. Morocco used French as a language of instruction in schools from 1912 with the signing of the Treaty of Fez until the 1950s. Shortly after Morocco gained independence from France in 1956, the government Arabized the education system, although the project came to a standstill in the mid-1960s. Reducing the amount of French taught at schools has since been a national priority, and replacing it with Arabic has been seen as marker of identity, argued Rabia Redouane, an associate professor at Montclair State University in the US. The policy aimed to restore the Arab culture Morocco had lost to the French colonial presence through “an education that is Moroccan in its thinking, Arabic in its language and Muslim in its spirit,” as King Hassan II said in a speech in 1958. Some want to remove French entirely, saying it is a scar left by the colonial presence in Morocco. Supplanting French with Arabic means upholding their values and authentic identity. Others advocate a mixture of Arabic and English. Benkirane, for instance, is in favor of Arabic or even English over French.  He stressed, “If [higher] education in a foreign language is necessary one day, there is a better language for it than French.” Abdelali Bentahila of Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University in Fez and Moroccan linguist Moha Naji argued those who debate which language to use also contradict themselves, especially supporters of standard Arabic.  According to Rabia Redouane, leading pro-Arabization supporters also send their children to private French schools. The government’s proposal to alternate between Arabic and French aligns with the 2015-2030 Strategic Vision for Education Reform. It will be discussed along with the amendment of the framework Law 51.17 in an extraordinary session of Parliament expected to be held this month. The government seems to have reached a decision on the linguistic dilemma. However, whether the ministry’s choice to teach technical and scientific subjects in French bears fruit or not is still under discussion.

Rabat – The administrative committee of the first official mosque in Athens has chosen Moroccan-born Zaki Mohammed to act as their imam. The committee nominated him in a unanimous vote, based on a review of his qualifications and a personal interview. Mohammed, a 50-year-old father of two, is a respected cleric and well-regarded in Athens’ Muslim community. He holds Greek citizenship, which he obtained after moving to Greece 25 years ago. Mohammed speaks Arabic, Greek, and French and studied theology and mathematics. He is currently an imam at one of the six makeshift prayer spaces in Athens which have received permits from the state. The mosque, the first to be officially recognized and government-funded, is expected to open in time for the beginning of Ramadan on May 5. The opening of the mosque will mark the first time Muslims in Athens have had a formal place to worship since the end of Ottoman rule over a century ago. As of now, Athens is the only European capital without an official mosque despite Greece’s Muslim population of over 250,000. There are two historic mosques in Athens, but neither has been used for worship since Ottoman times. One, the Tzistarakis Mosque, hosts the Museum of Greek Folk Art, and the other, the Fethiye Mosque, has been heavily renovated and is used as an exhibition space. Muslims in Athens pray at makeshift worship spaces located in basements, warehouses, garages, and apartments. As of 2016, there were at least 100 “underground” mosques in the city, the majority of which are not allowed to operate as places of worship without having registered as legal entities. An increasing number of these spaces have been granted permits to operate, although the government’s hope is that many Muslims will move from the informal spaces to the mosque for prayer once it opens. Read Also: Islam in Europe: A View From the Medieval European Imagination The mosque itself is a 1,000-square-meter building without a minaret which will hold 350 people. It’s two floors include a gender-segregated worship area, auxiliary rooms, an office for the imam, and an office for the muezzin. It will be open to the public daily from a half hour before the first prayer until a half hour after the last prayer and 24 hours a day during Ramadan. The estimated cost of the mosque, to be borne by the Greek state, is €887,000. “Is this the mosque they’ve been telling us about for so many years?” There have been numerous attempts to build a mosque in Athens, beginning as early as 1890 with plans proposed again in 1934 and 2004. The Greek Parliament finally approved the construction of the mosque in August 2016. There have been some complaints about the conditions of the mosque from within the Muslim community. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, president of Turkey, met with Greek officials in Athens in 2017, telling them he opposed the idea of a mosque without a minaret. Naim el-Ghandour, president of the Muslim Association of Greece, complained that the mosque is not nearly big enough to accommodate all the Muslims who have been worshipping in makeshift spaces around Athens, asking, “Is this the mosque they’ve been telling us about for so many years?” But many Greek Muslims see the mosque as an important symbol–a sign of their recognition as equal citizens of Greece. Much like the rest of Europe, Greece has experienced rising Islamophobia and xenophobia. This, in large part, explains why it has taken so long for the mosque to be finished. The construction has been plagued by delays and protests since its beginning. The construction site has been regularly defaced by anti-Islam graffiti and leaflets. Residents of Athens have held a number of protests, with demonstrators camped out at the site until dispersed by police. Golden Dawn, the far-right neo-Nazi party in Greece has made public commitments to halting the progress of the mosque and has threatened violence. Part of the party’s anti-Islam rhetoric involves the conflation of contemporary Islam with Ottoman rule of Greece. In 2016 Golden Dawn’s leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos decried the mosque as a “shrine to slavery,” saying “a mosque in the shadow of the Acropolis. Are we returning to Turkish occupation?” According to the UN and Amnesty International, Golden Dawn is responsible for leading violent attacks against refugees. Over the years, there have been several attacks on Muslims’ unofficial prayer sites. Georgios Kalatzis, secretary general of religions at the Hellenic Ministry of Education, Research, and Religious Affairs, spoke in favor of the mosque, saying its publicly-funded construction is “the Greek public’s choice, and the message to the Muslim society is clear that Islam holds an equal position in our country.”

Rabat – Morocco’s youth are key to driving innovation, said speakers and students at the EMI-Enterprises Forum, April 3-4, which connects Moroccan students with businesses searching for talent. The challenge is finding them the right opportunities. “The forum will help students immerse themselves further into [the] development and progress of our country and all future relative projects,” said Moulay Larbi Abidi, director of the Mohammadia School of Engineers (EMI), in his remarks at the opening ceremony. This year marks the 25th EMI-Enterprises Forum, which EMI holds each year at its campus. Founded in 1959 by King Mohammed V, the university is Morocco’s leading engineering school and its largest institute of technology. A quarter-century ago, the forum was Morocco’s first job fair. It has since become EMI’s premier event, bringing companies in from around the globe to Rabat. The forum also hosts experts that workshop students’ resumes and interview skills. Over 100 businesses set up stands stocked with glossy promotional flyers at EMI on Wednesday—more companies than ever before, according to Bilal Khelil, an engineering student involved in organizing the event.  “We’re celebrating this year 25 years of excellence, 25 years of leading Morocco when it comes to job fairs,” Khelil said. Economic intelligence for innovation In March, EMI announced the theme for the 2019 forum’s theme would be “economic intelligence”—the kinds of analytical skills needed to anticipate changes and risk in the economy. It is a hot topic in the job market right now, Abidi said. Mohammed Rhachi, president of Mohammed V University in Rabat, also emphasized the theme in his remarks. Development is held “hostage to the adoption of economic intelligence,” he said, adding that its adoption will stimulate innovation and growth. Such training is vital for students just entering the job market, both said—not only for the graduates as they search for jobs, but for Morocco. The Moroccan economy has suffered from an exodus of high-skilled workers abroad, partly as a result of stubborn unemployment rates.  More than 600 engineers leave the country annually, according to education minister Said Amzazi. Fighting the brain drain EMI students at the event, clad in formal red-and-black uniforms, talked about their own hopes for the event and fears for the future. “It’s hard to find a job that suits you, a job that you can enjoy,” said Salma Mangoug, a second-year engineering student at EMI. Thousands of engineers, she said, graduate and enter the job market each year in Morocco.  For Mangoug, the EMI-Enterprises Forum offered a chance at finding that job. “It’s a real glimpse of hope,” she said. And while companies abroad might continue seeking out students like Mangoug and Khelil for positions outside of the country, Morocco’s business environment is improving in many sectors. “Everyone thinks there are more opportunities abroad, and sometimes they can be wrong,” Mangoug said. “They should think again about Morocco, about working here.”

Rabat – After collecting and analyzing 90 different samples of hashish in Madrid, including from Moroccan sources, a group of Spanish pharmacists have established that the large majority of cannabis sold in the Madrid streets is not suitable for human consumption. Fifty-four-year-old Manuel Perez Moreno, a pharmacist at Madrid’s Complutense University, reported the results of his study in a co-authored paper titled “Cannabis Resin in the Region of Madrid: Adulteration and Contamination.” In the paper, the authors shed light on the preparation and transportation methods of the cannabis sold in Madrid. They found that the hashish sold in Madrid neighborhoods could have a detrimental effect on human health. As Moreno wanted the study’s conclusions to be robust and more accurately generalizable, he collected 90 samples of cannabis from different sources. “The majority of the hash sold in the Madrid region is not apt for human consumption, mainly due to microbiological criteria, and it represents a danger for health,” read part of the paper. It added, “Our results showed a direct relationship between the shape of the samples (acorn or ingot) and the presence of foreign elements, adulterants and microbiological contamination.” Although Moreno successfully analyzed 90 different samples of cannabis, he claims to have never consumed the narcotic. Instead, he explained, during the one-year period over which he collected the samples, according to Spanish outlet El Pais, he would show up at Madrid neighborhoods and ask locals questions such as, “Do you know where I can buy hash?” But he bought the cannabis with his own money, “since I couldn’t imagine asking for a grant to buy hashish,” Moreno said. Of the feral and microbiological contamination of the different types of hashish collected, the acorn-shaped category, the type most traffickers from Morocco smuggle to Spain, was found to be unfit for human consumption in 100 percent of the samples. Comparing acorn-shaped to ingot-shaped types, the analysis indicated that 93 percent of acorns “were contaminated by E. coli,” compared to only 29.4 percent of ingots. “In addition,” the study added, “all samples with fecal odor were acorns.” And while the study’s overall contamination percentage was 88 percent, that number was “significantly higher” for acorn-type cannabis. Moreno attributed the reason for such high contamination with E. coli, a bacteria found in feces, to the way people smuggle the drug from Morocco. Traffickers operating between Spain and Morocco wrap up tiny hashish pellets—described as acorns—in plastic film. They then swallow the pellets after consuming yoghurt to neutralize the acids secreted by the stomach. “When they get to Spain, they take a laxative and expel the [acorns]. And then they’re put on sale,” El Pais quoted the Spanish pharmacist as saying. According to the study, the degree of feral contamination found in the different samples used for the study was 500 times higher than the maximum accepted in the US for marijuana or in EU regulations for products such as tea or coffee. “This is clearly a public-health problem. The quantities of bacteria that we found are appalling,” said biologist Inmaculada Santos, a co-author of the study at Madrid’s Complutense University.

Rabat –  Royal Air Maroc (RAM) launched a Casablanca-Miami non-stop flight on Wednesday. The first direct flight between the two destinations landed on Wednesday night at Miami International Airport (MIA). The company will serve the non-stop flight three days a week, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. A Moroccan delegation attended the launching ceremony. Morocco’s ambassador to the US, Lalla Joumala Alaoui, attended the ceremony with RAM President Hamid Addou and a local official, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez. The inaugural flight used a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, with a capacity of 302 seats, including 26 in business class. The non-stop flight will also operate on a Boeing 787-800 Dreamliner, with a capacity of 274 seats, including 18 seats in business class. “Miami becomes the third direct destination served by Royal Air Maroc in the United States, after those of New York and Washington, D.C. With this new air route, the company strengthens its network in the Americas, where Royal Air Maroc also directly connects Casablanca with Montreal, Sao Paulo, and Rio De Janeiro,” said Addou. The CEO added that RAM is preparing to launch another line between Casablanca and Boston next June to increase direct flights to the US. Addou also expressed pride at the launch of the new flight, emphasizing that RAM is the first airline connecting the southern US to Africa that provides passengers with direct flight options of less than nine hours. There are, however, longer direct flights between Atlanta and Johannesburg and Lagos. “The new route, first and foremost, provides an air connection tailored to the needs of our Moroccans living in Florida,” said the CEO. Royal Air Maroc submitted its request to the US Department of Transportation to get approval for its Miami-Casablanca offer on July 26, 2018. In August, MIA quoted Miami-Dade Aviation Director Lester Sola, who said that “Royal Air Maroc’s announcement is a major milestone in the 90-year history of Miami International Airport. We have long sought to re-establish nonstop passenger service to Africa, and to accomplish that with an airline and a destination of this caliber is an added bonus.”

Rabat – The 24th annual Andalusian Music Festival will take place in the old city of Fez from April 6 to 13. The festival is organized by a partnership between the municipality of Fez and the Fez-Meknes regional council. The festival will host more than 30 orchestras from Fez, Tangier, Tetouan, Rabat, Meknes, Casablanca as well as a number of other Moroccan regions and a group from Seville, Spain. Under the theme “Moroccan Andalusian Music: A Changing Heritage,” the festival organizers hope to celebrate tradition and cultural heritage while also appealing to new generations. In recent years, the organizers have made it a concrete goal to promote Andalusian music and art among young people. They have been increasingly successful in this aim, as the 2018 festival saw a massive youth turn out. The first night of the festival, April 6, opens with performances from the Andalusian Music Orchestra of Fes led by Mohamed Otmani and the Andalucia Choir of Morocco led by Abdelhamid Essbai. In addition to musical performances, the festival boasts a wide variety of activities which relate back to Andalusian music.  In partnership with the City Heritage Foundation, this year these activities will include an exhibition on the history of Al-Ala—the structure of Andalusian music, a conference on the topic of “Andalusian Music and Psychic Quietness,” a tribute to Moroccan scholar Abdelmalek Chami, a number of book signings, and a masterclass on Andalusian music. Andalusian music is associated with the Jews and Muslims who fled Spain after the fall of Al-Andalus at the end of the 15th century but likely has its origins anywhere between the 9th and 15th centuries. It is considered the classical music of Morocco as it is notably one of the region’s oldest musical genres. At the heart of Andalusian music is a spirit of cultural exchange and collaborative creativity.

Rabat – The Spanish Civil Guard has arrested eight suspects of a car theft ring in Spain in late March believed to be headed by a Moroccan man. Four of those arrested were relatives of the suspected ringleader, three his children and one his nephew. The authorities discovered that the ring sent stolen cars for sale in Africa, especially Morocco, according to Spanish news outlet Mira Corredor. Spanish police officers stated that before the suspects shipped the vehicles to Morocco, the gang used them to rob pharmacies on the weekends in Madrid. The gang had attacked eight pharmacies with force. The Spanish Civil Guard seized 57 vehicles and equipment used in forging number plates.  Police carried out an investigation following reports from maritime ports that vehicles of the same make and model were being shipped to Morocco under identical license plate numbers. The Moroccan man thought to be the head of the gang, shipped up to two cars per week to Africa. The seemingly family operation included relatives specializing in various aspects of the crime.  One member was in charge of changing license plates and chassis numbering and falsifying identification information. Another stole expensive cars, and the oldest son stole vans. On the day of the raid, police recovered 25 cars parked in different streets in Madrid, five of which had the same license plate number. The suspects sometimes parked the stolen cars near their homes.  Before sending them to the small town of Paracuellos de Jarama northeast of Madrid where they had a farm and forged the license plates, the gang usually parked the stolen cars along national roads for a few days to make sure they were not under police surveillance. The main suspect took the cars through the Spain-Morocco border by buying and registering one car legally and then stealing cars of the same make and model and copying the license plate onto them, according to the news outlet.

Rabat – Dozens of Sahrawis carried out a sit-in in front of the headquarters of the self-styled Sahrawi Ministry of the Interior to protest tightened restrictions at the Tindouf camps in Algeria. Sahrawi activists and former Polisario member Mustafa Salma Sidi Mouloud said on Wednesday that the protesters are carrying out the sit-in to condemn Polisario’s decisions to limit cars to leaving the camps only once in 20 days. The protesters also denounced the separatists’ decision to hand over a list of those who leave the camps to the Algerian security services. Protesters, according to Mustafa Salma, describe the separatists’ restrictions as “forced detention” and a “violation of the right of movement.” Mustafa Salma, who has been following the news of Western Sahara closely, said that most of the camp residents “are unaware that they are being held.” The Sahrawi activist added that demonstrators are unaware that they have chosen the “right place to protest because if they checked under their feet they would find the first underground prison built by the Polisario to detain” anti-Polisario activists at the interior ministry prison in 1976. The former police officer, Mustafa Salma, has been criticizing Polisario and Algeria for their restrictions, accusing them of kidnapping one of the separatist elites in the camps. In recent months, Polisario has been under pressure to explain the disappearance of Polisario member Ahmed El Khalil, who went missing more than 10 years ago under unknown circumstances. Friends and relatives of the kidnapped member also threatened to organize demonstrations in European capitals if their demands are not met. Read Also: 12 Polisario Soldiers Desert from Tindouf Camps, Arrive in Morocco The front also faced pressure when some of its militias escaped the camps and decided to return to their homeland, Morocco. In March, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported on the return of a 29-year-old Sahrawi who fled the camps, saying he was an officer in the front.  A week later, Mustafa Salma said that a group of 12 Polisario soldiers presented themselves to Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces ear Mahbes, north-eastern Western Sahara. Mustafa Salma translated the move as a failure from the Polisario Front to meet their demands. In a previous Facebook post, Mustafa Salma criticized the front for its treatment of Sahrawis living in the camps. “Is it not the right for everyone to leave and return to any country, including their own, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?” he asked. The activist also accused Polisario of holding Sahrawis as hostages for its own interests.

Rabat – Pope Francis has warmly reflected on his recent trip to Morocco in his weekly “General Audience” in St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican. Vatican News shared the statement the pope delivered during his General Audience on Wednesday, in which he expressed his thanks to Moroccans and King Mohammed VI. The pope gives a General Audience to visitors at the Vatican every Wednesday while he is in Rome. “Last Saturday and Sunday, I completed an Apostolic Journey to Morocco, and I thank His Majesty King Mohammed VI and the other authorities, for their warm welcome.” The pope also thanked God for allowing him to “to take yet another step along the road of dialogue and encounter with our Muslim brothers and sisters, as a ‘Servant of hope’ in today’s world.” Pope Francis also said it was a joy and honor to visit “the noble Kingdom of Morocco” as well as meeting with its people and senior Moroccan senior officials. “King Mohammed and I reiterated the essential role religions have in defending human dignity, promoting peace and justice, and in caring for creation, our common home.” The pope recalled that migration challenges were the center of his visit. “I was table to thank the Church in Morocco for its commitment towards migrants, and to encourage those who give generous service in realizing the words of Christ.” The pope also mentioned his Catholic mass at the Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, which gathered thousands of people. With King Mohammed VI, the pope also spoke about tolerance and coexistence between the three Abrahamic religions. Pope Francis said during his General Audience that “with Muslims, we are descendants of the same father, Abraham.” The pope visited Morocco March 30-31.

Rabat – Units of the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces (FAR), the US army, and the British army conducted a joint exercise on Tuesday in Tifnit, a coastal city south of Agadir, to strengthen their capabilities in the fight against violent extremist organizations. The training is part of the combined Moroccan-American “African Lion” joint exercises.  The annual exercise began on March 16 and will continue until April 7 in southwest Morocco, in areas around Agadir, TanTan, and Tata, and in Ben Guerir, a city between Casablanca and Marrakech. Thousands of military personnel took part. Captain Thomas Jelly, commander of the British specialized infantry, said that the three nations’ armies simulated a raid against violent extremists planning terrorist attacks. He added that several teams from the three countries participated in the exercise, including teams for observation, air assault, main assault, and security cordon. The operation tested the skills the different teams learned during African Lion 2019, particularly demonstrating their ability to work together. African Lion 2019 is jointly organized by the United States Command for Africa (AFRICOM) and FAR to consolidate cooperation and training and exchange experience between the various military components.  The exercises saw the first usage of invisible laser-guided bombs, the GBU-24 Paveway III and GBU-12 Paveway II. Moroccan and US F-16s also conducted surface attacks and large-scale operations. As well as the US and Morocco, the military exercise is attended by military units and observers from five countries: Canada, Spain, the UK, Senegal, and Tunisia.

Rabat – Airplanes with the international coalition against ISIS have dropped leaflets over Ramadi, an Iraqi city 100 kilometers west of Baghdad, requesting information that would lead to the capture of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The leaflets, dropped Tuesday, April 2, note that the US-led international coalition will give $25 million for the information. “The leader of Daesh (IS group) and his fighters stole your land and killed your family, and now he is hiding safely away from the death and destruction that he planted,” read the leaflet, according to Xinhua news agency. According to Iraq’s anti-terrorism agency spokesperson Sabah al Namaan, who spoke to Fox News, al-Baghdadi is still in Syria, near the Iraqi border. A member of the National Reconciliation Commission in Iraq, Hisham al-Hashimi, reported that al-Baghdadi may be hiding in three possible locations. Al-Hashimi believes al-Baghdadi may be stranded either in the arid Syrian desert, the desert of Tadmur or Homs, or across the border in Iraq. Keeping a low profile to avoid arrest, al-Baghdadi has changed most of his facial features including shaving his beard, according to Hamid al-Hayes, the head of the al-Anbar Salvation Council in Iraq. Iraqi intelligence reported that al-Baghdadi is still in hiding in the eastern part of Syria with his followers, including one of his sons. Al-Hashimi pointed out that the hunt will not be easy; al-Baghdadi knows how to survive in the desert and arid areas, which stretch for 200 square miles.

Casablanca – The 2019 Casablanca Insurance Rendezvous convened insurance professionals and government representatives on April 3-4 to discuss the new challenges and opportunities emerging in the age of a digitized global economy. As has become the unspoken norm for most high-profile forums in Morocco, the African continent was one of the major talking points at the sixth annual Casablanca Insurance Rendezvous, a meeting of global trailblazers in insurance and reinsurance. The Casablanca-held event has, in the space of five years, become a significant gathering of insurance and reinsurance experts, market risks practitioners, governments, and multinational companies driving the global insurance and reinsurance conversation. At this year’s event, over 1,000 representatives from more than 30 countries are meeting to discuss the new disruptions of the digital age in the field. Of the countries present at the gathering, more than 20 were from Africa, showcasing Morocco’s “genuine interest in playing a greater role in the much-needed Africa-Africa turn to rise to continental challenges,” according to Mohamed Hassan Bensalah, chairman of the Moroccan Federation of Insurance and Reinsurance Companies (FMSAR). Squarely addressing the event’s theme, “The New Borders of Insurance,” Bensalah’s keynote speech spoke in effusive terms of the Moroccan reissuance market’s ability to face a relentlessly globalizing and digitizing world. Despite the number and the difficulty of the emerging challenges, he stressed, Morocco has invested in new infrastructures that have “boosted its resilience and adaptability.” This optimism in the face of “emerging and intensifying known and unknown risks,” Bensalah explained, springs from the collaborative efforts which FMSAR and the Moroccan finance ministry have made recently to limit the damaging impacts of new risks. “As far as the Moroccan [insurance] market is concerned, we have intelligently worked with the Ministry of Finance to establish a protection mechanism against catastrophic events.” The “catastrophic events,” the FMSAR chair went on to explain, include natural disasters and systemic fluctuations within national and international markets. The goal of the collaboration with the ministry is to create more appropriate conditions for insurance in Morocco. The vision is to enable Morocco to protect Moroccans from market shocks and fluctuations, while also exporting its expertise internationally, especially to fellow African countries with similar challenges but fewer resources. Other participants, including panelists and speakers, nodded at Bensalah’s observations, despite the wide-ranging perspectives from which they looked at the conference’s theme. Some mentioned geographic, economic, geopolitical, structural, and climatic risks as the “new delimitations of the coming frontiers of insurability.” Morocco’s economy minister Mohamed Benchaaboun, who was also a keynote speaker on the inaugural day, echoed Bensalah’s sentiments. Benchaaboun spoke about Morocco’s efforts to meet the needs of less fortunate Moroccans with insurance and reinsurance coverage. “Faced with new and more complex risks,” Benchaaboun said, Morocco has worked on “improving its creativity and adaptability” to “expand the borders of insurability” in Morocco. In doing so, Morocco is striving to further improve its investment markets and “fully enter into the digital age.” The goal of such an effective entry in the age of digitization, Benchaaboun suggested, is to ensure the success of a planned policy of “inclusive insurance” by including children, women, and rural Morocco in the country’s new insurance equation. At the same time, the minister argued, in line with its continental leadership, Morocco seeks to exploit “Africa’s double economic and demographic dynamics” to bring insurability to a new level in the continent. The minister called for the “moralization” of public actions, saying that Morocco wants to keep investing in expanding continental cooperation and solidarity. The objective of such continental actions, he suggested, would be to realize “financial inclusion” by sustaining profitability in Morocco and expanding the country’s presence in as many African insurance markets as possible. Mali, guest of honor Beyond panels and keynote speeches that highlighted the critical importance of continental solidarity for Morocco’s emerging vision of South-South actions, the empathic presence of a delegation from Mali was one of the culminating points of the event’s first day. The West African country is the 2019 event’s guest country. Moroccan insurance companies expect to strengthen collaboration with Mali. The cooperation seeks to “limit the risks and maximize the opportunities” of the new disruptive digital age of new insurance-related technologies. In his keynote speech, Oumar N’doye, chairman of the Insurance Companies Committees of Mali (CCAM), reiterated his country’s gratitude to Morocco, which he said has been an important partner over the past 5-10 years. “Morocco’s presence in Mali in various sectors is a statement to the strong friendship and quasi-parental ties binding our two countries,” N’doye said. He added that bolstering Morocco-Mali relations is part of the “imperative South-South cooperation to dare cross the new frontiers of insurability.” The inaugural ceremony’s plenary session ended with a signature of agreement framework between Morocco’s FMSAR and Mali’s CCAM. The agreement is a convention of technical cooperation to “make South-South more fruitful,” according to FMSAR’s Hassan Bensalah. “For us, cooperating with the rest of Africa is not a desire; it is a priority,” he said.

Rabat – Tangier prefectural police arrested four suspects on Thursday for possession of and dealing in large amounts of drugs and psychotropic substances. Working with the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST), the police caught the primary suspect who had been wanted, in the middle of a drugs transaction in with another person coming from Casablanca.  The suspects were in possession of 30,000 ecstasy pills and large sums of cash in local currency.  Police also arrested two other suspects they believe to have been acting as middlemen for the drug ring.  The DGSN announced in a statement that “the suspects are placed under police custody pending further investigation before the prosecutor general.” The DGSN stated that the arrests are part of its intense search operations to combat drug dealing.  Lately, Moroccan authorities have cracked down on a number of suspected drug dealers and criminals.  In mid-March, Morocco’s National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) arrested five foreign suspects connected to a Moroccan network forging Moroccan IDs.

Rabat – Former Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika once received commendations for his role in ending the Algerian Civil War and improving the infrastructure of Algeria, but after he spent 20 years in office as president, the Algerian people and army have forced Bouteflika’s resignation. Bouteflika was born to Algerian parents in the Moroccan city of Oujda, just over the border from Algeria, in 1937. He subsequently attended schools in the region.  In 1956, at the age of 19, Bouteflika moved to the village of Ouled Amer, near Tlemcen in western Algeria. There, he joined the Army of National Liberation (ALN) in the war of independence against France.  Bouteflika received military training in the Dar El Kebdani region of Morocco, east of Tangier. In the military, Bouteflika quickly rose through the ranks as an officer and was tasked with reporting on the situation at the Moroccan border with Algeria. During his time in the military, Bouteflika gained the trust of the ALN commander and second president of Algeria, Houari Boumediene. After Algerian independence in 1962, a young Bouteflika became minister of youth, sports and tourism under former President Ahmed Ben Bella. Shortly after, in 1963, Bouteflika became minister of foreign affairs, making him, in his mid-twenties, the youngest foreign minister in the world. In 1974, Bouteflika was appointed president of the UN General Assembly. During his one-year term, Bouteflika invited the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to speak to the UN General Assembly for the first time. The move was an unprecedented step towards international recognition of the Palestinian cause.  Though he was highly successful in his early years in politics and diplomacy, in 1981 Bouteflika corruption charges forced Bouteflika into self-imposed exile. Bouteflika resided in Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates until he returned to Algeria in 1987. Algeria welcomed Bouteflika back home and the National Liberation Front’s (FLN) central committee readmitted him in 1989.  However, in 1991, the Algerian Civil War broke out, killing approximately 200,000 Algerians through the 11-year conflict. In 1994 Bouteflika was offered the presidency, but due to fears of military control over the government, Bouteflika declined the offer.  Five years later, in 1999, Bouteflika ran for president and succeeded, gaining 74 percent of the vote. However, the election received heavy criticism with claims of rigging. Bouteflika won commendations for his role in ending the 11-year civil war in 2002 and won reelection in 2004 for his second term as president. In 2005, in an attempt to bring closure to the war, Bouteflika granted amnesty to armed groups involved in the civil war with the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation. During his second term, Bouteflika focused on growing Algeria’s economy and building new infrastructure. Taking advantage of high oil prices, Bouteflika oversaw the construction of new roads and upgrades to Algiers’ metro system.  With the end of his second term looming, Bouteflika altered the Constitution to allow himself to run for a third term in office. Despite reports speculating about his failing health, the former president won reelection to his third term in office in 2009. In his third term, Bouteflika convinced Algerians not to follow suit of neighboring countries during the 2011 Arab Spring and remained in power. The former president used Algeria’s wealth to gain popularity by giving citizens large subsidies and low-interest loans. Bouteflika also reminded the population of the civil war they had only recently emerged from and played the threat of instability to his advantage. However, in 2013, after reports of poor health, Bouteflika suffered a serious stroke. From then on, he rarely made public appearances. Despite his poor health, Bouteflika won the 2014 election for his fourth term as Algeria’s president. During his fourth term, Bouteflika rarely appeared in public, however, the presidential office remained active. Speculations increased around who actually made decisions in the office and ran the country. In 2016, the office of the president amended the Algerian Constitution to include reimposed term limits on the presidency. Despite newly imposed term limits, on February 22, 2019, Bouteflika announced he would run for his fifth term as president at the age of 82 in the April elections. Subsequently, Algerians led large protests around the country calling for the withdrawal of his candidacy and his resignation.  Initially, Bouteflika responded with a statement that he would stay out of the 2019 elections but would extend his fourth term and delay the April 18 elections. On April 2, after allies in the FLN and army deserted him, the former Algerian president announced after a 20 year rule that he was resigning from his position. Once a symbol for statesmen bringing their countries out of colonial rule, Bouteflika’s fall from power may leave a long lasting stain on his reputation.

Rabat – After an attempt to retrieve her grandkids from Syria, Latifa, a 63-year-old Moroccan woman, ended up stranded in Syria. Three years after leaving Morocco, Latifa told her story to the Spanish news agency EFE.  The grandmother of five went to Syria in 2016 after her son, Husein al Guili, a jihadi fighter died in combat. “My son and his wife came to Syria without my permission. After six or eight months, his wife called me to tell me he had died and asked me to come get her and her kids,” recounted Latifa. Her son, Husein al Guili, was 42 years old in 2015 when he joined ISIS alongside his oldest son. The two died shortly after joining ISIS forces during a bombing in the Syrian city of Raqqa.  After hearing of her son’s death, Latifa began her attempt to rescue her son’s family in Syria. She communicated with members of ISIS to set up the exchange. First, she traveled to Turkey, where she stayed in a hotel for two days. She was then taken by jihadi forces to Raqqa in Syria. However, when she arrived, the jihadi forces did not allow her to see her grandchildren as promised. Instead, they took her phone, passport, and identification cards and left her with nothing. “I was put in really bad conditions for a month until I lost my mind,” said Latifa. She finally convinced the extremist fighters to bring her grandchildren because she “cried and screamed without stopping.” After reuniting with her grandchildren, Latifa then had to figure out how to return to Turkey. However, the jihadi fighters made her wait for years. Latifa and her family remained in Raqqa until Kurdish forces took control of the city in October 2017. However, ISIS took her and her family with them to the city of Mayadin in Syria.  Six months later, Latifa and her grandchildren escaped to the town of Al-Shaddadah in northeastern Syria, ending their captivity in the hands of ISIS. The family now remains in a detention camp guarded by Kurdish authorities. Latifa, originally from Fez, is asking that Morocco help bring her and her grandchildren back to their country. Latifa said, however, that she has not had any contact with her remaining children in Morocco or the Moroccan government. The head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Intelligence (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, estimates that around 1,668 Moroccans joined ISIS in Syria, Iraq, and Libya. As the Islamic State’s power and control diminishes, Moroccan authorities worry about the return of these fighters to Morocco.

Rabat – Canada’s Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Ahmed Hussen has said that Morocco is  home to many skills that are highly sought after in Canada. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) quoted the Canadian official, who made his remarks at a soiree in Toronto during the 18th Moroccan Cultural Days event. Hussen said that Canadian companies, which have 250,000 vacancies, are interested in skilled workers from around the world, including Morocco. “They need to attract skilled talents from around the world, and I can tell you that Morocco is one of the countries, where skills are among the most sought after.” Hussen also recalled his official visit to Morocco during the international conference on migration in December 2018 in Marrakech. Commenting on the UN-sponsored event, Hussen said that the choice of Marrakech and Morocco to convene leaders from the world to discuss migration challenges was not coincidental. “Morocco was chosen because the kingdom is a bridge between African and Europe, it is literally a bridge between many cultures and peoples,” said the official. Morocco’s ambassador to Canada, Souriya Otmani, said that Morocco, a land of hospitality, openness, and coexistence, “works on the front line in favor of promoting the culture of peace, positive, interaction and intercultural dialogue.” She also remarked on the significance of the messages delivered by Pope Francis and King Mohammed VI on March 30. “It is a strong call to make reconciliation and dialogue between religions and cultural peace and to reject the deleterious logic of confrontation and withdrawal.” Representatives of the Canadian federal government, several Canadian and foreign personalities, and members of the Moroccan community attended the soiree as part of the Moroccan Cultural Days.

Rabat – Morocco’s permanent representative to the United Nations, Omar Hilale, and the papal ambassador to the UN, Bernardito Auza, jointly conveyed to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres the “Jerusalem appeal,” that King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis signed during the pope’s visit to Morocco March 30-31. Through the “Jerusalem appeal,” King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis, recognized the uniqueness and sacred character of Jerusalem, known in Arabic as Al-Quds Al-Sharif. The two leaders noted Jerusalem’s spiritual significance and its special vocation as a city of peace. Ambassador Hilale and the papal ambassador, officially an “apostolic nuncio,” also delivered the appeal to the chairman of the UN’s Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, Ambassador Cheikh Niang. Cheikh Niang will hold a meeting in Palestine next Wednesday, April 10, with the UN high representative for the Alliance of Civilizations, Miguel Angel, and with all permanent missions and observations in New York. Representatives from the Arab Group at the UN, who held a meeting on Tuesday, under the chairmanship of Permanent Representative Hilale, commended the enlightened vision of King Mohammed VI. They also praised the signing of the appeal, which is in line with international law and the fundamental principles of the Arab and Islamic community.  The appeal is also part of the support for the Palestinian people’s right to liberation and the establishment of a state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, living side by side with Israel.

Rabat – The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, has informed the Security Council of the African Union’s support for the UN-led political process to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to the Western Sahara conflict. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) published excerpts from the annual draft report of the UN chief, in which he confirmed that the chairman of the AU Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, assured the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Kohler of the AU’s support for the UN-led political process. Faki also informed the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Kohler of the AU’s Decision 693, adopted in July 2018 in Nouakchott, which expressed support for the UN-led political process in the conflict. “I wish to commend, in this regard, the recent decisions made by the AU Summit of Heads of State and Government, held in Nouakchott, which were consistent with the relevant international positions and principles,” King Mohammed VI said of the AU decisions. Thirty-seven African countries repeated their commitment to back the UN as the exclusive arbiter in the conflict during the African Ministerial Conference on the African Union’s Role in Supporting the UN-Led Political Process in Western Sahara held in Marrakech in March 2019. The same week as the Marrakech meeting, South Africa and Namibia co-hosted the SADC Solidarity Conference with the Sahrawi People in Pretoria to express their support for the Polisario Front. About 20 African countries attended the event. Last week, the United Nations called on all states, including African countries, to show commitment to the UN-led political process. Morocco’s dialogue initiative with Algeria The UN chief recalled Morocco’s efforts towards the Maghreb Union, emphasizing that King Mohammed VI offered dialogue to Algeria in his speech of November 6, 2018. Guterres added that the King called for an “end to the lack of unity in the Maghreb,” pointing out the King’s offer to create a “joint political mechanism of dialogue and construction” between Morocco and Algeria “without conditions or exceptions.” Algeria, however, never responded to Morocco’s offer. Guterres’s recent report also welcomed Morocco’s cooperation in the UN-led process in good faith for the “purpose of establishing a serious and credible political process, taking into account the lessons and experiences of the past,” according to MAP. Notable development in Western Sahara The Moroccan government has launched several programs and signed agreements to develop Western Sahara. In his report, Guterres informed the Security Council that Morocco is investing in its southern provinces, recognizing Moroccan efforts towards socio-economic development. Kohler welcomed the development in the region during his field visit in July 2018 to the cities of Laayoune, Dakhla, and Smara. The Secretary-General also listed the two resolutions of the European Parliament adopted on January 16 and February 12, 2019, approving the extension of the agriculture and fisheries agreements between Morocco and the European Union. Morocco said the agreements, which included products from Western Sahara, would benefit the people of the region. The Secretary-General mentioned that he received Morocco’s letter concerning the adoption of the two resolutions, which were the culmination of negotiations with representatives of the people. The UN report is usually an annual document addressed to the Security Council before the end of the mandate of the UN peacekeeping mission in the region, also known as MINURSO. The Security Council announced in a statement that it expects to hold consultations to renew the mandate of the mission “before it expires on 30 April.” In April, according to the Security Council, Kohler is expected to brief the council on his latest activities and “Colin Stewart, the Special Representative for Western Sahara and head of MINURSO, is expected to brief on the Secretary-General’s MINURSO report, due in early April.” The Security Council updated MINURSO’s mandate on October 31, 2018, extending its mission for only six months.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI will personally take care of the funeral expenses for victims of a fatal truck accident and ordered authorities to transfer the survivors to Mohammed V Military Hospital in Rabat. Approximately 14 people died and 30 others were injured in a traffic accident between a heavyweight truck transporting construction materials and a bus carrying agriculture workers. The truck and the bus collided Wednesday morning near Moulay Bousselham, a town on Morocco’s Atlantic coast, 140 kilometers north of Rabat. Local gendarmerie and civil protection officers quickly went to the scene to assist. Authorities also opened an investigation into the deadly accident.   The survivors were transported to the provincial hospitals of Kenitra, Larache, and Souk El Arbaa. Hours after the accident, King Mohammed VI sent his condolences to the victims’ families and agreed to personally take charge of the funeral expenses and the hospitalization costs of the survivors, according to a statement from the Royal Cabinet.

Rabat – The US embassy in Rabat has issued a security alert, upgrading its risk assessment to “Level 2” for possible terrorist attacks in Morocco. The US embassy is warning tourists to be on alert for possible terrorist attacks, especially in areas foreigners frequent. After a periodic review of security threats, the embassy recommended tourists “exercise increased caution in Morocco due to terrorism.” The embassy stated, “Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Morocco. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.”  According to its travel advisory map, the US government has also given much of Western Europe, including Spain, France, Germany, and Italy, a Level 2 security alert.  Level 2, which corresponds to “exercise increased caution,” is one step up from Level 1’s “exercise normal precaution,” which countries like the US and Canada have, and one step down from Level 3, “reconsider travel,” which countries like Mauritania and Niger have. The US government also gives a few countries, including Libya, its Level 4 travel advisory, “do not travel.” In its periodic review last year, the embassy also issued a general warning about possible terrorist attacks in Morocco. “The U.S. government remains concerned that terrorists are intent on targeting U.S. citizens, including children,” it stated. The Moroccan government has not issued any special alert on the threat of terrorism.  Morocco heightened its security measures ever since the Casablanca terrorist attack in 2003. Since the creation of the Central Bureau for Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) in 2015, Morocco has busted 49 terrorist cells, 44 of which had links to ISIS, and arrested 772 people in connection to terrorism.  Since 2003, Morocco has experienced two terrorist attacks. In 2011, terrorists bombed the Argana cafe in Jemaa El Fna Square in Marrakech, killing 17 people.  In December 2018, two Scandinavian female tourists were found murdered near Imlil in Morocco’s High Atlas mountains in an apparent terrorist attack.  Morocco’s counter-terrorism policy rests on three key targets: Stepping up internal security, eradicating poverty, and making religious reforms. Following the Imlil murders, Canada warned its citizens in its updated travel advisory to “exercise a high degree of caution” due to terrorism in Morocco. The United Kingdom also warned its citizens to stay vigilant for any possible terrorist attack in the country.

Rabat – A draft report on Western Sahara from the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has informed the Security Council that Morocco has provided images to the UN peacekeeping mission, MINURSO, confirming Polisario’s violations in the region. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) published extracts from the copy, stipulating that Guterres spoke of violations on military agreements and UN resolutions, including the most recent resolutions—2414 and 2440. The resolutions, adopted in April and October 2018, firmly called on the Polisario Front to leave the Guerguerat buffer zone immediately and to refrain from building or transferring any of its structures into the region east of Morocco’s defense wall. The Secretary-General’s draft report mentioned images taken by Morocco’s high resolution satellite, which Morocco gave to the UN to enable MINURSO to identify and confirm new violations by Polisario, including the construction of several buildings east of Morocco’s defence wall. The copy of the report warned against major risks of tensions in the region due to Polisario’s military exercises in restricted zones. In January, pro-Polisario news outlets, including the official news agency of the separatist group, reported that its members conducted a “military maneuver in the fourth military region in Mehriz,” a region in Western Sahara claimed as a “liberated zone” by Polisario. The Sahara Press Service said that the region also witnessed the “destruction of the eighth and last stockpile of antipersonnel mines.” The move angered the Moroccan government, which held press conferences to warn of possible tension due to Polisario’s maneuvers. The Moroccan government also sent a letter to Guterres to denounce the maneuvers and the construction of buildings as serious violations of the ceasefire and military agreements. In the draft report, Guterres also informed the Security Council that Polisario “continues to impede the freedom of movement of MINURSO military observers, whose patrols East of the defense system are already limited by the prevailing insecurity,” according to MAP. Polisario defies request to meet MINURSO at Rabouni Guterres also informed the Security Council that he called on Polisario members to meet MINURSO officials in Rabouni, Algeria and not east of the defense wall in Western Sahara. In his 2018 report, Guterres said that he asked Polisario that meetings between the separatist group and the UN representative take place as usual in Rabouni near Tindouf, in Algeria. Guterres, however, acknowledged that Polisario “insists” on meeting UN Special Representative for Western Sahara Colin Stewart east of the defense wall that Morocco built in Western Sahara. But the UN chief warned that the situation is a “significant obstacle to the relationship between MINURSO and Frente Polisario, which is currently limited to telephone and written contracts between my Special Representative and the Frente Polisario Coordinator.” In his recent report, Guterres recognized that the meetings between Polisario and MINURSO has not “resumed in Rabouni, Algeria, in accordance with the practice established since the creation of MINURSO” in 1991. The Secretary-General expressed regrets that his request was not respected. Second roundtable part of report The draft also recalled the efforts of the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy, Horst Kohler, who convened the parties involved in the conflict—Morocco, Algeria, Polisario, and Mauritania—around the same table in two roundtable discussions on Western Sahara. The first roundtable took place in December 2018 and the second in March, serving as initial steps to prepare for the launch of negotiations to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict. The UN expressed satisfaction with both roundtables, with Kohler acknowledging that there will be no quick result to the conflict because the parties need to build trust. In his draft report, the UN chief commented on the “positive spirit and constructive and respectful atmosphere” at the two roundtables. Guterres welcomed and emphasized the importance of the discussions and appreciated the agreement of all delegations to continue the process and to “reconvene in the same format, calling all parties to continue to seek compromise.” Quoting the report, MAP said that Algeria is “indeed called upon to engage fully and throughout the process, in accordance with its political, historical, and legal responsibility in the conflict and the resolutions of the Security Council, including resolution 2440” adopted in October 2018. The resolution called on all parties, including Algeria, which describes itself as an observer to the conflict, to constructively work along with all other parties with Kohler to find a mutually acceptable political solution. The draft report also called for a realistic, pragmatic, and durable political solution based on compromise as “the only way towards” a solution. Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, which Morocco has said is the only solution for the dispute, has long been described as a credible and serious solution to end the conflict. The report also asserted that a political solution to the regional conflict would benefit the entire region.

Rabat – Throngs of people took to the streets of Algerian cities yesterday to celebrate the resignation of the ailing Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.  After five weeks of mass protests across a number of Algerian cities, protesters marched together yesterday, April 2, to commemorate their long-awaited moment of victory in the wake of news that Bouteflika had officially resigned from office.  Videos have circulated social media showing cheering crowds of Algerians waving flags and euphorically chanting, marking the beginning of a critical transition for the Algerian people.  Some protesters chanted slogans like, “The people and the army are brothers!” and “Oh, Gaid Salah, fill up the prisons,” a call to the army chief to arrest other corrupt leaders.  Since February 22, Algerians have engaged in mass protests in opposition to Bouteflika and Algeria’s ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) party, which declared on February 9 that Bouteflika would run for a fifth term in office. Protesters demanded the ailing president abandon his campaign for the 2019 elections on April 18 and called for a radical change to the political system. The protests were largely peaceful. But in early March, protests escalated into clashes between riot police and protesters, who were heading to the presidential palace. Police fired tear gas to push protesters back, and protesters threw stones. A number of people were injured, including policemen. Bouteflika initially responded, on March 11, by saying he would not run for a fifth term, but he also said he would extend his fourth term for an undefined period of time. Protests continued, and Bouteflika announced a cabinet reshuffle on March 31, but protesters refused to backtrack on their demands.  Finally, Bouteflika gave in to popular demands and handed his resignation letter to the Constitutional Council late Tuesday, April 2, ending a 20-year presidency. The Constitutional Council is meeting Wednesday to confirm the resignation and appeal to the two houses of Parliament to declare the presidency vacant.  In his resignation letter, Bouteflika stated that he is leaving office to “protect the country from dire consequences, its possessions, and placate citizens.”  President Bouteflika tendered his resignation less than four weeks before his term would have officially ended on April 28. Since 2013 when Bouteflika suffered a stroke, he has rarely been seen in public and he has been confined to a wheelchair.  Army chief Gaid Salah demanded last week that Bouteflika step down or that the Constitutional Council declare him unfit for office, invoking Article 102 of the Constitution.  The article stipulates immediate removal of the president if deemed unfit for office due to his state of health.

Rabat – The children of the murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi have each received “million-dollar houses” and thousands of dollars in monthly payments from Saudi Arabia as compensation for the killing of their father. Saudi Arabia is attempting through the move to come to a long-term understanding and discourage the Khashoggi children from speaking out for their father’s killing at the hands of Saudi agents, Saudi officials told the Washington Post. One Saudi official told the paper that the payments are part of Saudi Arabia’s “custom and culture” and are “not attached to anything else.” A number of Saudi officials who spoke to the paper on the condition of anonymity declared that negotiations for further payments are expected to take place following the trials of the agents involved in the killing of Khashoggi, who was a Washington Post contributor. The newspaper quoted a former Saudi official saying that King Salman Abdulaziz Al Saud approved the “delivery of homes and monthly payments of $10,000 or more to each sibling” in 2018 as an acknowledgment that “a big injustice has been done” and in a bid “to make a wrong, right.” The houses offered to the siblings are worth as much as $4 million apiece and are located in Jeddah, where Khashoggi’s eldest son, Salah, lives. The three other children, who live in the US, are expected to sell their new properties. Khashoggi was killed on October 2, 2018, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he had gone to retrieve documents he needed for his impending wedding. Turkish police never found Khashoggi’s body. Turkish investigators believe that Khashoggi’s remains were dissolved in acid and poured down the drain of the Saudi consulate. Although Saudi Arabia has denied the royal family had anything to do with the assassination of Khashoggi, international intelligence agencies have implicated Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman as the main instigator of the murder. Saudi authorities arrested 11 suspects involved in the killing, five of whom could face the death penalty for “ordering and committing the crime.”

Rabat – After the embattled Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika stepped down late Tuesday, April 2, the Constitutional Council convened a meeting to declare the presidency vacant. The Constitutional Council invoked Article 102 of the Algerian Constitution. The two houses of Parliament, the People’s National Assembly and the Council of the Nation, will have to approve the decision.  Under the Algerian Constitution, Bouteflika’s long-standing ally Abdelkader Bensalah, 77, the current head of Algeria’s upper house of Parliament, will become interim leader for 90 days. Last week, army chief Ahmed Gaid Salah demanded that the president step down and called for the Constitutional Council to invoke Article 102 of the Constitution. The article gives the council power to remove the incumbent if judged unfit for office. Salah also called for the application of Articles 7 and 8 of the Constitution. Article 7 lays down that “the people are the source of power.” Since February 22, Algeria has witnessed hundreds of thousands of citizens flooding its streets calling for Bouteflika not to run for a fifth term in office. The 82-year-old  had been president since 1999. On March 8, after some of the biggest protests since February 22, Bouteflika caved in to popular demands and declared that he would not run for another term.

Rabat – Colonial legacies, especially the legacies of border adjustments for postcolonial states, have sowed the seeds of instability in Africa and elsewhere. The colonizer sought to extend a logic of territorial disintegration that retains control and neocolonial advantages, ignoring this way the precolonial realities to the benefit of rootless fashioned identities. Morocco is a case in point. Morocco was under the capture of two colonial powers—France and Spain, which of course tore apart its land. It took nearly 20 years to completely decolonize the land and gain full independence. By questioning territoriality here, of course with regard to colonialism and its repercussions, it should be noted that, unlike other parts of North Africa, Morocco was ruled under the centuries-old Alawite monarchy, predating European expansionism. Resistance and the fight for independence were carried out in the name of the sultan. The relationship between the ruler and the ruled was one of allegiance, with all its political and religious embodiments. However, the French and the Spanish colonialist administrations in Morocco adopted divergent approaches to subjugate the insurgent regions. The Spanish, dominating the north and south, did not pay much attention to establishing a centralized form of governance. They prioritized securing the coastal line of the Sahara against threats to their economic goals in the region. France, covering the middle zone, sought to perpetuate their hegemony by obliterating all regional insurrections, without challenging the Alawite legitimacy as a central ruling authority. However, the dividing line between these two colonial mindsets will be later referential for separatist theses sponsored by geopolitical rivals to Morocco. The emergence of Polisario’s separatist ambition, which was initially part of the Moroccan nationalist liberation movement, benefitted from an ambiguous postcolonial context marked by Algeria’s growing hegemonic spirit. Algerian policy would subsequently result in heated competition with Morocco, more remarkably after the 1960s border war. This historical factor, among others, justifies the role of the Algerian diplomatic apparatus in rallying international support for Polisario, using all its resources to serve what seems to be a proxy player, the self-proclaimed Sahrawi republic, in an endless zero sum game that is blatant to the international community. Very simplistic studies seem to deliberately reduce the Sahara issue to the application of the “self-determination” principle from a political perspective. They ignore historical and cultural factors in understanding the Sahara conflict dynamics, which undermine Polisario’s secessionist thesis. Before deconstructing cultural discourses, I should mention that the “referendum” option, which was accepted by all parties to the conflict, including Algeria, proved impracticable and very difficult without a cultural and social reference to define the “Sahrawi Identity” and decide on the lists of voters eligible for the referendum. The bone of contention that led to the suspension of the “identification process” was the impossibility of “knowing who is the Sahrawi?” Since then, the UN line of thought has shifted towards a more realistic stance in approaching the Sahara issue. Polisario and Algeria say the “self-determination” principle has to be fulfilled hinging exclusively on the lists of the 1974 Spanish census. The census is a colonial document produced in a limited period on a demarcated territory for a “tailored identity” that would be used later to justify secession. The census tunes out, however, the indigenous cultural and historical determinism that shapes a Sahrawi nomadic mindset that relies on mobility as a lifestyle. The Spanish colonizer was more attentive to land control, without putting much pressure on the mobility of tribes across the colonial borders. Spain was not willing to change the local lifestyle, as the Spanish administration maintained “jmaa,” the group of tribal chiefs (shioukhs), as the legitimate representatives of the local population. The shioukhs, who admit allegiance to the Alawite monarchy, draw their legitimacy from a traditional sense of belonging that emanates from grounded social and religious beliefs. The Spanish 1974 census cannot stand as a genuine source to define the “Sahrawi identity” because it uproots part of the population from its broader cultural sphere and enforces an uprooted postcolonial identity unfittingly labelled as “Sahrawi People.” During the UN-led identification process in 1997, Polisario leaders sought to bring new realities to the political arena, as they were cautiously selective in recognizing some “Sahrawis” as eligible voters and many others as not. If we go back to the lists of Sahrawis covered by the UN in 1997, we would discover an ideological rather than a cultural/ethnic explanation of this identification. Strong evidence shows that Polisario accepted some members of Sahrawi families as “eligible voters” and excluded other members of the same families from the lists. For Polisario, an alleged reference to the Spanish 1974 census should be the dividing line between two separate identities, which seems to look at “self-determination” through referendum as a one-size-fits-all approach to a mechanical transition from one situation to another. Astonishingly, the Polisario Front contradicts itself and subverts its alleged rightfulness by recognizing as Sahrawis, though not eligible to vote in the referendum, all those who support its political claims, even if they belong to areas (Guelmim, Assa, Tantan) beyond the so-called “Western Sahara,” and were not covered by the Spanish 1974 census. The fact that Polisario recognizes the existence of part of the Sahrawi community in other parts of Morocco, and of a cultural entity broader than the alleged “Sahrawi People” destabilizes the legitimacy of its claims and gives meaning to initiatives mindful of the multidimensionality of the Sahara issue. It also enhances the legality of Morocco’s territorial integrity after a long decolonization process. The international community shows a growing, though belated, realistic understanding of the intricacies of the Sahara issue, which justifies the tendency towards brokering a solution based on compromise. The realism in the UN consciousness was more conspicuous in former UNSG Personal Envoy Peter Van Walsum’s straightforward statement that “the question of Western Sahara does not stand a chance of ever being understood as long as Algeria’s deep involvement is not taken into account.” Several years later, Horst Kohler, who holds the same position, is inviting Morocco, Algeria, Polisario, and Mauritania on equal footing to convene for roundtable consultations on the Sahara issue. This is another unmistakable recognition of Algeria’s meddling in the Sahara matter, and of the instrumentalization of human rights issues that cloak Algeria’s geopolitical aims, blurring considerations of local historical and cultural specificities to achieve a peaceful solution to the regional conflict.

Rabat – The assistant to the secretary general of the Arab League for Palestinian affairs and occupied lands, Saeed Abu Ali, has commended King Mohammed VI’s and Pope Francis’s “al-Quds call.” As the chairman of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation’s al-Quds Committee, King Mohammed VI signed the “al-Quds call” with Pope Francis on Saturday, March 30, to promote the holy character and spiritual significance of Jerusalem, known in Arabic as al-Quds al-Sharif, or the holy Jerusalem.  Abu Ali stated that the signing of the call is the strongest international response to all attempts at redefining the “occupied” Jerusalem and obscuring its religious identity.  “The signing of the document by the pope as world leader of Christianity and Morocco’s King as commander of the faithful and representative of Islam” Abu Ali stated, “serves as the strongest and most eloquent response thus far in reiterating Jerusalem’s multi-religious dimension.” He added that Jerusalem is not for the Jews only, and nobody has the right to alter this reality. Abu Ali noted that the spiritual dimension King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis brought is what gave the document strategic importance. He said the “al-Quds call” can be “nothing but the product of a wise man of faith.” Believing that Jerusalem is a heritage of humankind and not the capital of Israel or Jews alone, Abu Ali called the document historic and a confrontation of the decision of the US government that ignored others’ rights and ties to the city. Abu Ali insinuated that the Trump administration, which recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in 2017, poses a constant threat to the region. The signing of the “al-Quds call” came within a week after the US also recognized Israel as sovereign over the Syrian Golan Heights territory.  “After 52 years it is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel’s Sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and Regional Stability!” Trump tweeted on March 21. Following President Donald Trump’s official recognition of the Golan Heights as Israel’s, Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancila stated that her country plans to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, who has authority over foreign policy, contradicted Dancila and opposed the claim. In response to Dancila, Morocco postponed a visit by Romanian Senate President Calin Popescu Tariceanu to the kingdom that was scheduled for March 27-31. The Jordanian King Abdullah II also canceled his trip to Romania on March 27-28.

Rabat – After leading Algeria for 20 years, Abdelaziz Bouteflika has decided to resign amid unrest and perceived unpopularity. The decision comes following an announcement from the president’s office that the ailing leader was considering stepping down by April 28, before the official end of his fourth presidential term.  But that announcement only came after weeks of unrest in the streets of Algiers, with students and civil society groups calling for power to be handed over to a new generation. Protesters said the country’s ineffective political system had to leave and hand power over to a new generation. In response, Bouteflika initially announced a major cabinet reshuffle, hoping to assuage the protesters’ radical demands and weeks-long street protests calling for a major change in the country’s “dying” political system. In recent weeks, however, there were reports of further weakening of the Bouteflika regime after Algerian army top chief Gaid Salah asked Bouteflika to submit his immediate resignation. Salah, who was known for his support for Bouteflika, said that he backs Algerian people and their determination. He added that “no more time should be wasted” after the mass protests demanding the resignation of Bouteflika. Monday marked the seventh week of mass protests against Bouteflika and his government. As Bouteflika’s resignation sinks in in the following hours and weeks, Algerians are set to look at the future with both excitement and apprehension.  While the streets have been successful in ending the Bouteflika regime’s iron fist on the country’s political power, there are no clear indications of rupture in what will now be called post-Bouteflika Algeria. There are speculations that Gaid Salah is likely to succeed Bouteflika.

Rabat – Her first act of defiance was wearing a red union armband to class. Her second was staging assemblies after school. Now, Imane Ragi, a veteran of more than 25 protests, is entering the third month of a nation-wide contractual teachers’ strike in Morocco. Along with more than 200 other contractual teachers, Ragi chanted, “We are still here and we won’t stop” in front of Parliament in Rabat, the usual location for rallies. This particular protest is the first in April. The day before, teachers’ rights unions had sent messages urging their supporters to continue rejecting the Moroccan government’s attempts to end protests and ignore the Ministry of Education’s threats of firing. “Most of us are not afraid to get fired anymore, especially if we are just going to go back to working the way we’ve been,” Ragi told Morocco World News. “I’d prefer to look for another job where I can work with my dignity and be treated with justice.” Ragi was one of the thousands of teachers participating in the overnight protest two weeks ago that ended when the police dispersed the crowd with the use of water cannons. “I am so ashamed to be a part of a society that treats teachers in this way,” Ragi said. “It is shameful. How can you treat teachers, the people who teach the next generation, like that. It is unjust.” On March 30, following the police’s use of water cannons and the ministry’s threats, a statement was released by the collection of unions which strongly condemned “the repression the government practiced in facing the wave of contractual teachers’ protests.” The Democratic Labor Confederation’s National Education Union (SNE-CDT), the Democratic Labor Federation’s National Education Union (SNE-FDT), the National Teaching Federation (FNE), the National Federation of Teachers (UNMT) and the Moroccan National Coordination of Teachers Forced into Teaching Contracts (CNPCC) are five of the unions that have been most involved with the contractual teachers’ protests. Together the unions have staged protests in several cities across Morocco, including Kenitra, Casablanca, Tetouan, Oujda, Errachidia, and Marrakech. Each union has its own designated color, making the crowd of teachers participating in the first April protest a sea of red, yellow, purple, blue, and white. Before slipping into the crowd of chanting teachers, Ragi adjusted her red union armband—the CNPCC’s color. “I can’t lose this,” Ragi said. “I still have a lot more use for it.” Behind the protests: The contractual cause The core of the movement has two main groups. The first is the contractual teachers. To fill a need for more teachers, the Ministry of Education has been hiring teachers through regional academies under annually renewable contracts since 2016.  Individuals hired under this contract are known as “contractual teachers.” They are members of the public sector and receive the same salary, starting at MAD 5,000 ($520) a month, as teachers permanently on the government payroll. But their annual contracts include a reduced pension and lead to less job security—the two main reasons many have been protesting. These teachers have been accused by the government of violating their contracts by protesting instead of teaching. Minister of Education Said Amzazi issued a statement in March, explaining that teachers were properly informed of the contracts’ conditions and requested the contractual teachers to return to their classrooms. His request went ignored. “We won’t go home until we have our demands realized. We aren’t going to stop until we get what we want and we are integrated into the government,” Khalid Bittaouia, a member of the national CNPCC and coordinator for Sidi Slimane, a city northeast of Rabat, told MWN. Bittaouia has played a pivotal role in organizing and transporting teachers between the two cities, a journey of more than 100 kilometers. During the March 12 protest, Bittaouia calculated that more than half of Sidi Slimane’s contractual teachers were in attendance—roughly 200 demonstrators. “We are not stopping until we get what we want, what we deserve,” Bittaouia said. “This policy of contracting has to go, there is no going back.” The Cell 9 Coordination is the second group of teachers that form the base of the movement; teachers in this group fall within the government’s ninth pay grade. According to the SNE-CDT, SNE-FDT, and FNE, the government has been withholding promotions to the 10th pay grade. The average difference between the two grades is MAD 1,500 ($155) per month. Every two years, the Ministry of Education is required to offer qualifying exams to evaluate teachers’ performance; the results of the exams determine promotions. But the unions claim the exams are not fairly graded and that many of their teachers have not been promoted since 2012. “We are forced to stay in this stage, some of us for decades,” Mohammed Boukhisse, a national coordinator for Cell 9, told MWN during the protest on March 12. “By doing this the government never needs to increase our pay or benefits.” The group is calling for the immediate promotion of all of its members to the 10th pay grade. Boukhisse declined to give the exact number of teachers within the coordination. But according to the Ministry of Education, there are more than 4,560 teachers within the ninth pay grade nationwide. The Ministry of Education has been steadfast in its refusal to meet all of the teacher unions’ requests. Violence broke out during the first month of the protests on Feb. 18-20. The injuries suffered by teachers caused outrage throughout the unions and inspired protesters to continue into March. On March 10, the Ministry of Education announced potential reforms that would grant contractual teachers all the rights of a permanent teacher but not hire them as public sector employees. The unions rejected the reforms on the same day. Protests continued throughout the month, leading to the outburst of violence on March 23-24, when police used water cannons to disperse an overnight sit-in by Parliament. Days after the incident, Amzazi announced in a press conference on March 27 the government’s plans to begin firing contractual teacher protesters. Amzazi assured teachers that if they ended their strikes and returned to work, the government would “provide them with all their needs and guarantee all their rights, except for the deduction of their wages,” which the government still plans to do. It was in response to this announcement and the end of March violence that the unions called for their members to take to the streets and continue protesting.

Rabat – The Moroccan Coalition for the Arabic Language has launched a petition on Avaaz against draft framework Law 51. 17 which makes French the language of instruction for scientific and technological subjects in Moroccan schools. The petition, under the title “For Linguistic Justice,” has generated more than 1,470 signatures. The coalition said that political figures and Moroccan scholars also signed the petition. In a press statement, the coalition said that more than 150 popular political and academic figures launched the petition to amend the framework law. The petition addresses Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, the House of Representatives, the House of Councillors, the minister of education, and heads of parliamentary committees.  The signatories of the petition said that they rejected the content of the draft law, saying it contradicts the principles of the Moroccan Constitution and the status of the Arabic language in Morocco. “The coalition plans to launch a popular petition open to individuals and institutions on social networks before resorting to other measure to mobilize all the energies and competencies of the community to demand the amendment of the law framework.” The draft law stresses the importance of having students master three languages in addition to Arabic. The draft law stipulates that students should be proficient in languages such as Tamazight (Berber), which is Morocco’s second official language, as well as in two other foreign languages. Sign another petition In addition to the coalition, the University of Education Employees affiliated with the Moroccan National Labor Union (UNTM) called on education employees and the public to sign a petition to condemn the draft law. “The university warned of the consequences” of not abiding by the principles of the Moroccan Constitution because it would be against the “national consensus.” The statement published by UNTM added that the university “emphasized its rejection of this prejudice against the purpose of the Arabic language and its fundamentalism as a basic language in teaching alongside Tamazight language.” The petition supported statements made by former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane, who strongly criticized the law. On Sunday, Benkirane published a video on his Facebook to condemn the law. Benkirane criticized members of his political party, the Justice and Development Party (PJD), telling them that they “have no right to vote on this law.” The move, Benkirane argued, is a serious “betrayal of the principles of the party [PJD] and the Constitution and its vision.” In addition to Benkirane, the head of the International Union of Muslim Scholars, Ahmed Raissouni, defended Arabic. “I am for Arabic teaching, and with it Morocco has been a great country.” Raissouni also put forward English as preferable over French, emphasizing that it is the top language in the world. “If science must to be taught in a foreign language, it must be taught in English. English first, then Spanish, and then French, and Morocco must come out of this monopoly, because the French language monopolizes Morocco, Moroccan intellectuals, thinkers, and students.” The scholar went further, stating, “This bypassed monopoly to rape.” For Raissouni, “Arabic should come first, and then English, and then we can look for a place for French.” He added that students do not fully grasp lessons taught in French and English because their proficiency level is low.

Rabat – Spanish journalists who traveled with Pope Francis to Morocco seized the opportunity to share their concerns and convey messages from inmates held at in the Castellon II prison in Albocasser, Spain. Pope Francis said that he would “like to visit Spain,” but he would do it “when peace reigns,” reported EFE. Journalists said that the pope did not give further explanation on the peace remarks. During the trip, a Spanish journalist handed the pope a letter from several people imprisoned in Castellon and asked him to visit them. Read Also: UN: Pope Francis’s Visit to Morocco is Extremely Symbolic, Important The pope said that “he would like” to visit Spain and greet all inmates. Journalists also asked the pope about the Spanish government’s decision to build border fences and a barbed-wire wall around Ceuta and Melilla to stop undocumented migration. Commenting on the issue, the pope said, “It is very difficult, it is very difficult.” Pope Francis made his feelings on migration clear, when he said during his return to the Vatican that people should build bridges not walls. On the papal flight back to the Vatican, the pope criticized US President Donald Trump, emphasizing that “those who build bridges are moving forward. The bridge is for human communication, it is very beautiful and I have seen it here in Morocco.”  Journalists also asked the pope if he was willing to visit Argentina, his homeland. “We will if I can go soon,” said the pope. The pope spent a busy two-day visit in Morocco March 30-31. During his first day in Morocco, the pope met with the Moroccan royal family and signed an appeal to preserve the status of Jerusalem with King Mohammed VI. On his second day in Morocco, the pope visited Rabat’s cathedral where he met with priests, migrants, and Catholic Christians. The pope then concluded his visit with a Catholic mass at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, attended by 10,000 people from multiple countries.

Rabat – Former Salafi and scholar Mohamed Abdelwahhab Rafiqui, also known as Abu Hafs, has spoken highly of the Islamic-Jewish-Christian musical synergy performed during Pope Francis’s visit to Morocco.  Is fusing the adhan with music a form of idolatry? While the synergized performance, which included the Muslim call to prayer (adhan), aimed to highlight rapprochement and dialogue between the three religions, the chants seem to have touched the nerve of many and have generated a flood of criticism on social media. Many have expressed outright rejection of the fusion of adhan with music on the grounds that it contradicts the Islamic doctrine. In a post on Facebook, Hamad Al Kabbaj, a Salafi and affiliate of the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD), described the musical combination as “pagan.” He said the performance runs counter to the principle of the unity of God. In response, Rafiqui took to Facebook on Monday, April 1, to lambaste critics. Rafiqui called the performance a “beautiful and innovative palette of music.” Kabbaj had argued that it is absolutely impermissible to fuse the adhan with the “pagan” elements that permeated the Christian and Jewish faiths.  Kabbaj called on the High Council of Scholars for the Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs to take their responsibility and punish what he perceives as an insult to Islam. A historical aversion of art? Rafiqui attributed Kabbaj’s and others’ reactions to two main causes. The first is that their attitude reflects a superiority complex. They think that all other faiths are mistaken and only theirs is true, according to Rafiqui. The second reason is their “historical aversion to the arts.” Rafiqui asked, “How would someone, who believes that listening to music is forbidden—whose divine punishment is to pour molten lead into the ears of those who listen to it, savour holy words accompanied by music?” Celebrating the two-day papal visit to Morocco, the Moroccan Philharmonic Orchestra (OPM) gave an orchestral performance before King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis at the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams, Morchidines and Morchidates. Bringing together the three monotheistic religions, OPM’s chants wove together three voices: The Muslim adhan (call to prayer); the Jewish call for prayer known as Adonai; and Caccini’s motet Ave Maria, a landmark Christian song. Events held during Pope Francis’s two-day visit, from March 30 to 31, sought to boost interfaith dialogue, religious tolerance, and coexistence. Many perceived the papal visit as an opportunity to strengthen the relationship among people of different faiths. In a gesture promoting freedom of religious practice, King Mohammed VI stressed in his speech at the Hassan Tower in Rabat, “I protect Moroccan Jews as well as foreign Christians, who are living in Morocco.”

Rabat – Europe’s leading human rights organization, the Council of Europe, named Morocco a “partner for local democracy” in a resolution on Tuesday. Morocco is the first country to hold the title. The status gives Morocco a platform at the Council’s Congress of Local and Regional Authorities. The body serves as a hub for Europe’s local political authorities and aims to promote democracy and good governance on a regional level. Morocco has sent a nine-person delegation to the Congress’s 36th session, which began April 2 and will conclude April 4. Headed by Mohand Laenser, who leads Morocco’s Popular Movement (MP) Party, the delegation will participate in the Congress’s discussion and debate—though delegates will not be able to vote. Morocco’s Ministry of the Interior applied for the status in May 2018 jointly with two Moroccan regional political associations. Council spokesperson Piero Fassino said the move reflected Morocco’s strong relationship with the Congress. “It is in this promising context that we look forward to the ambitious co-operation work that is about to begin,” Fassino said. For the Council of Europe, granting the status to Morocco advances a strategy of bettering ties with Europe’s border nations—what it calls its “neighborhood policy.” The policy, announced in 2011 after the Arab Spring, has always centered on North Africa.  Since the Council launched the policy, it has collaborated extensively with Morocco. The Moroccan Parliament holds “Partner for Democracy” status with the Council’s Parliamentary Assembly, and the Council opened up a bureau in Rabat in 2014. In 2018, Morocco and the Council announced a three-year partnership plan, developed jointly, that laid out objectives for their collaboration through 2021.  On April 3, Laenser and Abdelouahab El Jabri, governor and official at the Ministry of the Interior, will address the Congress following a presentation on the importance of Morocco’s partnership with the Council.

Rabat – The United Nations has described Pope Francis’s visit to Morocco as “extremely  important.” The spokesperson of the United Nations Secretary-General, Stephane Dujarric, said that the Jerusalem appeal signed by King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis “goes along the lines of what the Secretary-General has been saying for a quite long time, that Jerusalem has a sacred character for Jews, for Christians and Muslims and that it needs to be preserved.” On Saturday, March 30, the pope and the King expressed concerns through an appeal to the world to warn against moves that undermine the status of Jerusalem. “We believe it is important to preserve the Holy City of Jerusalem (Al-Quds Al-Sharif) as a shared heritage of humankind and to safeguard it, above all for the believers of the three monotheistic religions, as a symbol of peaceful coexistence and as a meeting place where mutual esteem and dialogue are fostered,” reads the appeal. Dujarric said that the pope’s visit to Morocco is “extremely important and extremely symbolic.” “Anything that can bring greater understanding and tolerance between religions is to be welcomed and the issue of migrants and the protection of migrants and the respect of migrants’ dignity is something that is very close to the Secretary-General’s heart,” said the spokesperson in a press briefing on April 1. The European Union also expressed satisfaction with the Jerusalem appeal. A spokesman of the EU, quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), said that the European institution “recognizes the special importance of the holy places of Jerusalem for the three monotheistic religions.” The unidentified spokesperson added that the EU also “firmly believes that the status quo established in 1976 must be maintained in accordance with the previous agreements.” Pope Francis dedicated his first-ever visit to Morocco to discussing migrants’ rights, interfaith coexistence, and the importance of charity. Meeting hundreds of migrants during his visit, the pope chaired a holy mass at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, convening Christians from all over the world. An estimated 10,000 people attended the pope’s mass. On his way back to the Vatican, Pope Francis regretted issues facing migrants. The pope also criticized US President Donald Trump’s policy regarding migrants, saying that the world should invest in building bridges, not walls. “Those who build bridges are moving forward. The bridge is for human communication, it is very beautiful and I have seen it here in Morocco,” the pope told the press.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi and Abdellatif Jouahri, the governor of Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM)— Morocco’s central bank—signed an agreement on March 29 for BAM to prepare, design, and preserve the certificates and diplomas issued by national educational institutions. Students usually keep their high school diplomas and certificates at home or their universities for preservation, but Bank Al-Maghrib has come to change that. All certificates, including baccalaureate certificates and grade sheets from schools, universities, and vocational training centers will be in the care of Dar As Sikkah, Bank Al-Maghrib’s printing unit. Amzazi and Jouahri’s partnership agreement also aims to guarantee equal rights and opportunities by preserving all kinds of diplomas from primary education to higher education.  The partnership seeks to improve the diplomas’ trustworthiness by “strengthening their credibility in accordance with the latest international technologies,” said Jouahri.  The agreement, which went into force on March 29, is open for a period of up to 10 years. Founded in 1959 with headquarters in Rabat, Bank Al-Maghrib manages currency, formulates the monetary policy in Morocco, and supervises a number of private banks supplying commercial banking services. The bank’s Dar As-Sikkah was established in March 1987 to take over printing bank notes and minting coins.

Rabat – The president of the International Union of Muslim Scholars, Ahmed Al Raissouni, has strongly criticized the heads of political parties who support draft Law 51.17, which seeks to adopt French as a language of teaching in scientific subjects in Moroccan schools. Raissouni said that Arabic should come first, and then English, “and then [we can] look for a place for French.” The scholar warned that students’ proficiency in foreign languages is low because students cannot interact with classes in French and English. Raissouni argued that “if science should be taught in a foreign language, it must be taught in English.” Read Also: Abdelilah Benkirane Slams PJD’s Stance on French Teaching Law, Calls on El Othmani to Resign The scholar added that “English should come first, Spanish second, and then French.” According to Raissouni, Morocco has to come out of “this monopoly, because French monopolizes Morocco, intellectuals, thinkers, and students.” Raissouni’s statement added to the recent remarks by former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane, who criticized members of the Justice and Development Party (PJD) which he previously led. According to Benkirane, the draft law is unconstitutional and against the principles of his party. The draft law, according to education minister Said Amzazi is in line with the Strategic Vision for the Reform of the Moroccan School launched by the Higher Council for Education, Training, and Scientific Research in 2015. Amzazi argued that “some subjects should be taught in a foreign language,” alluding to French. Benkirane, however, called on all members of the PJD to abstain from voting on the draft law. Benkirane also called on Head of Government and Secretary-General of the PJD Saad Eddine El Othmani to resign if necessary, suggesting that a resignation would be more honorable than giving up on the party’s principles.

Rabat – United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres submitted a report to the Security Council on Monday, in which he called on the parties involved in the Western Sahara conflict to “take action” to contribute to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to end the conflict. Quoting the report, AFP said that Guterres believes that a political solution to the conflict is “possible.” In the report, Guterres spoke about the “lack of trust” between the parties involved in the conflict to engage “seriously and equitably in the process.” Guterres, however, acknowledges that “building trust takes time,” emphasizing the importance of a “strong” political will to end the conflict. The UN chief also spoke about the peacekeeping mission in the region known as MINURSO. Guterres said that he had asked the UN General Assembly for a budget of  $56.4 million for the mission in the period of July 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020. Guterres also requested an extension to MINURSO’s mandate, which expires April 30 in accordance with Security Council Resolution 2440. Guterres’ report followed remarks by John Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser, about MINURSO’s budget. The anti-MINURSO official lambasted the mission for its failure to end the conflict since its creation in 1991. “Ladies and gentlemen, 27 years of deployment of this peacekeeping force, 27 years and it’s still there? How can you justify that? I have got to know over the years the Saharawi people, I have enormous respect for them, I have enormous respect for the government and people of Morocco and Algeria, is there not a way to resolve it?” Bolton asked in December 2018. He added that the US will not pay for missions that have no impact on conflicts. Guterres’s report to the Security Council followed the second roundtable near Geneva in March, convening all parties involved in the conflict. At the end of the roundtable, the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Kohler promised a third roundtable in the same format. Kohler also acknowledged that there will be no quick solution to the conflict. “There is still a lot of work ahead of the delegations. Nobody should expect a quick outcome,” said Kohler. The envoy called on the parties to engage seriously in the UN-led political process to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict.

Rabat – American news outlet CNN has listed Morocco’s Mount Toubkal, the highest peak in North Africa, as the one of the 23 best destinations for hiking in the world. “The path upwards rises from the village of Imlil, passing over a dry river before rising sharply through the shrine at Sidi Chamharouch and on towards a large mountain hut,” said the news outlet. CNN, however, said that a local guide is a “must” in the region for a better adventure. “After overnighting here, hikers strap on crampons and set off up the snowfield to the summit, where the Atlas Mountains open out and the views are relentless.” The ranking illustrates that tourism in the region has not been affected after the murder of two Scandinavian tourists near Imlil at the base of Mount Toubkal in December 2018. Morocco’s security services found the bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, of Norway on December 17. Following the Imlil murders, senior Moroccan officials said that every country faces the threat of terrorism. Morocco’s security services arrested at least 22 suspects in connection to the murder of the two Scandinavian tourists. The High Atlas Mountains maintain their charm and still attract international and local tourists who prefer outdoor activities. In March, over 100 Danish tourists visited Imlil to show the world that Morocco is a safe country with hospitable people.

Rabat – Rooted Everyday, an environmental campaign focused on the Mediterranean, is launching an environment-themed writing competition on April 2.  The short story competition is open for writers over 18 from the Mediterranean ecoregion: Portugal, Spain, Morocco, Greece, and Lebanon.  Candidates should submit a 3000-word story encouraging “awareness, understanding and the protection of Mediterranean culture and biodiversity.” The deadline for submitting stories will be on June 24, and the winners will be announced on October 1, 2019. Stories can be either in Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, or Greek. There will also be a competition for children and young adults aged between 7 and 18. Candidates for that category should be from schools in Morocco’s High Atlas mountains, Greek Island of Lemnos in the Aegean Sea, Montados in Portugal, and Shouf mountains in Lebanon.  The campaign has selected experienced readers and judges from each country to look for stories that address the conservation issues within the Rooted Everyday campaign.  The prize includes a certificate, a selection of books, promotional support for the winners to share their stories on the campaign’s platforms and have them featured in an e-book. According to the organizers, the contest’s main objective, is to show the value of biodiversity and traditional practices in the Mediterranean. The prize is set to celebrate the rich biodiversity in the aforementioned ecoregions, “and to tell the stories of the people whose livelihoods depend on traditional and sustainable practices.” The campaign mentioned Morocco’s High Atlas Mountain landscapes which are home to a rich cultural heritage, including endangered traditions and economically important plant species looked after by indigenous Moroccan Amazigh people. Lily Mordechai, MeDINA’s Scientific Secretary, said:  “We chose to make creative writing part of the campaign because storytelling is a powerful tool that is authentic … By engaging writers and creative individuals we hope we will not only raise awareness but also hear stories of how people experience and perceive biodiversity and heritage in the Mediterranean.”

Rabat – Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has decided to step down from his office before the end of his mandate on April 28. A statement from his office reads that Bouteflika will take “steps to ensure state institutions continue to function during the transition period.” The statement added that his “resignation would occur before April 28, 2019.” Bouteflika’s decision followed a major cabinet reshuffle on Sunday. The president announced a new government after a major protest carried out on Friday, March 29. The protests erupted when Bouteflika’s office announced that the ailing president will run for a fifth term. The announcement comes weeks after Bouteflika appointed a caretaker government to complete the transition period by the end of which he would cede his position to a president elect.   Among the replacement made during the government reshuffle, Bouteflika dismissed Lamamra Ramtane from his two posts: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Newly appointed head of government Noureddine Bedoui remained as Prime Minister. Ahmed Gaid Salah, who has been calling for the resignation of Bouteflika, remained as top chief of the Algerian army and deputy defence minister. Ennahar television channel reported that Algerian security services seized on Monday the passports of seven businessmen over corruption allegations. Police also arrested Algerian businessman Ali Haddad on Saturday night at a border post with Tunisia, according to AFP. Algerian police also  prevented all private jets from “taking off  and landing until the end of the month,” according to France 24.

Rabat – Likewise, starting this year, Mayor Justin Wilson of Alexandria, Virginia, has proclaimed June 9 as an annual day to celebrate Moroccan culture and history.  Mohamed El Hajjam, the president of MAN, has confirmed that Alexandria will host a cultural festival to pay homage to Morocco’s diversity. The festival will feature a mixture of Morocco’s Gnawa music and dance, jazz music, and other artistic expressions.  The event will also be an opportunity to celebrate Morocco as a country with a genuine culture of peace and generosity.  There will also be references to Morocco’s historical role as a bridge between different cultures and religious creeds, with an emphasis on how the country promotes coexistence in the face of intolerance and extremism. On March 29, Moroccans and Americans participated in the Moroccan American Network’s fourth annual Business Forum–CEO Summit. Members of the Royal Cabinet of Morocco, the US Black Chambers, think tank experts, academics, and business leaders were in attendance. The summit focused on augmenting international small business opportunities and encouraging partnerships between the US and Africa “for greater collaboration and exchange of ideas, promoting foreign investment and economic growth,” according to El Hajjam. He added that establishing Morocco Day in D.C. was just the “first step in a long and ambitious journey to strengthen Morocco’s position in the United States of America.”  In addition to business-related themes, the event also recognized Morocco’s unique cultural heritage, as well as its contributions to the world and Moroccans’ peaceful efforts to practice religious tolerance. The network endeavors to use the cultural event to celebrate each of Morocco’s twelve regions each year;his year, the event celebrated the city of Zagora in the Draa-Tafilalet region. The Moroccan American Network strives to educate the American public, media, and government officials about business and investment opportunities in Morocco through dialogue, forums, and events. In addition to education, the network also connects American and African small businesses and media communities to facilitate mutual growth and collaboration.

by Sebastian Bouknight Rabat – In the stadium-turned-church, a grand altar stage dominated, backed by images of Moroccan architecture and a large cross. The space brimmed with some 10,000 worshippers and others who came for the experience, a stunning number considering the country’s small Christian community.    The Mass drew Christians from across Morocco and beyond. Flags of Spain, Brazil, Lebanon, and Poland were but a few among many. Mexicans, Congolese, Cameroonians, Angolans, and Italians shared the stands. Readings and prayers were offered in six languages, including Arabic. A Saharawi woman held an enormous Moroccan flag.   When large monitors showed the pope’s convoy arriving at the stadium, the crowd erupted in excitement: “Il arrive!” “El llegó!” “He’s arrived!” Spirited shouts of “El Papa! Viva!” punctuated the Mass. Many of those who managed to touch the pope’s arm as he walked down the aisle swooned with joy.  A chorus of several hundred sang sober Latin liturgy and joyful, dancing hymns. The group was an assembly of singers from parishes across Morocco, who took fleets of buses to meet in Rabat. Most of them, like most of Morocco’s Christians, were immigrants, many from sub-Saharan African countries.  Damien, an architecture student from Burkina Faso now living in Tétouan, was thrilled to experience the mass, and happy to see the pope and King Mohammed VI working together.  “Between Christians and Muslims, there’s a bit of a misunderstanding,” he told Morocco World News. “It was great to see the heads of two religions find an accord. Like they said, we need to build a bridge, not a wall.”  In the stadium, leaders of Morocco’s government, including imams, sat across the aisle from the priests and nuns.  During his sermon, Pope Francis reflected on the Mass’s Bible reading, which told of a jealous son reacting angrily to his father’s joy when his long-absent younger brother returned.   The elder “would rather be an orphan than a brother,” the pope explained, reflecting a tension in “our societies and in our communities and even in our own hearts.” Using the parable to advocate for acceptance of the “other,” Pope Francis said that using “hatred and revenge” as means to “quick and effective justice” only succeeds in destroying “everything we cherish.”   He encouraged the congregation to adopt the father’s compassion in order to see past divisive thinking, but to not “downplay our differences in the name of a forced unity or quiet marginalization.” Archbishop of Rabat Cristóbal Lopez Romero thanked the pope for his visit, saying that he hoped Morocco could be a bridge between Muslims and Christians, between North and South, and affirmed the humanity of all migrants.   Manolo, who travelled to the Mass from the Spanish enclave city of Ceuta in Morocco’s north, celebrated his city as “a laboratory of interculturalism,” where Muslims, Christians, Jews, and Hindus live in harmony. He, like his compatriots from a local Catholic confraternity, praised King Mohammed VI’s invitation of the pope as “magnificent.” Tens of thousands of sub-Saharan and Moroccan migrants have scaled Ceuta’s fences in recent years, seeking European soil. Humane treatment of migrants was a major focus of the pope’s visit to Morocco.  Pope Francis pointed out that the parable of the lost son ends unresolved. “Each individual and every community” is responsible to decide whether to love or reject the ‘other,’ he said. The pope concluded with hopes to build a “culture in which no one looks at others with indifference, or averts his eyes in the face of their suffering.”   While there are spaces for Christians in Morocco, Damian said, Christians are not entirely at home, especially in the school system. “But it’s normal. We come from the outside, we’re not in our country. Most Moroccans are Muslims,” he said. “With time, Moroccans will understand better and accept Christians.”

Rabat – The International Union of Muslim Scholars (IAMS) has criticized a religious performance offered  to celebrate Pope Francis’s visit to Morocco. On Saturday, March 30, three representatives of the three Abrahamic religions performed a religious chant at the Mohammed VI Institute for Training Imams. The performance marked the first day of the papal visit. The performers started their chant with Muslim call for prayer (addhan), Jewish call for prayer known as Adonai, and Caccini’s motet Ave Maria. By combining the three in a single chant, the performance sought to convey messages of interfaith dialogue and peace, the central theme of the papal visit. While the chant, which were performed before King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis, received applause from the attendees, it has generated a backlash from some internet users. Criticizing the performance, IAMS said that the “principle of tolerance, coexistence, and dialogue is a fixed and broad principle in Islam, but it does not mean giving up the constants and merging the great Islamic rites and the church chants, which contradict our creed and rituals.” The union added that the Quran strongly warned of divine retribution against “violators of the constants of this religion.” Jerusalem is for Muslims IAMS also commented on the Jerusalem Appeal signed by King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis to preserve the statue of the holy site. The King and the Pope signed the agreement to condemn Trump’s administration 2017 decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The appeal emphasized the importance of preserving the status of Jerusalem as a holy site for believers of the three Abrahamic religions. “We believe it is important to preserve the Holy City of Jerusalem (Al-Quds Al-Sharif) as a shared heritage of humankind and to safeguard it, above all for the believers of the three monotheistic religions, as a symbol of peaceful coexistence and as a meeting place where mutual esteem and dialogue are fostered,”  the Jerusalem appeal said. For the union, however, Jerusalem is a holy site for Muslims only. “The Union reaffirms that one of the nation’s primary duties is to preserve Al-Quds Al-Sharif as an Arab-Islamic Palestinian land, and not as a shared property among people of all faiths, even if it fits  all of them, their churches, temples and rituals,” the union wrote. IAMS is currently chaired by Moroccan Islamic scholar Raissouni, who was appointed as the body’s head in November 2018.

Rabat – Moroccan footballer Adel Taarabt, who signed with Benfica in June 2015, was only deemed up to the Portuguese club’s standards on Saturday. The 29-year-old made his first appearance with Benfica in a game against fellow Portuguese club Tondela, four years after joining the club. Benfica won 1-0 against Tondela. Before his transfer to Benfica in the summer of 2015, Taarabt played for Queens Park Rangers before the deal was terminated by mutual consent. Taarabt has played for European footballing heavy weights, including Tottenham Hotspur and AC Milan. The Moroccan footballer has also played a one season loaned player for England’s Fulham and Italy’s Genoa. In his Benfica debut at the Estadio da Luz on Saturday night, the midfielder came on as a 71st-minute substitute for Pizzi, a Portuguese central midfielder.  Shortly after signing Taarabt, Benfica loaned him to the Italian club Genoa, where the Moroccan player stayed for 18 months and scored twice in 29 appearances. He was then benched for 7-months, before returning to training with Benfica February of this year. In a post-match press conference after Taarabt’ debut, Benfica head coach head Bruno Lage said of the player, “He is 29 years old, he had a brilliant career but he lost a lot of time.” Now that Benfica has chosen to give him the opportunity to prove himself, it is up to Taarabt to train harder to meet the club’s standards and avoid being benched again, Lage suggested. “It’s his responsibility to get back on track and he knows it. When we examined who could come with us [to the Tondela game] we thought we had to give him a chance.”

Rabat – Prominent theologian Hans Kung says in his book on Islam that: “Islam continues to strike us as essentially foreign, as more threatening, politically and economically, than either Hinduism or Buddhism, a phenomenon, in any case, that we have a hard time understanding.” The view of Islam as a “foreign” religion might make more sense if it didn’t express similarities, theologically at least, with its fellow Abrahamic faiths: Christianity and Judaism. Since the Middle Ages, Islam has occupied a space of alterity and difference in Western consciousness. This image of Islam has shifted in nature over the centuries depending on the impact of the West’s various encounters with the religion. The centuries-long Moorish Invasion of Spain which began in 711 CE; the Crusades, a series of bloody religious wars between Christians and Muslims between 1096 and 1291 CE; as well as the “Islamic Golden Age” which took place from the eighth to the fourteenth century and involved the translation of a plethora of Islamic philosophical, scientific, and medical texts into European languages, have all contributed to modern-day perceptions and understandings of Islam in Western consciousness. During this period, people from the Muslim world were seen as alien and at odds with the Christian world; a view that more or less prevailed before gradually morphing into what came to be the orientalist attitudes that characterized nineteenth century narratives about Islamic peoples. It would be remiss to mention Orientalism in this context without speaking of the influence of Palestinian American intellectual and cultural critic Edward Said. His extensive work on this subject has been widely recognized for exploring the gaps of social, cultural, and political understanding between the so-called “Western” and “Eastern” worlds, specifically the ways in which the West views and interacts with the Middle East and Islam. Writings about Islam grew exponentially in number over the years, into what Edward Said called a “cultural enterprise” formed of “a complex array of Oriental ideas (oriental despotism, oriental splendor, cruelty, sensuality), many Eastern sects, philosophies, and wisdoms domesticated for local European use.” This enterprise has fueled the misrepresentation of Islam, in turn fueling the rise of Islamophobia in the Western world. Orientalist writings have historically presented Islam as theologically inferior to Christianity, and with the decline of Christianity in the Western world in modern times, increasingly as inherently at odds with “Western” concepts of democracy and human rights. These false dichotomies have created an entrenched narrative that has long served to fuel European discrimination and prejudice against Islam and made the lives of Muslims living in Europe increasingly challenging. Although there have been attempts to release Islam from its medieval closet, these haven’t been enough to shift the narrative. Literature about Islam, in the fields of theology, history or politics, has been characterized by, in one way or another, a moralizing tone, assertions of European superiority, or at worst, imperialist overtones. The ideas, information, and innovations produced from the Islamic world during its “Golden Age” led it to flourish culturally, economically, and scientifically. They also had a transformational and lasting impact on the rest of the world and the foundations of modern thought. Indeed, translation of philosophical works from Arabic to Latin by such Muslim thinkers as Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes) “led to the transformation of almost all philosophical disciplines in the medieval Latin world.” Moreover, while Europe was going through the dark ages, the Islamic world had come to encompass an area larger than the Roman empire. For 700 years during this period, the empire had so much influence and power that Arabic was the international language of science. Emerging Christian thinkers in the centuries that followed, such as Italian Dominican missionary, Christian apologist, and travel writer, Riccoldo da Montecroce (c. 1243–1320 CE), tended to draw inspiration and admiration from a number of aspects of the Islamic world, such as its beautiful natural landscapes; poetic, referential, and aesthetically pleasing language; and canon of literature, while rejecting the “perfidious” Islamic religion from which they stemmed. Montecroce’s medieval peers tended to agree, adopting a similarly selective view of the religion. Moreover, medieval writings on Islam functioned well to establish a stable paradigm by which Christianity could assert its superiority, and create a counter-image of Islam’s inferiority. In the words of British anthropologist Mary Douglas, “Christian Europeans from the ninth century to the twelfth explained Islam in ways meant to reassure their Christian readers of the superiority of Christianity.” Since the early Middle Ages, writings about Islam have continued to perpetuate the medieval discriminatory discourse that presented Islam as foreign, backwards, and dangerous. This has endured into the modern-day damaging perceptions of Muslim people as ignorant, violent, or lascivious, among other stereotypes. Once a Muslim behaves or thinks contrarily to such stereotypes, and steps out of the darkness of their medieval cabin so to speak, the pervasive nature of such stereotypes becomes apparent. Prominent Algerian scholar and thinker Mohammed Arkoun recounted his own experience as a Muslim North African in Europe, noting that: “it was a shock for nearly all [my] European colleagues to meet someone like me. They always say how can a Muslim like you talk in such a manner. It is a great thing and a hopeful sign to see a liberal, open-minded Muslim like you. Still they jump to conclusions: We don’t think your ideas represent any of your own people’s or fellow Muslims in your country. Your thoughts, speeches or discourse go against the stream of Islam.” Perspectives such as these have become common in modern times. Echoing the selective and narrow view of Islam and its place in the West that was propagated centuries earlier by the likes of Montecroce, Arkoun’s colleagues’ well-meaning comments reflect a damaging and fallacious view of the “inherent” conflict between Muslims and Europeans. The representation of Islam and Muslims as regressive has medieval roots, but has endured ever since in various forms, inflaming at various points in history. In order to move past the fallacious but entrenched perception of a dangerous, inferior, and problematic Islam at odds with the “Western World,” we must move towards the deconstruction of these concepts, particularly in light of an increasingly globalized, interconnected, and pluralistic world. As Arkoun argues, we have a responsibility “to fight clichés and dogmas [and] deconstruct them. Not to be eager to endorse, adopt or instill them.” The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Morocco World News’ editorial views. © Morocco World News.

Rabat – Morocco’s Administration of Customs and Indirect Tax (ADII) has published the list of new prices of cigarettes. The updated list shows major increase in popular brands, including Marlboro, Winston, and Camel. Camel will be sold now at MAD 33, an increase of MAD 1. Winston will be sold at MAD 34, an increase of MAD 2. The Marlboro R3MX brand will be sold for MAD 37, instead of MAD 33. Price of the Maghreb cigarette brand rose from MAD 18 to MAD 19. The increase is thought be one of the first ramifications of the Moroccan government’s 2019 Finance Bill, which, when it was published earlier this year in January, hinted at a major increase in the domestic consumption tax on several goods.   The bill stipulated that Marlboro Red Beyond and Marlboro Gold Beyond packs will be sold for MAD 35 instead of MAD 32. Price of all other cigarettes of the same brand Marlboro have increased by MAD 2. ADII said in 2017 that Moroccans consumed 13.8 billion cigarettes in 2016, representing 1.2 billion more cigarettes compared to 2015. Official data also indicate that there are around 7  million smokers in Morocco, including 500,000 minors. The American Cancer Society, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and the Union for International Cancer Control, have estimated that more than 17,600 Moroccans die every year because of “tobacco-caused disease.”

Rabat  – Pope Francis, who visited Morocco for the first time on March 30-31, has expressed satisfaction with his stay in the North African country. On his way back to the Vatican after what he called a delightful two-day stay in Morocco, Pope Francis told the press on board his flight that his trip gave him the image of a “beautiful flower of coexistence.” The Pope, who had a busy schedule in Morocco, called  for the preservation of coexistence to transcend the difficulties “which unfortunately exist because there are intransigent groups.” The Pope also criticized US President Donald Trump, saying that “those who build the walls will end up trapped in the walls they build.” In speeches throughout his Moroccan stay, Francis reiterated his faith in principles of international solidarity and interreligious dialogue. He said that the world should invest in   building bridges, not walls. Read Also: Morocco’s Royal Family Gather for Amicable Photo with Pope Francis “Those who build bridges are moving forward. The bridge is for human communication, it is very beautiful and I have seen it here in Morocco.” Appeal for a universal and multireligious Jerusalem In Morocco, the pope and King Mohammed VI signed a document they called “the Jerusalem appeal.” The move aimed to garner support in the international community to reclaim the multi-religious character of the city of Jerusalem, which is considered holy site by all the three Abrahamic religions.  The Pope said that believers of all faiths want a free Jerusalem , and described the appeal he signed with the King describing it as a “step forward” in the struggle against regimes and leaders who oppose the universality of Jerusalem. The move to sign the document, Pope Francis argued,  was not the reflection of his and King Mohammed VI’s deep convictions alone. Rather, the appeal is an alarm call from“brother believers who suffer to see that this city of hope is still not as universal as we all want it to be.” More than an agreement, the appeal is “a desire, a call to religious fraternity that is symbolized in this city that belongs to all of us,” the pope stressed. Watershed papal mass Pope Francis also addressed the issue of migration, emphasizing that he is against the drowning  of migrants in the Mediterranean. “Welcoming, accompanying, and integrating remain the key values of the solution to be developed,” he asserted. Pope Francis left Morocco on Sunday evening after a two-day trip  in which he repeatedly preached politico-religious tolerance and coexistence. An estimated number of 10,000 people attended the pope’s mass at the Moulay Abdellah Complex in Rabat. The papal mass was a watershed in the history of Morocco’s growing population of Christians,  most of whom are said to be expats and migrants from sub-Saharan Africa.  “ Thank you Morocco for this opportunity. Thank you our father for your message of hope. Thank you my pope for coming,” the crowd chanted in chorus as the pope concluded his mass.

Rabat – The Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) will come to Marrakech for its annual meeting, April 3-6, where it plans to disclose a new vision for development. The event convenes the bank’s Board of Governors each year to discuss institutional and development issues, pulling in experts and development specialists from around the globe. 2018’s event took place in Tunis. This year, the meeting’s slogan is “Transformation in a changing world,” a reference to the new development strategy the bank’s president Bandar Hajjar will unveil. The new strategy dovetails with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), according to IsDB.  “We need to be constantly finding new, innovative ways to approach development in our fast-evolving world,” Hajjar said in a press release. The world, he explained, needs a development model that “focus[es] on root causes of development challenges rather than symptoms.” IsDB, which is headquartered in Saudi Arabia, has considerable global outreach. The bank operates in 57 countries and works with Muslim communities globally.  But global development, Hajjar said, has moved beyond the scope of any single institution. The SDGs have set standards for social and economic progress that will require trillions of dollars and international collaboration. “Never has the need for cooperation and partnership been of such paramount importance as it is today,” he said. Morocco is one of IsDB’s most important partners. The institution has worked extensively with the kingdom, most recently launching a multimillion dollar fund for science and technology in Morocco.  In February, lauding Morocco’s use of private-public partnerships, one of the new “core pillars” of the IsDB, Hajjar called the North African country a “model and a reference” for its other member countries. Other pillars include science and technology and Islamic finance. April’s meeting will explore these ideas through a series of panels and events, with a projected attendance of thousands to Marrakech.

Rabat – Rihab Sadik, 27, attended the launching of the International Space Station (ISS) crew members who went on a spacewalk last Friday to repair the space station’s old batteries. Sadik, an ISS Biomedical Flight Controller and Medical Operations Data Specialist at NASA Johnson Space Center, was part of the ISS team that attended the launch of two astronauts, NASA’s Christina Koch and Nick Hague on March 29. Koch and Hague completed a seven-hour spacewalk, replacing the six nickel-hydrogen batteries with new lithium-ion batteries to upgrade and maintain the ISS which serves as a space environment research laboratory. Crew members conduct experiments in biology, physics, astronomy, and other fields. As a biomedical controller and part of the ground ISS staff on the ground, Rihab keeps an eye on the astronauts’ health and their vital signs such as their heart rate, blood oxygen level, blood pressure, skin temperature, and breathing volume. Born in Casablanca, Morocco, in 1992, Sadik moved with her parents to the United States when she was 9 years old. Sadik received a Bachelor’s degree in science and biomedical engineering from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. In November 2016, KBRwyle, a global government services business recruited her to become a NASA biomedical controller. This is not the first time that a Moroccan is associated with a watershed moment in science around the world. Moroccan scientist Kamal Oudrhirhi, head of NASA’s Planetary Studies Department, contributed to several NASA projects including the InSight Mars project.   The InSight Mars Lander successfully touched down on Mars on Monday, November 26, with the aim of analyzing the internal composition of Mars. Born in Fez, Ourdhiri has worked for NASA for more than 20 years after he completed his graduate studies in space communication in the US. The scientist has been recognized with several NASA achievement honor awards from the global science community.

Rabat – The former Head of Government, Abdelilah Benkirane, recorded a 26-minute video in which he strongly criticized a draft framework law seeking to push for a widespread adoption of French as language of instruction of most subjects in Moroccan schools.   In a parliamentary meeting on n March 25,  the majority Moroccan political party leaders agreed to pass Draft Law 51.17 on language of instruction in Moroccan schools.Adopting the law would impose on Moroccan schools to teach  science and technology subjects being taught in French, a move the former PJD head has decried from the outset. in Moroccan schools. Benkirane, a trenchant critic of what he perceives as a more pointed “Francization” of an already Francophile education system, is urging members of the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) to ditch the draft law.  Minister of Education Said Amzazi proposed the law, which received a nod from the heads of the political parties in parliament. Amzazi said that “some subjects should be taught in a foreign language,” alluding to French. According to the minister, the proposal is in line with the Strategic Vision for the Reform of the Moroccan School launched by the Higher Council for Education, Training, and Scientific Research in 2015. Benkirane, who had taken aim at Amzazi in earlier statements on the language controversy, vehemently disagreed with the minister’s proposal. He rebuked PJD members for agreeing to Amzazi’s proposal, telling them that they “have no right to vote on this law.” The move, Benkirane argued, is a serious“betrayal of the principles of the party [PJD] and the Constitution and its vision.” Describing the draft law as “a fatal blow to the Justice and Development Party,” Benkirane warned PJD members: “Do not accept to be false witnesses, even if it requires the fall of this government and the appointment of another.” Why did MPs agree on the draft law? Draft Law 51.17 stresses the importance of having students master many other languages in addition to Arabic, the language in which they pass their baccalaureate exam.  The draft points out that alongside Arabic, students should be proficient in languages such as Tamazight (Berber), which is Morocco’s second official language, as well as in two other foreign languages. Also included in the draft is the long-term objective to make Moroccan students able to speak two foreign languages by the age of six. While Benkirane has not overtly opposed the plan to make Moroccan students more proficient in languages other than Arabic, he views the law as a subtle move with the long-term goal of abandoning Arabic altogether as the country’s primary language of instruction.  Addressing Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, he said it would be a “shame” to undo the three-decade-long  “honor of the Arabization of scientific subjects.”  Benkirane was referring to the early 1970s, when Morocco’s Al Istiqlal party (Independence Party) campaigned for the urgent need to Arabize the educational system. The nationalism-flavored move aimed to curb the then perceived threat of the predominance of French in Morocco’s educated circles. El Othmani should resign In a particularly scathing section of his 26-minute message, Benkirane drew parallels between passing the law and the blockade period in 2016, when, according to him, he was forced to leave his position as Head of Government after his principled refusal to include in his government parties he fundamentally disagreed with on Morocco’s future.  Rather than surrender to RNI’s pressure to pass Draft Law 51.17, Benkirane advised El Othmani, he should consider giving up on hi position. According to Benkirane, resignation would be more honorable for El Othmani than  surrender to principles that clash with his party’s founding philosophy.  He said, “Are you the first head of government to fall? I refused the entry of four parties in the blockade period.”  All fuss about deja vu? The Language debate is not new in Morocco. Morocco’s linguistic dilemma has historically been the source of furious exchanges between opposing parties and sections of Morocco’s political and cultural scene.   Liberal Moroccans have mostly called for French or English to be adopted in most schools. They argue that, because most of the scientific knowledge reaching Morocco is produced in English or French, teaching science in Arabic puts Moroccan students at a disadvantage in the current globalized knowledge economy.  In March, the Conference of University Presidents (CPU) issued a statement announcing that Moroccan schools should not teach science in Arabic, weighing into the intensifying political debate on which language should be used to teach science in Morocco. While acknowledging the importance of Arabic and Tamazight (Berber) in Morocco, CPU said that “technology, science, and knowledge are produced in foreign languages, especially English and French.” In conservative circles, however, Arabic is perceived as the unquestioned national language. Giving foreign languages like French or English preeminence over Arabic is seen in such circles as a grave blow to Morocco’s national pride and honor.  In February, the Independence Party slammed any moves to adopt French as teaching language. The party linked any such move to a “crime,” pointing out that Arabic should have the upper hand over French.

Rabat – Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has appointed a new government in a major cabinet reshuffle announced on Sunday. Algerian media reported that 21 ministers have been replaced. Prime Minister Noureddine Bedioui will resume his post as a prime minister. Bouteflika has also sacked Ramtane Lamamra, who was appointed a few weeks ago as a foreign minister and a deputy prime minister. Bouteflika also sacked Energy Minister Mustapha Guitouni, who will be replaced by Mohamed Arkab. Central Bank Governor Mohamed Loukal will replace Finance Minister Abderrahmane Rouia. In a surprising move, Bouteflika named Algeria’s top army chief Gaid Salah as deputy defense minister despite his recent announcement calling for Bouteflika’s resignation in accordance with Article 102 of the Constitution. Article 102 says  that “whenever the President of the Republic, because of serious and enduring illness, finds himself in a total incapacity to exercise his functions, the Constitutional Council shall meet as of right and, after having verified by all appropriate means that the incapacity indeed exists, shall propose to the Parliament by unanimity to declare a state of incapacity.” Salah reiterated his call on Saturday, emphasizing that implementing Article 102 will end the crisis in Algeria. The new government reshuffle follows six weeks of mass protests described as an Algerian hirak or popular movement. The hirak aims for major reforms in the Algerian system, with protesters calling Bouteflika and his elites or “pouvoir” to leave. Friday marked the sixth week of protests. Algerian security services used tear gas to disperse Friday’s  protests. It is remained to be seen whether Algerians would appreciate Bouteflika’s decision to reshuffle the government. Algerian television channel Al Nahar translated Bouteflika’s move as a preparation for  resignation. Reuters said that the President might announce his leave on Tuesday, before the original date of the postponed election, which was planned for April 18.

Rabat – The five most representative unions in the education sector saluted the contractual teachers’ strong involvement in the three-day strike from March 26, 27 and 28, which saw the participation of 90 percent of the teachers. In a statement released on March 30, the unions “strongly condemn the repression the government practiced in facing the wave of contractual teachers’ protests.” The unions are accusing the government of not respecting the international legislation, charters, and all the laws in force from the Moroccan Labor Law that guarantee the right to protest peacefully and maintain the freedom of unions. According to them, the government has deducted sums from protesters wages, in the absence of an organized law and called it to return those sums. They also called the government to recognize the failure of the educational policy and the measures taken, urging it to immediately respond to the contractual teachers’ demands. In order to resume work, the strikers want integration into the public sector according to the statement. The five unions, CDT, UGTM, FDT, UMT, and FNE, are demanding the teachers to reject the ministry of education measures aiming at breaking the teachers’ strike and to refuse, what the government called, “courses of support during the holiday.” The unions urge teachers for a march before the parliament on Tuesday at 4 p.m. to protest against the introduction of the framework law on education. They also called on teachers to further mobilize and continue protesting as part of a program to be announced soon.

Rabat – Morocco, Mauritania, Algeria, and Tunisia submitted a joint candidacy file on Friday for the recognition of Couscous in UNESCO’s heritage list. The four countries’ UNESCO representatives previously signed an agreement for the submission of the file. The joint candidacy is the result of combined efforts from the four states’ experts who are said to have put together a strong dossier. In a statement to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Morocco’s Permanent Representative at UNESCO, Zohour Alaoui, stressed the importance of the candidacy as a symbolic move of mutual understanding.  Alaoui said that the joint Maghreb underscores “the knowledge and the know-how of the practices related to the production and the consumption of couscous.” The move, she asserted, comes “to devote the tremendous wealth the Berber culture transmitted, not only to the Maghreb countries but also in Africa, the Mediterranean, and today in the world as a whole. ”  The Moroccan official also stressed that “this is the first time that four Maghreb countries have dissented from their efforts to submit a joint file.” She also paid tribute to the Maghrebian women who ensure the continuity of the tradition by passing it on from generation to generation
