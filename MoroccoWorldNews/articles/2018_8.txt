Rabat – Undocumented migration continues to stymie Morocco and European countries. Morocco y has launched a new measure to fight migration “mafia” networks. Migration took an important part in Thursday’s press conference held after the weekly government council. During the press conference, the government’s spokesperson, Mustapha El Khalfi, discussed the need to increase efforts to fight undocumented migration. In a statement to the press, El Khalfi said that Morocco is firm against human trafficking networks. El Khalfi said, “Morocco has taken another step of transferring migrants to other cities, and this is not a deportation operation outside the national territory.” El Khalfi also emphasized that throughout the years, Morocco launched several regularization operations to integrate migrants into Moroccan society and offer them the basic rights of health, housing, and education. The official’s statement came after Spain and Morocco decided to reactivate an agreement they signed in 1992, which allows Spain to deport migrants to the transit country. The agreement came in response to the surge of undocumented migration through the Moroccan border with the Spanish enclave, Ceuta. The spokesperson estimated the number of foiled undocumented migration attempts at 65,000 in 2017. El Khalfi said that the issue has increased in recent years, especially since 2016. The official mentioned that two-thirds of failed attempts are from migrants of sub-Saharan countries, recalling Morocco’s migration policy that King Mohammed VI outlined in his message addressed to the 30th African Union Summit on January 30. To manage migration, the King proposed the creation of an African Migration Observatory, “whose terms of reference would be the triad ‘Understand, Anticipate, Act.’” The mission of the observatory would be the exchange of information between African countries to promote management of migration flows. The King also expressed concerns, saying: “How many more migration-related tragedies do we still have to witness before our societies change the way they perceive migration?” El Khalfi also pinpointed Moroccan-European partnerships to tackle migration issues.  “Morocco and the European partners continue the dialogue and hold regular meetings.” El Khalfi also discussed the migration of Moroccan youth to Libya and other countries in attempts to cross the Mediterranean to reach the Eldorado. “The sectors and services concerned have followed the subject in the past and have taken measures and still follow this question in the context of the communication with the countries concerned,” said El Khalfi. Dozens of Moroccans were stranded in Libyan detention centers. Moroccan authorities have repatriated hundreds of Moroccans in several operations after videos circulating on social media featured them in “unbearable” conditions.

Rabat – Morocco’s Court of Auditors has identified serious deficiencies in public and private schools regarding infrastructure, reception capacity, and number of teachers. In its 2016-2017 annual report, the Court of Auditors found deficits in basic facilities of some schools, such as connections to drinking water, electricity, and sewage.  Some other schools did not have basic infrastructure such as fences, sanitary units, sports fields, multimedia rooms, libraries, internet connections, and teaching materials. The Court of Auditors made its report public on Monday, August 27. Classrooms unused because of too few teachers The court also noted that some schools have multiple grade levels in one class. According to the report, the lack of teachers, educators, and financial support led to the “non-use of some rooms dedicated for pre-school education.” Boarding schools and school cafeterias suffer from congestion in reception capacity and inadequate reception conditions. They also do not have enough adults to supervise students. Some schools lack reception infrastructure for children with special needs and preschool students; other schools have insufficient safety and health conditions. The report mentioned an overall failure to achieve the goal of generalization of basic education for all children beginning at age 6. On July 12, Minister of National Education, Vocational Training, and Scientific Research Said Amzazi said that the ministry will launch a national program of generalization and reform of the pre-primary education in Morocco. The program, including the 2018-2019 academic year, was to start on July 18 and run to 2028. Concerning the pedagogical supervision of students, the report recorded “failure to respect the regulatory working hours,” particularly in secondary and high school. Lack of pedagogical inspectors’ supervision of teachers, especially through continuous training, was also cited in the report. The court recorded “non-pedagogical teaching practices,” such as schools failing to make up class time when teachers were absent and decreasing class hours for some subjects and dropping other subjects for lack of teachers.  The court also noted significant levels of teacher absences, both unjustified and justified, presenting short, medium or long-term medical certificates. Private schools too crowded, don’t have medical monitoring Many private schools do not respect equipment standards set in Article 4 of Law 06.00 on private education, the Court of Auditors stated. These include the lack of sports fields, medical monitoring, and exceeding reception capacity by 50 percent. When supervising the private schools, the court found that the majority of private schools, particularly secondary and high school, do not comply with the minimum threshold of permanent teachers, which is set at 80 percent by Article 13 of Law 06.00.  Overall, the report noted that regional education and training academies (AREF) have not fulfilled their mission to train and supervise teachers and to evaluate the performance of private schools.

Rabat – Saad Lamjarred’s first French victim, Laura Prioul, has reacted to the decision of the suspect’s lawyer to withdraw from his case. Prioul took to her Twitter on Thursday, sharing her thoughts on Eric Dupond-Moretti’s decision to drop Lamjarred’s case. “Master Moretti drops the case. Realizing that life is too short to waste time with lost causes?” she wrote. The lawyer announced his withdrawal from the case yesterday, opening the doors for rumors. Lamjarred, who is facing his second charge of rape and violence in France, was arrested on Sunday, August 26, in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France. King Mohammed VI recommended Moretti to defend Lamjarred when he was arrested in France on rape and violence charges in October 2016. Maître Moretti lâche l’affaire . Prise de conscience que la vie est trop courte pour perdre son temps avec des causes perdues?#SaadLamjarred #saadlamjarred1 #lauraprioul #balancetonporc #MeToo — Laura Prioul (@lora_s_life) August 30, 2018  Prioul reacted to Lamjarred’s new case earlier this week. Prioul heavily criticized her country’s justice system when news outlets wrote about Lamjarred’s release 48 hours after his arrest.   “This is something I can not conceive, it’s something I can not understand, that he can go on vacation like that since there have already been complaints against him and I’m not the first,” Prioul told France radio RTL. Jean-Marc Fedida, another member of Lamjarred’s defense team, denied the charges against Lamjarred after his release. The lawyer told France Info that the singer had “a consensual sexual relationship” with the second victim, who accuses him of rape. “He denies any violence against this person, of any nature whatsoever.” Fedida also claimed that “no material findings can confirm the existence of such violence.”

Rabat – Moroccan startups are having a hard time getting funding despite reported efforts to promote technology-related startups. As Morocco stretches its financial might and technical expertise across Africa and plans to reach a broader audience at the global level, the Moroccan government has listed investments in high tech projects among its policy priorities  According to l’Economiste, however, innovative Moroccan project bearers have limited access to financial means to materialize their ideas. Despite government-assisted initiatives to boost entrepreneurship and information technology-related projects, l’Economiste reports that only 10 percent of Moroccan start ups have had relatively easy access to capital funds.  The remaining percentage faces structural dysfunction in the institutions supposed to oversee the allocation of funds and an “incoherent public policy” that complicate access to investments for startups. Risk-averse investors sometimes tell project bearers that they prefer to place their money in limited companies—where owners are responsible for their debts to the extent of investment—rather than in capital risk projects like startups, where there is a high risk of losing the money invested.  As innovation is highly correlated with risk-taking, l’Economiste noted, one consequence of Moroccan investors’ risk-averse attitude is that innovative but risky projects almost never get funded. With the advent of information capital technologies and an increasingly digitized global economy, the newspaper added that Morocco’s financial markets should ease the funding process for startups and ensure the kingdom’s smooth and timely integration into the prevailing financial system.  “Mutual efforts are needed,” wrote l’Economiste, calling for collaboration between young innovators and investors to “change the [sector’s] current direction” and prepare Morocco’s technology sector for the challenges of the digitized economy.

Rabat- Khadija’s parents have filed a complaint against Moroccan-Tunisian tattoo expert, Linda Paradis, for accusing their daughter of lying about receiving involuntary tattoos. Khadija, 17, had claimed she was kidnapped, raped, held in captivity, and tattooed involuntarily this summer. However, a professional tattoo remover calling herself “Linda Paradis” asserted that the tattoos were too old to corroborate her story, suggesting that Khadija was the one who inflicted them on herself. “The skin of the girl was perfectly healed, so her tattoo would go back at least six months. She made her tattoos to hide scars with a knife that she inflicted to herself a year ago or more,” Linda Paradis said in an interview with Arabic outlet Barlamane. “There is no crust, no redness, no inflammation; I have a lot of doubts.… I offered [Khadija] a medical follow-up; she was only asking for money. I also tried to offer psychological support, but it ended badly with the family,” she added. Khadija’s new lawyer, Youssef Chehbi, said in a statement to Moroccan news outlet Le 360, ”If this woman was really a professional as she claims to be, she wouldn’t have disclosed such information about Khadija to change the course of justice.” Linda Paradis’ statements support those of the parents of suspects arrested for raping her. The mother of two suspects said that Khadija asked “for the tattoos and they were not forced on her by anyone.” The mother added that she would defend the victim herself if Khadija were really a victim as she claimed. “She wanted this, she was always knocking on my door asking if my son was home,” the mother told Moroccan television channel Soltana. Another parent questioned Khadija’s allegation, claiming that if what she charged of his son were true, the victim’s father would have filed a complaint about his daughter’s absence. The 17-year-old teenager from Oulad Ayad, a small town near Beni Mellal in central Morocco, recounted that she was held captive and raped by 10 men who tortured her. Khadija explained that she tried to escape several times, but each time she was caught and tortured. “They didn’t give me food or drink, and I was not even allowed to take a shower.” Earlier this week, Moroccan authorities arrested twelve men, aged 18 to 28, on suspicion of raping Khadija. An authority told AFP that the general prosecutor of the Criminal Division of the Beni Mellal Court of Appeal had decided to prosecute and to put the suspects in pre-trial detention. The primary suspect is aged 20 and is being prosecuted for “trafficking a minor, rape, threat of murder, torture, kidnapping and for having a criminal gang.” To show solidarity with the victim, Moroccans have addressed a Change.org petition to King Mohammed VI and public authorities to restore Khadija’s dignity. The hashtag #JusticePourKhadija (Justice for Khadija) was also created by social media users.

Rabat – Jailed Hirak Rif activist Nasser Zefzafi has started a hunger strike to protest “torture” and “harassment” in Casablanca’s Oukacha prison. In a four-minute video, Nasser Zefzafi’s father, Ahmed Zefzafi, conveyed Zezafi’s message to all Moroccans that supported or did not support him. In the video, posted on Facebook Thursday, August 30, Zefzafi’s father said that his son told his mother that he would start a hunger strike and would not even drink water until he dies. Zefzafi’s decision was made in response to “harassment” and “torture” that he alleges he has suffered in the prison. Ahmed Zefzafi said that his son asked for “forgiveness” from all people, including those who do not support him. He also asked his mother to tell his family not to intervene in the hunger strike. According to his father, Zezafi is still being held in the small solitary cell where he was jailed before his trial. (function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(d.getElementById(id))return;js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src='https://connect.facebook.net/fr_FR/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v3.1';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}(document,'script','facebook-jssdk'));  #??????????????? ????? #??????? #???? #???????? ?? ?????? ???? ????? ?? ????? ?? ?????? ????? ???????? ?????? ????? #???? #???? ?? ??? ???????. Publiée par Zefzafi Lotfi sur Jeudi 30 août 2018 “He can only pray when he sits on a chair because the surface of the cell is too small.” “He is determined not to eat or drink until his demands are met. It is a strike of no return,” the father told AFP. “He only asks for the rights that other prisoners enjoy: that he be taken out of isolation in a solitary cell and put him in a dignified cell where he can see and talk” with the other jailed activists, added Ahmad. Zefzafi was arrested in May 2017 after he interrupted a Friday prayer in a mosque to protest the sermon’s content. In June, a court in Casablanca gave sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years for 54 Hirak Rif activists. Zefzafi and three other activists received 20 years in prison. On Eid alAdha, King Mohammed VI pardoned 188 prisoners involved in unauthorized protests in the Al Hoceima province. The protests erupted after the death of Mouhcine Fikri, a local fishmonger, who attempted to save his goods when they were confiscated and thrown in a garbage truck. Fikri jumped into the garbage truck and was crushed to death. More than 400 activists were arrested in a government crackdown of the protests.

Rabat- Polisario and Algeria are caught in the middle of a new embezzlement scandal after Sahrawis allegedly found their people’s aid being sold in Algerian stores. Some Sahrawi people were surprised to find a popular aid product, Gofio corn flour from Spain, on display in Algerian grocery shops, reported the pro-Polisario website futurosahara.com on Tuesday, August 28. Foodstuffs destined for Sahrawi people in Algeria’s Tindouf camps, near the border with Mauritania and Morocco, are being sold in large quantities for DZD 250 (€1.82) per kilogram. Adding to Sahrawis’ suspicion, some grocery shopkeepers refused to let them take photos of the food aid products, initially donated to the starving Sahrawis in the camps by various global NGOs. Moroccan news outlet Le 360 claimed some Mauritanian shops also reportedly take advantage of the Tindouf Sahrawis’ situation, filling their shelves with products from donations. At the same time, the Mauritanian shops displayed signs reading, “Help Tindouf Refugees,” to inspire sympathy. It was not the first time that Polisario and Algeria were involved in similar practices. In 2015, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), UNHCR, and the World Food Program accused Polisario and Algeria of smuggling humanitarian aid intended for the Tindouf population. At the time, Morocco condemned “the human rights abuse” before the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHCR). In 2017, Polisario smuggled tents UNHCR gave as aid to the Sahrawis only to sell the tents to Sahrawis later. UNHCR has denounced the human rights violations committed against the Sahrawis. On the sidelines of the 38th session of the Human Rights Council, June 18 to July 6, 2018, an expert of the committee emphasized that Algeria is obliged to take good care and support “victims and witnesses of human rights violations.” In line with his meeting with the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Kohler, who was on a 10-day tour of the region, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita stressed the need to pressure Algeria to authorize a census of inhabitants at the Tindouf camps.

Rabat – The secretary-general of Algeria’s Workers Party has joined the list of local public figures criticizing the Algerian political system. During a press conference held at the party’s headquarters in Algiers on Wednesday, Louisa Hanoune heavily criticized the Algerian regime. She condemned the “mafiaization of state institutions,” referring to the arrest of senior officials involved in cocaine trafficking. At a time when Algeria accused Morocco of “flooding” it with cannabis, Hanoune opened up about a scandal in the Algerian cabinet regarding senior government officials involved in smuggling over 700 kilograms of cocaine in May. According to the politician, the scandal “reveals a mafiaization of state institutions already gangrenous by widespread corruption.” Algerian newspaper Al Watan quoted Hanoune’s criticism, emphasizing that Algeria lives in a “political congestion, caught in a spiral of economic recession and social distress, it is a state that loses its authority internally and externally.” Hanoune also expressed concerns over the next presidential election. For the politician, the election will take place in a “dangerous context” that will “lead the country to the unknown, it is to go to the abyss.” Hanoune said, “We refuse to embark on the sterile debate on the 5th mandate, because it bypasses the central question that is the nature of the political regime, especially no one knows what will happen here. “Should we change a man to replace him with another or change an ‘Escobarized’ system? It is to sign the death sentence of the country.” In April, the Algerian ruling party the National Liberation Front called on President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to run for a fifth term in the 2019 presidential election. Algerian media reported earlier this year that the majority of the party sent requests to the president. However, several Algerian public figures expressed disatisfaction with the Algerian political regime under the leadership of Bouteflika, who has been president since 1999. In June, Algerian author and journalist Mohamed Benchicou criticized the political status and economic situation of the Algerian regime, describing the country as a “stateless” nation subjected to “corruption and predation.” “We are not masters of our future either economically, socially, or politically. Everything is done to let things rot and to worsen delays,” he told Le Point d’Afrique.   Algerian journalist Lila Haddad recorded a video at the European Parliament’s studio in Brussels in June, denouncing the Algerian regime for “undermining”  the dignity of Algerian citizens. The journalist, who is based in Brussels, said that Bouteflika is “nothing more than a heap of flesh exposed to the world.” Haddad appeared in another video less than a week after her first video, sharing her concerns and slamming both Bouteflika and his brother Said. “I had asked your brother Said to show compassion and to release you. A feeling tells me that you wish to withdraw and that you are waiting for a favorable moment.” The journalist also said that Algerian people are suffering social issues due to a “group of criminals who became decision-makers” following Bouteflika’s sickness. In 2013, Bouteflika suffered a debilitating stroke.

Rabat – Ambassador Nathan Sales, US coordinator for counterterrorism, has arrived in Morocco and discussed counterterrorism issues with Morocco’s minister of foreign affairs. Sales met with Morocco’s minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, Nasser Bourita, on Thursday, August 30, in Rabat. “The commitment shared by the government of Morocco and the United States to fight and defeat terrorists is at the heart of a strong Moroccan-American partnership,” Sales was quoted by the state-owned news agency (MAP) as saying. The US official’s visit to Morocco came as part of a diplomatic trip to Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco August 26-30. The purpose of Sales’ trip is to “engage in bilateral discussions with his counterparts on countering violent extremism, foreign terrorist fighters, and information sharing,” according to the State Department media note published on August 27. “Terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaida continue to threaten and unite us in our determination to fight this scourge,” Sales said at press briefing following his meeting with Bourita. In January 2018, the US Department of Defense gave Morocco arms equipment worth $18 million to reinforce the country’s special forces units combating terrorism, in light of the threat ISIS poses to North African countries. The US allocated $60 million as security assistance to allies in the MENA region. Le Ministre des Affaires Etrangères et de la Coopération Internationale, M. Nasser Bourita, a reçu, le jeudi 30 août 2018 à #Rabat, l’ambassadeur SEM.

(@MarocDiplomatie) August 30, 2018  Sales described his discussions with Bourita as “productive” and also remarked on the “excellent” friendly relations between the US and Morocco and their alliance to combat terrorism especially within the framework of the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF).  The GCTF is a apolitical and multilateral counterterrorism platform launched on September 22, 2011, in New York. The objective of GCTF, which is currently co-chaired by Morocco and the Netherlands, is to develop a strategic approach to counterterrorism and prevent the violent extremist ideologies supporting terrorism. Sales also expressed his country’s wish to promote cooperation between the US and Morocco in the future. Sales has led the State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau since August 2017 and serves as the principal adviser to the US secretary of state on international counterterrorism matters.

Rabat – The World Bank vice-president for the MENA region, Ferid Belhaj, has remarked on Morocco’s socio-economic potential,  calling Morocco a “regional exception.” Belhaj has concluded his three-day working visit to Morocco, from August 27-29, as part of a World Bank-financed $100 million initiative to tackle socio-economic disparities in Morocco.  During his stay, the World Bank official met the new economy and finance minister, Mohamed Benchaaboun; the head of government, Saad Eddine El Othmani; as well as a number of business owners, young entrepreneurs, and other drivers of Morocco’s political and socio-economic activities. “If you ask me today how I see Morocco today … I see a half full glass because I consider the country’s potential, all the proposals that are being materialized, the steps that have been taken,” Belhaj said in an interview with Moroccan francophone outlet Telquel. Challenges remain But while lauding Morocco’s political and socio-economic reforms, the Tunisian economist showed signs of caution. For all its bold reforms, vibrant infrastructure, burgeoning markets, and heavy investments, Morocco still has a long way to go. “Over the years, there have been serious efforts in terms of reforms and infrastructure. That is why I see Morocco full of potential.” He continued, however: “But there is another Morocco faced with enormous difficulties, namely of resource redistribution and social cohesion.” He added, “There is something a bit upsetting: there are so many possibilities and achievements that make Morocco a regional exception, but there are also some lapses. These need to be tackled at their roots.” From the mass unemployment of the country’s youth to the crushing income disparities between different sections of the population, Belhaj argued, Morocco’s challenge remains to translate the increasing political will—notably the King’s two latest speeches on youth and social inclusion—into a political reality. Possibilities for inclusive growth Belhaj, whose visit to Morocco culminated in the signing of a joint social register program between Morocco and India, said that the persisting challenges should not obscure Morocco’s ability to devise a development model that can satisfactorily meet challenges and considerably reduce the high income gap. “There seems to be a genuine desire to change things,” he said, citing the credibility of Morocco’s financial markets, the dynamic and increasingly innovative private sector, and the King’s insistence on a new development model adapted to the needs of Moroccans.  Morocco, Belhaj asserted, is “a country that is moving.”    When asked about Morocco’s prospects to be a regional and continental trendsetter and whether the kingdom can sustainably reach many of its other aspirations, Belhaj said that Morocco is already an inspiration, in terms of reforms and stability, for a region generally associated with socio-economic unrest. “When I look a bit further in the horizons, I realize that Morocco is a bright spot, a source of light in an unfortunately dark environment.”

Rabat- El Othmani has condemned cholera rumours “provoking fear among Moroccans,” reiterating that the kingdom has no recorded cases of the disease. In Thursday’s government council, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani stated: “This information has already been relayed by the Ministry of Health, however we will repeat it so that citizens can be at ease. Yes, cholera has been recorded in [Algeria], but fortunately not in our country.” “No case of cholera has been recorded in Morocco,” the Moroccan Ministry of Health said on Tuesday, August 28. El Othmani said that citizens need not be wary of drinking tap water as some rumours suggest. According to the ministry’s Tuesday statement, “The control over irrigation waters, water wells, and irrigated agricultural fields will be enhanced to exclude any possibility of the arrival of the disease in Morocco.” The same official affirmed that food contamination is not a matter of concern since irrigation using wastewater has not been used for many years in the eastern region, the most vulnerable region due to its geographic proximity to Algeria. El Othmani reassured citizens that Morocco has taken precautions against the epidemic and is actively working with different sectors concerned with the issue, including water and agriculture, to protect its borders from cholera.  The head of government recalled Morocco’s agreement with the World Health Organization (WHO), pledging to work together if Morocco was to fall prey to the disease. Health professionals have given instructions to pharmacists across the country to detect signs of cholera transmission, El Othmani concluded. Cholera is an infectious illness that results when the cholera bacteria gets into the intestine. The disease causes severe diarrhea, which can cause dehydration and death if untreated. Algeria has been battling a cholera epidemic since August 7. Algerian authorities confirmed 41 cholera cases and the death of one infected patient on Thursday, August 23. However, by the next day a second person had died because of the epidemic.

Rabat – The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is expected to pay a working visit to Morocco. Maghreb Confidentiel reported yesterday that the French president’s Moroccan visit is underpinned by the two countries’ desire to uphold diplomatic cooperation and cement their historical friendship. According to the newspaper, Macron agreed to a prospective visit to Morocco after King Mohammed VI invited him to the launch of the kingdom’s first high-speed train, an ongoing project expected to be completed in November. Morocco’s high-speed train project entered the pre-operation phase in June, and total completion was scheduled towards the end of the year. Although no details have yet been announced about the specific date and the schedule for Macron’s visit, Moroccan authorities are reported to have already prepared to host their French guest. While the immediate reason for the French president’s visit is to honor King Mohammed VI’s invitation, the two leaders are also expected to discuss a range of critical issues in their bilateral ties. In the context of massive human movements, especially irregular migrants to EU countries, President Macron and King Mohammed VI are particularly expected to discuss the common security challenges facing Rabat and its EU partners.  “The question of irregular immigration, which has become a policy priority for the two countries, will top the discussions,” explained Maghreb Confidentiel. France remains Morocco’s foremost foreign investor, and there has recently been a marked increase in Morocco’s exports to France, rising by 20 percent in 2016 alone, according to the French government.  In addition to the strong commercial and cultural—mainly linguistic and educational—ties between Paris and Rabat, the two countries have upgraded their security cooperation in recent months.  In June, the two countries joined Belgium and Spain in creating a joint anti-terror front to “materialize,” “upgrade,” and “harmonize” their efforts regarding intelligence, field interventions, and deradicalization.

Rabat – Benatia has responded to rumors that Morocco’s head coach Herve Renard did not select him for a CAN 2019 qualifier due to a conflict. Speculations ran wild after Renard released his list of players for the Morocco-Malawi Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) qualifier. The list did not include Mehdi Benatia, the team’s captain, leaving the door open for massive rumors. Local media, including sports news outlet Lions de l’Atlas, speculated the absence was due to a statement Benatia made blaming “people close to the team” after Morocco’s second  2018 World Cup game against Portugal on June 20. In response to the rumors published by Lions de l’Atlas, Benatia took to his Twitter to shut down the speculations. Benatia tweeted, “Oh we’re used it’s not the first time I would say @Herve_Renard_HR is not just a coach for me it’s a friend the gossip will never stop ?!”  Un mensonge de plus !!! Sa commence a faire beaucoup tt sa !!?? — MBenatia5 (@MedhiBenatia) August 30, 2018  In another tweet, Benatia wrote, “One more lie. This is to much!” Following the Morocco-Portugal game, Benatia blamed people close to the team of not supporting the Atlas Lions in a statement to beIN Sports. “People close to us have already turned their backs on us after the first game. I say it and I repeat it well, some people close to the team thought that we had become spoiled children since the qualification at the World Cup, that we did not deserve to be there. Oh on a l’habitude c’est pas la première fois ???je dirais même @Herve_Renard_HR n’est pas juste un entraîneur pour moi c’est un ami ..??la médisance ne s’arrêtera donc jamais ?!?????????? — MBenatia5 (@MedhiBenatia) August 30, 2018  “These are not journalists or other people but close people who should not have that kind of words, yet they got it. We the players, we wanted to show to these puppets what we are capable of,” he said. Morocco was ruled out of the competition as the team lost their two first games against Iran and Portugal, and ended with a draw with Spain. The team, however, received applause from the world for their outstanding performance despite the highly criticized choice of the referee in their Portugal game not to use video assistant referee, which could have earned them penalty kicks. Morocco will play against Malawi on September 8 in Casablanca as part of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.

Rabat – Moroccan award-winning writer Leila Slimani will be a jury member for the Deauville Film Festival. A fine connoisseur of American art and a well-respected novelist and art critique, Leila Slimani’s pedigree of genuine engagement with some of the most salient topics of modern life convinced the organizers to choose her as a jury member alongside top names in the French film industry.  Other jury members include Sabine Azema, renowned stage and film actress and also director; French composer Alex Beaupain; film director Pierre Salvadori; actress Leila Bekhti; and award-winning actor and screenwriter Stephane Brize. The Deauville festival, taking place August 3-September 9 this year, is France’s biggest America-focused film festival, exclusively screening American cinema, from Hollywood blockbusters to independently-made films and more traditional dramas, comedies, action movies, and others. According to organizers, the festival, which was launched in 1975, “celebrates the diversity of American cinema.” Over the year, it has acknowledged the lifelong achievements of established names, while also “constantly discovering new talents.” For the 44th Deauville festival, Slimani and her colleagues of the jury will be charged with evaluating the prize-worthiness of some of the year’s most thrilling titles. The films in contest include “The Tale” by Jennifer Fox, “American Animals” by Bart Layton, “Blindspotting” by Carlos Lopez Estrada, and “Thunder Road” by Jim Cummings. Slimani is best known for her 2014 debut novel “Dans le Jardin de l’Ogre” (In the Garden of the Ogre), which established her in French literary circles, and the 2016 novel Chanson Douce (“Lullaby” or “The Perfect Nanny,” depending on the translation), which earned her the Goncourt Prize, France’s highest literary accolade.

Rabat –  Morocco’s flag carrier Royal Air Maroc (RAM) is set to launch a new direct flight connecting Casablanca and Athens. RAM will mobilize its Boeing 737-700 airplane to serve its customers between the two destinations. The plane has a capacity of 114 seats, including 12 in business class, said RAM in a statement. Flights departing from Casablanca will be scheduled at 11 a.m., while flights from Athens to Casablanca will leave the Greek capital at 4:05 p.m. RAM will offer the service three times a week. According to the statement, the new direct flight aims to reinforce the company’s services to European destinations accessible from the Casablanca airport. The flight will also strengthen RAM’s position as one of Africa’s “leading” companies to connect Africa with Europe and North America. Royal Air Maroc is recovering from a major month-long crisis; pilots began protesting on July 18 about the company’s “unbearable” and “unreasonable” working conditions. The pilots also argued that the RAM-funded flight training school which was closed in 2014 should be reopened to produce more local pilots. At the height of the crisis, more than 100 flights were cancelled in just 2 weeks due to the rift between RAM and the pilots. On August 14, RAM reached an agreement with pilots. The agreement concluded between the two parties suggested that the airline needs to overcome challenges and review its flawed management, PR and sales strategies, which hindered its long-term goals.

Rabat- Najib Boulif has announced that 53,200 travelers left Morocco from Tangier Med Port on Wednesday, the highest single-day number since Operation “Marhaba” launch. The secretary of state to the minister of equipment, transport, logistics, and water said in a statement on Facebook that the Marhaba 2018 operation, which began on June 5 to welcome home Moroccans living abroad, has seen “exceptional developments.” 

Boulif drew attention to the number of Moroccan travelers returning abroad on the same day, noting that Morocco has never witnessed a similar record before.  Due to the large number of travelers leaving Morocco at the same time, many had to wait longer than they planned to pass through the port. The secretary expects that “the registered number of travelers on Thursday will most likely” be as high as that of Wednesday. Boulif added that Morocco and Spain are working together to find solutions to the situation, considering adding another ship to the ferry route to reduce overcrowdedness. According to Tangier Med Port Authority, a total of 842,698 passengers have entered Morocco through Tangier Med from June to August. During the same period, 371,861 passengers, 118,579 vehicles and 1,695 buses left Morocco through the same port which is a veritable gateway to Africa and Europe. 

On July 29 alone, the port received 33,091 travelers coming to spend Eid al-Adha with their families. Morocco celebrated Eid al-Adha (festival of sacrifice) on August 22. Tangier Med Port has established itself as the first in Africa, owing to its notable performance this year. Tangier’s two container terminals handled 1,668,566 containers in the first six months of 2018. A port statement shared in July announced that 252,194 cars were handled in both terminals during the first six months of 2018, representing an increase of 18 percent compared to the first half of 2017.

Rabat – The French club OGC Nice is seriously thinking of calling back Atlas Lion Younes Belhanda. The Moroccan footballer already played with Nice in 2016-2017. Will Belhanda leave Turkey Galatasaray for his former club? According to French outlet Nice Matin, OGC Nice’s directors have decided to allocate a large budget to its management to attract a “name,” especially with the mercato (summer transfer window) coming to an end.  The additional budget could be used to sign Paris Saint-Germain’s former player Hatem Ben Arfa or someone whom they know very well: Younes Belhanda. The offensive midfielder of Galatasaray would be very interested in returning to the Allianz Riviera.  However, if the French club succeeded in recruiting Belhanda, it can only afford to receive him on a loan. The Atlas Lion is still under contract with the Turkish club until June 2021.  In addition, Belhanda has already ruled out a move to the English premier league in the 2019 summer transfer window, saying that he is happy with life at the Turkish side Galatasaray. The 28-year old playmaker has increasingly been linked with a number of Premier League sides, following a successful season in the Turkish Super League and solid displays in Herve Renard’s Atlas Lions side. Crystal Palace reportedly proposed a £5.3 million transfer fee to obtain the midfielder.  Speaking to beIN Sports last month, Belhanda openly ruled out any prospects of transfer this summer, reiterating his desire to be part of Galatasaray’s next season’s Champions League squad. “I am happy in Galatasaray. I will play here in the Champions League. I do not want to go to England,” the former Shalke 04 man was quoted by Turkish Football as saying. Mercato aside, Belhanda has a lot on his mind right know with the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations coming. The 28-year-old has been chosen by Herve Renard to be part of the 25 players who will compete against Malawi, September 8, in the Mohammed V Stadium of Casablanca.

Rabat – Spanish authorities are allegedly worried that pardoned individuals previously convicted of terrorism and extremism in Morocco will migrate to Spain. On the eve of the anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the People, celebrated in Morocco on August 20, the Ministry of Justice announced that King Mohammed VI offered a royal pardon to 22 individuals convicted of extremism and terrorism. The ministry added that the pardon included the individuals who participated in the“moussalaha” (reconciliation) program, which aims to reintegrate prisoners into society. The royal decision, however, seems to have worried Spanish authorities. Spanish news outlet Okdiario reported that the lack of civil guards in the Morocco-Spanish borders led to the massive entries of undocumented migrants on July 26 and August 22. Quoting security officials, the news outlet added that Morocco’s release of individuals convicted of terrorism-related crimes poses a “threat,” as it is impossible for civil guards to review the backgrounds of migrants who forcibly cross the borders. Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska, according to Okdiario, underscored on Wednesday,  “Humanity is not equal to permissiveness.” He warned that the new cabinet will not “allow violent immigration” to threaten his country and the civil guards. He also recalled that both Morocco and Spain reactivated the 1992 agreement on the deportation of migrants. Okdiario criticized the agreement, saying it would not be able to prevent the “continued entry of immigrants” and the “lack of personnel that causes the lack of control of immigration.” Morocco’s reconciliation program not enough? Morocco appears to trust its reconciliation program since the royal pardon includes defendants convicted of terrorism-related crimes and extremism. Moroccan authorities in charge of terrorism-related crimes have dismantled several terror cells across the country, while other suspects affiliated to terrorism were also arrested throughout 2018. Morocco also deals with returning Moroccan ISIS fighters and has introduced a criminal code to address the challenges relating to foreign fighters. The program involves human rights experts and radicalism experts who provide psychological support and rehabilitation to convicts with links to extremism or terrorist organizations. The program, which was launched in 2016, aims to help them reintegrate into society. The initiative depends on three fundamental points: reconciliation with the self, with religious principal texts, and with society. Morocco’s General Commission for the Management of Prisons and Reintegration (DGAPR), which developed and implements the program, reassured citizens that moussalaha intends to offer the best conditions for participatory reintegration of persons serving sentences for extremism and terrorism. Morocco, however, is still concerned about the threat posed by people who were involved in terror-related crimes in Middle Eastern countries affected by civil wars. In June, the head of the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, expressed concerns about rehabilitating ISIS returnees and managing Moroccan combatants stranded in combat zones who plan to return to Morocco as soon as circumstances allow them. Khiame, however, is eminently confident in his staff and Morocco’s security system that has been “essentially effective,” especially in its ability to identify security threats. Khiame also estimated the number of Moroccan fighters affiliated with terror organizations at “only 1,660 fighters.”  The country has also launched several programs in mosques to fight extremist ideology, which might result in breeding terrorists.

Rabat- One of Saad Lamjarred’s lawyers has announced his withdrawal from the rape case, after the Moroccan singer was accused of a second rape in France. Eric Dupond-Moretti told Moroccan news outlet Le 360 that he is no longer a member of the Moroccan singer’s defense team. King Mohammed VI had appointed the lawyer to defend Lamjarred when he was first arrested in France for violence and rape in October 2016. Dupond-Moretti, however, refused to explain why he dropped the case. French authorities arrested the 33-year-old singer on Sunday morning in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France on Sunday, August 26, after police received a new rape complaint from another woman. Jean-Marc Fedida, another member of Lamjarred’s defense team, denied the charges against his client after his release. He told France Info that Lamjarred had “a consensual sexual relationship” with the woman who accuses him of rape. “He denies any violence against this person, of any nature whatsoever.”
Fedida also asserted that “no material findings can confirm the existence of such violence.” The news of Lamjarred’s new alleged crime has his fans and followers questioning his involvement. Lamjarred was released under surveillance Tuesday night, after spending two days in custody. An investigating judge of the Draguignan Tribunal charged him with rape.
Several Moroccan celebrities, including singer Douzi, congratulated Lamjarred after his release. The judge’s decision to allow Lamjarred to be released, however, angered his first French victim, Laura Prioul, who is awaiting trial in her case and heavily criticized her country’s justice system. “This is something I can not conceive, it’s something I can not understand, that he can go on vacation like that since there have already been complaints against him and I’m not the first,” Prioul told France radio RTL. In another statement to Le Parisian, Prioul said that she was “extremely shocked” that Lamjarred has the right to roam freely in France’s Saint-Tropez, “not far from the place” where she works.

Rabat – The story of Khadija, the 17-year-girl who said she was kidnapped, raped, and tattooed, is still making headlines. After Khadija claimed she was forcibly tattooed while being held captive for two months this summer, parents of the suspects denied the story and asserted the teenager had the tattoos long before. A professional tattoo remover has now weighed in.  In an interview with Arabic outlet Barlamane, the professional, who called herself “Linda Paradis,” said that the tattoos are older than the teenager’s story asserts.  Linda explained that when she heard the heartbreaking story of the girl, she went straight to the victim’s home to examine her in the presence of her mother.  What she found was not what she expected.  “The skin of the girl was perfectly healed, so her tattoo would go back at least six months. She made her tattoos to hide scars with a knife that she inflicted to herself a year ago or more,” said the specialist.  “There is no crust, no redness, no inflammation; I have a lot of doubts,” she added. She explained that no laser can remove the scars as it is too dangerous for her. “I offered her a medical follow-up; she was only asking for money. I also tried to offer psychological support, but it ended badly with the family,” added the specialist.  Linda Paradis’ version supports the parents’. One of the parents of the suspects said that Khadija asked “for the tattoos and they were not forced on her by anyone.” The mother of two of the suspects added that she would defend the victim herself if Khadija were really a victim as she claimed. “She wanted this, she was always knocking on my door asking if my son was home,” the mother told Moroccan television channel Soltana. Another parent questioned Khadija’s allegation, claiming that if what she charged of his son were true, the victim’s father would have filed a complaint about his daughter’s absence. Khadija, however, claimed that she tried to escape several times, but the suspects caught her and tortured her. Earlier this week, twelve men, aged 18 to 28, were arrested on suspicion of raping Khadija. An authority told AFP that the general prosecutor of the Criminal Division of the Beni Mellal Court of Appeal in central Morocco had decided to prosecute and to put the suspects in pre-trial detention. The primary suspect is aged 20 and is being prosecuted for “trafficking a minor, rape, threat of murder, torture, kidnapping and for having a criminal gang.” Ten other suspects are facing charges of “human trafficking of a minor, threat of murder, torture, kidnapping, rape and non-reporting of crime and for not helping a person in danger,” the source added. A twelfth suspect will be charged for “not helping the victim” and for not reporting on a crime. Police are now searching for three other suspects, AFP’s source said.

Rabat – Alexandre Laurent, a French surgeon and businessman, has brought attention to 1980, the year when Morocco was five times richer than China. L’express, a French magazine, published Laurent’s article comparing the two nations, in which the businessman highlighted the different trends and cultures between the two countries in the past and present. The businessman made the comparison based on the average income per capita of each country and their current trends and investment levels. Laurent explained that Morocco’s average income per capita in 1980 was $1,075, five times higher than China’s $195. Although Morocco outweighed China in average income, Morocco’s economy mostly relied on the agriculture sector, focusing on ways to achieve self sufficiency in food production.  Morocco’s major source of foreign currency depended on processing phosphate ore into fertilizers and phosphoric acid, in addition to textiles and clothes made of domestically produced cotton and wool. “China has become a great scientific power, while Morocco remains a poor country that still has a 40% illiteracy rate among women,” said Laurent. However, Laurent praised the Moroccan technocratic elites who surround Morocco’s King Mohammed VI. “King Mohammed VI is an enlightened king surrounded by high-quality technocratic elites, but this is not enough to keep up with the pace of Asia, which invests heavily in research, innovation and education,” he said. Morocco is aware of the challenges that it is facing to enhance the business, research, and education sectors that all constitute the main sectors responsible for the future of its economy. In an attempt to improve these sectors, Morocco’s government introduced reforms. This month, the King urged the cabinet to increase their efforts to address education issues and to empower youth as they represent the “wealth” of Morocco. The August report of Bank Al Maghrib also showcases many irregularities in government that hamper Morocco’s economy and its development. Laurent attributed Morocco’s inability to follow China’s growth in all sectors to China’s great emphasis on investment in research, innovation, education, and artificial intelligence.  According to Laurent, globalization saved the lives of hundreds of millions who were living in misery. Life expectancy doubled for Chinese people. The businessman believes that all Asian countries are leaders when it comes to innovation, education, and creativity. He added, “There is still no research center worthy of the name in North Africa…. Even several European countries that claimed to be advanced cannot keep up with the Asians’ path.” Regarding the political class in France, the author noted that the Asian countries’ progress in PISA ranking, the international assessment of students’ achievement, is a taboo topic in France. He explained that France is no longer a leader of “knowledge capitalism,” a mantle taken up by Asian countries. Laurent reminded readers that in 1970, France was three times richer than Singapore, and only now that French people realized that Singaporeans have twice France’s quality of life, which will hold France’s political class accountable.

Rabat – Spanish authorities arrested two more sub-Saharan migrants on Wednesday for alleged violence while forcefully crossing the Spain-Morocco border at Ceuta in July. While reporting on the new arrests, AFP gave more details about the 10 previously arrested migrants who were involved in July 26 massive crossing of the fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. On Tuesday, Spain arrested the first 10 migrants: 7 Guineans, 2 Cameroonians, and 1 Togolese. Authorities arrested the migrants for “organizing and leading the massive and violent intrusion,” according to the Spanish Civil Guard. Police placed the arrested migrants at a reception center for migrants in Ceuta. The migrants will be charged with “violence against police and assault.” On July 26, more than 600 sub-Saharans successfully crossed the border between Morocco and Ceuta. Along with border guards, dozens of migrants were injured during the incursion. On August 22, allegedly 300 migrants tried to storm the border of Ceuta. Spanish authorities, however, accounted for only  115 of them, while other reports estimated the number at between 100 and 200. Every year, hundreds of migrants take the risky sea route or cross controlled fences to reach the Eldorado.  However, Spain has reactivated an agreement concluded with Morocco in 1992. The agreement allows Spain to deport migrants to the kingdom. On August 23, Spanish authorities implemented the agreement, sending back 116 migrants to Morocco who had entered Ceuta on August 22.  Quoted by AFP, the Spanish Ministry of Interior said the migrants had the “opportunity to seek asylum but have not done so.”

Rabat – The first French woman to accuse Saad Lamjarred of rape, Laura Prioul, expressed disappointment with the judge’s decision to release Lamjarred after two days in custody. For Prioul, Lamjarred, who is now facing another rape charge in France, is a threat, given the “danger he represents.” Saad Lamjarred was arrested Sunday, August 26, and held for 48 hours before being released on surveillance. He is awaiting trial in the rape case of Laura Prioul and was charged with rape in the second case on Tuesday, August 28. “This is something I can not conceive, it’s something I can not understand, that he can go on vacation like that since there have already been complaints against him and I’m not the first,” Prioul told France radio RTL. Speaking about Lamjarred, the victim recalled how the singer’s change to a “violent person” occurred suddenly during her encounter with him. “He is someone who looks nice, but suddenly, the look will change, the expression will change … he will become violent. I understand this girl, I know he can be nice over a period of time,” said Prioul, explaining that she experienced the same feelings the new victim did. In another statement to French news outlet Le Parisien, Prioul said that she was “extremely shocked” that Lamjarred has the right to roam freely in France’s Saint-Tropez, “not far from the place” where she works. After Lamjarred’s arrest on Sunday, Prioul shared a post on Facebook, protesting French justice for not being “firm” against the singer. Prioul opened up about her allegations against Lamjarred on November 12, 2017. Prioul said that the singer “ruined” her life, claiming that Lamjarred raped and beat her in October 2016 after she “refused him.” “I wanted to defend myself, and this person hit me again, and again and again.… I couldn’t do anything. He was stronger than me. That person raped me,” she said. Lamjarred, according to Prioul, acted like a different person after the incident as if nothing had happened, asking her why she was crying after he raped her. “He asked me why I was crying, if I was injured, and if I needed some ice?”  After the incident, Prioul filed complaints against the infamous singer. Subsequently, police arrested Lamjarred in October 2016, and he spent six months at the Marriott Champs Elysées in Paris pending his trial. In April 2017, French authorities decided to release Lamjarred on bail under electronic surveillance, and he was allowed to return to Morocco twice.

Rabat – Mehdi Echafai, better known as the “poor’s people doctor” is not done with the provincial hospital in Tiznit, near Agadir.  Despite being fined MAD 20,000 on August 5 for libel and defamation of the Tiznit Provincial Hospital’s chief, the Moroccan pediatric surgeon is not afraid to speak out again about the work conditions and the “dysfunctional system” of the hospital.   In a viral video posted on his Facebook page Tuesday, the 34-year-old practitioner who resigned has spoken out about his reunion with the chief department denouncing again his behavior.  “We came after our leave to do our duty, but since the authorities took no action against the director of the hospital, he came to make fun of me indirectly, not leaving me to perform my tasks,” shouted the pediatric surgeon, filming himself from the hospital’s operating room. The doctor angrily called for help from the leaders of the sector to come and solve the dysfunctional system of the hospital.  The video has been widely circulating on social media, generating more than 430,000 views and hundred of comments supporting the doctor’s statement.  Beginning in 2017, Echafai carried out more than 560 free operations for the poorest patients in 8 months in the same hospital, before he decided to resign on July 23 in the midst of defamation hearings. The doctor earned his nickname for helping hundreds of families treat their children.

Echafai submitted a complaint to the health minister to protest “corruption” on July 25, deploring the “many dysfunctions of the health sector in general” and the “corruption that is commonplace within the hospital center.” In his resignation letter, he denounced the fact he was asked to give “illegal treatment” in his surgical duties, which negatively affected his family and health. Following Echafai’s accusations, the ministry issued a statement explaining that the surgeon “made administrative errors” that led to him being sent to a disciplinary council. The ministry noted the doctor’s right to defense by lawyers had been respected.

Rabat- Benabdellah has reiterated PPS’ disapproval of PJD’s proposal to remove the water secretariat and is considering withdrawing from the ruling coalition. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani of the Justice and Development party (PJD) is under fire again for his propose that the Secretariat of State in Charge of Water be dissolved, a decision the King made on August 20. This time, the secretary-general of the Progress and Socialism Party (PPS) publicly expressed his disapproval of El Othmani’s proposal. The head of the water secretariat was PPS member Charafat Afilal. Nabil Benabdellah stated that the Minister of Equipment, Transportation, Logistics, and Water, Abdelkader Amara is also to blame for the proposal. “The Progress and Socialism Party is unable to comprehend the gist of this proposal, coming from the head of government, and which the Minister of Equipment, Transportation, Logistics, and Water bears a direct responsibility for.”  Benabdellah maintained that the proposal failed to represent moral and political ethics as well as the “special relationship” between PPS and the PJD, chaired by El Othmani. PPS called on the political bureau of PPS to hold a meeting on Saturday, September 22, to discuss a potential withdrawal from the government’s ruling coalition. The socialist PPS and the moderate Islamist PJD have been in a ruling coalition since 2011, following Morocco’s constitutional reforms when PJD won the majority of votes in the parliament. The two parties have been good allies despite their different approaches since Abdelilah Benkirane’s government. On Monday, in the presence of the human rights minister, Mustapha Ramid, the two ruling parties met to discuss the move and find a mutual solution to the rising conflict. Benabdellah told Moroccan news outlet Le 360 in a statement: “The meeting with El Othmani lasted for more than an hour. [PJD] was direct and we also expressed our stand in the recent shifts affecting the partnership.” The decision, first recommended to King Mohammed VI by El Othmani, was allegedly taken to improve the management of water-related projects in the kingdom, according to a communique from the Royal Palace released on August 20.

Rabat – The head of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) has questioned whether Cameroon is ready to host Africa’s biggest football event next year. Ahmad Ahmad has questioned Cameroon’s ability to host in 2019. Ahmad Ahmad also opened the door of speculations that the location of the  Africa Cup of Nations might be changed. “I am not sure Cameroon is ready to host the AFCON,”  Ahmad told KweséESPN on Monday, August 27. He added that “there are many things which are still wanting and yet there is little time left.” In 2017, Ahmad had asked the African country to make more efforts to convince the confederation that they were able to host CAN 2019. Ahmad also said CAF now sends experts to inspect the host country selected as the host of the competition. CAF’s experts were sent in August 2017, but it is unclear what their decision has been. The experts, however, do not seem to be satisfied with what Cameroon has offered so far. “It would be dangerous to risk African players, especially the professionals plying their trade in Europe and other continents, to play under difficult conditions and facilities,” Ahmad said in his recent statement to KweséESPN. There were speculations that Morocco was interested in hosting the tournament. Head of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) and the Ministry of Youth and Sports both  denied the rumors, emphasizing that Cameroon would host the tournament, and Morocco had not thought about replacing it. The CAF president also said in an interview with Cameroon outlet Camfoot published August 9 that the competition “will be held in Cameroon … until proven otherwise.”  CAN 2019 will boast the participation of 24 national teams, up from the usual 16. For the qualifier games, Morocco will play against Malawi September 8 in Casablanca, Comoros on October 10, and Cameroon on November 17. Despite its difficulties preparing for the continental tournament, Cameroonian presidential candidate Joshua Osih wants his country to present its candidature as a potential host for the 2030 World Cup.

Washington, DC – So much has been written about John Bolton’s “pro-Algeria” positions in the Western Sahara conflict, but the facts show that President Trump’s national security adviser is more of an anti-United Nations crusader than a self-determination champion.  With the arrival of Mr. Bolton to the White House and the renewed efforts of the current UN envoy to Western Sahara, Horst Köhler, to restart direct negotiations between the belligerents, the specter of the Baker plan II has reemerged. The US national security advisers’ tough positions in the Sahara conflict and his staunch support to the former UN Envoy to the Western Sahara James  Baker’s  plan stem from Bolton’s dislike of United Nations’ missions that tend to last forever without ever finding  final solutions to conflict that are purely political. The UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) fits these criteria. His hard-charging approach to the conflict is a response to the “sluggish” work of the UN Security Council to address a stalemate that sees Morocco rule the territory and Algeria play spoiler. The Algerian press hailed the appointment of John Bolton as a victory of the Algerian military backed Polisario guerrilla fighting Morocco over the control of the Western Sahara. In actuality, this development can benefit Morocco more than Algiers, if Rabat plays its cards right. In fact, the first draft of the plan, AKA Baker 1, called for an autonomy for the Western Sahara within Moroccan sovereignty. Algeria and the Polisario rejected the proposal. The former U.S. ambassador is a critic of multilateral institutions especially the UN and at the same time believes in defending American interests at any cost. In the case of the Western Sahara, he wants an end to the “wasteful” MINURSO but not at the expense of American national security in North Africa and the Sahel. His aggressive advocacy of U.S. interests should fit in with Morocco’s cold policy and attitudes towards nations that are anti-American. On the other hand, Algeria has been courting and accommodating regimes that Bolton despises such as Venezuela, Iran and North Korea. Furthermore, Mr. Bolton argument as was presented by Amy Tachco, political officer at the US mission in the UN, during the briefing in the Security Council on April 27,  goes to the heart of the new American position aiming at finding a final solution to the conflict and an end the mandate of the MINURSO. However, Ms. Tachco never took a position on the “nature” of a final status for the Western Sahara. Algerian diplomats wishfully refer to Mr. Bolton’s past endorsement of the Baker Plans as a sign of his support of the Polisario, a guerrilla movement that was heavily funded by Kaddafi and Castro in the 1970’s. Moreover, the Baker documents included several key Moroccan demands, called on Algeria to join the UN efforts as a party into the conflict, and did not reference independence as a preferred resolution. While it is true, that Morocco objected to some elements of the Baker Plan II, it did not reject the spirit of the proposal. Rabat appreciated the inclusion of all eligible Sahrawi voters and the endorsement of autonomy as a feasible resolution, but opposed the idea of a Western Sahara Authority that would invite Algerian trained Polisario agents to destabilize the region. Mr. Bolton regrets the abandonment of Secretary Baker’s settlement plan back in 2004. Nevertheless, this year may be an opportune time to revive and update the proposal to meet the current geo-political realities in the region and the world. Washington cannot afford to have a failed state in the Western Sahara and therefore the option of “independence” is void and null and a local autonomy plan that includes some members of the Polisario looks more feasible.

Rabat – Morocco’s Court of Auditors has uncovered irregularities in many hospital centers, including inefficient management and lack of essential medical services. In its 2016-2017 annual report, the Court of Auditors identified many problems related to medical services, billing and debt recovery, drug supply, and pharmacy premises in Moroccan hospital centers. The Court of Auditors made its report public on Monday, August 27. The Court of Auditors continued its supervising mission over many regional and prefectural autonomously-managed hospitals under the Ministry of Health during the years 2016 and 2017. The controlled hospital centers function without “a document defining strategic objectives and organizing the supply of care, equipment and infrastructure, or giving a clear vision for their developments,” stated the report. The lack of the document is in breach of Article 8 of Decree 2.06.656, issued on April 13, 2007, on hospital organization. Absence of essential medical services Although Decree 2.06.656 on hospital organization “defined for each hospital level specialties and medical services to make available to the public,” the court noted that some hospitals do not offer all necessary services to patients. The report included the example of Marrakech’s regional hospital center which does not offer general surgery, neurosurgery, and pneumology while cardiology and endocrinology services are limited to outpatients “since there is a single doctor for each specialty.” As for Berkane’s prefectural hospital center, in eastern Morocco, stomatology and maxillofacial surgery services are not provided while the ophthalmology and mental health services are not functional due to a lack of equipment and paramedics. “Endocrinology services have also not been available in the hospital since the end of 2015, following the transfer of the only specialist doctor in this service,” the report noted. ‘Abnormally’ long consultation deadlines and disorganization  The court described appointments made for patients as “abnormally” long although deadlines for appointments are a “determining factor in the quality and efficiency of hospital care.” Long delays for appointments were recorded in many Moroccan hospitals: some appointments exceeded 10 months delay. The court considered that long delays were primarily due to lack of schedule programming. The report explained that doctors exercising the same specialty are not present at the same time at hospitals and consultations are limited to one or two sessions per week per doctor. The sessions often end at the end of the morning. “Some doctors determine in advance the number of patients to be examined, which leads to low productivity of doctors,” the court’s report added. Billing and debt recovery problems The court identified many problems related to billing and the recovering of patients’ debts in many hospital centers. In some medical centers, the court noted a difference between the medical services performed and those invoiced. Many reception services in hospital centers did not register or invoice the services provided, including emergency services. In Temara-Skhirat, 35 kilometers southwest of Rabat, the prefectural hospital center’s emergency department performed 943,354 consultations between January 1, 2009, and December 15, 2015, while only 21 consultations were billed during the same period. Significant delays were made to processing hospitals’ files and the billing process in addition to mismanagement of insured patient files. The report cited, in 2015, 4,370 billing files out of 7,653 were not processed in Meknes’ prefectural hospital center, 160 kilometers west of Rabat and 60 kilometers southwest of Fez. Shortage of drugs and lack of drug use monitoring Hospital centers purchased drugs and pharmaceutical products either through direct procurement or through endowments from the central pharmacy of the Ministry of Health, the regional directorate, or the provincial delegation.  Hospital centers also exchange drugs between them without regulating the exchanges. However, the court said the central pharmacy’s supplies do not always meet the needs of the medical centers both quantitatively and qualitatively. The mismatch between supplies and needs leads either to situations where drugs are out of stock or where excess drugs pass expiration periods and must be thrown out, the report stated. Recurrent shortages in drugs were reported at Mohammed V Hospital in Tangier, even though MAD 14.7 million worth of drugs remained to be delivered by the ministry. For El Jadida’s hospital center, a city 100 kilometers south of Casablanca, expired drugs over the period 2011-2015 were worth over MAD 1.7 billion. Similarly, Marrakech’s regional hospital center registered a difference between the hospital’s actual needs and the needs it claimed to have for drugs. In 2016, the hospital said it needed drugs worth MAD 16.6 million. The health ministry gave the hospital drugs worth MAD 8.8 million. However, the hospital’s annual consumption did not exceed MAD 5.8 million, stated the court’s report. Lack of monitoring in hospital pharmacies “The clinical services do not keep records allowing them to follow their drug supplies and consumption,” reads the court’s report. “As a result, drugs were not included in the billing of hospital services,” added the report. According to the Court of Auditors, hospital pharmacies still face problems on their premises with equipment as well as an inadequate working environment for staff. The problems in pharmacy premises “resulted in storage conditions for drugs and medical devices that violate existing standards.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has sent a message of condolence and compassion to the family members of the late US Senator John McCain. McCain died on Saturday at the age of 81. He spoke out for the world’s longest-held POWs, Moroccan soldiers in Tindouf.  In 2005, McCain called for the release of more than 400 Moroccan POWs who were still detained by the Polisario Front in Tindouf in western Algeria, years after an agreement had been signed to exchange POWs in 1991. On August 18, 2005, Polisario released the Moroccan POWs to the Red Cross. They were later flown to Agadir aboard a US piloted aircraft and were welcomed by King Mohammed VI. In the message, the sovereign expressed to the family members, friends, and relatives of the late senator his heartfelt condolences and sincere feelings of compassion, asking God to give them patience and comfort. In these painful circumstances, King Mohammed VI recalled with appreciation the human qualities, patriotism, and commitment of Senator McCain for world causes, pointing out that Morocco had “lost a great friend with whom the Kingdom had close ties based on mutual esteem and the common pursuit of humanistic ideas.” McCain was a prisoner of war (POW) in Vietnam for more than 5 years. During the war in Vietnam, McCain was a bomber pilot, and he was captured when his plane was shot down in 1967. McCain refused to be released from the Hanoi Hilton prison until his fellow prisoners were freed with him. It was an action that showed McCain’s selflessness and heroism in the eyes of many Americans. In 2008, McCain ran for president in the US as a maverick Republican. During McCain’s presidential campaign, he respected his opponent, Barack Obama.  One voter told McCain, “I can’t trust Obama… he’s an Arab.” With characteristic integrity, McCain responded, “No ma’am, he’s a decent family man and citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that’s what this campaign’s about.”

Rabat- Saudi Arabia has acknowledged its neglect of Moroccan pilgrims on Hajj, claiming that they were not the only ones affected. Saudi Arabia’s National Tawafa (pilgrimage guide) Establishment for Pilgrims of Arabian Countries explained on Tuesday, August 27, that the overcrowding in camps at Mina, 5 kilometers to the east of Mecca, affected all pilgrims and not just Moroccans alone. The official statement, given to Morocco’s state owned press, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), pointed out that Saudi Arabia has been working for years to find a solution to the problem of accommodations in Mina camps, an important site on the Hajj. As for the transportation crisis, especially the 13 kilometers between Arafat and Muzdalifah, two parts of the pilgrimage, the pilgrimage guide said the problem was caused by attempting to transport two groups of pilgrims on each bus instead of securing buses for each separate group. The National Tawafa noted that implementing the solution would have meant additional costs. In videos posted online last week, Moroccans complained of poor nutrition due to lack of food on Hajj. Responding to the complaints, the National Tawafa stressed that for every Hajj season, it hires licensed companies responsible for food safety to provide healthy meals to all pilgrims during pilgrimage.  The National Tawafa stated, “It is impossible for the establishment to respond to the different dietary habits of pilgrims, despite its efforts to provide suitable meals.” The body pledged to continue to work with Morocco to improve the Hajj experience for pilgrims. The statement comes after the emergency meeting held between the National Tawafa and the Moroccan delegation in Mecca on August 25 to review the “malfunctions experienced in this year’s Hajj season with regard to food and housing and Mina and transportation to Arafat.” Some Moroccan pilgrims complained about their hardships in Mecca due to non-existent management, leaving them hungry, without transport and shelter. A video was posted on social media showing distressed Moroccans rueing their inability to perform Hajj rituals, such as the “stoning of the devil,” a major rite, because there were “no delegates or coordinators” to guide them. At first, Morocco’s Ministry of Islamic Affairs stated that “some allegations reported by some media outlets” regarding the conditions of Hajj for Moroccan pilgrims were “lies dating back to previous years,” insisting that the accommodations in Hajj for Moroccans were satisfactory. It was not long before the ministry announced that it recognized the pilgrims’ struggle. In turn, Moroccan MPs, taken aback by the videos and photos of distressed pilgrims, demanded explanations for the allegations. Justice and Development (PJD) party member Nabil Andaloussi wrote to the minister of Islamic affairs, Ahmed Taoufioufiq, questioning the real accommodations for Moroccan pilgrims, whereas member of the Party of Authenticity and Modernity (PAM), Ibtissam Azzaoui, requested a meeting with Taoufiq. “The suffering of Moroccan pilgrims at the sacred sites is unacceptable. I vow to communicate to the minister all forms of mismanagement and struggle experienced by Moroccan Hajj pilgrims in the holy sites,” she stated in a Facebook post on Tuesday.

Rabat – Marrakech’s luxurious Mamounia hotel caught on to a tourist who forged a letter from the Moroccan royal couple. Before coming to Marrakech, the tourist made a six-person reservation for a week-long stay at Mamounia, between August 18-25, a stay that would cost MAD 200,000.  Upon arrival at the hotel, however, the tourist and his friends paid MAD 20,000 as an advance, promising to pay the rest “ as soon as possible.” When asked on the following day to pay the balance, the man, who holds both Brazilian and Portuguese passports, reportedly produced a number of Portuguese and Brazilian bank cards.  But the hotel could only retrieve MAD 63,000 from the bank cards. The man then promised to pay the remaining sum on the following day. Unable to pay the totality of his hotel fees, the tourist pretended to be a contact of King Mohammed VI. He assured the hotel that the King had given him a letter requesting that the tourist be given preferential treatment.  Royal request According to Le 360, the man spent many hours on the Royal Palace website on the night of August 22. He reportedly downloaded information related to royal protocol, ranging from King Mohammed VI and Princess Lalla Salma’s signatures to the general content of the King’s official letters.  The tourist then allegedly sent the information he downloaded to graphic designer friends in Sao Paulo, Brazil, instructing them to replicate a letter, signed by the King, that the man be given special treatment by the hotel in Marrakech. On August 23, the tourist presented the forgery to hotel management, pretending that it was from the royal couple.  Doubting the authenticity of the letter, the hotel management reported the tourist to the Marrakech police department.  The police launched an investigation and summoned the suspect on August 24.  The police established that the man was a known imposter wanted by Brazilian law enforcement for similar crimes he had committed in the South American country. The case was transferred to the Marrakech justice court, where the suspect is awaiting a trial scheduled for October 24. Meanwhile, the city’s judicial authorities have placed a travel ban on the man and confiscated his two passports.  Identity theft and forged letters are not news to Marrakech’s luxurious hotel establishments and restaurants.  In March, the wife of the French president, Bridgitte Macron, lodged a legal complaint of identity theft. Macron’s complaint included a Moroccan luxurious hotel which had received a supposed email from her, requesting that her nephew be warmly received at the airport and given special treatment during his stay at the hotel.

Rabat – After his audience with Morocco’s foreign affairs ministry, the Cuban ambassador said his country is interested in “expanding and amplifying” political dialogue with Morocco. Elio Eduardo Rodriguez made his remarks on political dialogue when a journalist asked him about Cuba’s stance on the Western Sahara conflict after his meeting with the president of the House of Representatives, Lahbib El Malki, on Wednesday, August 28, in Rabat. The ambassador responded, “Even within a family, there are still differences.” The ambassador said that he discussed all subjects of common interest with Moroccan authorities. “There is great will on both sides to reinforce our political dialogue.” He added that he realized after his appointment that “there is much more in common than differences” between the two countries and that the commonalities “can give a new impetus to our relations.” Cuba has supported the Polisario Front separatist movement, which resulted in 37 years of frozen diplomatic ties with Morocco. Morocco severed ties with Cuba in 1980 when the Latin republic recognized the front. In his statement to the press today, the ambassador also showed interest in reinforcing ties in different sectors with Morocco, including the business sector. Rodriguez also conveyed an invitation from the Ministry of Economy of Cuba to participate in Havana’s International Fair in October.  The official believed that the two countries could develop stronger trade relations. The ambassador then recalled his meeting with Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita, mentioning that the two countries re-established diplomatic ties in April 2017. In 2017, both countries decided to normalize ties, coming after the King’s private visit to Cuba in April. According to Rodriguez,  citizens of both Morocco and Cuba share “historic and traditional” ties. He said that the ties between Cuba and Africa play an “important and essential role,” and said that is why “we are in this moment … a new moment of bilateral relations.” Rodriguez also described his meeting with El Malki as “excellent and friendly,” adding that Morocco is also interested in developing Morocco-Cuba relations. On Tuesday, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed satisfaction with the new development that the ties between the two countries has reached. The statement of the ministry also added that the meeting between Bourita and Rodriguez “ reflects the common will to develop bilateral cooperation and strengthen relations of friendship and mutual respect.”

Rabat – After nearly 37 years of frozen diplomatic ties, Morocco and Cuba have officially restored their bilateral bonds. King Mohammed VI’s 2017 visit to Cuba and Morocco’s diplomacy seem to be working well. On August 28, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita received Cuba’s Ambassador to Morocco Elio Eduardo Rodríguez Perdomo in Rabat . The ambassador presented his credentials as Cuba’s extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador to Rabat, residing in Paris, France. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation released a statement yesterday, expressing satisfaction with the development. The statement said that the meeting between Bourita and Perdomo reflects “a new dynamic” in the diplomatic ties between the two countries.  “The meeting also reflects the common will to develop bilateral cooperation and strengthen relations of friendship and mutual respect,” according to the statement. Re-establishment of diplomatic relations After the monarch’s visit to Cuba in April 2017, which the ministry described as “historic,” both countries signed a joint statement on the re-establishment of diplomatic ties. The statement was signed in New York and announced the decision to restore diplomatic ties at the level of ambassadors. Morocco cut ties with Cuba in 1980 as a result of Cuba’s recognition of the Polisario Front and the island’s support of Polisario’s claims for independence in Western Sahara.  Cuba also offered trainings for Polisario youth in different fields, including military training, angering Morocco, which believes that the only solution to end the Western Sahara conflict is through Morocco’s Autonomy Plan introduced to the UN in 2007.  Cuba backed Polisario by providing military aid to Algeria.  While Cuba still supports Polisario, Moroccan analysts believe that the reestablishment of ties between Rabat and Havana could be a major step towards a more neutral stance from Cuba on the conflict.  The monarch’s private visit to Cuba changed the situation, causing confusion among both Algeria and Polisario officials. It is still unknown what happened during the King’s visit, but many things have changed since then. In June, Morocco’s Ambassador to Cuba Boughaleb El Attar presented his credentials to Cuba’s president, Miguel Diaz-Canel. During his meeting with the Moroccan ambassador, Diaz-Canel conveyed “warm greetings” for the King, welcoming the “historic visit” of the monarch to Cuba, which marked the resumption of diplomatic relations. Diaz-Canel said that after the diplomatic restoration, both countries aim to begin “a new phase of cooperation in various fields for the benefit of both countries and two peoples,” according to the Moroccan ambassador.

By Raja Felgata The Netherlands – Let’s talk a little about Saad Lamjarred. My opinion about this man is based on what I know about him from the media and his history of abusing women in different continents and getting away with it. I don’t know any of his songs; as a feminist I refuse to listen to him. Just like I am boycotting the famous American R&amp;B singer R. Kelly for his assaults, I have boycotted Saad for years now for the same reasons.  What is interesting for me as a Moroccan-Dutch journalist based in the Netherlands is the blind loyalty Saad receives from his Moroccan fans, even when he is on probation and wearing an ankle bracelet awaiting a trial for another assault charge.  Saad Lamjarred even fled the US on bail after he was charged with rape in New York, and yet people are still defending him, as if he is the Holy Spirit himself. Where is this blind faith in Saad coming from? Because of his artist status? The money, the fame? The (superficial) songs? Why is the Moroccan standard of acceptance and tolerance so low and why is this man getting away with rape and assaulting women? And even though the evidence is evident, people are blind to the facts it seems. What’s even more intriguing are the women supporting Saad who see no harm in the charges or the idea of him being a sexual predator. How can this be in the era of #metoo when women (and men!) all around the globe are raising their voice to end sexual harassment and oppression of women? As Moroccan women at home and abroad, we should unite and make a fist to let our voices against these kinds of men be heard so media and the government can take our voices seriously.  Unfortunately, women in Morocco live in a more patriarchal context than Moroccan women in the West. The power of the #metoo movement seems to have skipped Morocco, while the rest of the world isn’t afraid to speak out anymore. And the messed up thing is, when women do speak up, the blame game starts: “She must have asked for it and then changed her mind; she’s just jealous; she needs attention; what was she doing in that situation anyway?” Or there is even the argument of him being the victim of a “plot” by neighbouring Algeria, which has strained relations with Morocco. It is hilarious, to be honest, and sad at the same time.  With his dangerous behavior towards women, Saad is normalizing the objectification of women on a mainstream level, while women in Morocco are facing everyday harassment—most of the time without any form of help or understanding. As a victim, she often will be criminalized and detached from friends and family because of ”honour and shame” while millions of predators, famous and unknown, like Saad, are walking down the streets of Morocco, knowing that they are safe and sound. How is this still possible in 2018? I don’t care how many fans and followers Saad has. It doesn’t define him, nor will it save him when he faces the charges he deserves.  All I know is that I believe that Morocco has to protect women and girls from men and boys like him. Women should stand stronger to be a united front and show the world that the legacies of Moroccan feminists like Fatima Mernissi are still rising and Moroccan women can take pride in their femininity and claim back ownership of their bodies.  And how about a radio boycott? No more Saad songs on air. It would be a first step in taking responsibility. I don’t know if Morocco is ready yet though. Men seem to always get the benefit of the doubt. What I do know is that the time for Morocco to take a stand against sexual harassment is now! Morocco needs to talk about this more often on national radio and television. So the people can get past the shame and protect their daughters. And hopefully the blind fans can recognize the truth.  At the end of the day, we don’t want our women to be daily harassed on the streets like they are everyone’s object, raped, or tortured.  We all heard about the case of the young Khadija who was kidnapped and raped for 2 months by 13 men and was tattooed all over her body against her will! No worries though, Saad has only three accusations of rape and sexual assault. The Middle Ages are behind us, and we need to protect ourselves! So I am saying NO to men like Saad as long as I am breathing, and I hope justice will be served.  #TaAnna #MeToo  Raja Felgata is a Dutch-Moroccan journalist and media entrepreneur in the Netherlands.

Rabat – Bank Al Maghrib (BAM) has issued another statement denying a fake message calling its employees to withdraw MAD 15,537. For at least two months, a message claiming to be from BAM has been circulating via mobile messaging apps saying, “Those who worked for Bank Al Maghrib between 1990 and 2018 have the right to withdraw MAD 15,537 from Bank Al Maghrib.” The message invites recipients to open a link to find out if their names “are on the list of those who have the right to withdraw these funds.” Bank Al Maghrib said in a statement Tuesday, August 28, that the message is not, under any circumstances, sent on BAM’s behalf and denied any relation with the content or its sender. As a result, BAM denied all responsibility for the content of the message and the possible consequences of clicking the link. The link destination is unknown. Bank Al Maghrib underlined that it reserves the right to take legal action in accordance with the applicable laws. On June 30, BAM released its first statement saying it was not behind the message received by its employees.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Human Rights Council, CNDH, is aiming to broaden its appeal beyond Moroccan borders. In a bid to show Morocco’s improving human rights records and enhance its own international credibility, CNDH has announced the organization in October of an international conference on the promotion and protection of human rights.  The forum will take place on October 12 in Marrakech and is expected to gather over 500 participants—mostly NGOs and national councils for human rights—from around the world. Human rights experts and activists from all continents are expected to attend the event, as well as high-ranking government representatives from Morocco and other countries to discuss current challenges and the future of human rights issues in their respective countries. The event will be launched in the presence of Driss El Yazami, CNDH’s chairman, and Michel Forst, the UN Special rapporteur on the situation of human rights and chairman of France’s national commission on human rights. According to organizers, Forst’s attendance is a reflection of CNDH’s desire to genuinely promote a culture of human rights in Morocco and propel the kingdom to be among the countries with an improved and encouraging record on human rights. While the conference’s general topics will deal with issues related to the respect of human rights, there will be a special focus on respecting the rights and dignity of vulnerable populations, including people with disabilities, children, elderly people, and—to a great extent—women.  The idea of a Morocco-organized international forum on human rights comes at a time when the country’s authorities have received criticism from national and international observers alike for not doing enough to protect human rights. Last week, Mohamed Ziane, a lawyer for the leader of the Hirak Rif protest movement Nasser Zefzafi, accused Morocco’s human rights minister, Mustapha Ramid, of being “responsible” for the mass arrests and “unfair trials” that followed the Hirak protests in 2016 and 2017.  On June 26, 53 Hirak activists were sentenced to 1 to 20 years in prison for their involvement in the unauthorized protests.

Rabat- PAM has called for an urgent meeting with the Ministry of Islamic Affairs concerning the suffering of Moroccan pilgrims during Hajj. On behalf of the Party of Authenticity and Modernity (PAM), Ibtissam Azzaoui announced on Tuesday that she requested a meeting with the minister of Islamic affairs, Ahmed Taoufiq, to demand explanations for media reports of the lack of accommodations for Moroccan pilgrims.

“The suffering of Moroccan pilgrims at the sacred sites is unacceptable. I vow to communicate to the minister all forms of mismanagement and struggle experienced by Moroccan Hajj pilgrims in the holy sites,” she stated in a follow-up Facebook post.  It was the second reaction by an MP after Justice and Development (PJD) party member Nabil Andaloussi who wrote to Taoufiq, questioning the real accommodations for Moroccan pilgrims. This year’s Hajj did not go smoothly for all Moroccan pilgrims. Several Moroccan pilgrims complained about their hardships in Mecca due to non-existent management, leaving them hungry, without transport and shelter. A video was posted on social media showing distressed Moroccans rueing their inability to perform Hajj rituals, such as the “stoning of the devil,” a major rite, because there were “no delegates or coordinators” to guide them. After news reports of similar videos circulated on social media, the Ministry of Islamic Affairs stated that “some allegations reported by some media outlets” were “lies dating back to previous years,” insisting that the accommodations in Hajj for Moroccans were satisfactory. Finally recognizing the pilgrims’ struggle, the Moroccan delegation in Mecca held an emergency meeting in Saudi Arabia with the National Tawafa (pilgrimage guide) Establishment for Pilgrims of Arabian Countries on August 25. The parties “reviewed the malfunctions experienced in this year’s Hajj season with regard to food and housing and Mina and transportation to Arafat,” referring to two important sites on the Hajj. Two airplanes carrying the first group of Moroccan Hajj pilgrims took off on Monday from Saudi Arabia towards Moroccan airports. The planes, carrying 462 and 224 pilgrims, flew out of King Abdulaziz International Airport near Jeddah to land at Casablanca’s Mohammed V International Airport, according to Royal Air Maroc (RAM). Up until as late as September 15, some 32,000 pilgrims are expected to return to Morocco.

Rabat – Saad Lamjarred was released Tuesday night, a few hours after the investigating judge of the Draguignan Tribunal charged him with rape. The news was released by Var le Matin. Lamjarred’s father, Bachir Abdou, also announced the news on his Facebook page. “My son Saad has been released, thank god,” he wrote.  The 32-year-old artist was arrested on Sunday morning in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France after police received a new rape complaint from another alleged victim. After staying two days in custody, the Moroccan singer has appeared in front of an investigating judge for a long interrogation.  According to Le Parisien, a bail judge decided to place him under judicial supervision. Following the decision, Lamjarred is prohibited from leaving the French territory and from contacting the complainant.  In addition, the singer of “Ghazali” was required to pay bail of €150,000. According to France Info,  Lamjarred met the alleged victim in a nightclub in Saint-Tropez, on Saturday night. He invited her to his hotel room and, according to Lamjarred’s lawyer, had “a consensual sexual relationship.”  “He denies any violence against this person, of any nature whatsoever,” added his lawyer. He also asserted that “no material findings can confirm the existence of such violence.” The woman who accused the singer of “Casablanca” is a 29-year-old seasonal worker in Saint-Tropez. Contacted by Le Parisien, Lamjarred’s family deplored the “very unpleasant situation.” His aunt said, “The more important we are, the more enemies we have. It’s a revenge.”

Rabat – Police have arrested more suspects for their alleged involvement in the case of Khadija, the 17-year-old who said she was kidnapped and repeatedly raped. The case, which has sparked outrage among Moroccan citizens in the last week, continues to develop.  An authority told AFP that the general prosecutor of the Criminal Division of the Beni Mellal Court of Appeal has decided to prosecute and to put the suspects in pre-trial detention. The primary suspect is aged 20 and is being prosecuted for “trafficking a minor, rape, threat of murder, torture, kidnapping and for having a criminal gang.” Ten other suspects are facing charges of “human trafficking of a minor, threat of murder, torture, kidnapping, rape and non-reporting of crime and for not helping a person in danger,” the source added. A twelfth suspect will be charged for “not helping the victim” and for not reporting on a crime. Police are now searching for three other suspects, AFP’s source said. A member of an NGO based in Marrakech, NSAT, Loubna El Joud, told AFP that the alleged victim “is still shocked even if she tries to be strong, her hands are shaking when she speaks.” El Joud said that “several volunteer doctors have offered to remove her tattoos, but the dermatologist recommended waiting” due to inflammation in her skin. The alleged crimes against Khadija occurred in Oulad Ayad, a small town near Beni Mellal in central Morocco. When Khadija spoke about her tragedy, she said that her captors “raped”  and “tortured” her for almost two months .“They are all criminals … I want my rights and dignity back. They are a very dangerous gang,” she said in an interview as she showed green tattoos all over her body. On Sunday, August 26,  several suspects’ parents gave another version of the story. The parents claimed that Khadija has a bad reputation in the town, adding that she used to “drink, smoke and even burn herself with cigarettes.” A mother of two of the suspects said that Khadija asked “for the tattoos and they were not forced on her by anyone.” The suspect’s mother added that she would defend the victim herself if she were really a victim as she claims. “She wanted this, she was always knocking on my door asking if my son was home,” the mother told Moroccan television channel Soltana. Another parent questioned Khadija’s allegation, claiming that if what she charged of his son were true, the victim’s father would have file a complaint about his daughter’s absence. Khadija, however, claimed that she tried to escape several times, but the suspects caught her and tortured her. “They didn’t give me food or drink, and I was not even allowed to take a shower.” Social media users have launched a petition on Change.org asking King Mohammed VI and public authorities to restore Khadija’s dignity by giving her good representation in court. The petition has gathered over 28,000 signatures so far.

Rabat – Spanish police arrested 10 sub-Saharan migrants on Tuesday for violence while forcefully crossing the border of Ceuta in July. The migrants are being held at a migration center in Spain, a spokesperson for the Spanish civil guard told AFP. Authorities accused the migrants of violence against authorities and assault. “Among the ten arrested is the alleged leader of the assault on July 26 in which 15 civil guards were injured,” added the spokesperson. On July 26, more than 600 sub-Saharans successfully crossed the border between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. Along with border guards, dozens of migrants were injured during the incursion. On August 22, 300 migrants allegedly tried to storm the border of Ceuta. The Spanish Civil Guard, however, only encountered 115 migrants, and other reports put the number at 100-200. “To prevent the civil guard from approaching the area where the attempted irregular entry was occurring, the migrants threw on the agents plastic containers filled with excrement, blood, quicklime and acids,” tweeted the Spanish Civil Guard on Wednesday, August 22. On August 23, Spanish authorities began deporting the migrants from the August 22 crossing back to Morocco. AFP reported that the deportation falls within the reactivation of a bilateral agreement concluded between Spain and Morocco in 1992. Quoted by AFP, the Spanish Ministry of Interior said the migrants also had the “opportunity to seek asylum but have not done so.”

Rabat – Moroccan and South Korean officials have met to reinforce bilateral ties and economic cooperation between the two countries. Morocco’s speaker of House of Representatives, Habib El Malki, and Deputy Speaker of South Korea’s National Assembly Lee Ju-Young met on Monday, August 27, in Rabat. The two officials discussed bilateral opportunities for cooperation in renewable energies, tourism, and the automotive industry, according to the state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The meeting was held during Ju-Young’s visit to the kingdom at the head of a parliamentary delegation. The South Korean ambassador to Morocco also attended the meeting. El Malki praised the friendship between Morocco and South Korea and said the two countries “share the same values ??regarding the strengthening of peace, security and unity of peoples, and preserving the territorial integrity of countries,” according a statement by the House of Representatives. The North African country and the Asian country established diplomatic relations in 1962. For his part, Ju-Young said, “The Republic of Korea attaches great importance to strengthening its relations with Morocco, a country distinguished by its important geostrategic position, as a gateway to Africa and a link with Europe and the Middle East.” El Malki noted that a parliamentary economic forum of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly of South Korea will be scheduled for early 2019. The forum will be an opportunity to examine ways to develop economic, trade, and technological cooperation between the two countries, he added. Speaking about the parliamentary economic forum, Ju-Young said, “The National Assembly will actively contribute to the success of the Moroccan-Korean economic parliamentary forum.” El Malki stated that Morocco has considered a new development model to meet citizens’ needs. The Moroccan official also described South Korea’s experience, which represents a model of development based on human resources development, as “interesting and useful.” Ju-Young said his visit came following the Moroccan head of government’s official visit to South Korea in May 2018. Many ministers accompanied Morocco’s head of government during his visit to South Korea to discuss bilateral cooperation between the two countries. The Asian and the North African country signed an MoU between their legislative institutions. Morocco’s trade with South Korea According to Chafik Rachadi, Morocco’s ambassador to South Korea, the volume of trade between Morocco and South Korea totaled $703 million in 2016: $544 million of Moroccan exports to Korea and $159 million of Moroccan imports from Korea. Morocco is Korea’s 77th largest buying country and 79th supplier, while South Korea is the 39th buying country of Morocco and its 18th supplier, Rachadi added. However, Moroccan-Korean trade represents only 0.9% of all Moroccan trade, according to Mohammed Tawfik Mouline, director general of the Royal Institute for Strategic Studies (IRES). Mouline cited “the non-diversification of the trade” as one of the major obstacles to “Moroccan trade relations.” Morocco’s exports to Korea are mainly phosphates, fisheries, textiles, leather, animal products, and clothing. The main imported products of the North African country from Korea are digital devices, appliances, cars, automotive parts, and filaments.

Rabat – Achraf Bencharki is taking a step forward in his career. The Moroccan footballer will now play in the French league.  According to France Football, the Atlas Lion will get to grow with Racing Club Lens on loan from Saudi Arabia’s Al Hilal. He has signed a 1-year contract.  The club’s sports director, Eric Roya, Saudi club president Sami Al Jaber, and Bencharki’s agent Karim Balk sealed the deal for the 23-year-old football player in London.  Bencharki joined Al Hilal in February 2018 after being sold by Wydad of Casablanca for $9 million.  The striker’s transfer to the Saudi club made headlines, creating a heated debate between those who supported his move and those who advised him to turn down the Saudi offer. Many news outlets reported that Herve Renard was not supportive of the striker’s transfer to Al Hilal. Bencharki represented Morocco in the African Nations Championship (CHAN) 2018, which took place in Morocco from January 13 to February 4. Yesterday, Bencharki was chosen by Herve Renard to be one of the 25 players who will take part in the 2019 CAN qualifier game between Morocco and Malawi, on September 8, in Casablanca’s Mohammed V Stadium.

Rabat – Moroccan novelist and filmmaker Abdellah Taia has expressed his anger over the case of Khadija, the 17-year-old who was allegedly kidnapped and repeatedly raped in central Morocco. In a fiery article titled, “We are all Khadija,” Taia wrote a scathing critique of Moroccan gendered mores, accusing the whole society of condoning and legitimizing the physical plight and psychological wounds of girls like Khadija, who said she was held captive for two months: kidnapped, raped, tortured, and tattooed. “Once again horror. Once again the banalization of Moroccan women,” the novelist wrote. He went on to make his central points: the guilty silence of all Moroccans, the male thirst to tame and regulate the female body, and the fleeting mass indignation that solves nothing. However outrageous Khadija’s suffering and internal wounds may be, Taia suggested authorities and families would do no nothing to prevent what happened to Khadija. And while people may complain for weeks or months on social media, he said, “Everyone will forget about Khadija and life will go on as usual.” “This is unfortunately a matter that may be forgotten next week. Or perhaps next month. We will pass on to something else. There will be another cause for collective uproar. Nothing will be done. Society will not even try to find a solution. That’s how it is, don’t be surprised. This is not life, it is a jungle. And, as always, women are the ones who pay the hefty price of a dysfunctional society that refuses to grow up.” Although cases of repeated rape and toxic masculinity are not new to the Moroccan society, Taia argued that the way Khadija’s rapists behaved has brought about “a whole new dimension of the unspeakable.”  “They exchanged her among themselves” and treated her “like a doll, like a little dog, like a sexual slave.” More than a crime and an outrage, what Khadija’s rapists did is to defy the whole Moroccan society, Taia wrote.  According to Taia, the tattoos left on Khadija’s body are not merely symbolic, nor are they signs of mental disorder or any other illness on the part of those who performed them. Instead, they are a firm message of deviance and mockery to Morocco: “Yes, we are rapists. Yes, this woman has no value. Yes, we are savages. Yes, you are right, we are criminals.” “Now what will do to us? Are you going to punish us? Put us in prison? Re-educate us? We will do it again, and you know it.”  Taia also criticized the attitude of Khadija’s parents, who, he suggested, should have taken the case to the authorities rather than trying to keep the matter to themselves.  However, he wrote, their behavior is understandable. Like many Moroccans, “they are poor among countless poor people that nobody cares about,” and they wanted to shield their daughter from society’s wrath, “from shame.” Throughout the article, Taia repeatedly made the case of Morocco’s double standards and tradition-backed discrimination when it comes to women’s rights and female bodies.  He suggested that both a highly publicized case of a girl who was sexually assaulted on a bus in Casablanca in the summer of 2017 and Khadija’s plight are part of a socially dominant trend where collective rapes and public humiliation of women constitute a display of male virility.  Citing the case of singer Saad Lamjarred, who is again in trouble for a rape allegation, Taia said that many Moroccans still believe that to be a man is to be obsessed with the female body, to want to control it, and to make it subject to one’s desires. “This Khadija is just a woman,” Taia wrote, in a novelist’s attempt to capture what the rapists and their defenders could say in response to the uproar the incident provoked. “Do not exaggerate. Just a woman. We wanted to get some taste of paradise. That’s all.”  Taia concluded with a clarion call, urging Moroccan citizens and government institutions to do something that can bring about change instead of making “circumstantial condemnations” and comments that do not change reality and wither away as soon as another incident erupts. “It is now more than ever urgent to rethink the social contract that binds us. We cannot wash our hands of the Khadija affair. It is certain that there are other Khadijas in Morocco,” Taia wrote.  The trauma and the horror that Khadija and her family are going through, Taia concluded, should be a burden that all Moroccans ought to share and be concerned about, because in countries like Morocco still fighting for the recognition of many basic rights—for women—and the emergence of a truly democratic society, “The downfall of one is the downfall of the whole country.”

Rabat – Besides social issues, the 2016-2017 annual report of Morocco’s Court of Auditors has also pinpointed irregularities in tourism projects. The report, which was made public Monday, August 27, has found a “low rate of achievement” for the 15 signed regional program contracts (CPR) signed since 2010, part of the government’s “Vision 2020” for tourism development. The surge of local and foreign tourists in Morocco touted by Morocco’s Ministry of Tourism did not appear to satisfy the head of the Court of Auditors, Driss Jettou. According to the report, “The analysis of the progress of the projects planned by the CPR shows a weak completion rate.” Many projects have not been completed Jettou’s document revealed that of the 944 tourism projects since 2010  “only 37 projects were completed at the end of 2015, for an amount of nearly MAD 1.4 billion.” While MAD 151 billion was allocated to the projects, only 1.4 billion was spent for the intended purpose. None of the governance bodies, which were planned in the 2010 launch of Vision 2020, have seen the light, according to the report. Jettou also warned that two flagship programs were planned, but “no action has been taken.” The two programs are “Qariati,” a program for the integrated development of rural tourism and nature, and “Mdinti,” an integrated program for tourism development of the cultural and handicraft products in the medinas (old cities).  The program was designed by the Moroccan Society of Tourist Engineering (SMIT) as part of Vision 2020. The Moroccan government launched Vision 2020 to double Morocco’s tourism sector in terms of number of visitors, investments, and remittances. Eight years on, Jettou’s report reveals that many of the envisioned programs have not been achieved. The report mentioned other Vision 2020 programs, including the National Program for Innovation and Tourism Competitiveness, aimed at supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and to improve tourism.   The report noted that two support measures were set up to support SMEs, “Moussanda Siyaha” (support for tourism) and “Renovotel.” The systems, according to the report, have been found to be “below expectations.” To supervise tourism activity, the government modernized the legal and regulatory corpus for the main tourism professions, such as accommodation, distribution (travel agencies), and tourism guide, “without, however, recording a real breakthrough,” according to the report. Morocco’s airport situation is unacceptable The report also gave airport management an important section. According to the report, the design and management of the airports did not follow the master plan. Criticizing the Moroccan Airports Authority (ONDA), the Court of Auditors noted management’s failure to evaluate the financial opportunities for airport projects. The report also mentioned that almost all airport projects did not include an environmental impact study prior to their completion in accordance with Law 12.03 on environmental impact studies. Jettou handed over his 200-page report to King Mohammed VI on the eve of Throne Day, July 29.

Rabat – Moroccan artisan product exports have performed well in January to July 2018, increasing by 93 percent from the same period last year. According to statistics from the Ministry of Handicrafts, Social Economy and Solidarity, Morocco’s handmade exports have increased notably. Brassware tops the list of artisan exports; demand abroad multiplied by 7.4 compared to the amount shipped in 2017. Pottery and stone also performed well. The jewelry industry posted a 99 percent increase in exports, followed directly by wood and wrought-iron sectors, whose sales rose by 82 percent. Exports of traditional carpets and clothing increased by 19 percent and 9 percent, respectively. The primary importers Moroccan handmade products are European countries. Italy imported the largest volume of artisan products, followed by Belgium. Handmade exports to the United States grew by 32 percent, which together with Arab countries accounted for 65 percent of total handicraft export turnover. The artisan sector is of a great importance to Morocco as it reflects the kingdom’s identity and heritage.  The supervising ministry is deploying efforts to preserve craftsmanship by signing several agreements to promote handicraft products abroad and improving artisans’ working conditions. In 2017, the Ministry of Handicrafts signed three agreements. The first aimed to engage craftsmen in an English training program to improve their communication and the sale of their products. The supervising ministry signed the agreement with the American Embassy and the American Language Center. The second agreement signed by representatives from a number of Moroccan and American organizations aims to improve the quality of Moroccan handicrafts, the attractiveness of artisan products in the US market and matching handicraft products to contemporary trends. The third agreement reflects the ministry’s desire to preserve Moroccan heritage, especially carpet-making. The supervising ministry signed an agreement with the National Museum Foundation to launch a carpet museum in Marrakech. In June 2018, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani received a delegation of the national trade unions who requested the expansion of health coverage to cover craftsmen, who constitute a large number of Moroccans. The request is still being examined.

Rabat- Centrale Danone will announce new milk prices next month based on consumers’ recommendations in its “Ntwaslou w Nwaslou” campaign. After hosting consultations with consumers, the boycotted dairy company is undergoing the voting phase of its campaign, called Ntwaslou w Nwaslou (we communicate and proceed). Consumers get to vote on the dairy company’s new prices on the campaign’s electronic platform, based on certain criteria.  Prices depend on the types of vitamins added to the milk, on the time of year, and on the design of the milk container. 
Centrale Danone announced August 18 that the proposals and votes on the platform will determine the alternative prices of milk. The voting phase is scheduled from August 22 to September 2. The company had mobilized 1,000 employees to meet consumers and grocers in cities across Morocco—Marrakech, Casablanca, Rabat, Meknes, and Agadir—to listen and discuss consumers’ proposals. The campaign received more than 700 proposals since its launch on August 1 until August 15. The campaign’s aim is find a compromise on price in response to the purchasing power of consumers and boycotters’ demands. The move follows a major boycott that has targeted Centrale Danone and two other companies, Afriquia gasoline and Sidi Ali mineral water since April 20 over high prices. Several government officials, including Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid, have tried to persuade boycotters into ending the campaign because they say it threatens the country’s economy and the jobs of dairy farmers.

As expected, Renard has selected most of the players who competed in the 2018 World Cup, such as Nordin Amrabat, Hakim Ziyech, Achraf Hakimi, M’barek Boussoufa, and Younes Belhanda. However, the absence of the captain of the national team, Mehdi Benatia, from the list is raising questions regarding his future with the national team. The same goes for the notable absence of Celta Vigo’s new player Sofiane Boufal.  Noussair Mazraoui will officially make his debut under the Moroccan jersey. The Moroccan-Dutch player has finally made his choice by agreeing to play for Morocco instead of the Netherlands.  Mazraoui is one of the new faces recruited by Herve Renard, as well as Nayef Aguerd, former defender of the FUS club in Rabat who transferred this summer to Dijon and Amien club’s Oualid El Hajjam.

Rabat – The Economist has recognized Morocco’s growing investments in alternative and sustainable energy sources. According to the British newspaper, the North African kingdom is among the world’s top three countries with expanding solar energy production capability, indicating that Morocco’s energy policy is rapidly evolving to sustainability level and may become a global leader in coming years. While countries like the US, China, Japan, Spain, and France retain their leadership positions in terms of solar energy production, Morocco has risen through the ranks for solar energy-focused projects.  Morocco is home to 3 of the world’s 100 solar energy plants, the British newspaper noted. Most importantly, perhaps, the country currently hosts some of the largest CSP (Concentrated Solar Power) and CSH (Concentrated Solar Heat) projects in the world. Although CSP and CSH plants are primarily used for industrial purposes, Morocco has invested in them in recent years to facilitate domestic usage of its solar energy supply.  The Economist also found that Morocco’s expanding alternative energy sector has numerous socio-economic advantages, especially as it helps the country attain the increasingly preferred “smart energy” model for the digitized world.  The model promotes sustainable and efficient use of energy sources, while improving general health by reducing carbon dioxide levels. The Economist’s analysis of Morocco’s expanding solar energy system adds to the plaudits that the kingdom’s efforts have received in recent months.  In June, the World Bank injected $25 million in Morocco’s solar energy sector to help the completion of the Noor Midelt project in Ouarazazate, southern Morocco. Operating as a hybrid solar power plant(a combination of CSH and CSP energies), the project aims to produce 2,000 megawatts by 2020. The plant is managed by the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN) as part of Morocco’s Noor Solar Plan, which is the leading solar energy project in the MENA region. Morocco, now a regional pioneer in the field of sustainable and efficient energy sources, has exported its solar energy expertise to a number of other African countries, including Mali and Guinea, where Moroccan teams are designing national policies for sustainable energy production. “This project [Noor Midelt] confirms Morocco’s role as a regional pioneer in renewable energy,” said Marie Francoise Marie-Nelly, the World Bank’s country director for Malta and the MENA region.

Rabat- Increasing tension between the PPS and PJD parties after the sudden dissolution of the Secretariat of State in Charge of Water has led to an emergency meeting. The secretary-general of the Progress and Socialism Party (PPS), Nabil Benabdellah, was not pleased with the sacking of the secretariat of water without being informed beforehand. He criticized Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani for the action. El Othmani, the chairman of the Justice and Development Party (PJD), had recommended that King Mohammed VI remove the secretariat headed by PPS member Charafat Afilal. The decision was allegedly taken to improve the management of water-related projects in the kingdom, according to a communique from the Royal Palace released on August 20. On Monday afternoon, in the presence of the human rights minister, Mustapha Ramid, the two ruling parties met to discuss the move and find a mutual solution to the rising conflict.  Benabdellah told Moroccan news outlet Le 360 in a statement: “The meeting with El Othmani lasted for more than an hour. [PJD] was direct and we also expressed our stand in the recent shifts affecting the partnership” between PJD and PPS.  PPS, which enjoyed excellent terms with PJD during the previous Abdelilah Benkirane government, will soon reveal its decision on the issue, in line with the meeting. The socialist PPS and the moderate Islamist PJD have been in a ruling coalition since 2011, following Morocco’s constitutional reforms when PJD won the majority of votes in the parliament. The removal of Charafat Afilal and her department was another surprise move after the sacking of the minister of economy and finance, Mohamed Boussaid, of the National Rally of Independents (RNI) party.  The King appointed Mohamed Benchaaboun, another RNI member, to replace Boussaid, at the proposal of El Othmani.

Rabat – Several parents of suspects arrested for kidnapping and raping Khadija, a 17-year-old, have given their side of the story.  In an interview with news outlet Soltana, the mother of two suspects—Mohammed and Radouane—in the rape case, asserted that the teenager’s story is far from the truth.  The story of the young girl’s ordeal in Oulad Ayad, a small town near Beni Mellal in central Morocco, had made the headlines, stirring up controversy on social media.  In an interview with Chouf TV, the young lady recounted her version of the story, explaining that she was at her aunt’s house when she was kidnapped in front of the house.  She recounted that the men who took her raped her first before holding her captive in a house where she was handed over to other men for money. “She has a bad reputation in Oulad Ayad, everyone knows that she drinks, she smokes, and she even burns herself with her cigarettes,” said the mother. She also claimed Khadija was the one who asked for the tattoos and they were not forced on her by anyone.  In addition, the mother claimed that the girl was forced by her own mother, who is a prostitute, to do the same. Khadija “was always saying that once she will be done with the single boys she will hit on the married ones.”  “If she was really a victim, she would have taken my sons to the police station and I would have defended her myself. She wanted this, she was always knocking on my door asking if my son was home.”  The father of another suspect explained that Khadija’s father, who knew she had disappeared for two months, did not think of calling the police. “We have authorities in our region, he should have filed a complaint. I can’t understand why he kept silent while his daughter was missing for two months.”  Concerning the tattoos, the suspect’s father claimed that Khadija was tattooed by a tattoo artist. He said that she had been tattooed for a long time.  In addition, the families of the alleged perpetrators claimed that the victim was encouraged by associations to make the accusations.  Khadija explained that she tried to escape several times, but each time she was caught and tortured. “They didn’t give me food or drink, and I was not even allowed to take a shower.” Following her statement, Moroccans have addressed a Change.org petition to King Mohammed VI and public authorities to restore Khadija’s dignity. The hashtag #JusticePourKhadija (Justice for Khadija) was also created by social media users in support of the victim.  Affected by Khadija’s story, a Moroccan-Tunisian professional tattoo artist decided to help Khadija remove the tattoos inflicted by her alleged torturers. Police have arrested nine of the alleged perpetrators and are currently searching for other abusers.

Rabat – It appears that Morocco will not be the only African nation to bid for the hosting rights of the 2030 World Cup. Cameroonian presidential candidate Joshua Osih’s political program includes nominating his country along with two sub-Saharan African countries to host the 2030 World Cup, according to Cameroonian channel CRTV. The candidate is determined to make his country one of the bidding countries for the 2030 World Cup. Cameroon will host one of Africa’s biggest sporting events in 2019, the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). Officials appeared to have taken to heart Infantino’s statement regarding potential bids for the 2030 World Cup. FIFA President Gianni Infantino told press after the end of the 2026 World Cup bidding process that he prefers joint bids. Morocco lost its fifth attempt to host the tournament in June to “United 2026,” a joint bid between the US, Mexico, and Canada. Morocco, however, is not giving up on its World Cup dream. Immediately after its defeat, the North African country announced its intention to submit a new candidature to FIFA. A joint Maghreb bid has been highly discussed in the media, especially in Tunisia and Algeria as both countries have pledged to study the possibility of a joint bid between Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Earlier this month, the president of the Algerian Football Federation, Kheireddine Zetchi,  said that he would submit an official request on the bid to Algerian Minister of Youth and Sports Mohamed Hattab.
 However, speculations are rife that Morocco would prefer to bid with its hispanic neighbors, Portugal and Spain. Moroccan media reported last week that the country has asked Spain and Portugal to form a trio to host the World Cup. Al Youm 24 news outlet reported that sporting officials from the three football federations have met several times in recent months, adding that the idea has already been drafted. The trio’s decision is set to be officially announced in the coming weeks, the news outlet asserted. Several countries have shown an interest in bidding to host the global tournament, including England and a joint bid from South America: Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay. The South Americans plan to campaign on the notion that Uruguay, which hosted the first World Cup in 1930, should be given the right to host the tournament on its 100th anniversary. Whether it is bidding solo or with two other countries, Morocco believes that it will have a chance to host the World Cup. “Morocco will bid to host the World Cup in 2030—there is no doubt about that. But we have not yet decided on the co-hosts. The decision will be politically discussed,” said Fouzi Lekjaa, the president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) when asked if Morocco would bid with Algeria and Tunisia.

Rabat – Djamel Ouled Abbes has claimed Morocco is “flooding” Algeria with drugs, repeating his government’s accusations of Moroccan drug trafficking. The secretary general of Algeria’s National Liberation Front (FLN), Djamel Ouled Abbes, claimed that Morocco brings “enormous quantities of drugs into the Algerian territory.” He added that his country faces “many dangerous challenges. Among the challenges mentioned by the President of the Republic is what is happening in the country currently with drugs. Our neighbors to the west, may God forgive them, and I do not think he can forgive them, are flooding us with drugs.” The official’s statements were reported by Algerian news outlet TSA. Djamel, according to the news website, made his remarks on the sidelines of a meeting of his party’s political office on Monday, August 27. It is not the first time Ould Abbes has accused Morocco of drug trafficking. In February, the Algerian official said that “Algeria is targeted by tons of drugs dumped at its borders,” and “These drugs are more murderous than missiles or bombs.” Moroccan authorities have not yet responded to the latest accusation. Irony While Algeria is blames Morocco for drug issues, Morocco has called for more cooperation from Algeria to curb drug trafficking at borders, including in the Sahel region. The head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) has repeatedly called for a security partnership with Algeria as the border needs more security and stability. Ouled Abbes’ accustation appear to be an attempt to take revenge on Morocco as the kingdom has repeatedly accused its eastern neighbor of causing the conflict over Western Sahara. Ouled Abbes’ statement came two weeks after his remarks on the conflict, in which he reaffirmed his country’s refusal to take part in the UN-led political process to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. “Algeria, whose support for the Sahrawi cause is unwavering and non-negotiable, again reaffirms that it has nothing to do with the direct negotiations that the Security Council called for the end of this year between the Polisario Front and the Kingdom of Morocco,” he said on August 15. Drug accusations? Not the first time Ouled Abbes’s statement echoed claims made by Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel in October 2017.  Messahel accused Moroccan banks and airlines of transporting and selling cannabis. He also accused Morocco of “laundering drug money in sub-Saharan Africa.” In response to the accusations, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has summoned the chargé d’affaires at the Algerian embassy to condemn Messahel’s remarks. Moroccan officials described Algeria’s statements as “childish and irresponsible,” especially as they were made by a chief diplomat whose duty is to represent his country’s position internationally. “These unfounded statements will not harm the credibility nor the success of the cooperation between Morocco and the African countries, which is largely saluted by the African heads of states and appreciated by the populations of the continent,” said the statement of the Moroccan ministry. The ministry also linked Algeria’s stance with the “serious economic, political and social problems” the country has been facing recently and were made to hide Algeria’s “failures.” What about Algerian psychotropic tablets? For years, Morocco has complained of high numbers of psychotropic tablets from Algeria that authorities have seized. In 2017, Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) announced that seizures of psychotropic pills from Algeria “witnessed a very alarming rise over the past years.” DGSN said that a total of 808,022 psychotropic pills were confiscated in 2016, compared to 260,152 in 2015 and 293,282 in 2014. Authorities noted that some of the seized pills were brands such as Rivotril and Valium. Another hazardous brand, which is growing in the illegal drug market is “ecstasy.” Quoting Media 24’s police sources, the state-owned news agency said , “Despite the smashing of international criminal organizations for ecstasy trafficking and smuggling into Morocco, the number of seized pills grew by 5,000 percent in record time between 2014 and the first nine months of 2017.”

Rabat – Ambassador Nathan Sales, US Coordinator for Counterterrorism, is traveling to Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco to discuss counterterrorism issues. Sales will “engage in bilateral discussions with his counterparts on countering violent extremism, foreign terrorist fighters, and information sharing,” the State Department said in a media note on Monday, August 27. Sales’s official visit to the three countries began August 26 and continues until August 30, the US State Department said. Sales has led the State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau since August 2017 and serves as the principal adviser to the US secretary of state on international counterterrorism matters. In January 2018, the US Department of Defense gave Morocco arms equipment worth $18 million to reinforce the country’s special forces units combating terrorism, in light of the threat ISIS poses to North African countries. The US allocated $60 million as part of the Pentagon’s security assistance to allies in the MENA region. ‘Morocco is a stable, security-exporting partner’ The State Department lauded Morocco’s efforts to counter terrorism and its strategy to prevent violent extremism. In December 2017, the State Department published an analysis in its official blog “DipNote” which stated, “The United States and the Kingdom of Morocco are leading a global effort to address homegrown terrorism.” According to a 2016 report by the State Department on terrorism in the MENA region, “Morocco is a stable security-exporting partner in North Africa and is the only African nation to contribute military assets to the Defeat-ISIS Coalition campaign in Syria and Iraq.” Morocco’s counterterrorism efforts “effectively mitigated the risk of terrorism” in 2016, according to the same report. The State Department also praised the efficiency of Moroccan law enforcement units and the kingdom’s interventions which “aggressively targeted and effectively dismantled terrorist cells within the country by leveraging intelligence collection, police work, and collaboration with regional and international partners.”

Rabat – Morocco and India are working on a joint social register to curtail inequalities and social disparities. According to the World Bank, Morocco and India launched the India-Morocco Social Register cooperation on Monday, August 27.  Ferid Belhaj, the World Bank vice president for the MENA region, who is currently on a three-day visit to Morocco, attended the launch. Promoting inclusive economic growth, improving education quality, facilitating access to health programs, and implementing more effective social protection programs are among the project’s top priorities, the World Bank noted. Following his meeting yesterday with the new Moroccan minister of economy, Mohamed Benchaaboun, Belhaj also took part in the signing of a memorandum of understanding between Morocco’s Ministry of Interior and India’s Bangalore-based Institute of Technology. The memorandum is expected to cement institutional ties between the two countries, with the goal of using common digital tools to identify and meet the needs of their respective populations. Based on the World Bank’s Identification for Development (ID4D) program, the joint Morocco-India social register initiative will have Bangalore’s Institute of Technology cooperate with Morocco’s interior ministry to identify the needs and aspirations of the countries’ most marginalized families and regions.  According to government sources from the two countries, the project is part of a World Bank-backed initiative to boost social equality and promote an inclusive growth model. The overall plan is to improve living conditions for traditionally marginalized populations. The World Bank, which will help finance the $100 million project, has declared that the project will be a platform to “facilitate South-South cooperation,” especially in expertise sharing and poverty reduction. The project will be operational in 2020, and according to Moroccan authorities, its implementation is a priority for the Moroccan government because it reflects the driving spirit of King Mohammed VI’s society and inclusive growth-oriented Throne Day speech. “I view the new initiative to set up a ‘consolidated social register’ as a promising start for the gradual improvement of social welfare programs over the short and medium terms. This is a national registration system to identify families that truly deserve to benefit from social assistance programs,” the King said.  The King added that new technology would be used to identify and cater to the needs of marginalized sections of Moroccan society.

Rabat – France’s Bordeaux is trying its luck with the Atlas Lions’ coach, Herve Renard.  After Bordeaux’s attempted recruitment of former French champion Thierry Henry was shot down, the Girondins are in desperate need of a new coach.  According to AFP, the French coach was one of the potential names contacted by Bordeaux to to succeed Gustavo Poyet, whose official dismissal should be announced Tuesday afternoon.  Will Renard be interested in the offer? A few months before the World Cup, during an interview with the Telefoot show, the former Lille coach expressed his desire to return to the French league, showing an interest in Saint-Etienne.  However, the 49-year-old has already said he is committed to the kingdom. Two months ago, on his flight back home from Russia to Morocco, the Atlas Lions’ coach agreed to answer 2M’s questions about his future, saying that he has a contract with the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) until 2022. Renard has reiterated his commitment on social media, saying that out of respect for Morocco, he would not leave for another African nation regardless of the offer. However, he did not say anything about a possible return to France.  The Frenchman is Africa’s highest-paid head coach with a monthly wage of MAD 800,000. According to FRMF sources, a breach of contract would come with a release clause of MAD 40 million. Renard previously coached Côte d’Ivoire and Zambia, and has been rumored to have offers from both Algeria and Egypt.

Rabat – In terms of human development potential, Morocco is a nation of immense promise.  It is where gifted fortunes of nature (including agricultural) come together with dynamic social development Frameworks that could launch the country into a bottom-up haven in Africa and the Near East of community-managed projects and change. Sadly, however, for the majority of people, the application of the country’s combined initiatives for development is not seeming consequential.  The problem is that Morocco’s programs for national growth and development through people’s participation are not being orchestrated together. Integrating these programs would enable their mutual reinforcement to promote accelerated growth and success of development initiatives. Commenting on the calls in Morocco, publicly by King Mohammed VI, that the nation must now reconsider its development model: I submit that it is specifically the model to implement the nation’s development model that requires the major reevaluation and overhaul. These Moroccan Frameworks–among others, including those that intend to advance women’s and youth empowerment–set out to structurally guide local and national growth:
1) The Municipal Charter, amended in 2010, requires the creation of multi-year community development plans that are formed by people’s participation;
2) The National Initiative for Human Development was launched in 2005 to provide access to sub-nationally managed funding for multidimensional development projects; and
3) The Decentralization Roadmap, first unveiled in 2008, innovatively synthesizes three pathways–delegation, deconcentration, and devolution–to empower regions in development; How can the three Frameworks better fulfill their individual purposes, and how can they relate with each other to create human development that is sustained by the local beneficiaries? The first Framework, the Municipal Charter, requires locally elected representatives to assist participatory community planning in the determination of projects.  This could and should be a major pathway for sustainable development to take hold, due to the fact that people’s participation (along with finance) is the key factor of sustainability. Further, people-driven projects, instituted in the Municipal Charter, are necessary for sustainable development and actualization of the other Frameworks that compose the Moroccan model.  However, in Morocco there is a constant challenge: elected members to municipal councils are typically not trained in facilitating participatory methods. Catalyzing widespread, inclusive development projects, means first implementing experiential training programs for university students, school teachers, technicians, civil society members, elected officials, and local people, for example, to be active agents of participatory development. Through training-by-doing, the aforementioned municipal development plans can then reflect the actual will of the people in regards to the projects and future they most want. The second Framework, Morocco’s National Initiative for Human Development, is a national fund for infrastructure projects, capacity-building, social and cultural revitalization, and job generating activities on sub-national levels. This fund should include a multi-billion-dollar budget over five years for participatory planning training and community-identified projects. The NIHD should primarily help actualize the development projects designed according to the Municipal Charter.  Indeed, the NIHD and the Municipal Charter can only be successful if they work in tandem.  NIHD should help fund the participatory development plans embodied in the Charter, and finance projects that local people expressed they most need and want to implement. Third, the “Roadmap” of Moroccan decentralization–taken from the public statements of the King of Morocco since 2008–aims to utilize ongoing national level engagement (devolution) along with sub-national partnerships (deconcentration), to help implement community projects (delegation).  In other words, the Moroccan pathway aims to rally national resources and partnerships for local development, which in principle is good for the sake of sustainability. Without the Municipal Charter and the NIHD working together, however, adequate decentralized arrangements of public administrations will not be enduring.  Overall in Morocco, decentralization is not significantly taking hold, which further adds to the suppression of new local development. The national level still generally decides the parameters, terms, cases, and situations for sub-regional actions. As far as destabilizing political outcomes that may be a concern and caused by decentralization, as described in international cases, the following seems clear in regards to the Moroccan case, certainly based on my experience: the entire emphasis of people during community-based discussions centers on livelihoods and meeting immediate human needs. I have observed no basis for concerns that stem beyond these developmental factors. Understandably, executing decentralization, particularly in regards to its pace, is a delicate process.  The local level is stratified socio-economically, environmentally, and in regards to gender just as it is on the societal level and globally.  Advancing decentralization quickly can be fraught with unhelpful consequences, such as entrenching further the locally affluent and political classes. However, genuine implementation of the Municipal Charter in close conjunction with the NIHD could create the needed participatory democratic conditions which would enable Morocco to eventually opt for an emerging form of communalization–or decentralized management to the municipal level. The Moroccan Frameworks for development bear essentially what are needed in order for sustainable development for marginalized areas and groups to be catalyzed with enduring results.  The Municipal Charter could provide the plans for projects that the NIHD may then help accomplish.  Decentralized arrangements are subsequently built in that wake of community project implementation that involves multi-sectoral partnership. Moroccan agriculture, with its enormous income-generating and environmental-enhancing potential, can and should be the engine for self-reliant financing of the people’s projects.  Agriculture projects may also become identified and determined through the process of implementing the mandates of the Municipal Charter. It is not the insufficiency of these Frameworks that accounts for the hardships that afflict Moroccan people, especially in rural areas.  It is their inadequate implementation stemming from a considerable lack of their popular understanding and the skills that are needed in order to translate them into reality.  I have found that all that is needed is to give men and women of all ages the chance to come together for community workshops that if followed through can ultimately deliver the projects that they and their families have hoped for far too long.

Rabat – Despite previous tension between ferry companies and Moroccan expatriates, Tangier Port registered a new number of vacationers who spent their holiday in Morocco in 2018. As of August 25, Tangier-Med Port Authority said that a total of 842,698 passengers have entered Morocco through Tangier-Med since the launch of the “Marhaba” operation on June 5. During the same period, 371,861 passengers, 118,579 vehicles and 1,695 buses left Morocco through the same port. Authorities at the port, a veritable gateway to Africa and Europe, received 33,091 travelers on July 29 alone. Many  Moroccans living in Europe entered Morocco in late July and early August to spend Eid al-Adha with their families. Morocco celebrated Eid al-Adha, the festival of sacrifice, on August 22. Throughout the Marhaba operation, the government’s project to welcome home Moroccan expatriates for the summer, many Moroccan expats protested expensive ticket prices for the ferry between Morocco and Spain. In response, Morocco’s Ministry of Equipment, Transport, and Logistics negotiated with ferry companies to reduce ticket prices for the ferry between Tangier and Tarifa and between Tangier-Med and Algeciras. In July, Secretary of State for Transport Mohamed Najib Boulif shared a statement from the ministry showing ticket prices for each crossing point on Facebook. The official also said that the ministry was closely monitoring the situation and communicating with the ferry companies. Tangier-Med Port has established itself as the 1st in Africa, owing to its notable performance this year. Tangier’s two container terminals handled 1,668,566 containers in the first six months of 2018. A port statement shared in July announced that 252,194 cars were handled in both terminals during the first six months of 2018, representing an increase of 18 percent compared to the first half of 2017. Last week, news outlet Le Point Afrique reported that each year the port exports 1 million vehicles, 7 million passengers, and 700,000 trucks. The African outlet emphasized that the port should keep its African leadership “in the years to come.”

Rabat- A former boxer, Tarik Sahibbedine, took down a violent passenger threatening to hijack a Lufthansa plane. Sahibbedine recounted the story to his friend, Arnaud Romera, a sports journalist, who was the first to share it on social media:

It all started Friday, August 24, on a Lufthansa flight from Munich to Paris when a passenger threw an angry tantrum. The passenger became aggressive with a flight attendant who refused to serve him any more alcohol, and the 46-year-old French-Moroccan knew that it was time to intervene to save the plane’s 200 passengers. First, Sahibbedine tried to talk the angry passenger into calming down, pulling the curtains at the front of the plane to prevent passengers from panicking. However, the situation nearly got out of hand. The boxer noted to news outlets France Info and le Parisien that the aggressive passenger, who appeared to be in his 20s, had the attitude of a mentally unstable man. The aggressor, threatening to open the cabin door and hijack the plane, was about to attack the cockpit when the boxer tackled him to the ground. Other passengers joined in the effort and immobilized the young man. “I didn’t have time to be afraid…. I told him if you move, I’ll break your jaw,” Sahibbedine stated. Following the incident, French police reportedly sent the passenger to undergo a psychiatric test as part of their investigation.

Rabat – The Moroccan movie “Sofia,” produced by Moroccan director Meryem Ben M’barek, has found its public in France.  The feature movie won, on Sunday, August 26; the “Valois” for best scenario at the Angoulême Francophone Film Festival held in southwest France), from August 21-26.  The award is not Ben M’barek’s first distinction. In May, “Sofia” received the Cannes Festival’s Screenwriting Award.  “Sofia” is Meryem Ben M’Barek’s first feature film. Her short film “Jennah,” her thesis project at INSAS in Brussels, won the 2014 Grand Prize at the Rhode Island International Film Festival. Starred by Maha Alami, the cast includes Sara Elmhamdi Elalaoui (“Much Loved”), Sarah Perles (“Burnout” by Nour-Eddine Lakmari), Hamza Khafif, Lubna Azabal (“Exiles” and “Paradise Now”), Faouzi Bensaidi (“The Blissful”), Nadia Niazi, and Said Bey. Ben M’Barek’s script tells the story of a single mother desperately searching for the father of her unborn child to avoid being reported to the authorities by the hospital. However, the objective of the film is not to discover the identity of the father but to show “the pressure imposed by a society that cannot comprehend a birth without a husband,” as Ben M’Barek explained in a statement. The film “Sofia,” a French-Qatari-Moroccan production, in which the lead role is played by the actress Maha Alami, will be released in cinemas in France on September 5. The “Diamond Valois,” the highest distinction of the Francophone Film Festival, was won by the film “Sheherazade,” the first feature film by French director Jean-Bernard Marlin. Created by producers Marie-France Briere and Dominique Besnehard, the FFA defends a popular and subtle cinema and honors the francophone and French films of today, those of the past, and also the talents of tomorrow.

Rabat – Following the cholera epidemic in Algeria, Morocco’s Ministry of Health has taken precautions to protect its eastern borders with Algeria. A ministerial committee belonging to the Directorate of Epidemiology arrived this weekend in the eastern region of Morocco, an official from the health ministry told Akhbar Al Yaoum yesterday. The eastern region is the most vulnerable region due to its geographical proximity to Algeria. Algerian authorities confirmed 41 cholera cases and the death of one infected patient on Thursday, August 23. However, by Friday, a second person had died because of the epidemic.  According to the Algerian health ministry, at least 46 cases have been confirmed as cholera out of 139 hospitalizations across Algeria since August 7. Morocco’s ministerial committee urged the health authorities in the region to monitor patients who show symptoms similar to cholera symptoms, according to the daily newspaper. The committee also distributed a scientific guide to contain the epidemic before its emergence. Low chance of cholera in Morocco  “Until now, there is little concern for cholera in Morocco and the possibility of the epidemic spreading to the Moroccan border remains little,” said the health ministry official quoted by Akhbar Al Yaoum. “Morocco has not registered any [cholera] case for 20 years since epidemiological surveillance procedures have become routine.” The eastern region is known for the smuggling of goods between both Morocco and Algeria’s border, which has been closed since 1994. However, smuggling activities do not present health dangers as cholera is transmitted through contaminated water, such as wastewater, or food. The same official stated that food contamination is not a matter of concern since irrigation using wastewater has not been used in the eastern region for many years. “The control over irrigation waters, water wells, and irrigated agricultural fields will be enhanced to exclude any possibility of the arrival of the disease to Morocco,” he added. Statement from Morocco’s health ministry “No case of cholera has been recorded in Morocco,” the Moroccan Ministry of Health said on Tuesday, August 28. The ministry said it has taken preventive measures through the reinforcement of epidemiological surveillance, and sanitary control measures at the border level, particularly at airports receiving passengers from countries where cholera cases have been reported. The measures also included support for hospital laboratories in the microbiological investigation and the deployment of drugs and equipment necessary for the treatment of cholera cases. The ministry provided citizens with a telephone number, 0801004747, to contact for more information.

Rabat- The Prosecutor General’s Office has urged prosecutors to be strict with the increasing numbers of toll road violators. Morocco records 5,000 cases of drivers avoiding tolls daily. Due to the growing numbers of toll violations, Mohammed Abdennabaoui, president of the Prosecutor General’s Office, has given instructions not to tolerate the phenomenon. In an official statement, Abdennabaoui wrote that failing to pay road tolls causes major losses to the country’s revenue and hinders traffic flow, leading to accidents at toll stations. Abdennabaoui reminded the public that toll road violations are “a first degree offence that is punishable by a fine ranging from MAD 700 to 1,400 according to Article 184 of Traffic Law 52.05.” He called  for the law to be implemented strictly. “Due to these widespread violations and the different harms they cause, I urge you to pay thorough attention to the complaints that the National Motorway Company presents concerning the issue, and to stress on the judicial police to immediately open relevant investigations,” he stated, addressing the King’s prosecutors.

Rabat – Why has the government not yet implemented February’s Law 103-13 against gender-based discrimination, set to go into effect in August? After a month of delay, the awaited law criminalizing public harassment and all forms of violence, including sexual assault, will be put into force on September 12. The government pledged to begin enforcing the law in August after publishing a final draft of the law six months ago, on February 22. Sources told Moroccan business news outlets L’Economiste that the law will be implemented in September. A series of publicized rapes Moroccan activists and feminists questioned the existence of a law that criminalizes violence against women, especially after the publicization of several rape cases and violent incidents. The most recent infamous rape case was publicized Friday night, when police arrested three suspects for violence against three women. Two of the women filed complaints against the suspects, saying that they and a friend were attacked. The two women said that they managed to escape but their friend was kidnapped. After being rescued, the victim told the police that she was raped. Another alleged rape of a 17-year old girl also sparked outrage on social media last week. The victim, named Khadija, told Chouf TV how she was kidnapped and raped for two months. Her alleged rapists also tattooed her body against her will, writing their names on her skin. Bouchra Abdou, an activist, feminist, and president of Tahadi Center, commented on the law, telling Morocco World News that she did not “really understand what the delay was about.” She said that the law should have been used in Moroccan courts beginning in August. She added that there is no problem if it is delayed until September as the most “important” thing is that the law will be “finally” put into force. She added that now is the time for associations and NGOsto put pressure on the government to implement the law in September. Summary of the law NGOs and associations have decried the light sentences given to defendants charged with violence, rape, or sexual harassment for many years. In April, Morocco World News received an unofficial English translation of the law’s text from the international non-profit women’s rights organization, Mobilising for Rights Associates. The law includes articles dictating the punishment that perpetrators of violence will receive if found guilty. Those who sexually harass in public spaces, by use of words, acts, or signals of sexual nature for sexual purposes, will face prison sentences ranging from one to six months, as well as a fine ranging from MAD 2,000 to 10,000. Punishable cybercrimes include broadcasting or disseminating a combination of false allegations, statements, or pictures that seek to harm an individual’s private life or reputation “without prior approval.” Cybercrime perpetrators will face  one to three years in prison and a fine ranging from MAD 1,000 to 20,000 if found guilty “by any means whatsoever.”  Commenting on the law after its adoption, Minister of Family, Solidarity, and Equality Bassima Hakkaoui said it “is part of an ongoing process to strengthen democracy and achieve parity, in accordance with the provisions of the constitution aimed at combating all forms of gender-based discrimination.” The law will also include the establishment of a regional committee for female victims of violence at the level of the judicial district of each court of appeal. The committee should include a prosecutor or his deputy, investigating judge, social assistance, and a lawyer, in accordance with Article 13 of the law. The committee’s tasks include: “Ensuring communication and coordination between judicial authorities and other sectors and administrations concerned with issues relating to the support of female victims of violence at the regional level.” The committee will also define the “constraints” and “obstacles” hampering the “process of support provided for female victims of violence” and suggest “appropriate solutions thereto on a participatory basis and according to the competence of each relevant sector.”

Rabat – The French Authorities are keeping an eye on Saad Lamjarred. The Moroccan singer must stay 24 more hours in custody, according to AFP. The 32-year-old artist was arrested on Sunday morning in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France after police received a new rape complaint from another alleged victim.  According to AFP, the rape was alleged to have been committed in a Saint-Tropez establishment Saturday night. Police conducted an investigation following a complaint by a woman for “facts characterized rape.” The public prosecutor’s office referred to “a complex affair” which took place “in the context of a meeting in a nightclub” with “two diametrically opposed versions [which] collide,” requiring “the continuation of investigations and the hearing of any useful witness.” Laura Prioul, who is currently pursuing a court case against Lamjarred for rape, reacted to the news on her Facebook page in support of the “new victim” and denouncing the lack of justice in the Lamjarred case. “I support with all my heart this new victim who wouldn’t have lived this drama if the justice was tougher,” she wrote.  According to French outlet Var le Matin, the woman who accused the singer of “Casablanca” is a 29-year-old seasonal worker in Saint-Tropez.  Lamjarred’s criminal case  Lamjarred’s previous rape charges are not helping him prove his innocence. Bachir Abdou’s son was arrested on October 26, 2016, for the sexual assault of Laura Prioul. The trial has not yet commenced. French authorities temporarily released the artist on bail under electronic surveillance on April 13, 2017, after he spent nearly six months at the Marriott Champs Elysées in Paris pending his trial. Lamjarred also faced a rape charge in the United States. A woman told the American daily, New York Post in May 2016 that the Moroccan singer sexually assaulted her in a New York apartment in 2010. The prosecutor later dropped the charges when the alleged victim withdrew her story, reportedly due to a settlement.

Rabat – Tunisia’s Islamic Ennahda party has said that religion should not lose its central place in Tunisia, criticizing a  proposed inheritance equality law.  “I propose equality inheritance to become law,” Tunisia’s progressive president, Beji Caid Essebi, announced earlier this month.  And while Ennahda gave a supportive nod to the president’s proposal at the time of the announcement, the party, which is a central part of the country’s incumbent government coalition, has altered its position on some specifics of the proposed law.  Possibly giving in to the pressures of its conservative base which has been heavily critical of President Essebi’s proposal, Ennahda has argued lately that the constitution should not challenge norms and traditions dictated by the Qur’an. “We will fight for women’s inheritance rights because women are still discriminated against in Tunisia,” said Abdelkarim Harouni, president of Ennahda’s parliamentary group on Sunday, August 26. Harouni stressed, however, that changes to the country’s current inheritance law should be made “in line with the constitution,” which he said is in accordance with the Qur’an and Islamic prescriptions.  “We reject any project that stands in contradiction with the constitution and the categorical texts of the Qur’an.” In a subsequent interview with AFP, Harouni explained that the party is waiting for the final draft of the proposed law to adopt a final position. He nonetheless remained resolute in his belief about the central role of Islam, arguing that religion should play an important part in regulating norms and mores of Tunisian society.  The country’s current Islamic inheritance law gives greater weight to male relatives with equal kinship levels as female relatives. If an individual dies without a will, the deceased’s female relatives, such as daughters and sisters, inherit half of what male relatives with an equal level of kinship, such as sons and brothers, inherit. Last year, Tunisia made another landmark move in male-female relations by allowing Tunisian women to marry non-Muslims, a right previously held by Tunisian men. Should the inheritance equality law receive a majority vote in the parliament, the North African country will consolidate its position as a rising bulwark of liberal or progressive reforms in the Arab-Muslim world.

Rabat – US Senator John McCain, savior of the world’s longest-held POWs—Moroccan soldiers in Tindouf, died on Saturday at the age of 81. “Senator John Sidney McCain III died at 4:28 pm on August 25, 2018. With the Senator when he passed were his wife Cindy and their family. At his death, he had served the United States of America faithfully for sixty years,” the office of Senator John McCain said in a statement. McCain was a prisoner of war (POW) in Vietnam for more than 5 years. During the war in Vietnam, McCain was a bomber pilot, and he was captured when his plane was shot down in 1967. During the Vietnam war, McCain refused to be released from the Hanoi Hilton prison until his fellow prisoners were freed with him. It was an action that showed McCain’s selflessness and heroism in the eyes of many Americans. In 2008, McCain ran for president in the US as a maverick Republican. During McCain’s presidential campaign, he respected his opponent, Barack Obama. One voter told McCain, “I can’t trust Obama… he’s an Arab.” With characteristic integrity, McCain responded, “No ma’am, he’s a decent family man and citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that’s what this campaign’s about.” McCain helped to save more than 400 Moroccan POWs https://twitter.com/TalesDarkSide/status/1033524165586956288 After Morocco reclaimed the Western Sahara territory from Spain in 1975, fighting broke out between the North African country and the Algerian-backed Polisario Front.  Since the beginning of the war between Morocco and Polisario, many POWs were detained until 1991 when both sides agreed to return POWs under a UN-mediated cease-fire. Up to May 2005, the Polisario Front released approximately 903 Moroccan POWs, according to a report by Paris-based rights group France Libertes. However, hundreds of Moroccan POWs remained in the camps. Ali Najab, a pilot who was taken prisoner by Polisario in 1978 and released in 2003, met with a number of US leaders, including Senator McCain. “He was at UN headquarters to give voice to 408 of his countrymen who remained prisoners of war,” the UN said of Najab. “We are not here to talk about politics. We are ordinary people who survived an extraordinary ordeal and hold a responsibility on behalf of our brothers in captivity … victims of ongoing and outrageous violations of international human rights,” Najab said. In 2005, McCain called for the release of more than 400 Moroccans who were still detained by the Polisario Front in Tindouf in western Algeria. “This is a gross violation of international law and a travesty of human rights,” said McCain.  McCain said he sent a letter to the Polisario leadership in which he called the front to release the remaining Moroccan POWs. “I add my voice to this call for an immediate release. I do so in my official capacity but also on a very personal basis, as a former prison of war in Vietnam,” McCain said in his letter, quoted by Edward M. Gabriel, the US ambassador to Morocco between 1997 and 2001. McCain quoted one of the Moroccan POWs in his letter: “I ask the others if I am a human being here or if I am an animal. We are Muslims. We believe in God. We pray. We are not rocks. We are living in this inferno. We are the forgotten victims of this drama. We have our lives to live. I have lost my youth. We have lost our families. Every time we receive letters, someone has died. How long is this going to go on? Please, will somebody notice us.” McCain stated, “Let us hope (the Polisario) can be swayed, not by political pressures or promises, but by what is undeniably just and humane in the eyes of the world community.” On August 18, 2005, Polisario released the Moroccan POWs to the Red Cross. They were later flown to Agadir aboard a US piloted aircraft and were welcomed by King Mohammed VI. The Moroccan POWs detained in violation of the Geneva Conventions since the 1991 cease-fire were believed to be the longest held POWs in the world. Many of the prisoners were held for more than two decades while others were held for nearly 30 years. POWs were held for an average of 17 years.

Rabat – Social media users are seeking justice for Khadija, a 17-year-old girl who was kidnapped, raped, tortured, and tattooed by 10 men in central Morocco. The heartbreaking story of the young girl in Oulad Ayad, a small town near Beni Mellal in central Morocco had made the headlines, stirring up controversy on social media where people decided to support the victim by creating the hashtag #JusticePourKhadija (Justice for Khadija) to denounce the inhuman treatment she suffered.  Since no one has given this poor girl some attention and affection, I’ll give it to her.

Having read her story, Tunisian tattoo artist Fawez Zahmoul, who goes by “Fawez the tattoo artist,” decided to help Khadija get rid of the horrible tattoos inflicted by her torturers. On his Facebook page, the tattoo artist announced Saturday that he managed to contact Khadija’s father to bring her to Tunisia to remove the tattoos from her whole body where her tormentors marked their names and even inscribed the swastika. “She is physically in pain and completely traumatized, we try to find a solution to make her come because the family is very poor and lives in a remote corner in Morocco.They have an interview with Judge next Thursday to try to find a solution,” he wrote.   According to several local media, 1 of the 10 men owned the house where Khadija was being held. After police arrested the men, some managed to escape. In an interview with Chouf TV, the young lady recounted the nightmare she lived, explaining that she was at her aunt’s house when she was kidnapped in front of the house. The men who took her raped her first before holding her captive in a house where she was handed over to other men for money. Khadija tried to escape several times, but each time she was caught and tortured. “They didn’t give me food or drink, and I was not even allowed to take a shower.” “I want justice to be done and [for them] to pay for what they have done to me,” she bravely told reporters. “For how many women who, for fear of this hchouma [shame], continue to keep quiet?” she added.

Rabat- A World Bank statement has announced that its vice-president for the MENA region, Ferid Belhaj, is visiting Morocco from August 27-29. The three-day visit is Belhaj’s first trip to the North African country as the bank’s vice-president for MENA, having been appointed to his post on July 1. According to the World Bank, Belhaj is expected to meet with the Moroccan head of government, Saad Eddine El Othmani. Belhaj will also meet representatives from the Ministry of Economy and Finance, to discuss the country’s fiscal issues.  Also during his visit, the vice-president is expected to meet with non-government actors driving the kingdom’s economy, including CEOs, trade unions, and community organizers. In addition to fiscal and monetary issues, the World Bank official and his various hosts are set to discuss themes like human capital, infrastructure, and new information technologies, which the institution deems essential for inclusive growth and the emergence in Morocco of a society ready to meet the challenges of the digitized world. The World Bank’s statement also praised Morocco’s efforts in terms of fiscal reforms and labor investments. It noted that the kingdom was among the first countries to join and support the World Bank’s Global Human Capital initiative, while promising to support Morocco’s needs to invest in children, health, and education issues. Belhaj’s visit coincides with Morocco’s bid to boost its human capital by increasing investments in quality education and devising a youth-oriented policy to curtail the country’s persisting socio-economic disparities.  Speaking during the anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the People on August 20, Morocco’s King Mohammed VI promised a new government platform and strategies to improve young Moroccans’ living conditions by boosting education and job opportunities and easing the youth’s “engagement in social and professional life.” “We must give our young people what they need in the areas of education, employment, health and so on. More importantly, we must enhance their confidence and give them hope in the future,” the King said.

Rabat – The La Creme Marrakech shooting continues to bring more suspects down. On Sunday, Moroccan authorities arrested two Moroccan-Dutch brothers for their alleged connection with the mafia behind Marrakech’s La Creme shooting, which occurred in November 2017. A new statement by the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that the two are brothers of the mastermind of the criminal act. The press release added that the arrests were made in an area between the northern cities of Oued Laou, Tetouan, and Al Hoceima. The two suspects are also the subject of an international arrest warrant for their alleged involvement in the case, according to the statement. Investigations determined the direct involvement of the two defendants and their participation in “this international homicide.” During the arrest, police seized money, cell phones, computer storage media, and a car. The two defendants were placed in custody pending further investigation to find any additional individuals involved in the crime. Flashback The mafia-related crime instilled fear among Moroccans as shootings are rare in Morocco. The incident made international headlines.  On November 2, two masked individuals shot and killed a 26-year old man at La Creme Cafe in Marrakech. Two others were injured. The shooters then fled the scene on a motorcycle. Authorities caught and arrested the two Dutch shooters who had entered Morocco with tourist visas, claiming that they were interested in exploring the city of Marrakech. The two suspects were targeting the cafe’s owner, but they hit the wrong target, killing a medical student. The cafe owner had reportedly stolen €27 million from a mafia boss’s cocaine shipment, according to Moroccan newspaper Al Massae. Following the incident, a vehicle came to carry the shooters and their motorcycle to a place near Marrakech’s airport, where the motorcycle and murder weapons were found burnt a couple of hours after the shooting. In May, Moroccan media reported that security forces had linked the incident to cocaine dealings between the Dutch mafia and the owner of the cafe. Media also reported that Moroccan authorities allegedly arrest ten senior officers of the royal gendarmerie across several cities, including Marrakech, Tangier, and Tetouan.

Rabat – Footballer Noussair Mazraoui is torn between representing Morocco or the Netherlands.  Courted by both the Moroccan and the Dutch team, the Dutch-Moroccan football player will have to chose soon which colors he wants to wear. The 20-year-old was called by Herve Renard before the 2018 World Cup in Russia, but he was not selected for the team.  Rumored to also be on the French coach’s list of players for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) in Cameroon, the Ajax Amsterdam player is still uncertain about his international future. The Netherlands are similarly trying to pitch Mazraoui the idea to join their national team.  According to De Telegraaf, the Dutch team’s manager, Ronald Koeman, is doing his best to convince the Ajax right-back to choose the Oranjes over the Atlas Lions, speaking with him last Thursday. “Nico-Jan Hoogma [technical director], Mazraoui, his agent and I had a good talk, the four of us. We have indicated what we want and how we see it for us with him. That in the future he will be a serious option for the right back position,” he said.  “One of these days he has to make a choice, because he is probably being called for Morocco. But I do not think a player comes to a conversation and listens to our story if he has already made the choice for Morocco,” he added. However, the footballer has already participated in an internship with the Atlas Lions during his youth, which may increase the chance he will join the Moroccan team.  If the 20-year-old sensation agrees to play with the Atlas Lions, he may face the anger of the Dutch football world just like his Ajax teammate Hakim Ziyech, who was called “stupid” by Dutch football player Marco Van Basten for wearing Morocco’s colors. The 25-year-old midfielder was also considered a traitor for betraying his birthplace while honoring his parents’ homeland.

Rabat – Casablanca’s authorities arrested three suspects for their involvement in kidnapping, violence, and rape on Friday night. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that three people filed complaints against the alleged suspects. The list of complainants includes two women who claimed that they were attacked by the defendants. The two women said that they managed to escape but their friend was kidnapped. Police identified the suspects after an investigation carried out by DGSN staff. Police were also able to rescue the kidnapped victim, who said she was raped by one of the attackers. The defendants were placed in custody, while investigations are ongoing. Recently, Moroccan authorities arrested 10 men involved in kidnapping, raping, torturing, tattooing, and holding capite a 17-year-old in central Morocco. Khadija, the victim, was held captive and subjected to violence for a month. The girl was held in a small town near Beni Mellal and 150 kilometers northeast of Marrakech. Khadija’s story has stirred up outrage and controversy in Morocco, especially among women’s rights associations.   Although 800 cases of rape were reported in Morocco in 2016, 1,600 cases were reported in 2017, according to an annual report issued by the King’s attorney general, Mohamed Abdel Nabawi. In 2017, a total of 17,280 people were arrested on corruption charges, 2,890 for adultery, 5,328 for prostitution, and 2,384 for rape.

Rabat – Morocco’s Human Rights Council has said it was not given a chance to comment on the compulsory military service draft bill before approval. The government council and the ministerial council approved Bill 44.18 on August 20, the 65th anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the People. “The bill was not submitted to [the human rights council] to give its opinion,” the council said in a statement to Moroccan news outlet Lakome. Contrary to some news reports, the council stressed that it had no say in the matter despite Law 76.15 Article 25 on the reorganization of the National Human Rights Council dictates: “The council, on its own will or at the request of the government or one of the houses of parliament, expresses its opinions on human rights-related draft laws and proposals,” if compatible with Morocco’s ratified international treaties. The mandatory military service aims to “inculcate the spirit of citizenship in young people as part of a correlation between the rights and duties of citizenship.”  If the law is passed in Parliament and goes into effect, it will not be the first time Morocco has mandatory military service.  On June 9, 1966, Morocco introduced an 18-month mandatory military service in accordance with Royal Decree 137-66. However, in 2006, King Mohammed VI abolished it. This time, the bill emphasizes that both men and women (aged 19 to 25) should contribute to the defense of the homeland and its territorial integrity. Citizens would complete a 12-month mandatory military service and receive payment at the end of the training period, according to Article 5 in the bill. Any attempt to avoid serving without giving strong justification would be punished with one to three months in prison and a fine of MAD 2,000 to MAD 5,000. The bill has triggered mixed reactions and confusion so far. Moroccan youth with dual nationalities have been wondering whether the law will affect them as well, since the bill did not address binationals.

Rabat – Morocco’s 12-century-old Al Quaraouiyine Library in Fez has made it into Time’s first annual list of the world’s greatest places. Al Quaraouiyine, the world’s oldest still-operating library, is home to some of the world’s most priceless manuscripts from the 9th century, including an old version of Qur’an and one of the earliest collections of hadiths, the sayings of the Prophet Mohammed with accounts of his daily practice. The library is also home to a 12th-century astronomy text and a 14th-century tome on jurisprudence. As part of a restoration project, architects added a temperature-controlled room to the Quaraouiyine Library in 2012 to preserve the most priceless manuscripts. Restorers also built space in the basement where the maintenance of the library’s more fragile pieces can be completed. Located in the heart of the spiritual city of Fez, the library positioned itself as a hub of learning for scholars throughout the centuries.  The library, along with the famous Al Quaraouiyine mosque and university in Fez were founded in 859 AD by Fatima El-Fihriya, the daughter of a rich merchant family who immigrated to Fez from the town of Qayrawan in modern Tunisia. The library underwent restoration and was reopened to the public in May 2016. Quoted by Time, Fez-born architect Aziza Chaouni said that the library is “the soul of the city.” The library, however, was “something of a closed book, open to only scholars,” added Time.  The library reportedly became accessible to domestic and foreign tourists, owing to a “government initiative and a restoration led by Chaouni.” However, foreign tourists report that they are still prevented from entering the library. Chaouni also had the chance to make her touches on the historical site as she was appointed by the Ministry of Culture to restore the library. “It’s probably the thing I’m most proud of,” she says. “The heritage needs to live. It can’t be thought of as this mummy we need to preserve,” Chaouni told CNN in 2017. In April 2017, CNN also released a seven-minute video featuring the history of the library and restoration efforts. CNN was fascinated by every part of the library’s treasures. The video starts with a presentation of the library’s famous door, which is made of copper and has a 16th century security system: four locks. The library is home to 30,000 books and manuscripts.

Rabat – The “Momo Challenge,” a suicide game, is stirring fear in parents globally as it targets teenagers on Snapchat and WhatsApp. The online game starts when unidentified numbers send an invitation via WhatsApp or other messaging services. The invitation features a creepy image of a girl with a weird face and bulging eyes called the “Mother Bird by Link Factory.” The challenge attempts to convince users to complete a series of hazardous tasks to meet “Momo.” If the users refuse the orders of the game, Momo threatens them with violent photos. The game has allegedly resulted in the death of several teenagers in countries such as India and Argentina. Many news outlets and blogs wrote about the challenge to raise awareness and warn parents of the risk of the suicide game for children. No details have been found on who is behind the suicide game yet. In 2017, a similar deadly game called the “Blue Whale Challenge” worried social media users as it allegedly caused the death of many young people. The suicide game had allegedly broadened its influence to Morocco as Moroccan newspapers reported the death of two Moroccan children in December 2017. The game was reportedly created in 2013 by its alleged mastermind Ilya Sidorov, a 26-year old Russian postman.  Like the Momo Challenge, the Blue Whale Challenge assigned users daily tasks which they had to do over 50 days. The challenges given to the players include many self-harming tasks. The game started by telling its users to wake up at unusual hours to watch horror movies, to listen to sad songs and to insult their parents. The tasks became increasingly more extreme throughout the 50 days. A study conducted by the opinion research firm “Averty” in partnership with “Kaspersky Lab” in 2016 showed that 88 percent of Moroccan children use internet on a regular basis. Despite the benefits of internet, unsupervised access to social media and internet can be dangerous. “Internet is not always fruitful,” said Abdelali Erramy, a social activist and president of the Childhood Forum and the National Association for Social, Economic, and Cultural Development in a previous interview with Morocco World News. “Many children use internet nowadays without being supervised by their parents, which is a very serious issue that parents need to be aware of.”

Rabat – Moroccan singer Saad Lamjarred has once again been arrested on a rape allegation in France, where he is already charged with rape. The singer is making international news headlines, but the news will not please his fans. French authorities arrested Lamjarred on Sunday morning in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France after receiving a new complaint from another alleged victim. Quoting a French prosecutor, Inquirer.net confirmed his arrest. However, the prosecutor’s office has not given any details on the arrest and allegation. Not the first time Lamjarred is already facing rape charges in France; he was arrested on October 26, 2016, for the sexual assault of a woman named Laura Prioul. French authorities temporarily released the artist on bail under electronic surveillance on April 13, 2017, after he spent nearly six months at the Marriott Champs Elysées in Paris pending his trial. Since his release on bail, the 33-year-old artist has returned to Morocco twice.  In May, the French court allowed him to spend the holy month of Ramadan in the kingdom. He even filmed two of his new popular songs in Morocco: “Ghazali” and “Casablanca.” Lamjarred denied Prioul’s allegations against him. Dozens of Moroccan and international singers expressed sympathy and solidarity with the singer, including Emirati star Ahlam and Moroccan singer Asma El Mnawar. Prioul told her version of the story in a video she posted on Youtube on November 12, 2017. She explained how the alleged crime “ruined” her life. Prioul claimed that Lamjarred invited her to his hotel room and forcefully raped her. “We put some music and danced and laughed. We got closer to each other at some point, and we kissed. He wanted to kiss me again but I turned my head away. He did not like the fact that I refused him, therefore, I was hit…. I wanted to defend myself, and this person hit me again, and again and again.… I couldn’t do anything. He was stronger than me. That person raped me.” She continued, “After he raped me, I locked myself in the bathroom. Then I realized that I had to go back to the room because my phone was there. I had to call someone for help.” After the rape, Prioul claimed that Lamjarred attempted to act as if nothing had happened. “He asked me why I was crying, if I was injured, and if I needed some ice?” Prioul added that her alleged aggressor became a totally different person, as if nothing had happened. Lamjarred also faced a rape charge in the United States. A woman told the American daily, New York Post in May 2016 that the Moroccan singer sexually assaulted her in a New York apartment in 2010. However, Lamjarred left the US on bail, and the prosecutor later dropped the charges when the woman withdrew her complaint due to a settlement.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI is expected to inaugurate socio-economic development projects in the city of Fez. The King arrived in Fez on Friday, August 24, with Moroccan media speculating that the monarch will inaugurate development projects in the spiritual city. Sources spoke, on condition of anonymity, to Moroccan news outlet Le Site Info that the monarch walked through the streets of Fez “without an entourage, and has noticed the spread of waste in some areas of the old medina, specifically in the alleys near the Moulay Idriss mosque.” Subsequently, the royal cabinet contacted a local senior official to say the King would have a telephone conversation with him on the matter.  Sources also told the news outlet that the King is expected to fire several local officials due to irregularities found in several projects inaugurated in recent years. In May, King Mohammed VI called on his government to promote Morocco’s renowned walled medinas (old cities) and to preserve their architectural heritage. Restoration projects are being carried out on Morocco’s historic walled medinas in Casablanca, Fez, Rabat, and Marrakech. Morocco’s Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit gave a presentation to the King on the programs and rehabilitation projects in May. During the presentation, which took place at the Royal Palace of Rabat, Laftit said that Fez has benefited from several restoration programs.  Laftit said that the programs are focusing on the rehabilitation of 27 historic hubs, including madrasas (schools), hotels, bridges, and souks (markets). Fez’s MAD 583 million renovation program received an MAD 100 million gift from the Hassan II Fund for Economic and Social Development. The programs aim to reinforce the dynamic development dynamic of the historic medinas. On Friday, August 24, the monarch also appointed new walis, representatives of the central government appointed by the King. The King also appointed new governors at the level of territorial administration and central administration.

Rabat – Morocco’s minister of Islamic affairs has issued a statement, recognizing the suffering experienced by Moroccan pilgrims in Hajj in Mecca. The Moroccan delegation in Mecca held an emergency meeting in Saudi Arabia with the National Tawafa (pilgrimage guide) Establishment for Pilgrims of Arabian Countries on Friday, August 25. The parties “reviewed the malfunctions experienced in this year’s Hajj season with regard to food and housing and Mina and transportation to Arafat.” According to the statement, the Establishment of Mutawwifs (pilgrimage guides said that they “fully understand the suffering faced by the Moroccan pilgrims” in Mina, Arafat and Muzdalifah, three integral stops on the Hajj near Mecca. Several Moroccan pilgrims complained about their struggles during their stay in Saudi Arabia due to non-existent management—leaving them hungry and without transport or shelter. A video was posted on social media showing angry Moroccan pilgrims distressed that they were not able to perform Hajj rituals, such as the “stoning of the devil,” a major ritual. They were prevented because there were “no delegates or coordinators” to guide them. Several pictures, which were shared widely on social media, showed some elderly Moroccan men lying on the floor appearing weak. The person who filmed the pilgrims said: “People are dying of hunger here, some didn’t eat for three days.” The pilgrim claimed that people from other countries were able to travel smoothly from Mount Arafat to Muzdalifah (13 kilometers away), two parts of the Hajj pilgrimage, but Moroccans could not. The Islamic ministry’s response to Moroccans’ complaints followed a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, which said that “some allegations reported by some media outlets” were “lies dating back to previous years.”  The ministry insisted that the conditions of stay in Hajj for Moroccans were positive.

Rabat – Morocco’s treasury faced a budget deficit of MAD 20.2 billion in the first seven months of 2018, according to TGR. The treasury’s spending and income created a larger deficit than the same period last year, when it was MAD 18.2 billion, the General Treasury of the Kingdom (TGR) reported in its July 2018 bulletin of statistics of public finances. The deficit reflected a negative balance of MAD 15.9 billion generated by the special treasury accounts (CST) and autonomously managed state institutions (SEGMA). The bulletin also showed that the government’s regular revenue for the period stood at MAD 158.9 billion, up from MAD 133.7 billion at the end of July 2017, an increase of 18.8 percent. The increase takes into account an exceptional payment of MAD 24 billion from a special trust account named “Special Account for GCC Countries Donations.”  Apart from the special payment, regular revenue rose by 0.9 percent, caused by the increase in non-tax revenues by 202 percent, customs duties by 12.8 percent, and indirect taxes by 5.5 percent. The increase was tempered by a drop in direct taxes by 2.2 percent and registration and stamp duties by 1.8 percent. Lower debt burden decreased spending General spending decreased by 4.7 percent to MAD 180.9 billion in the first seven months of 2018, due to a 27 percent decrease in the budgeted debt burden, combined with an increase in operating costs by 2.9 percent and investment expenditures by 3.1 percent, according to TGR’s bulletin. Spending commitments, including those not subject toprior approvals of spending approval like investments, amounted to MAD 307.5 billion in the period. ” The decrease of the budgeted debt burden is due to a 42.9 percent decline in principal repayments (MAD 17.7 billion instead of  MAD 31 billion) and a 0.9 percent increase in debt interest (MAD 17.8 billion against MAD 17.7 billion), according to the same report. The revenue from special treasury accounts in the period reached MAD 50 billion. The figure takes into account MAD 12 billion in transfers from the common expenses of the general investment budget and the “re-entry” of MAD 447 million in donations from Gulf countries. Earlier this month, research group Fitch Solutions predicted Morocco’s budget deficit would decrease over the next 10 years. The group’s August 2 report stated, “Morocco’s current account deficit will narrow gradually over the coming decade thanks to strong exports of manufactured goods and tourism services.” At the same time, the kingdom has recently proposed measures that would increase its spending commitments. On August 20, a ministerial council attended by King Mohammed VI approved a draft bill to conscript young Moroccans for a year of military service. If enacted, the bill could reduce the country’s tax base as young Moroccans leave the workforce for 12 months and would incur the cost of making payments at the completion of the year.

Rabat- Tangier will soon become home to a large Ferris wheel as part of a new tourism project by two young Moroccans. The two Moroccans living abroad in France and the US met the head of Tangier’s council, Mohamed Bachir Abdellaoui, on Friday, August 24, to discuss details on their project. They aim to reinforce tourism and promote the kingdom’s rich cultural activities in the northern city. The project includes a state-of-the-art Ferris wheel to be named “Grande Roue de Tanger” (Grand Wheel of Tangier), a water park, and other entertainment spaces, reported the council of Tangier on its official website. The Grand Wheel of Tangier is set to be one of the largest Ferris wheels in Africa, at a cost of MAD 60 million. For his part, the mayor of Tangier applauded the project, anticipating the gains it could bring to the country’s economy by attracting both Moroccans and foreign tourists alike, according to the Tangier website.

Rabat – FIFA has banned Jibril Rajoub after he called fans to burn Messi shirts and pictures if he played in a (later canceled) Argentina-Israel friendly match in June. According to a statement published by FIFA on Friday, August 25, the head of the Palestinian Football Association’s statements “incited hatred and violence.” Rajoub, according to FIFA, is subject to a 12-month match suspension and a fine of CHF 20,000 for violating Article 53 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code, which deals with the incitement of hatred and violence. “The 12-month match suspension imposed on Mr Rajoub entails a ban on taking part in any future match or competition taking place during the given period,” said FIFA. In June, Rajoub requested the Argentinian football federation cancel their national team’s friendly game with Israel. He also called on football fans, supporting the Palestinian cause, to burn Messi’s shirts and photos. Palestinian officials claimed in June that Israel would use the match, expected to feature Barcelona’s superstar Messi, for political motives. “The Israeli government has turned a regular sports match into a political tool. As was widely covered by the Argentinean media, the match will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the state of Israel,” Rajoub wrote to Argentina’s football federation. “Messi, don’t come. Don’t whitewash the face of racism,” Rajoub said in June. “We call on everyone to burn his pictures and shirts and to abandon him. We still hope that Messi will not come,” he told reporters. The FIFA ban sanctions the head of the Palestinian football federation from attending football games or competitions “in any official capacity, which includes, among others, participating in media activities at stadiums or in their vicinity on matchdays.”

Rabat – Algeria has confirmed that 41 cholera cases have been reported in Algiers and nearby areas since mid-August. Health authorities announced the number on Thursday, August 23. According to France 24, one of the infected patients has died, while dozens of other patients are waiting for test results. Algeria’s Ministry of Health said that the cholera cases are results of bad food and improper hygiene. Health authorities’ delay in announcing the outbreak of the disease sparked outrage among Algerian citizens. A correspondent for France 24’s sister station RFI in Algeria, Leila Beratto, told France24 that the Ministry of Health has been “accused of negligence” as the minister of health linked the cases with food poisoning. “In a press conference on August 20, authorities confirmed that these were cases of gastroenteritis,” said Berrato. The journalist said that when a man died on August 23, the official story on the outbreak was “still food poisoning.” Doctors working in Algerian hospitals, according to France24, confirmed that cholera cases were detected a week ago. Quoting a tweet by a doctor of infectious illnesses, France 24 wrote: “The infectious diseases department at Boufarik [30km southwest of Algiers] received confirmation of cholera cases six days ago.… The alert was given but the ministry didn’t move. It’s very serious.”  The same health expert added that “doctors who suspected two cases at Ain Bessem [in southeast Algiers] treated the patients as if they had cholera, and took the samples and sent them to the Pasteur Institute in Algeria. But it’s not up to the doctors to make the declaration, it’s up to the [health] ministry.” Cholera is an infectious illness that results when the cholera bacteria gets into the intestine. The disease causes severe diarrhea, which can cause dehydration and death if untreated. Morocco on alert Algeria’s neighbor, Morocco, will take measures to raise awareness of the risk of cholera emerging in the kingdom. An anonymous source told Le360 that the Moroccan minister of health, Anas Doukkali, has instructed his ministry on health monitoring systems to detect possible cases of cholera.  The source added that no case of cholera has been recorded in Morocco since 1997. The source also said, “No sign of unusual health with gastroenteritis has been detected in the regions of Morocco.” The risk of a cholera outbreak in Morocco is low, added the source.

Rabat – A new study has found that many animals in Moroccan markets are treated poorly due to vendors’ unawareness and lack of enforcement of existing law. Daniel Bergin, a researcher from Oxford Brookes University, conducted the study focusing on wildlife trade in Morocco.  Bergin and his team visited wildlife markets in six of Morocco’s largest cities: Rabat, Casablanca, Fez, Marrakech, Tangier, and Meknes. The research study assessed the welfare of a total of 2,113 animals seen in Moroccan markets “based on four of the Farm Animal Welfare Committee Five Freedoms: freedom from hunger and thirst, freedom from discomfort, freedom to express normal behavior, and freedom from distress.” The study’s highlights were published on August 24 by Mongabay, which reports on conservation and environmental issues. At least one endangered animal is available for sale in Morocco: the Barbary macaque (macaca sylvanus) which costs around $500. Another “threatened” species, the spur-thighed tortoise (testudo graeca) is sold at about $1. North African hedgehogs (atelerix algirus), Mediterranean chameleons (chamaeleo chamaeleon), and Egyptian cobras (naja haje) are also on sale in Morocco’s wildlife markets. According to Bergin’s study, published in the Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science, over 88 percent of the examined 2,113 animals were kept in situations which violated the four above-mentioned freedoms and only 9 animals were in a good situation. The study found that captive wild animals on sale or used for entertainment suffer from “universally poor” conditions. The study was conducted across 48 shops including 61 enclosures for animals. Of the 2,113 animals, however, 94 percent were spur-thighed tortoises; only 127 were not tortoises. “Tortoises were often piled together in such a way that they could not all touch the ground and we once found a sack full of tortoises that had seemingly been abandoned in the corner of a market. The tortoises were desperately trying to get free, but there seemed to be no immediate intention to move them, even to put them in crates,” said Bergin. “Baby monkeys were picked up and carried by a chain that was fixed around their neck even though it clearly caused them a lot of pain and distress,” he added. The animals lacked access to food and water and were not able to hide from stressors, left exposed to direct sun and heat. “These animals were dying slow, painful deaths, totally unnecessarily,” said Bergin. The phenomenon disturbed much of his team. Vendors’ lack of awareness of animals’ needs and health led them to keep the animals in poor conditions.  “Vendors often incorrectly said that tortoises do not need to drink water, or that chameleons only eat mint leaves (they actually eat insects and cannot survive on a diet of only leaves),” Bergin said. The researcher, nevertheless, believed that the vendors “did not want to intentionally hurt the animals, but they need to have a better understanding of how to keep them in good health.” Laws on wildlife trade not applied Although Morocco is a member of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), an intergovernmental organization responsible for globally improving animal health and welfare, the North African country’s laws “do not reflect the commitment of the government to animal welfare,” Bergin explained. According to Bergin’s research, 1,970 of the 2,113 captive wild animals for sale were illegal to sell in Morocco. “Despite the illegality of this trade, no attempt is made to hide any animals, as repercussions from new laws are clearly not enough to act as a deterrent due to a lack of enforcement,” the researcher said. According to the study, the poor welfare conditions which captive wild animals experience “would be in breach of the Moroccan proposed law 122–12 as the conditions are not suitable for the biological needs of these animals.” In 2013, the Moroccan government proposed a draft law prohibiting the mistreatment or abuse of animals in captivity, with fines of up to MAD 20,000. However, the draft law has not been enacted yet. Article 14 of the law stipulates that animals must be kept in conditions suitable to the biological requirements of their species. If the law were enacted, it would allow Moroccan authorities to stop the widespread mistreatment of animals in wildlife markets, Bergin claimed. “Simple improvements in housing and care such as access to water and shade would greatly improve the animals’ quality of life and decrease their mortality rate and would therefore benefit both animals and traders,” he said. Bergin said the welfare of animals was neglected in Moroccan laws, and he stressed the need to include a provision to that affect in laws. “During the standard rewriting of these laws, the welfare aspect was quietly dropped from consideration and appears never to have resurfaced. We believe that by drawing attention to this important provision again, we can bring animal welfare back to the discussion.” Bergin and his team called on the Moroccan government to fulfill its commitment to establish welfare laws for captive wild animals and devote resources to the application of the existing laws.

Rabat – The standoff between Rome and Brussels continues as Italy’s government keeps warning it will boycott the EU if it does not share Italy’s migration burden. Rome’s latest spiral of swipes at the European Union started earlier this month over Italy’s refusal to disembark the Diciotti, an Italian patrol vessel carrying 170 migrants who were rescued in Italian waters on August 15.  The migrants are currently stalled at a port in Catania, eastern Sicily, while Italy demands commitment from the EU. Cutting off the Italian contribution to the EU Rome, insisting that it cannot provide a safe haven for all rescued migrants, has asked the EU to step in and agree to “burden sharing” that will see migrants split among EU countries. Of the migrants stuck aboard the Diciotti, Italian authorities have only conceded to take in 27 unaccompanied minors, arguing that Italy “has had enough” of EU’s “hypocrisy” and inaction on the migration crisis in entry countries. Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio warned that Italy would cut off its financial contribution to the EU should the organization fail to shoulder substantial responsibility in the disembarkation and redistribution of the migrants onboard the Diciotti. “If they decide nothing regarding the Diciotti and the redistribution of migrants, I and the whole Five Star Movement will no longer be prepared to give 20 billion euros to the European Union every year.” Di Maio, who issued his warnings prior to a high-level EU meeting in Brussels on Friday, August 24, doubled down on his threats after the meeting failed to comply with Rome’s demands. Di Maio argued that Italy needs to take bold and “retaliatory” measures, because the EU is allegedly turning its back on Rome. “The European Union has decided to turn its back on Italy once again,” Di Maio wrote on his Facebook page. He added that Italy’s only choice was to “take a compensatory measure in a unilateral way … we are ready to reduce the funds that we give to the European Union.” He explained: “They want the 20 billion euros paid by Italian citizens? Then let them demonstrate that they deserve it and that they are taking charge of a problem that we can no longer face alone. The borders of Italy are the borders of Europe.” ‘Unconstructive’ threats Meanwhile, some in the European Union have tempered Rome’s threats. “There are forces in Italy that are looking to co-operate, we want to believe Italy wishes to play the game,” France’s Elysee palace said in a statement. Brussels swiftly hit back at Italy’s threats, however. The continental organization has shrugged off Rome’s comments as temporary mood swings and described its threats as “unconstructive comments.” European Commission spokesman Alexander Winterstein said at a briefing after the Friday meeting: “Unconstructive comments, let alone threats, are not helpful and they will not get us any closer to a solution.” “The EU,” the commission spokesman added, “is a community of rules and it operates on the basis of rules, not threats.” Another EU source was quoted by Reuters as saying that no deal was reached regarding the Diciotti because the Friday meeting “was not a meeting where decisions were taken.”  EU sources suggested that Rome should understand that the migration crisis is a general one and that the organization is dealing with similar issues in other countries in addition to other major hot-button topics and serious concerns. Rome, however, remains adamant on its funding and redistribution demands.  The country’s new strong man, the controversial interior minister Matteo Salvini, hit back at Brussels’ comments after the Friday meeting. Salvini, who has remained relatively silent at the start of the standoff on the Diciotti, picked up Di Maio’s threats in an interview on Friday. “If in Europe they pretend not to understand, given that we pay a lot, we will do what it takes to pay a little less,” Salvini said.

Elalamy, who is Saham’s CEO and minister of industry, trade, and technology, has sold Saham’s second health sector business in the same month to the same corporation. After selling Saham’s private hospital in Marrakech for MAD 500 million to KMR in mid-August, Elalamy has reportedly sold Saham’s medical division, Coral Park, to Kabbaj. Coral Park sells healthcare equipment and materials. With Coral Park gone, Saham’s remaining healthcare divisions include Spring Park, Crystal Park, Ivory Park, and Wood Park. Elalamy also ceded 53.37 percent of Saham Finance’s remaining shares, the group’s insurance division, to the South African insurance giant Sanlam for $1.05 billion in March. Kabbaj, who is the coordinator of the National Rally of Independents (RNI) in the Marrakech-Safi region, owns both the International University of Casablanca (UIC) and the Private University of Marrakech (UPM), in addition to a campus in Dakar, Senegal. KMR is supported by the Mediterrania Capital Partners, a private equity firm based in Barcelona, Spain.

Rabat – The US has announced it will axe more than $200 million in aid to Palestinians amid continuous tension over Jerusalem. On Friday, a senior State Department official quoted by Reuters said that the fund would tackle “high-priority projects elsewhere.” The US made a similar move in January, cutting more than half of the financial aid that the US normally provides to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the US State Department, explained Trump’s action, saying that the Trump administration would provide only $60 million to the UNRWA. She added that the country would withhold another $65 million “for future consideration.” Nauert said that the move is aimed at encouraging other countries to increase their funding of the UN agency. The move is set to generate more tension between the US and Palestine. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced a boycott against the US peace plan when Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the US embassy to the city. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) condemned the US move of cutting more aid, describing it as “the use of cheap blackmail as a political tool. The Palestinian people and leadership will not be intimidated and will not succumb to coercion,” said the organization, as quoted by Al Jazeera.

Rabat – Despite rumors of his departure to France’s Toulouse or Saudi Arabia’s Al Hilal or Al Ahly, Nabil Dirar has decided to stay with Turkey’s Fenerbahce.  According to his agent Fouad Ben Kouider, contacted by Moroccan outlet Lions de l’Atlas, the Atlas Lion “feels very good at Fenerbahce.” “Nabil Dirar is still under contract with Fenerbahce. He is focused on his season with his club,” he added.  The 32-year-old football player was courted in the past two months by the two Saudi giants, both hoping to conclude the arrival of the former AS Monaco player.  Under contract until 2020 with the Turkish club, Dirar was rumored to be unwanted by his club which was ready to release him for €6 million.  Wearing Morocco’s colors during the 2018 World Cup, Dirar participated in the tournament despite having suffered a knee injury just before it.  Following Morocco’s loss in the global competition, Dirar received a lot of support from his fans, especially after he left the field in tears during Morocco’s last game, against Spain (2-2). The Atlas Lion may be chosen by Herve Renard to be a part of the 36 players who will take part in the 2019 CAN qualifiers. Morocco is expected to play against Malawi September 8 in the Mohammed V stadium in Casablanca.  Football aside, the Atlas Lion has recently made headlines for a series of photos in which he appeared to puff smoke from a shisha pipe.  Dirar’s shisha party did not go unnoticed, and his fans heavily criticized him for smoking shisha as it is forbidden by the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF).

Rabat – The Spanish government has sparked public outcry for returning to Morocco 116 migrants who stormed the Spanish enclave of Ceuta on Wednesday. In an unprecedented move, Spanish and Moroccan authorities agreed Thursday for Spain to send back to Morocco the 116 migrants who “violently” crossed the land border from Morocco to Spain on Wednesday, August 22. Spanish authorities confirmed the deportation in a statement: “The 116 sub-Saharan migrants who illegally entered Spain through Ceuta have been readmitted by Moroccan authorities.”  The statement added that the deportation process had been done “legally” in accordance with international and European norms as well as a 1992 bilateral agreement between Madrid and Rabat. “All [migrants] benefited from a lawyer, an interpreter and medical help,” according to the Spanish Ministry of the Interior. The decision has, however, provoked a storm of criticism in the country, with a coalition of 48 Spanish NGO and human rights advocacy groups describing the move as “scandalous.” Walking Borders, a Madrid-based advocacy group, said that the mass deportation on arrival was both illegal and unmindful of international law regarding the rights of migrants. The decision “constitutes a gross violation of human rights.” Proactiva Open Arms has also cast doubts on Spain’s recent reputation as a welcoming destination for migrants refused in other EU countries. “The most concerning,” the NGO said, “is that if the government is capable of such a move before the eyes of the world and in front of the cameras, we can imagine that what they do at deep sea is much worse.” Spain’s mixed feelings on migration Leading the spiral of tirades against Spanish authorities is the far-left party Podemos, which in June played a major rule in the electoral triumph of the current socialist government. According to Podemos, Spain acted in blatant disregard of human rights and the country’s reputation for being welcoming and tolerant on migration issues.  “This government should continue acting as it did in its first days,” the group said, hinting at an incident in June when Spain stepped in to receive over 600 migrants onboard the Aquarius rescue ship, a group that Malta and Italy had rejected. While others have expressed disappointment that the newly-elected socialist government would resort to such rapid mass deportation, they maintained that authorities were only following Spain’s old policy on migration.  Carmen Calvo, deputy prime minister in the current socialist government, showed sympathy towards the criticism. She acknowledged the unprecedented pace in which the deportation occurred. In defense of the current government, however, she said, “Spain’s migration policy has not changed of an ounce in recent decades.” She also pointed out that the 116 migrants “violently” entered Spain, throwing dangerous chemical substances, including quicklime and battery acid, at the Spanish Civil Guard while physically assaulting others. Seven civil guards were injured in the incident, according to reports.  Calvo said that is “unacceptable” to enter a country as the migrants did on Wednesday.

Rabat – Spanish authorities have deported more than 100 sub-Saharan migrants to Morocco who forcefully crossed the border at Ceuta on Wednesday. The migrants crossed Spain’s land border with Morocco on Eid al-Adha, August 22. Authorities began deporting the migrants on Thursday, August 23, according to AFP. The news outlet added that the deportation falls within the reactivation of a bilateral agreement concluded between Spain and Morocco in 1992. “All benefited from a lawyer, an interpreter and medical help,” according to the Spanish Ministry of the Interior. Quoted by AFP, the ministry said the migrants also had the “opportunity to seek asylum but have not done so.” Un abrazo con nuestro deseo de pronta recuperación a los 7 guardias civiles heridos por quemaduras de ácido y cal cuando intentaban evitar un intento de entrada de personas a través del vallado del perímetro fronterizo de #Ceuta pic.twitter.com/dLBuYdlVei — Guardia Civil ?? (@guardiacivil) August 22, 2018  Three hundred migrants allegedly tried to storm the border of the Spanish enclave of Ceuta around 7 a.m. local time on Wednesday. However, the Spanish Civil Guard only encountered 115 migrants, and other reports put the number at 100-200. Spanish news agency El Pais said that the migrants attempt to harm security members throwing battery acid, quicklime, and excrement to attack officers.  “To prevent the civil guard from approaching the area where the attempted irregular entry was occurring, the migrants threw on the agents plastic containers filled with excrement, blood, quicklime and acids,” tweeted the Spanish Civil Guard on Wednesday.  The migrants took advantage of the Eid al-Adha holiday as the border on the Moroccan side was monitored by less than 10 police officers. Wednesday’s escape came only a month after more than 600 sub-Saharans successfully crossed the border on July 26. Dozens of migrants were injured during the incursion. More than five boats carrying 233 migrants also arrived in the first months of 2018 in Ceuta. Earlier this month, Morocco’s Ministry of Interior asked for €60 million in resources to tackle migration issues. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez responded to the Moroccan request, calling for the EU to provide funds to Morocco. The EU welcomed the Spanish request. However, the president of the European Commission said that the EU’s resources are limited. The EU complained that some countries have not contributed sufficiently to a fund for border control. The chairman of the commission promised Sanchez that there would be “additional financing for the management of the borders in Morocco as soon as these contributions materialize.” Juncker said that the North African country has received over €100 million in 10 years from the fund.

Rabat- El Othmani has commented on King Mohammed VI’s royal pardon of Hirak Rif activists, describing their release as a “significant” event. On the eve of Eid al-Adha (festival of sacrifice), August 21, King Mohammed VI granted a royal pardon to a 184 prisoners—according to Head of Government El Othmani—who were involved in the unauthorized protests that broke out in the northern Al Hoceima province after the death of a local fishmonger, Mouhcine Fikri, in October 2016. In post on his Facebook page, El Othmani expressed gratitude for the King’s decision. “It is the Moroccan wisdom, set to ease the difficult situations.” El Othmani echoed Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid’s comment in line with the release of prisoners, asserting that he agrees with the statements. “King Mohammed VI’s generous initiative will strengthen our belief that our country is marching on the right path despite the challenges that will not prevent it from ensuring the rights and freedoms [of citizens],” El Othmani quoted Ramid. On June 26, a court in Casablanca sentenced 53 Hirak activists, including the movement’s leader, Nasser Zefzafi, to prison terms varying from one to twenty years.  The Hirak leaders, however, were not granted the royal pardon. Ramid has emphasized the government’s willingness to extend favor to the remaining detained Hirak-linked prisoners, to Zefzafi and others if they “act wisely and clear-sightedly.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Fathallah Oualalou has won the “Special Book of China Award” for his book “China and Us: A Response to the Second Passage.” Oualalou, the former minister of economy and finance, along with 14 other foreign authors, publishers, and translators won the award during a ceremony at the 25th annual Beijing International Book Fair. The award recognized the 15 authors for covering Chinese culture in their works. Oualalou was the only African to receive the award. Oualalou’s book, which was published in the French language by the Arab Culture Center in Casablanca, discussed how China has positioned itself as a powerful country, succeeding in just a third of a century to rise from a developing country to an emerging economy to a global economic power. The minister emphasized in his book that China’s success was caused by multiple factors, including its attachment to territorial integrity, culture, and history, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Other authors who won the award were Marianne Bastid-Bruguière (France), Arakawa Kiyohide (Japan), and Kulteva Umut Baimuratovna (Kazakhstan). In the category of publishers, Bujar Hudhri (Albania), Andrzej Kacperski (Poland), and Zimarin Oleg (Russia) also won the prize.

Rabat – Morocco’s human rights minister has slammed criticisms of his handling of the Hirak activists’ trials, claiming that full responsibility lies with the attorney general. “I am not responsible for the arrest of Hirak protestors, including Nasser Zefzafi,” Minister Mustapha Ramid wrote on Facebook.  The minister was reacting to allegations by Mohamed Ziane, Zefzafi’s lawyer, who in an interview with France 24 said that Ramid bore some responsibility for the arrest and the severe sentences handed to Zefzafi and his fellow activists. On June 26, a Casablanca court handed down prison sentences ranging from one to twenty years to 53 Hirak protestors, including the movement’s leader Nasser Zefzafi. The court’s decision was greeted by a wave of condemnations both in Morocco and abroad, all slamming the mass trial as “politicized” and “unfair.” Ramid, who was minister of justice and liberties when the Hirak Rif protest movement erupted in 2016, has been among the most criticized government officials over the Hirak trials.   According to Ramid, he had left his post as justice minister by the time the court launched the legal investigations into the Hirak protests, including arrests and trials.  The minister noted that the legal procedures such the ones witnessed in the Hirak dossier are the responsibility of the attorney general, not the government or the Ministry of Justice.  Ramid’s response to Ziane’s accusations is his second comment this week on the Hirak dossier. In an earlier post in response to King Mohammed VI’s decision to pardon an unknown number (160-188 prisoners, depending on the report) of Hirak-linked prisoners, Ramid asserted that “the government is genuinely willing to definitely close the Hirak dossier.” If Zefzafi and the other Hirak activists “act wisely and clear-sightedly, this dossier will be soon closed, because there is no desire on the government’s part to take revenge,” Ramid said. Morocco’s human rights  records have been a contentious topic in recent months. The Hirak mass trial has particularly attracted international interest, prompting many of the country’s “strategic allies” to draw attention to human rights issues in dealing with Moroccan authorities. During a confirmation hearing on Thursday, August 23, David Fischer, nominated to serve as US ambassador to Morocco, responded to concerns about the Hirak activists’ sentences, saying that human rights issues remain a concern in Morocco despite the government’s “significant efforts” to improve.

Rabat – ONSSA has responded to two cases of discolored meat in Kenitra, which sparked rumors of meat unfit for human consumption. Pictures of the discolored meat made their way to social media. The pictures showed sheep meat of odd colors: green, blue, and gray. In response, Morocco’s National Office for Food Safety (ONSSA) published a statement on Facebook to explain the two cases. ONSSA wrote that the two cases were reported in Kenitra, a city near Rabat. The agency added that when the photos were posted on social media, officials from ONSSA travelled to Kenitra to investigate the incidents. According to ONSSA, the officials reassured worried citizens, emphasizing that the discolored meat in the first case was caused by pockets of water in the lungs of the sheep. The officials added that the sheep’s meat was safe to be consumed.  For the second case, ONSSA said that the sheep had swallowed a “strange subject,” resulting in inflammation of its tissues. ONSSA added that “the infected parts have been removed” but that the remaining meat could be consumed. A 2017 incident might be the reason Moroccan citizens are concerned. In 2017, discolored and unsanitary Eid al-Adha meat caused public worry. In response, ONSSA warned that the meat was not safe for consumption.  Citizens then speculated that the sheep were force-fed, injected with hormones or infected by bacteria. In June, Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch discussed preparations for Eid al-Adha with the president of the Interprofessional Federation of Red Meat (FIVIAR). The meeting was an opportunity to ensure better animal traceability and transparency in commercial transactions. The minister warned that any failure or non-compliance with quality requirements of any link in the chain would cause all stakeholders to be severely punished.

Rabat – Police have seized 160 kilograms of cannabis in Tangier from a Moroccan drug trafficker attempting to embark to Europe. On Wednesday evening, police and customs officers stopped a Moroccan national at Tangier Med Port who was trying to smuggle cannabis in the form of cannabis resin (chira) to Europe.  The drug, which was concealed in a Belgium-registered car, was discovered during a vehicle scan. Police dogs were also involved in the operation.  The 39-year-old culprit was arrested and placed in custody for an investigation by Tangier’s judicial police. The investigation will be carried out under the supervision of the competent public prosecutor’s office. Cannabis resin is one of the most exported drugs in Morocco and has continuously been the subject of seizures in past years. The demand for the drug in Europe is very high due to its powerful and high-yield hybrid varieties. In fact, Morocco is the largest supplier of cannabis resin for Europe, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In 2014, 302 tons and 85 percent of all cannabis resin seizures in Spain were linked to Morocco.  Spain has played an important role for Morocco’s drug trafficking, as it is the closest European country and therefore used as gateway to all the others. Other popular points of entry are Portugal, France, and Italy.  According to the UNODC World Drug Report of 2017, Morocco has the third highest cannabis resin seizures among countries worldwide. The kingdom comes behind Spain and Pakistan.  Other drugs that Spain and Europe have increasingly imported are heroin and cocaine. The latter has also been the subject of numerous seizures lately. A UNODC report from 2011 suggested that the traditional trafficking route from Morocco to Spain, used to import cannabis resin to Europe, has also been used for cocaine.

Rabat- Italian authorities arrested a Moroccan resident who tied up his sacrificial sheep in a stroller in a “barbaric” way. Onlookers in the city of Naples felt uncomfortable after seeing the man handling a sheep during Eid al-Adha (festival of sacrifice) in a child’s stroller. The sheep was on its back, tied in such a way that its head was cocked, and appeared to be struggling. A video of the sheep in the stroller, which has circulated on social media, caused Italian media and animal rights activists to condemn the act and describe it as “barbaric” or “cruel.” The Italian news outlet la Repubblica said the man with the sheep was on his way to Garibaldi Square in Naples to celebrate Eid when he ran into a member of the Naples city council, who was shocked by the manner in which the Moroccan had tied the sheep and asked him to untie it. When the Moroccan refused, police interfered and arrested him. Eid al-Adha is the second of two Islamic holidays Muslims celebrate worldwide. The holiday comes on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the month of pilgrimage in which the Hajj takes place. On Eid, the oldest male in Muslim families slaughter a sheep, goat, or cow, after performing the morning prayers.

Rabat- Several Moroccan pilgrims complained about their struggles in Mecca due to non-existent management—leaving them hungry, without transport or shelter. While Morocco’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mustapha Mansouri was saying that Moroccan pilgrims’ Hajj experience in 2018 was positive, a video was posted online offering a different picture. Moroccan pilgrims were recorded complaining about the bad conditions in Mecca. The video, which has swept Moroccan social media, shows a number of Moroccan men distressed because they were not able to perform Hajj rituals, such as the “stoning of the devil,” a major ritual. They were prevented because there were “no delegates or coordinators” to guide them. The ritual marks the end of the Hajj Pilgrimage in Mina, 5 kilometers to the east of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Some elderly Moroccan men can be seen lying on the floor, their bodies weary from lack of nourishment. One man told the camera: “We send this message to the minister in charge of Hajj management, this is an insult to us. We paid for Hajj and we never got to eat a decent meal.” “People are dying of hunger here, some didn’t eat for three days,” the cameraman commented. The pilgrim claimed that people from other countries were able to travel smoothly from Mount Arafat to Muzdalifah (13 kilometers away), two parts of the Hajj pilgrimage, but Moroccans could not. Pilgrims traditionally arrive in Muzdalifah after sunset on the 9th day of the Islamic month Dhu al Hijjah, the second day of Hajj. Moroccans in the video said that they arrived at dawn on the 10th day due to delayed transport. One of the men said that the bus driver stopped midway and left passengers behind, adding that Moroccan pilgrims were wandering directionless in Mecca because they had no guides accompanying them. “They lied to us, they took our money, there is no transport, no managing delegation, no guides….nothing,” another one stated. Approximately 32,000 Moroccan pilgrims performed Hajj this year, according to Morocco’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia. A commenter in the video claimed that there were 2,000 Moroccan pilgrims experiencing the same problems. In a statement to the state owned press, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Morocco’s Ministry of Islamic Affairs stated that “some allegations reported by some media outlets” were “lies dating back to previous years,” claiming that information about pilgrims losing their way in Mecca was also false. The statement strassed that “the Moroccan delegation for this year are numbered at 105 to 112 delegates.”  The ministry insisted that the conditions of stay in Hajj for Moroccans are positive.

Rabat – Nineteen months after the last US ambassador left Rabat, the new ambassador nominee has begun confirmation hearings in the US Senate. US President Donald Trump nominated David T. Fischer, who contributed to Trump’s campaign and inauguration,  in November 2017. The nomination came nine months after Ambassador to Morocco Dwight Bush left. Trump has received heavy criticism for taking too long to nominate ambassadors to key US allies, including South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Even after Fischer was nominated, it took the US Senate Foreign Affairs Committee almost 10 months to hold a hearing on the nominee to hear his potential strategy if confirmed as ambassador to Rabat. However, the confirmation process can be slow in the US Senate, as another ambassador nominated last November, Joseph Macmanus to Colombia, has not been confirmed yet. The foreign relations committee has not yet approved Fischer’s nomination, and requested additional documentation from the nominee in regards to a lawsuit against his business. If the senate committee votes to approve the ambassador, Fischer’s nomination will be subject to a vote by all members of the US Senate. Moroccan analysts worried that Morocco-US relations were not stable as the Trump administration nominated an ambassador to Algeria in July 2017 before Fischer’s nomination. These analyses, however, started to fade away as the US and Morocco called for consolidating their ties in different symposiums and conferences. Fischer’s answers during the hearing confirmed the healthy relations between both countries as he made a pitch to Morocco for consolidating the “vital” bilateral ties between the two countries. He offered welcoming remarks on Morocco-US bonds in an opening statement at a hearing before the US Senate Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday, August 23. Morocco a historical ally of the US Fischer said that Morocco is one of the US’ “oldest allies,” recalling the treaty “of friendship with Morocco, ratified in 1787.” He added that the treaty is the “longest, unbroken treaty relationship in the United States’ history.” According to the US nominee, the Morocco-US friendship along with economic, political, and security cooperation “is vital and must be consolidated.” Fischer said that he welcomes the “fact that the enormous economic opportunities in the commercial fields and exports from the United States to Morocco have tripled in recent years.” The US ambassador nominee also recalled that Morocco is a gateway for US companies to access other markets. Pending confirmation on his nomination as ambassador, Fischer said he would work “with the aim of widening the opportunities for [American] companies.” Fischer has a business vision as he holds the position of CEO of Suburban Collection, the largest car dealership in Michigan with 48 franchised stores. Fischer said that the US and Morocco “remain resolute in their intention to advance religious freedom and fight against violent extremism,” adding that the North African country is a “partner capable and active.” He added that Morocco was the “first African country to join the International Coalition against Daesh, while co-chairing the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF).” Throughout the years, US State Department has welcomed Morocco’s efforts in fighting terrorism and extremism. Earlier this month, the US president applauded King Mohammed VI’s leadership in “international efforts to promote religious tolerance and fight against extremism.” Trump also welcomed the friendship between the two countries, which based on an interest “to promote peace, stability and economic opportunities.” Fischer echoed Trump’s remarks, emphasizing that he is looking forward to working to “further consolidate our security corporation with Morocco, in order to protect the interests of the United States in the region.” “Today, the United States is facing complex foreign policy challenges around the world. Morocco is positioning itself as a gateway to Africa, the Middle East and the Muslim world. Building a relationship with His Majesty King Mohammed VI will be of primary importance as we strive to strengthen our collaboration while being backed by a foundation of mutual trust,” he said. The nominee remains “convinced that  my own experience in building and consolidating strategic alliances, culture in the area of trade promotion, support and promotion of social welfare and human rights will be put to good use in the service of the Trump Administration and the United States, if my appointment is confirmed.” Concluding his statement, Fischer said that he is “fully aware” that it will be his mission and “privilege to work on behalf of President Donald Trump… to represent the United States of America to advance our interests and to help consolidate Morocco a vital, secure and prosperous ally of the United States.” Western Sahara conflict took part in hearing “How likely is a new round of direct talks between Morocco and the Polisario Front, how realistic are expectations that those talks could move this stalemated and perennial conflict into a new place?” asked one senator about Fischer’s thoughts regarding the forty-year-long dispute. Fischer then recalled that the US continues to “support the UN-led efforts to find a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict.” The nominee recalled the mission of the special envoy to Western Sahara of the UN secretary-general, Horst Kohler, who recently visited Morocco, Algeria, and Mauritania. Fischer noted that the UN is in talks with the concerned parties to find a solution to the dispute over the region. 
Human trafficking in Morocco remains a concern for the US  During his hearing, Fischer was asked by US Senator Jeanne Shaheen how he would tackle the issue of human trafficking in Morocco. Shaheen said that “human trafficking” and “human rights violations” have increased in recent years in Morocco. She asked Fischer how he would deal with the issue if confirmed. Recalling a report from the US Department of State, Fischer agreed that the issues are a problem. The human trafficking report, according to Fischer, found that the country’s efforts do not meet “the minimum standards for elimination of trafficking.” However, he believed that the Moroccan government is making “significant efforts” to handle the issues. He also said that the country introduced a law that prohibits all forms of trafficking. Senator Tim Kaine asked Fischer if he would stand for “justice, democracy, equality, and free speech,” recalling some of the problematic actions the Moroccan government has taken against protestors and activists, specifically the heavy sentences given to “non-violent” Hirak Rif activists. Fischer assured the committee he would work to also ensure that he will serve the interests of citizens and ensure peace, prosperity, respect, and human happiness. The senator then called on Fischer to discuss the political issues with the Moroccan government. However, Morocco’s position on the issues has been made clear on several occasions. Recently, the Moroccan government rejected the Netherlands’ “interference” in Morocco’s internal affairs. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita commented on the country’s remarks, which criticized the heavy sentences against Hirak activists involved in the Hirak Rif movement. “I have made it clear that the Rif’s Hirak is a strictly internal affair and is by no means an object of diplomatic discussion,” said Bourita. However, after an unconfirmed number of activists were pardoned on Wednesday, August 22, Morocco’s Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid said, “If the other prisoners act wisely and clear-sightedly, this dossier will soon be closed, because there is no desire on the government part to take revenge.”

Rabat – Moroccan footballer Sofyan Amrabat has officially joined Belgium’s FC Burges with a 4-year contract, leaving Feyenoord Rotterdam where he played for a year.  Sofyan Amrabat naar Club Brugge! #WelkomSofyan ??? Feyenoord ?? Club Brugge
? 4 jaar TRANSFER | https://t.co/Benj1l6HLi pic.twitter.com/DHMovnIKSD — Club Brugge KV (@ClubBrugge) August 24, 2018  The Belgian club announced the arrival of the 22-year-old midfielder on Friday, August 24, on its social media pages.  Last summer, the midfielder left Utrecht for Feyenoord where he signed a 4-year contract for €5 million.  Last season, the Atlas Lion played 31 games for the Dutch club (making 2 goals and 2 assists), including six in the Champions League.  Martin van Geel, the technical director of Feyenoord, explained the player’s departure on the team’s website. “Sofyan has been telling me for months that he has a lot of problems with his play role at Feyenoord. it’s very unfortunate to learn his departure, because the competition is part of a high-level club, and of course you try to manage that.” “If a player wants to leave immediately, the ultimate goal is to find a solution that always puts the interests of the club at the forefront and takes into account the circumstances,” he added.  The 22-year-old footballer made his debut for the Moroccan national football team in a 1-0 friendly win against Tunisia on March 28 after an invitation from Herve Renard, the coach of Morocco’s national football team. Renard praised the footballer for his good performance during the match. On November 11, 2017, he officially joined the Moroccan team in his first game against Côte d’Ivoire for a World Cup qualifier (2-0).  In May 2018, Renard chose Amrabat to take part in the 2018 World Cup in Russia with his brother Nordin Amrabat. Sofyan Amrabat made a 2018 World Cup appearance against Iran in Morocco’s first game at the tournament. He replaced his older brother Nordin Amrabat in the 76th minute in the right-back position. However, it was not enough as Morocco lost to Iran 0-1 with an own-goal from Aziz Bouhaddouz.  In his youth, Amrabat also represented the Netherlands Under 15 team in 2010. He later represented the Morocco national Under 17 football squad at the 2013 FIFA Under 17 World Cup.

Rabat – Mustapha Ramid, the Moroccan human rights minister, has asserted the government’s willingness to extend favor to the remaining detained Hirak-linked prisoners.  The minister took to his Facebook hours after the King pardoned some of the prisoners linked to the Hirak protests on the occasion of the Islamic Eid al-Adha feast. While reports vary on the number of prisoners pardoned (ranging from “more than 160” to 188), Ramid applauded the King’s initiative and said that he expects more similar moves in the future. According to Ramid, there is genuine desire to close the Hirak dossier. Calling the King’s pardon “a generous royal initiative,” the minister praised Morocco’s legal advances and human rights reforms in recent years. The minister wrote on his Facebook page that the King’s pardoning of Hirak-linked detainees “reinforces our firm conviction to see the country take further steps in the right direction despite all the difficulties.” He also said that challenges will not impede Morocco’s march towards full-fledged rule of law. Thanking the King for his “generous” act, Ramid that said more of such actions are needed to “respect individual liberties and rights in Morocco but also face together all of the country’s painful events.” Hirak prisoners should behave themselves Later, speaking to Telquel about the other Hirak activists still in detention in various Moroccan jails, Ramid said that his department has prepared a report to assess their situation and that all that is needed is for the other Hirak detainees to “be wise and act with clear-signtedness.”  Ramid’s comments come in the wake of a nationwide outcry over the Moroccan judiciary’s handling of the social unrest that erupted in the country’s historically marginalized northern Rif provinces in October 2016.  On June 26, a court in Casablanca sentenced 53 Hirak activists, including the movement’s leader, Nasser Zefzafi, to prison terms varying from one to twenty years. Meanwhile, over 400 Hirak-linked protestors are thought to have been arrested and detained. The severity of the sentences and the rapid pace in which they were reached prompted many in Morocco and at the international level to criticize the mass trial as “unfair” and call for reconsideration. But the widespread criticism did not temper the authorities, who were adamant that the trial had been fair. According to Ramid, if Zefzafi and the other remaining Hirak-linked prisoners show discernment, authorities are poised to take further steps to “definitively resolve their situation.” “If the other prisoners act wisely and clear-sightedly, this dossier will soon be closed, because there is no desire on the government part to take revenge,” he said.

Rabat – Police have reportedly arrested 10 men involved in kidnapping, raping, torturing, tattooing, and holding captive a 17-year-old in central Morocco. The girl, named Khadija, was subjected to the worst forms of violence during the month she was held by more than 10 men in Oulad Ayad, a small town near Beni Mellal and 150 kilometers northeast of Marrakech.  According to several local media, 1 of the 10 men owned the house where Khadija was being held. After police arrested the men, some managed to escape.  In an interview with Chouf TV, the young lady recounted the nightmare she lived, explaining that she was at her aunt’s house when she was kidnapped in front of the house. The men who took her raped her first before holding her captive in a house where she was handed over to other men for money.  Khadija tried to escape several times, but each time she was caught and tortured. “They didn’t give me food or drink, and I was not even allowed to take a shower.”  “I want justice to be done and [for them] to pay for what they have done to me,” she bravely told reporters. “For how many women who, for fear of this hchouma [shame], continue to keep quiet?” she added.  The awful story has stirred up outrage and controversy, especially among women’s rights associations.   In a statement obtained by Morocco World News, Bouchra Abdou, an activist, feminist, and director of Tahadi Center, has strongly condemned these “brutal and disrespectful practices of violence against women.”  “The associations concerned with women’s issues raise the alarm for the future of our daughters and women. Law 103-13 to combat violence against women began in August 2018. What we demand is to raise awareness and to use publicity and media tools to sensitize people. We call on the concerned parties to tighten the penalties for the perpetrators of this serious crime, and to take care of the psychological health of the victim,” added Abdou.  One case among thousands Morocco’s rate of reported rapes increased from 800 cases in 2016 to 1,600 cases in 2017, according to an annual report issued by the King’s attorney general, Mohamed Abdel Nabawi. In 2017, a total of 17,280 people were arrested on corruption charges, 2,890 for adultery, 5,328 for prostitution, and 2,384 for rape.  Morocco adopted a new law in February against sexual harassment and gender-based violence after years of women’s rights campaigns calling on the government to adopt the law. Just one month after Parliament passed the law, authorities arrested a 21-year-old man who sexually assaulted a young girl in public on the street in Benguerir city in central Morocco. The spine-chilling video of the incident, filmed by the culprit’s accomplice, sparked nationwide uproar among Moroccans on social media platforms, who called on authorities to immediately intervene.

Rabat – Young Moroccans in Belgium are reportedly concerned about Bill 44.18 on compulsory military service; the bill’s provisions are unclear on youth with dual nationality. In a press release issued August 17, the cabinet said that it would discuss “Bill 44.18 on Military Function” at the government council on Monday, August 20, the 65th anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the People.  The draft bill was approved by both the government council and ministerial council on August 20. All children of Moroccans residing abroad may be affected because it is not known yet whether they will also have to join the military. The binational youth could be exempted from the law if the council of ministers were to “refine” the bill, Belgian business newspaper L’echo asserted. Dutch news outlet NL Times has said that many Dutch-Moroccans are “worried that they will have to join the North African country’s army for a year.”  The chairman of the Foundation for Dutch-Moroccans (SMN), Fouad Sidali, argued that “Morocco would prefer that those young people [Dutch-Moroccans] maintain the bond with the country, by going there every year on vacation and preferably also investing.” The chairman questioned: “What would they get then by introducing a conscription? In many cases it would only ensure that young people say: ‘Look out for it’, and stay in the Netherlands.” The ministerial council approved the draft bill to reintroduce mandatory military service to “inculcate the spirit of citizenship in young people as part of a correlation between the rights and duties of citizenship” on Monday, triggering mixed reactions from citizens. The law will go into effect if it is passed in the parliament. It would not be the first time Morocco has mandatory military service. On June 9, 1966, Morocco introduced an 18-month mandatory military service in accordance with Royal Decree 137-66. In 2006, King Mohammed VI abolished the mandatory military service. The bill, in accordance with Article 38 of Morocco’s constitution, emphasizes that citizens—both men and women (aged 19 to 25)—should contribute to the defense of the homeland and its territorial integrity. The bill maintains that citizens would be subject to a 12-month mandatory military service. Any attempt to avoid the authorities’ call without giving strong justification would be punished with one to three months in prison and a fine of MAD 2,000 to MAD 5,000. Young conscripts would receive payment at the end of the training period, according to Article 5 in the bill.

Rabat – Burma’s Aung San Suu Kyi is set to have her Freedom of Edinburgh award removed over her refusal to speak up on the Rohingya crisis.  The “iron lady,” as Suu Kyi’s admirers call her, was once touted as a global champion of human rights and democracy. She won many international accolades for her activism and “staunch leadership” for the emergence of democracy and rule of law in military-ruled Burma.  The Oxford-educated politician was under house arrest in Burma when she was awarded the Freedom of Edinburgh award in 2005. At the time, the lord provost of Edinburgh likened Suu Kyi’s leadership and activism to Nelson Mandela’s, calling her “a symbol of peaceful resistance in the face of oppression.”  “By honoring her,” the lord provost said, “Edinburgh citizens will be publicly supporting her tireless work for democracy and human rights.” Suu Kyi’s party, the National League for Democracy, won Burma’s general elections in 2015, raising both national and international expectations for the country’s first non-military government.  Suu Kyi was barred from claiming the country’s presidency following her party’s triumph in the 2015 elections because her late husband and children held foreign citizenship. But she entered the country’s new government as state councilor.  But most observers describe her as the country’s de-facto leader. She is a more prominent and charismatic figure than then president, Htin Kyaw, a key figure in the National League.  Under the party’s leadership, however, Burma’s military brutality, police crackdown on activists, and grim record on the ethnic and religious minority Rohingya have persisted, international observers have complained in recent years. According to the Guardian, Frank Ross, Edinburgh’s lord provost, wrote to Suu Kyi in November to urge her to speak up against the spiral of violence against the Rohingya people.  Ross’s letter reportedly called on Suu Kyi’s “immeasurable moral courage,” asking her to step in to stop the mass deportation and rapes.  “After no communication from Suu Kyi, Ross has now tabled a council motion on Thursday calling for her freedom of the city to be removed with immediate effect,” the Guardian added. A series of award revocations Edinburgh’s decision to strip Suu Kyi of the city’s Freedom award is the seventh such occurrence in recent months.  The Burmese Nobel Peace laureate, whose international reputation has suffered a severe blow following reports of her “guilty silence” in the face of “state violence against Rohingyas,” has recently been stripped of six other awards. In the wake of the mass killings and state brutalization of ethnic Rohingyas, international organizations and a coalition of Nobel Peace laureates called on the “iron lady” to condemn the escalating violence and act to secure Rohingyas’ rights to citizenship.  The UN even called Rohingyas’ plight an “ethnic cleansing.” In March, the US Holocaust museum stripped Suu Kyi of the Elie Wiesel award.  The Elie Wiesel award committee argued that Suu Kyi’s handling of the Rohingya crisis stood in sharp contrast with her reputation as a global beacon of freedom and human rights. Before Edinburgh, other cities, such as Oxford, Glasgow, and Newcastle, revoked the Burmese leader of their Freedom of the City awards, the Guardian’s report noted.  All revocations have slammed Suu Kyi’s government’s handling of the country’s humanitarian crisis. In addition to reports of mass killings and rapes, over 700,000 Rohingyas have been said to have fled the latest spiral of violence that erupted in August 2017, crossing to neighboring Bangladesh.  Suu Kyi, meanwhile, has repeatedly denied the allegations against her government, claiming that the death toll has been misreported and that the escalating violence was due to “Rohingya terrorism” rather than military crackdown.  She also said that the crisis was all down to “hate narratives from outside the country,” hinting that Bangladesh, whose government has been critical of Burmese “state violence against Rohingyas,” has a vetted interest in fueling social tensions in Myanmar. “The outside world can choose the issues on which they wish to focus,” Suu Kyi has been reported as saying, defying the global outcry against her.

Isabella Wang Rabat – Abla Samrhouni, a Moroccan-American high school senior, has championed Moroccan culture through her educational presentations in the US.  In an increasingly globalized world, geographic and cultural boundaries have become more blurred. Yet, many communities are still entrenched within their own particular cultural perceptions. It is in this tension between globalization and restricted cultural views which emerges the necessity of intercultural dialogue.  As outlined by the UN, “The diversity of the world makes for an enriching experience in sharing and learning about our differences, experience that can foster peaceful coexistence between peoples.”  As a Moroccan-American, Abla Samrhouni embodies the new forefront of intercultural dialogue and education. Her enriching and enlightening presentations enable Americans to transcend their own perceptions and learn the many intriguing and complex facets of Moroccan culture.   In her series “Morocco on the Road,” Abla gives educational presentations on the Kingdom of Morocco across the US. She showcases the exotic, beautiful, and culturally rich country to US citizens who have not had the opportunity to learn about Moroccan culture.  Her audience spans a myriad of ages, from preschoolers to senior citizens. She gave her first presentation in February 2018 at Beauvoir, the National Cathedral Elementary School, in Washington, D.C.   When asked about her presentation, Neil McClay, one of the teachers, said, “She had been asked to deliver a presentation about Morocco to a group of 84 first grade students” for the school’s 1st grade Morocco morning. He continued, “Abla was an absolute pleasure to work with and her presentation was certainly one of the highlights of a fantastic event. She delivered valuable information in an inspiring and entertaining manner and the children thoroughly enjoyed listening to her presentation.” In her presentations, Abla covers a wide range of topics. She shares the rich history and culture of Morocco, discussing topics from Morocco’s imperial cities, religion, and customs to its souks, cuisine, and clothing. She even talks about the politics of Moroccan-US relations.  Further, Abla brings in artefacts, musical instruments, and jewelry to tangibly present the vibrant culture of Morocco. When asked about her motivations behind the presentations, Abla said, “The social issues that inspired me to start this were conflict due to cultural differences, close-minded viewpoints, and prejudice. The goal of the classes for society are to overcome these issues and unite people from all over the world despite differences by teaching them to embrace diversity and the mix of ethnicities in America that enrich the country and to fight against ignorance that fuels stereotypes.” One of the stereotypes Abla has had to battle is the austere and impersonal perception of the King.  She stated, “Whenever I show a picture of the King and his family to the kids in my PowerPoint they are surprised to see him wearing sunglasses and jeans. He is integrated in common people’s lives and he is humble despite … his magisterial title. This got rid of the image the kids had in their mind of a king on his throne.” Abla’s dual identity as American and Moroccan embodies the virtues of interculturalism and multiculturalism. As an American citizen and ethnic Moroccan, Abla has the opportunity to marvel in both cultures. She recalled the vibrancy of Morocco: “I visit Morocco almost every summer to see my extended family. It is the most exciting part of each year for me because I always learn something new and it feels like an adventure.” It has also become an incredibly enlightening experience. She stated, “Traveling there every year has gotten me out of my comfort zone, made me develop cultural sensitivity, taught me 2 additional languages, given me a new and more welcoming, curious outlook on life, and allowed me to meet all kinds of people. [To] get out of the world I live in and get exposed to somewhere completely different which showed me there is so much yet to see.”  In her firsthand experiences as a Moroccan-American, Abla has insightful observations on the distinct differences between the two countries.  She asserted, “America is a salad bowl, or in other words a mix of different cultures whereas Morocco is one big culture. In contrast to America, Morocco is predominantly Muslim, and Arabic and French is spoken widely.” The influences have also informed the values behind each country. According to Abla, Morocco focuses more on hospitality, collectivism, and family, which aligns with their values of tradition and religion. Meanwhile America focuses on individualism, freedom, and equality.  Beyond her presentations, Abla is a model of excellence. In her senior year of high school, she takes many advanced placement and honor classes. She competes in her school variety track and cross-country team and is also part of the French Honors Society while tutoring students who need assistance.  The presentations have informed her on her future possibilities. Just like her presentations, she hopes in the future to understand, learn, and enlighten others about many cultures.  She said, “I am not positive what I want to do but I’ve been trying to contribute to the effort to bridge between countries and people that come from all over the world in doing these presentations.” Abla is considering a career in foreign affairs, business or law, inspired by her parents to help people and defend their rights.  She emphasized, “Whichever path I chose I will be completely committed, driven, ambitious, and passionate and hopefully successful. “

Rabat – Moroccan footballer Hamza Mendyl has said difficulty getting a work permit as a Moroccan prevented him from playing for Arsenal or Newcastle. The Moroccan-Ivorian footballer, who signed for Schalke 04 last week, said that he was in negotiations with Arsenal this summer before signing with the German football team. Quoted by major sports outlets, the 20-year-old said that difficulty getting a work permit prevented him from joining England’s Arsenal. ESPN also said that the footballer was denied a work permit from Arsenal. “It is true: I was in talks Arsenal and Newcastle. But as a Moroccan citizen it’s not that easy to obtain a work permit. I would have trusted myself to play Premier League,” Mendyl said. Mendyl has joined his fellow Moroccan Amine Harit, who also plays for both Morocco’s national team and Schalke 04. Both Moroccans made the list of the team who participated in the 2018 World Cup. Mendyl expressed his joy over joining the German team. “I’m delighted to have signed for such a big club. With Domenico Tedesco, I’ve got a coach who is renowned for improving players,” the player was quoted by his club.

Mendyl also expressed his ambition to grow as a footballer, saying: “I want to keep developing and play an important role in all three campaigns for Schalke 04 this season.” Born in Casablanca to a Moroccan mother and an Ivorian father, Mendyl has made senior debut for the Moroccan national team in a 2-0 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier win over Sao Tome. He has also represented Morocco’s Under 19 and Under 20 teams. Before joining Schalke 04, the footballer played as a left-back for French League 1 side Lille.   The footballer said in 2017 that his father “would have liked me to play for Ivory Coast, but he respects my choice,” reported French sports outlet, France Football. The young footballer explained his choice by saying that he was born and raised in Morocco. “For me, it was always clear in my head, I wanted to play and defend my Moroccan jersey.”

Rabat – Al-Baghdadi, ISIS leader and self-proclaimed caliph, has purportedly broken a year of self-imposed silence and seclusion, calling on his followers to “persevere” and “fight infidels.”  The self-styled Islamic State (ISIS) released an audio recording Wednesday of a purported speech by al-Baghdadi. The group’s leader has kept a low profile since the first half of 2017 due to the heavy and sustained air raids by the US-led international coalition. In the recording, the self-proclaimed caliph is heard instructing jihadists around the world to “persevere” in spite of recent losses against “infidels.” “For the Mujahideen [holly warriors] the scale of victory or defeat is not dependent on a city or town being stolen or subject to that who has aerial superiority, intercontinental missiles or smart bombs,” Reuters quoted the released recording as saying. “Oh Caliphate of soldiers trust in God’s promise and His victory for with hardship comes relief and a way out.” Not defeated yet If authenticated, the speech may put at rest doubts about whether the terrorist leader is still alive. In the heat of the international anti-terrorism campaign in June 2017, Russian army officials proclaimed that al-Baghdadi may have been killed in one of Russia’s air raids that targeted a gathering of senior ISIS leaders in the vicinity of Raqqa, a Syrian city where ISIS had established its capital. A month later, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based advocacy group, confirmed the news of the terrorist leader’s death, claiming that he may have been hit in eastern Syria. The US, however, cast doubt on the narrative, with top American officers saying that it was highly probable that al-Baghdadi, who survived the Battle of Raqqa, the fifth and final anti-ISIS campaign that saw the terrorist group withdraw from the city, may be hiding in the Euphrates River Valley in eastern Syria. A recent UN report has corroborated Washington’s story.  According to the report, ISIS has found a way to survive, remaining dangerous despite heavy defeat at the hand of the international coalition.  The report estimated that the terrorist group still has up to 30,000 jihadists disseminated mostly in the Middle East and in small cells in cities around the world. It also warned that although ISIS’s military and organizational power has been greatly affected by the international coalition, transforming the group from “proto-state” to “terrorist network,” it is far from completely defeated and continues to pose a serious threat to regional and global stability. “Despite the damage to the bureaucratic structures of the so-called ‘caliphate,’ the collective discipline of Isil is still intact,” the report said. It added, concerning al-Baghdadi: “Although he is reported to have been injured, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi remains in authority.”

Rabat- Several Moroccan towns had their water cut off on Eid al-Adha and protested at water distribution offices. Residents of several towns woke up on August 22, the Eid al-Adha holiday, to find that their water had been cut off without prior notice from their water supplier. The affected towns included Tinjdad in the eastern Draa-Tafilalet region, Ait Milk in the southern Souss-Massa region, Taounate in the northern Rif Mountains, and Ksar el-Kebir in northwest Morocco. On any other day, Moroccans in many regions of the country are obliged to patiently wait when the tap goes dry. However, on Eid al-Adha (the festival of sacrifice), when people use more water than usual to clean up after the sacrifice, the lack of water becomes a crisis to many. In rural areas or villages people rely on wells when tap water is cut off, however in cities there are no wells on which to fall back.  Eid al-Adha is the second of two Islamic holidays celebrated by Muslims worldwide, on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah (the month of pilgrimage) in which the Hajj pilgrimage takes place. On Eid, families gather together to share their joy after performing the morning Eid prayers and making the sacrifice by slaughtering a sheep or goat. Demonstrating both anger and frustration for not being able to enjoy Eid to the fullest extent, dozens of residents in Taounate rallied in protest on Wednesday in front of the office responsible for water distribution, reported Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum. The residents complained about authorities’ lack of action to fix the problem, especially since the region is home to a large reservoir dam, Al Wahda Dam. Ksar el-Kebir residents protested the lack of water in their own way by hanging sheepskins on the gate of the water distributor in the region, Radeel.  In the Draa-Tafilalet region, water is finally back on Thursday, the second day of Eid.

Rabat – Morocco is the first African guest of honor at Beijing’s International Book Fair, August 22-26. Morocco is participating with 1,000 copies of books. Morocco’s collection is made up of books issued from the Moroccan Ministry of Culture, from the archives of Morocco, from the Council of the Moroccan Community Abroad, from the National Council of Human Rights, from the National Library of the Kingdom of Morocco, from the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture, and from the Moroccan National Tourist Office. Morocco’s agenda at the book fair will include academic seminars and conferences, including a symposium on translation and language policy under the theme “The Road to Translation.” The agenda also includes a conference focusing on relations between Morocco and China. Another conference on Moroccan culture under the theme “The Characteristics of Moroccan Culture and Literature” will also take place on the sidelines of the book fair. The Moroccan exhibit will also feature musical performances to showcase Morocco’s cultural heritage. Beijing hosted a reception in honor of Morocco Tuesday night. Morocco’s Ambassador to China Aziz Mekouar attended the ceremony, along with Chinese and international officials and a Moroccan delegation to the book fair. “The participation of Morocco as a guest of honor is a new milestone in the cultural exchanges between the two countries and offers an opportunity to crown the festivities celebrating the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Beijing and Rabat,” said Zhang Jichen, general director of the Society of Import and Export Publications of China. The official also discussed the cultural wealth of Morocco and the diversity of its history, owing to its historical role in building a bridge between other cultures: Africa, Europe, and Asia. Jichen said that the fair represents a good opportunity to reinforce exchanges between the two cultures and the two countries. The Moroccan delegation also expressed satisfaction over the Chinese-Moroccan ties through Hassan El Ouazzani, who is a director of Books, Libraries, and Archives at the Ministry of Culture. El Ouazzani conveyed a message from Morocco’s Minister of Culture Mohamed Laaraj. The minister said he was grateful to the Chinese government, saying that the honor shows the distinguished ties between Morocco and China at the political, economic and cultural levels. He added that the honor “devotes mutual respect between Moroccan and Chinese cultures, two of the oldest cultures in the world.” China has become one of Morocco’s most significant economic partners as the two countries have reinforced their ties in several sectors, including media and tourism. More than 300,000 newly published books from around the world are featured at the book fair, which boasts 2,500 exhibitors from 93 countries and regions.

Rabat – Moroccan footballer Abdelhak Nouri is seeing the light again. The Ajax Amsterdam midfielder has finally woken from a coma one year after his collapse on the pitch.  Nouri, who is still suffering from serious and irremediable brain damage, collapsed on July 8, 2017, during a friendly match between his club Ajax Amsterdam and Werder Bremen in Austria. “Appie,” as he is also called, was suffering from heart disease.  According to Abderrahim Nouri, the player’s brother, who spoke to Dutch channel NOS, Monday, August 20, the player’s “health is better than a few months ago.” He is now “quieter” and able to recognize and communicate with his family, who “stays with him 24 hours a day.”  “His neurological state is better than a few months ago. Physically, it’s hard, it does not move the body, just the head. By gestures, you can communicate with him,” added his brother.  However, Nouri depends on assistance to bathe and get into his wheelchair.  In January, Dutch media revealed that Nouri’s collapse was caused by heart rhythm problems. According to Dutch daily NRC Handelsblad, tests conducted in April 2014 by Ajax revealed the Dutch-Moroccan footballer had a heart disorder. The collapse shocked his family, friends, teammates, and club, leading international footballers to show solidarity and support for the young player and his family. Several months into Nouri’s hospital stay, Ajax fans gathered together outside the Nouri family home, showing support and sympathy for the player’s family and holding signs with the #StayStrongAppie slogan. The footballer was one of the most talented young players in the Netherlands. He started his youth career in 2005 at the age of 7 and played for the Netherlands Under 15, Under 16, Under 17, Under 18, and Under 19 teams.

Rabat – Through the Moroccan Hajj delegation in Mecca, King Mohammed VI has invited Saudi Arabia’s King Salman to visit Morocco. On Wednesday, the Saudi king received Morocco’s Minister of Tourism Mohamed Sajid in Mina, near Mecca. The minister led a Moroccan delegation on the 2018 Hajj pilgrimage. The Moroccan official conveyed a message from King Mohammed VI to King Salman, thanking him for his country’s efforts to facilitate Hajj pilgrims as they performed the Hajj rituals. King Salman also sent his greetings and esteem to the King and the Moroccan people, emphasizing the ties of “fraternity linking the two royal families and the solidity of historical relations between the two peoples.” The Saudi king chaired an address in honor of officials and heads of official delegations in Hajj, where he stressed his country’s determination to consolidate cooperation and to establish peace and security around the world. He added that his country is mobilizing “all its human and financial resources to facilitate the accomplishment of Hajj.” King Salman’s surprise summer destination Known for his summer holidays in Morocco, the 83-year old king chose to spend this year’s summer break in the planned city of Neom, Saudi Arabia, for business matters. Neom is a project which will cost Saudi Arabia more than $500 million to build. It is intended to create more job opportunities in the tech sector and to include a tourist resort. King Salman’s decision to summer in Neom raised speculations on social media and in headlines when Saudi news outlets confirmed the domestic vacation. Moroccan news outlets, including L’Economiste, guessed that the royal decision might have been caused by the last minute campaigning before the vote for the 2026 World Cup host. In the competition between the North American bid and Morocco’s bid, Saudi Arabia launched a strong campaign for North America, disappointing their fellow Arabs in Morocco. Saudi Arabia irritated over Moroccan neutrality Before voting for his country’s “strongest ally,” Saudi Arabia’s General Sports Authority Chairman Turki Al-Sheikh expressed anti-Moroccan sentiments. Morocco’s neutrality in the Gulf crisis between the Saudi coalition and Qatar incensed the Saudi official. Al-Sheikh took to his Twitter to blame Morocco for losing Saudi Arabia’s favor. Al Sheikh tweeted: “Some people went astray. If you want our support, you should seek it in Riyadh. What you are doing is wasting your time. Now ask the pseudo-state to help you,” referring to Qatar. Al Sheikh’s comments did not go unnoticed, especially when Saudi Arabia voted against Morocco on the eve of 2018 World Cup. Fans who followed the Moroccan team to Russia in the 2018 World Cup booed the official.

By Carlo Zanetti Rabat – Besides Morocco’s traditional colorful djellabas and beautiful kaftans, another piece of clothing caught my eye as incredibly popular among men in Rabat’s medina (old city): pirated football shirts, many pirated football shirts.  Even more uniform than the ubiquity of young Moroccans wearing football shirts is that they all seem to have the same, black-and-white striped one: the shirt of Juventus F.C., the team that has been dominating the Italian championship for the last 7 years.  As a “Juve” supporter myself, I thought: “Of course they are all wearing that shirt! It’s certainly going to have the number 4 and the name Benatia on the back: he is the captain of the Moroccan national team!” Once I saw the back of their shirts though, I realized they told a completely different story. Not one Juventus shirt I saw had Mehdi Benatia’s name; they were all consecrated to the international football hero, the player of the moment, among the most acclaimed, envied, and idolized public figures of all time: Cristiano Ronaldo.  A five-time Ballon d’Or winner, Ronaldo joined Juventus on July 10 in a €100 Million deal between the Turin club and Real Madrid. Looking at Ronaldo’s numbers with the Portuguese national team and the clubs he has played for—Sporting Lisboa, Manchester United, and Real Madrid—and his individual achievements, it is self-evident that Cristiano has already earned himself a place in the Olympus of the best footballers of all time, along with Messi, Pelè, and Maradona.  Ronaldo’s stature would probably be enough to justify his fame in Morocco, just like in any other country that has a strong football culture. However, the Portuguese legend appears to have a very special relationship with the North African country, which goes beyond his general international popularity. CR7, as Ronaldo is called in reference to his initials and shirt number, is known to be a loyal visitor of Marrakech, which he once described as “The City of Joy.” He chose the red city as his destination to celebrate New Year’s Eve 2017, which he spent with Moroccan kickboxer Badr Hari and his former teammate Karim Benzema. Cristiano is a real star in Rabat. His name has been by far the most popular answer to my cliche question “Messi or Ronaldo?” Many people believe that at 33, despite his age, CR7 has a lot to offer football. Anwar, a loyal Raja Casablanca supporter, said he is particularly excited about Cristiano’s transfer to Turin, as he expects that “he will bring something new to the table, something different from when he was playing for Real.” Bilal, a student from Meknes, believes that Ronaldo’s good reputation in Morocco “owes much to his humility and his commitment to humanitarian causes, especially his donations to the children of Palestine and Gaza.” The reasons behind Ronaldo’s popularity, however, have definitely reached far beyond the football pitch and the humanitarian causes. Like other sport personalities such as LeBron James, David Beckham, and Michael Jordan, Cristiano’s figure has achieved the final stage of success in today’s Western pop culture: becoming a brand.  It is more than the fact Ronaldo has been an ambassador for some major European and American companies, or that he is regularly featured on video game covers—PES and FIFA, or even that Matt Groening designed a Simpson character inspired by him. (The Simpson feat is quite remarkable, considering how unpopular “soccer” is in the US.)
 Cristiano Ronaldo is actually a brand himself. He owns two eponymous businesses: the underwear brand CR7 and the aftershave and cologne line Cristiano Ronaldo Fragrances.  In Morocco, Cristiano has invested in the luxury hospitality industry. According to Medias24, Juventus’ Number 7 has already signed a deal to open a new hotel in Marrakech. The project, scheduled to launch in 2019, is the product of an already existing partnership between the CR7 trademark and the Portuguese hotel group Pestana, the largest hotel chain in Portugal. The hotel, which will be called “Pestana CR7 Lifestyle,” would be part of an international chain with branches in Spain, Portugal, and the US. As Medias24 has underlined, the hotel’s services are clearly planned to target millennials, arguably the best audience for the Ronaldo brand. Viewing Ronaldo’s popularity in Morocco from a business perspective, his figure begins to assume a different connotation: he is much more than a remarkable sportsman. The new exciting commodity called Cristiano is a synonym of Nike, Armani, FIFA, and skin fade haircuts—in other words, the current Euro-American West. CR7 is a powerful concentrate of all the Western trends which are fashionable among Moroccan men of the younger generations—powerful enough to overshadow his new teammate Benatia, captain of the Moroccan national team, in his own country.  The story the Juve pirated shirts tell, then, might be much deeper than that of a popular sports icon. It might be a story of the appeal of Western consumeristic culture over Moroccan national pride.  Or it might just not be. At the end of the day, although CR7 is a symbol of Western pop culture, it would probably be an exaggeration to say that Mehdi Benatia is considered a “national hero” in Morocco. The people I interviewed in Rabat showed great respect and appreciation for Juventus’ centre back, but not to the point of considering him an idol. As Ramzi, another Raja supporter, pointed out, “Benatia is a competent player when it comes to defense. He knows what he’s doing and thinks before he acts.” Ramzi’s profile of Benatia suggested that Moroccans’ moderate enthusiasm for the captain of their national team might also have to do with the fact that he is a defender, not a striker. He does not have that heroic starring role which, for instance, Mo Salah covers in Egypt. But even if he did, I am not sure whether he would be able to compete with Ronaldo in popularity, due to the central role which CR7 has in Western culture, and, in turn, to the influence which the latter seems to have on the concept of fashion in Rabat. All things aside, Cristiano’s fame appears to have benefitted the local visibility of Juventus, as every sportswear shop in Rabat features Juventus tracksuits and accessories exposed in “pole position.” Like other North African peoples, Moroccans are particularly fond of European football leagues in general. In the early 2000s, Italian teams, such as Milan, Inter, and Juventus, were the most followed in the kingdom. But the economic crisis which hit Italy’s Serie A championship after the corruption scandals of 2006 disfavored the Italian teams and propelled the Spanish teams to favorite status.  Younger generations of Rabat have no doubt: the quality of Spanish football is higher than Italy’s, and the games are more enjoyable to watch. Yazid, a student from Meknes, explained that, unlike Italian teams, the Spanish “play modern football, ‘tikitaka’!” “What makes the difference,” he goes on, “is that in Spain they have the most prestigious football academies. As a consequence, La Liga [Spanish championship] teams can count on younger players, which are faster and more agile.” Nevertheless, despite the supremacy of La Liga, Italians still hope that the arrival of CR7 at Juventus could be a chance for the Serie A to regain the international acclaim it once had abroad. Although appreciation for Cristiano Ronaldo has always been independent of the teams he has played for, his new experience with Juventus might help restore the reputation of Italian football in Morocco, after a decade-long dominion of Real Madrid and Barcelona.

Rabat – More than 2 million Muslims have performed the “stoning of the devil” ritual as part of the Hajj pilgrimage. The act is one of the major rituals in Mina, 5 kilometers to the east of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The ritual marks the end of the Hajj Pilgrimage in Mina.  Dressed in white, thousands of Muslims from different countries across the globe chanted “Allah Akbar” (God is great) and threw stones at pillars or jamrat on Tuesday. The three pillars, called jamarat, represent Satan in Mina. Pilgrims pelt seven stones at each pillar. The ritual honors the prophet Abraham’s stoning of the devil, who attempted to convince him to disobey God’s order. However, the prophet’s determination to obey God and sacrifice his son Ishmael overcame the devil’s temptation, according to the Qur’anic account. Before Abraham carried through and sacrificed his son, God provided a male goat to sacrifice instead to honor Abraham for obeying God’s command. Muslims across the world celebrate Eid al-Adha to commemorate Abraham’s obedience, sacrificing a sheep or a goat. Saudi authorities estimated the number of pilgrims, who are mostly from foreign countries, at 2.4 million. “Our country’s greatest honor is to serve God’s guests,” said King Salman of Saudi Arabia. Morocco’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mustapha Mansouri said the conditions of Moroccan pilgrims’ Hajj experience in 2018 were positive. Approximately 32,000 Moroccan pilgrims performed Hajj this year, the ambassador added.

Rabat – Saudi Arabia keeps eying Moroccan international footballers. Moroccan footballer Aziz Bouhaddouz has officially joined Saudi’s Al Batin club. Al Batin announced Bouhaddouz’s transfer on Twitter on Wednesday, August 22. ???? ?? ???? | ?#?????_???????_???????????? pic.twitter.com/rkkAWGARl6 — ???? ?????? ??????? (@albatinclub) August 22, 2018  The club wrote that the transfer was signed, owing to the support of Turki Al Sheikh, the president of Saudi Arabian Football Federation. Bouhaddouz, who left FC St Pauli for Saudi Arabia’s Batin, also played with the Atlas Lions in the 2018 World Cup. ????? ?? ????? | @Turki_alalshikh
????? ????? ?????? “??????”#?????_???????_???????????? pic.twitter.com/KestMSeTCi — ???? ?????? ??????? (@albatinclub) August 22, 2018  The footballer, however, scored an own goal against Morocco in its first World Cup game against Iran in the final minutes of the game, which ended 0-1. The Atlas Lions left the tournament after the first round. Many Moroccans felt the team was unlucky in referees’ use of video assistant referee (VAR) in the country’s other two games against Portugal and Spain. Bouhaddouz started his career with FC Dietzenbach and moved in 2004 to play with SpVgg 03 Neu-Isenburg. The footballer then spent three seasons with FSV Frankfurt. Saudi Arabia has shown notable interest in Moroccan footballers lately, convincing Morocco’s star Noureddine Amrabat to join Saudi Arabia’s Al Nassr. Saudi Arabia’s Al Hilal also signed Achraf Bencharki in January from Wydad of Casablanca. However, the footballer may leave the Saudi team to join France’s RC Lens in the coming days. Saudi Arabia’s Al Wahda also offered MAD 6 million to recruit Moroccan football player Badr Banoune, who plays currently for Raja of Casablanca, Morocco. Recently, Atlas Lion Karim El Ahmadi signed with Al Ittihad Jeddah for a two-year contract. However, Saudi Arabia does not seem to be a favorite destination for Moroccan football fans as they believe that the teams are not strong enough to help them in their careers.

By Isabella Wang Rabat – The city of Rabat is a testament of its rich history and sophisticated future: from the ancient Chellah to the new marina, the city’s story is on display. History beckons in the ecru sandstone of the Roman ruins and the detailed Islamic-patterned tiled walls and ornate metalwork of the ceilings. On the Almohad gate of Bab Oudaia, the intricate carvings and the gravitas of the high arch harken to the 12th century before revealing a labyrinth of charmingly painted white and blue buildings.  Between the hustle and bustle of the old medina (city), the vibrant manifestations of its historic culture, the Amazigh (Berber) rugs, and the zellige plates, all remind of Morocco’s rich heritage. It is easy to see how Rabat was granted in 2012 a place on UNESCO’s world heritage list. Yet this is a city which also celebrates the new and modern. On the fashion promenade of Avenue Fald Ould Oumeir lies a world of fashion and consumption, where a globalized array of brands have established their shops. The trams running through the city gleam with a silver sheen, gliding on the tracks as the ringing of their bells resound through the open streets filled with new administrative areas and residential and commercial developments.  This is a city which sits on the precipice between modernity and heritage. With more developments planned, the balancing act between old and new will only continue.  As the government focuses on edification and progress, Rabat will undergo a strategic development to become a “green city” and cultural capital. Development projects: an urban revolution Urbanism and modernity is the trajectory for Rabat. In 2014, King Mohammed VI launched his plans to reinvent the city in a program dubbed “Rabat: City of Lights, Moroccan Capital of Culture.” Integrating projects to develop the Bouregreg Valley separating Rabat from its twin city Sale, the program aims to transform Rabat into a global capital, rivalling cities around the world.  At the ceremony launching the urban projects, King Mohammed VI stated, “This five-year program, which will allow the nation’s capital to measure up to the world’s major cities, revolves around seven main areas, namely the promotion of the cultural heritage of the city, the preservation of green spaces and the environment, improving access to local social services, strengthening governance, the revitalization of the urban fabric, boosting economic activity, and strengthening road infrastructure.” The Bouregreg Valley is the main locus of the project. In the past, the valley was marginalized, underused, and neglected. Some areas were used as a dumping ground for household refuse and waste water, while others were used as “bidonvilles” (slums or shanty towns).  With development comes the opportunity to overcome the degradation and an opportunity to reinvigorate the capital’s prestige as an attractive destination.  The Bouregreg Valley Development Agency (AAVB) seeks to rehabilitate the deteriorated environment around the valley, preventing the informal discharge of sewage an industrialized waste which has contaminated the bays for decades and regulating it according to international norms. The project will embody Rabat’s intended status as a green city.  As outlined by the general management plan, the architectural plans show a harmony with the natural environment. The project boasts new public spaces in the forms of hanging gardens, cultural sites, and beaches. At the same time, the erection of a marina and two new ports harken back to the history of when Sale and Rabat provided a haven for ships when Muslims were expelled from Andalusia. Since its inception in 2004, the AAVB has constructed a new marina, two tramways, and Hassan II Bridge. Currently in the works are also commercialization projects, like Bab El Bahr center and the extension of the tramways. Just as AAVB aims to reinvigorate the seas and the shores, other projects seek to embrace the coastal identity of Rabat and Sale. Spanning 11 kilometers, the Saphira Waterfront aims to capitalize on the picturesque Atlantic coastline surrounding Rabat. The project will transform the coast into a bustling marina and a waterfront development with residential, leisure, and business facilities. Rabat’s goals to become a cultural city on the global scale have indeed led to an urbanized revolution.  The Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art already is a manifestation of Rabat’s new urbanism and the government’s will to forge cultural institutions in line with international standards. Under the Wessal Bouregreg Megaproject, the umbrella project behind developing Rabat, the upcoming plans for the Grand Theater of Rabat and the National Museum of Archaeology and Natural Science will extend the project of culturally-prestigious urbanism. Designed by the late Zaha Hadid, an Iraqi-British architect, the Grand Theater’s futuristic layout, glossy white, and sleek lines aim to “transform the cultural and social landscape of Rabat,” as outlined in their plans. Building segregation? Yet, with a focus on the big, bold, and new, the development policies equate Moroccan culture with the construction of large-scale cultural institutions. The new policies compete for international recognition, aiming to attract outsiders, tourists and investors.  As a result, there is little room for local authorities in the design sector to propose cultural initiatives and to improve the local institutions which sustain Morocco’s cultural history and interweave a rich array of Arabic, Amazigh, European, and African influences.  Under the AAVB, a developmental company, Al Maabar, aims to incorporate a new region dedicated to artisan arts and crafts in Bab Al Bahr, a region on the Sale coast. Yet the gentrification of the area into a more upscale, more expensive market could bring competition to the artistry markets in the traditional medinas.  Although encased by the mastery of the high brick walls and Marinid ramparts, the historical medina of Sale has deteriorated; the infrastructure has become worn and access to collective services is difficult.  Competition with a new upscale industry only threatens the commercial existence of the medina and in turn the economic sustenance of its citizens.  With a transformation of Rabat into a thriving global metropolis may also come the neglect of local industries’ needs and development. Expansive projects could cause a worrying divide in the city: between the urbanized and the traditional, new foreign attractions and local industries.   The cultural divide is not only present in Rabat’s industry. The divide extends to the very residents of Rabat.   Indeed, it is a divide which has existed in Rabat for quite some time and derives from Morocco’s history itself. After opposition in Fez, Rabat became the capital of the French protectorate in 1912. The move was a crucial factor in reorganizing and galvanizing the urban hierarchy.  During the rule, Comissaire-Resident General Hubert Lyautey envisioned that the economic and physical development of Rabat should transcend the existing medina. His subsequent decision to build new French quarters, at the time called the European towns outside of the old city catalyzed a polarized urban landscape between “traditional and modern” which still exists.  Now known as Agdal, the European towns have undergone further changes by government and private entities, transforming into high-rise apartments and building complexes, while other districts did not experience the same developments. In the worst cases, buildings have become degraded and slum communities have appeared, such as the Douar Al Haja slum, just 1.5 kilometers east of Agdal.   The disparity in development forged the divide between Moroccan citizens and foreigners. The 2014 census revealed that the outer, more developed neighborhoods Agdal-Ryad and Souissi had a predominantly higher foreign population: Agdal Ryad had a 5.9 percent foreign population and Souissi had 5.2 percent. Meanwhile, the foreign population of all other neighborhoods were approximately 2 percent or lower.  The segregation of residents is only set to grow. The new developmental mega-projects are promoting an urbanism which meets the demands of a globalized middle and upper middle class, and among them the expat class.  With their selective campaigning of opulence and high prices, the projects do not have the same pertinence to the average Moroccan citizen, who is more concerned with issues of affordable living.  According to anthropologist Jamila Bargach, the infrastructural project “will mark the Bouregreg Valley as a space belonging to the wealthy.”  Many academics, like Sami Zemni and Koenraad Bogaert from the Belgian public research institute Ghent University, posit that urban development strategies, such as the Bouregreg project create spatial segregation. They juxtapose privileged zones of inclusion and grandeur for international investors and tourists and the outside spaces where urban poverty and exclusion remain for the average Moroccan.  Hassan, a Rabati local, spoke to Morocco World News about living in Rabat. He stated, “You have 2 Rabats: the old Rabat, it is medina, and the new Rabat is outside the medina. It’s like Paris. If you were to go outside the medina, you wouldn’t know you were in Morocco – the shops with the clothing, the restaurants, the cafes, the bars. Stay in the medina if you want to feel you are in Morocco.”  He continued to comment on the disparities between costs of living. “I stay in the medina because in the medina, you don’t need taxi, don’t need tramway or the car. All is near you. If you go out the medina, always we need taxi, tramway car, and then you need to spend money. If you stay within the medina, you don’t need to spend much money. All the life is cheap. Fifty dirham or 30 dirham you can spend in a day. Out the medina, no, 300, 500 in one day.”  Hassan called into question the presence of the tramways. While the new Rabat-Sale connection is an important facet for the development of Rabat and its connectivity, the tramway is a development that does not contribute to many locals’ needs, particularly since trams are not the most affordable means of transportation.  Hassan’s concerns over the future of Rabat continued, including the traditions of the people, culture, and industry. “In 2 years, the medina will change. In 2020, it will be changed. There are lots of working [construction] men in Rabat. They will change in the medina and outside the medina. People have changed. Their minds have changed. For example, people have changed their clothes, they don’t want to wear the old but now nicer.” He said it while pointing to his own shirt.  His last statement to MWN was: “Old people are dead now. Other people have come and it will change.” Sala al Moustaqbal (“Future of Sale”), an NGO, has emphasized the spatial and socioeconomic segregation of the Bab al Bahr Development as a pressing point of concern. They gathered for a roundtable to discuss the significant issues: the planned three-story buildings will create a barrier between the historical medina of Sale and the riverside.  The proposed Bal Al Bahr development: segregation from the Sale medina What will arise is a physical wall, created by the development, separating the medina of Sale from the quays of Rabat and the Oudaya. Under the plans, Sale’s medina will be enclosed by luxury with the Bab Al Bahr on one side and the bridge and tramway on the other.  Architect Nabil Rahmouni, an initiator behind Sala Al Moustaqbal, stated the project “turned its back on historic patrimony of Salé.” As Beatrice Allain El-Mansouri, who holds a geography doctorate, writes in her novel “The Water and the City of Morocco: Rabat-Sale and Its Periphery,” the medina of Sale is a poorer area, known for its bidonvilles, informal neighborhoods, and social housing. With what El-Mansouri described as the lack of collective services in the medina, the economic stratification between medina and Bab Al Bahr is clear.  By proposing a vision of cosmopolitanism and luxury in the new urban space of Bab Al Bahr, the price of the residences also escalate to match the image of grandeur. As the development’s website currently advertises “The City of Arts offers 390 apartments from 95 to 300m2, whose selling price start at 14,500 MAD” per month.  The cheapest apartment in the complex will cost MAD 1.26 million, which exceeds the typical cost of apartment under social housing of MAD 200,000 to 290,000. The economic disparity between social housing apartments and complexes, the old and the new, will further impose a design of spatial and social segregation.  Indeed, in 2016-2017, inequality increased in the administrative region of Rabat-Salé-Kenitra. Using the measure of the Gini coefficient, inequality has risen from 39.9 to 44.2 between 2001 and 2014 in the region, although it decreased slightly in the country overall.ag The question of slums To counter the growing inequalities, the government has established modernization strategies for the housing sector. “Cities without Slums” is a nationwide program which aims to eradicate slums and improve housing conditions for Moroccan citizens. The program has reportedly benefitted 257,993 families in the whole of Morocco.  However, many are concerned that the program is a façade to justify evictions, which enable the development of public-private partnerships in the construction of new developments, such as the AAVB’s buying of land to build the tramways. Evictions detriment the traditional tribes of Morocco and only exacerbate social inequalities.  Between Sale and Kenitra, a city 30 kilometers to Sale’s north, lives the Ouled Sbita tribe. The elders of the tribe claim that their tribe has lived there since the reign of Sultan Moulay Ismail in the 17th century.  In 2007, state officials approached the tribe to purchase parts of their land for development projects.  The Ministry of Interior sold the land to the Addoha Group with compensation at MAD 55 per square meter.  However, the scope of the project extended beyond the sold land, and compensation was not given accordingly. What has emerged is a marginalization and destruction of Morocco’s culture and wrongful expropriation of the tribe’s land.  The Ouled Sbita tribe are not the only ones who have been wronged.  The AAVB only enables more expropriations to occur. Prior to the Bouregreg project, only 44 percent of the designated land was public, and 56 percent was privately owned. Due to its special legal powers, the AAVB were able to declare the private lands necessary for the public interest and integrate them into the urban planning zone of the Bouregreg Valley Project. The AAVB exists as a special case of de-concentration, negotiating between state and non-state actors. Law No. 16-05 establishes that the AAVB can “take all necessary measures for the realization and honoring of the development plan.”  The government thus prescribes the agency exclusive authority over the project within its legally determined territorial boundaries. The law gives the AAVB the unprecedented power to expropriate land and evict families.  Fostering investment and the economy There is a seemingly compelling economic rationale behind the development projects. King Mohammed VI has commanded large-scale urban and regional developmental programs to promote economic growth. Economic growth is critical for Rabat and Morocco in order to generate taxes for welfare and social development.  The World Bank had predicted that an annual economic growth rate of 5-6 percent is necessary in order to reduce unemployment and poverty in Morocco. The developmental projects in Rabat aim to accelerate the rhythm of investments in Morocco in order to achieve that growth rate.  In its relations with the Gulf region, Morocco has presented itself as an attractive and reliable locus of investment. In total, Morocco attracts 80 percent of all Middle Eastern investments in the Maghreb region. The development projects are a testament to Morocco’s heightening ability to attract foreign investments and adapt to a competitive global investment market.  The urban spectacle that will be the Bouregreg Valley is funded by Abu Dhabi investor Al Maabar, alongside Wessal Capital, a joint venture between the Moroccan Fund for the Development of Tourism and four Gulf Cooperation Council countries: United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. The development projects are an opportunity to increase relations and investment flow from the Arab Gulf.  However, the economic model of investment is dependent on the development projects as leverages of economic growth. Integral to the model are the assumptions of the trickle-down effect and that the grand projects will provide and attract tourists to bring money into circulation.  Riccardo Fabiani, a senior analyst with the Eurasia Group, told Quartz, “There’s no distribution of the benefits of foreign investment to the rest of the economy. It’s like talking about two separate economies.” In Morocco, unemployment is still increasing, rising 4.2 percent from 2016 to 2017. Many, like Ghent University researchers Bogaert and Zemni, view the development projects as only contributing to unemployment, disrupting the traditional occupations of Moroccan society.  The fishing industry is one undergoing disruption. In 2006, the AAVB relocated fishermen to a new platform in order to dig out and dredge the rivers for the construction of a new port.   At the time, the fishermen endured engine breakdowns due to the insufficient depth of water. Disrupting the work flow, fishmongers were also banned access to the docks for supplies during the construction of the docks.  After the new fishing port was constructed in Sale in 2008, disruptions continued. Fishmongers from Rabat had to bear the cost of additional travel to Sale. According to Hicham Mouloudi, chief architect at the Department of Housing, Urban Planning, and City Policy, “Fishermen also believed that the number of boxes contained in the platform was inadequate and the new fishing harbor was too narrow to accommodate the 108 fishing boats allowed.” Festivals: a celebration of Rabat and its people While the mega-projects of Rabat draw in investment and international prestige, the government has also strived to create smaller cultural events which are capturing Moroccan citizens in the new urbanism.  Taking over Rabat annually, Mawazine is a music festival which features a number of international and local artists. It promotes the internationalized and trendy urbanism which defines the modernization strategies of the government.  With free admission, the festival, argues Abbas Azzouzi, executive vice-president of Maroc-Cultures which hosts the event, is critical to the community and civil society of Rabat.  The festival is a tangible manifestation of what Rabat could become as a globalized city: the festival creates job opportunities, incorporates Moroccan businesses, and offers citizens themselves the opportunity to engage with music and culture otherwise inaccessible.  Azzouzi further spoke to the Guardian about the benefits of the festival: “Since its creation in 2001, Mawazine levied itself as a first class economic actor of the city of Rabat. It guarantees long-lasting activity to hundreds of technicians and businesses. Every year, Mawazine continues to increase the revenue of taxis and nearby business, as well as ensuring a full hotel and restaurant occupancy rate. In all, this allows tourism professionals to increase their turnover by 30%.” However, many critics, like Elhadj Ezzahid, professor of economics and finance at Mohammed V University, still see the festival as an extension of the government’s overt focus on prestige urbanism, which ultimately sidelines the interests of the citizens.   Ezzahid posits that the festival has “no lasting  or major effects on the wellbeing of the people in the city,” and believes the government could be focusing funds more on the citizens’ needs, such as social projects. Street art further enables Rabati citizens to embrace the new modern identity of their city, yet, through their own cultural means: the urban alternative culture of street art.   Supported by the government, the annual Jidar Street Art Festival celebrates the public space of Rabat. Featuring a plethora of artists from around the world, the festival democratizes art, enabling citizens to see and feel the city around them in new ways.  Hicham Bahou, co-director of the festival, states “One reason why we develop this project is to transform the street into a cultural venue. Morocco is moving and it’s very dynamic but when you look to education and culture, it’s not the same rhythm of development. Culture is going backwards.” On the walls around them, the street art is an intriguing blend of styles, modern and traditional, and a mix of cultures, local and international. With geometry and calligraphy, evocative of traditional Islamic art, as well as surreal and new postmodern art forms, the street embraces the past and present of Rabat. The street murals enable citizens to both appreciate the local heritage, which is dear to them, as well as envision the future of their increasingly globalized city.  Rabat is forging ahead with grandiose development projects which instill the city with a new vivacity, urbanism, and economic stimulus. Yet there is great beauty and dynamism which lies still in Rabat’s rich heritage and local life. To develop Rabat is to embrace modernity while in constant dialogue with the past and accounting for the myriad of citizens.

Rabat – Morocco has asked Spain and Portugal to form a trio to host the 2030 World Cup, according to Moroccan media. The 2030 bid will be Morocco’s sixth attempt to convince the footballing world of its ability to host the sport’s most celebrated tournament, following the country’s most recent failure in June at the hand of the North American trio (the US, Canada, and Mexico). Most importantly, though, a successful Morocco-Spain-Portugal trio would be the first time that the World Cup would be hosted on two different continents. Choosing realism over the pan-Maghrebi dream According to Al Yaoum 24, the three countries’ sporting authorities have met several times in recent months, and the agreement has already been drafted. The decision will reportedly be officially announced in the coming weeks, as the three countries have decided to only let FIFA know about their plan once everything is settled. The 2030 FIFA World Cup is expected to attract the attention of footballing heavyweights. Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay, have already announced that they will bid to host as a trio. The South Americans plan to campaign on the notion that Uruguay, which hosted the first World Cup in 1930, should be given the right to host the tournament on its 100th anniversary.  England, meanwhile, has given signals of its interest to join the FIFA 2030 contest. Although the European country has yet to announce its final decision, statements and comments from the government, the English FA, and English football fans suggest an equally strong interest. And according to Al Yaoum, Morocco, which has experienced on numerous occasions the high stakes and tough competition that the scramble for the World Cup’s hosting rights entails, has chosen to form a trio with its Iberian neighbors rather than with its North African neighbors. While there have been reports of a Maghreb trio including Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, it was expected that the tense political atmosphere in the region—namely between Algiers and Rabat—would be major obstacle. The tension kept alive, at least from a Moroccan perspective, the possibility of joining forces with Spain and Portugal. Whereas activists, football fans, and cultural workers had expected that football would unify a divided Maghreb, authorities seem to have chosen—should Al Yaoum’s allegations be true—a more politically realistic partnership. “Morocco will bid to host the World Cup in 2030—there is no doubt about that. But we have not yet decided on the co-hosts. The decision will be politically discussed,” said Fouzi Lekjaa, the president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) when asked whether Morocco would definitely bid in a trio with Algeria and Tunisia.

Morocco’s head coach, Herve Renard, has not yet revealed his official list of footballers who will play in the qualifiers of for competition, which will start in September. Bencharki’s transfer to the Saudi club made headlines, creating a heated debate between those who support his move and those who advised him to turn down the Saudi offer. Many news outlets reported that Herve Renard was not supportive of the striker’s transfer to Al Hilal. Bencharki’s performance with Wydad of Casablanca in the African Champions League in 2017 received wows. Bencharki played a key role in helping his team win the continental title by scoring five goals in the tournament. Bencharki also represented Morocco in the African Nations Championship (CHAN) 2018, which took place in Morocco from January 13 to February 4.  Bencharki scored a magnificent goal in Morocco’s opening match of the tournament against Mauritania. Morocco went on to win the championship title.

Rabat – El Othmani has said that his cabinet will introduce a new development strategy dedicated to Morocco’s youth and employment challenges.  The head of government appears to have taken good notes during King Mohammed VI’s speech Monday, August 20, on the 65th anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the People, which focused on youth and Morocco’s development. In a statement to Le36, Saad Eddine El Othmani said that he will convene his team in the “coming days” for a meeting to make final decisions on strategy in response to King Mohammed VI’s expectations. El Othmani aims to meet the expectations of Morocco’s youth and to curb unemployment in the country. The head of government also welcomed the guidelines introduced by King Mohammed VI to empower the young people of Morocco. “We have a heavy responsibility to young people and each and every one of us has to take this responsibility.  By everyone, I mean the cabinet, political parties, unions and civil society,” said El Othmani. He added that the government “must act now and work tirelessly to carry out these projects on which the sovereign has insisted very much.” The head of government, who is also the secretary general of the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD), promised that his party “will engage in the rapid implementation of these reforms.” In his recent speech, the King renewed his call for the government to increase efforts to tackle social disparities and to introduce reforms that would revive education, administration, and other sectors. He also ordered the cabinet to devise an “integrated strategy” to improve education and training in Moroccan universities and vocational schools and create an attractive work environment for foreign-educated Moroccan youth to return home. The King also described the youth of Morocco as “the country’s true wealth” promising them that the country seeks to “rise to the challenge of completing the construction of modern Morocco; a revolution through which we aim to give Moroccans the place they deserve in life, especially our young people.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI’s newly-appointed minister of economy, Mohamed Benchaaboun, has already garnered positive vibes in Morocco’s political circles. Chief among the host of plaudits that followed Benchaaboun’s appointment is his excellent reputation for diligent and purpose-driven projects, which he demonstrated during his long career as an executive, especially his 10-year tenure as CEO of Morocco’s Central Popular Bank (BCP), one of the country’s most successful and revered financial institutions.  At the National Rally of Independents (RNI)—the political party under whose flagship the newly-appointed minster will be overseeing the economy and finance department in the El Othmani-led government—reactions to Benchaaboun’s appointment were overwhelmingly positive. Reacting to Benchaaboun’s appointment, Aziz Akhannouch, the minister of agriculture and also RNI chairman, made welcoming remarks, praising the new economy and finance minister for his professional qualities and the good reputation he earned in his numerous executive positions.  According to the RNI chief, the new finance minister was a confidante of the party and a regular consultant on various strategic decisions long before his direct involvement in the country’s political life.  The RNI chairman also asserted that the new minister shares similar values with the party, primarily for Benchaaboun’s notable marriage of royalist and liberal-leaning reforms in his previous functions. Under Benchaaboun’s decade-long tenure at BCP, the bank’s net revenues increased, exceeding the MAD 16 billion threshold for the first time and consolidating its leadership position in Morocco’s banking sector.  During the same period, BCP also extended its continental and global outreach, acquiring banks in 13 countries throughout Africa and inaugurating a representative office in the US in November 2015.  Of Benchaaboun’s established reputation as a diligent CEO and strategist in the private sector, Akhannouch said the private sector has always had a “crop of highly talented officials fully dedicated to Morocco’s socio-political advancement and economic prosperity.” Akhannouch said he believed that Benchaaboun will live up to his reputation. He added, “Mr. Benchaaboun has always been a resource that the party sought to have in its ranks on various occasions, for counsel and his expertise on numerous dossiers.”  “The party is proud to be able to be able to count on such competencies,” Akhannouch said.

Rabat –  Moroccans will celebrate Eid al-Adha on August 22 , by sacrificing a sheep or goat and enjoying traditional holiday dishes. Besides the significance of Eid al-Adha in Islam, the feast represents a special and unique feast in the North African country and Muslim countries in general. In Morocco, there are many traditions with this religious holiday; the most significant is the sacrifice of a sheep or goat, at least one-year-old. Following the Eid prayer in the morning, custom requires the head of the family to slaughter the sheep or goat using a sharp knife to end his suffering quickly. Traditional Moroccan Eid dishes The process of preparing the meat is the most important Moroccan tradition. During the four days of Eid, despite the expensive price of meat, families serve meat-rich dishes using various parts of the animal’s body, such as the head, stomach, and feet. Moroccans tend to be very frugal, using up all the parts of the animal. There are special dishes which use the head, tail, intestines, stomach, and feet. Even the brains, fat, and testicles do not go to waste. On the first day of Eid, most families serve stomach specialties of the sheep, as well as liver covered in fat. This may seem strange and high in cholesterol, but the barbecued dish is a favorite among many Moroccans.  In the evening of the first day, the perfect dish is couscous with the sheep’s head or with fresh shoulder meat and the seven vegetables: onions, zucchini, pumpkin, carrots, cabbage, tomato, kohlrabi and sometimes sweet potato. Chickpeas and chili are also among the important ingredients in couscous. On the following day, Moroccans serve an all meat barbecue, salads, and mkhmar or batbout, a semi flat bread cooked in a frying pan. Mrouzia is also one of the most important dishes served in the week of Eid al-Adha. The dish combines sweet, salty, and spicy ingredients in a meat tajine (Moroccan stew). In addition to the sacrifice, the holiday is an opportunity for Moroccan families to strengthen their relationships, exchanging visits and gathering around the same table to share delicious traditional dishes. Eid al-Adha is also for other Moroccans a time to rush to markets dedicated to traditional clothing, where they buy new traditional clothes to accompany the atmosphere of the sacred festival. A significant Islamic holiday In Islam, Eid al-Adha (the Feast of Sacrifice) celebrates the end of the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca. Every Muslim celebrates the holiday, even if he did not make the pilgrimage that year. It is one of the most important times of the year for Muslims who celebrate, surrounded by their loved ones, the ritual of sheep sacrifice. Although modernism is beginning to invade homes, many families still keep the tradition of the holiday. The sacrificed sheep is cooked and shared. The symbolic significance of the ritual of sacrifice is therefore also that of sharing with the poor, mutual help, and generosity. A large part, a third normally, is given to the poor. It is a very happy moment, and the atmosphere is generally warm. From delicious breakfasts to joyful family gatherings and the generous offering of sacrifice meat to the poor, Eid al-Adha offers a beautiful celebration, not only to Moroccans but to Muslims worldwide.  Why slaughter the sheep? The ritual commemorates Abraham’s sacrifice. According to the Qur’an, God had subjected Abraham to a severe test of his fidelity and piety: God had asked him to sacrifice his son Ishmael, which Abraham finally accepted. While Abraham was leading his son to his fate, God, grateful, sent him a sheep to replace Ishmael on the sacrificial place. The act of slaughter is credited to Abrahm’s good deeds since the prophet emphasized in a hadith: “For every hair, you will receive a good action.”

Rabat – The King’s Eid royal pardon allegedly included some Hirak Rif activists who were sentenced to prison for their involvement in unauthorized protests in Al Hoceima. Major news outlets and international television channels, including Al Hadath, announced the news Tuesday evening. Al Hadath initially reported that the King granted his royal pardon to 11 of the activists. The television channel then quoted an unidentified source close to the King, who confirmed the news, but estimated the number of absolved members at 180. Morocco’s Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid confirmed the news on Facebook, emphasizing that 184 activists were released. Of those, 173 were charged in Al Hoceima’s court, according to the minister. Morocco’s state-owned press, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), announced that the King granted a royal pardon to a total of 889 prisoners today—the eve of Eid al-Adha. However, the state news agency did not mention any of the Hirak Rif activists. Moroccan news outlet Hespress quoted a member of the Hirak Rif activists’ defense team, Mohamed Ghanaj, who claimed that 11 Hirak activists who were jailed in Casablanca’s Oukacha prison benefited from the royal pardon. Ghanaj added that the pardoned activists had all originally been sentenced to less than 3 years. Francophone news outlet Le Desk announced that the King ordered the release of 160 Moroccan activists. The Casablanca Court of Appeals issued sentences ranging from 1 to 15 years in prison to 49 activists on June 26 for activists and protesters involved in the 2016-2017 Al Hoceima protests. However the Hirak movement’s prominent leaders, Nasser Zefzafi and Nabil Ahemjik, received 20 years in prison. Two others, Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid also received 20 years. The total number of Hirak activists arrested between 2016 and 2018 is estimated at more than 400 activists. The 53 activists sentenced in June were prosecuted for “undermining the internal security of the state,” and “preparing a conspiracy against internal security.” The activists were found guilty of several serious charges, including participation in the unauthorized demonstrations that broke out in the northern Al Hoceima province after the death of a local fishmonger, Mouhcine Fikri, in October 2016. When a policeman confiscated his fish, Fikri climbed on top of a garbage truck to retrieve his goods. The crushing mechanism of the truck activated and crushed him fatally.  The incident caused outrage and protests in Al Hoceima and the surrounding areas. Chanting social slogans, the protesters decried social disparities in the region.

Rabat – The ministerial council chaired by King Mohammed VI on Monday pinpointed the King’s priorities, calling for more efforts to overcome Morocco’s social and economic challenges. The council was held in the Royal Palace of Rabat prior to the King’s speech on the 65th anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the People. The spokesperson of the Royal Palace, Abdelhak Lamrini, read a statement following the ministerial council.  Lamrini’s statement, which was televised after the royal speech, listed the major points discussed during the meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit gave a presentation on the general orientations of the state’s policy for administrative decentralization. The presentation followed King Mohammed VI’s repeated calls for his government to reform the administration to improve the quality of services within Moroccan public institutions to serve the demands of Moroccan citizens. The measure, according to King Mohammed VI, is a necessary and urgent project that aims to advance regionalization, promote economic and social development, encourage investment and job creation, and improve the quality of social services. According to the statement, the policy also defines the principles and new rules that govern relations between the central and decentralized administration in order to guarantee effective management and ensure coherence between public policies. Education reforms are necessary The King reiterated his stance on the importance of education and training for the country’s development. During the meeting, the officials approved a draft framework law on the country’s education, training, and scientific research. The projects envision an irreversible reform of the national education system. The project also falls within the King’s renewed recommendation for ownership of the reform and collective and serious support for its implementation. The main points of the project include the establishment of a new school open to all capable of serving and guaranteeing quality education for all. The King urged the government to introduce a new educational model to develop the learner’s capacities as well as to encourage critical thinking and creativity. The ministerial council asserted that successful conditions for the reform would be guaranteed if there was an institutional mechanism to monitor its implementation. The measure, according to the statement, is part of the strategic vision 2015-2030, which is the result of a national consensus and a broad dialogue involving the parties concerned.

The Ministry of the Royal Household, Protocol, and Chancellery announced the news today. Local television and radio channels will broadcast the prayer starting 10:30 a.m. Eid al-Adha falls in Dhu al-Hijjah, a sacred month in the Islamic calendar in which the Hajj pilgrimage takes place. Eid al-Adha, which is the second of two Islamic holidays celebrated by Muslims worldwide, commemorates the day that the prophet Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son, but God intervened by providing a ram as a sacrifice. In the morning of Eid al-Adha, thousands of Muslim men across the globe dress up in white traditional clothes, especially djellabas. Men then head to mosques to perform the Eid prayers. After the prayers, the family gathers to experience the joy of Eid as the father or the oldest brother slaughters a sheep or goat. Sometimes families also sacrifice a cow or even a camel.  Part of the meat is donated to needy and poor people.

Rabat – Morocco celebrates Youth Day on August 21 to commemorate the struggle of the Moroccan youth who were actively involved in achieving independence. The day is also a landmark to celebrate past youth’s contributions to the strength of the kingdom in all aspects of society and the younger generation’s contribution today. Youth Day is celebrated on King Mohammed VI’s birthday, August 21. King Mohammed VI was born on August 21, 1963. He is the twenty-third King of the Alaouite dynasty. He ascended to the throne on July 23, 1999, upon the death of his father, the late King Hassan II. Before Mohammed VI’s ascension to the throne, Youth Day was celebrated on July 9, the day Hassan II was born. When Mohammed VI was crown prince, King Hassan II entrusted him with many tasks and appointed him as an envoy to the leaders of brother countries. He also participated in many forums, at the national, Arab, Islamic, African, and international levels. King Mohammed VI’s early responsibilities At the age of four, King Mohammed VI accompanied his father on an official visit to the US February 9-10, 1967. His first official mission abroad was on April 6, 1974, when, at age 10, he represented his father at the religious mass at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, following the death of the then French president George Pompidou. The prince also represented his father at the funeral of Emperor Hirohito of Japan on February 23, 1989. King Mohammed VI made a tour of African countries, from July 23 to 30, 1980, where he met with the presidents of Senegal, Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire, Cameroon, and Nigeria. He delivered personal letters from his father, King Hassan II. The monarch also made an official visit to Saudi Arabia between March 11 and 18, 1986, and to Japan from March 7 to 21, 1987. He also presided over the Moroccan delegations which participated in several international and regional conferences, including: He also chaired the organizing committee of the 9th Mediterranean Games in March 1982 in Casablanca and the organizing committee of the 6th Pan Arab Games on April 11, 1985. The King’s education King Mohammed VI attended Qur’anic school at the Royal Palace at the age of four. He then completed his primary and secondary studies at Royal College. In 1981, the King obtained a baccalaureate degree and then his bachelor’s degree in law in 1985 from Mohammed V University in Rabat. His research paper focused on “the Arab-African Union and the Strategy of the Kingdom of Morocco in matters of International Relations.” On November 26, 1985, the monarch was appointed colonel major of the Royal Moroccan Army (FAR). In 1987, the monarch received higher studies certificate (CES) in political sciences and then obtained a Master of Advanced Studies (DEA) in public law in 1988. In 1993, the King received his PhD in law with distinction from University of Nice Sophia Antipolis in France for his thesis “EEC (European Economic Community)-Maghreb Relations.” He then served as the coordinator of the Offices and Services of the Royal Armed Forces until 1994, when he became commander in chief of the Royal Moroccan Army. In addition to Arabic, King Mohammed VI speaks French, Spanish, and English.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has thanked the UN and the AU for their resolve to find a political settlement in Western Sahara. Speaking last night in commemoration of the 65th anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the People, King Mohammed VI highlighted his resolve to invest more efforts and resources to solve Morocco’s youth issues, especially the quality of education and job opportunities. Despite the speech’s focus on a domestic agenda, the King also made a special mention of the recent international developments in the territorial dispute in Western Sahara.  Morocco ready to negotiate The King pointed out Morocco’s readiness to “confidently and responsibly” engage with the UN Security Council and the international community in the search of an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the territorial dispute between Morocco and the Polisario Front.  Moroccans have always been galvanized by values of “unanimity, cohesion and sacrifices” when it comes to upholding the country’s territorial integrity, the King said. He explained that he is “pleased to note that there is increasing compatibility between these principles and the stances adopted by the international community.” “Indeed, the recent resolutions of the UN Security Council and the African Union confirm, without a shadow of a doubt, that the United Nations Organization has exclusive authority to manage the political process relating to this question.” AU’s ‘positive reaction’ to Morocco The King’s mention of the United Nations’ “exclusive authority” was a direct reference to the African Union’s recent decision to refrain from having “a parallel agenda” in the Western Sahara territorial conflict. In the AU Western Sahara report presented on July 1, the continental organization said that it would respect the “required cohesion” with the UN’s stance by “prioritizing and supporting” the UN-led negotiations in Western Sahara. The report was delivered by AU Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat at the 31st AU Summit for Heads of States in Nouakchott, Mauritania. “The AU Conference of Heads of States and Chiefs of Governments will lend effective support to the UN-led peace process based on the relevant proposals of the UN Security Council,” the report said. It noted that the AU would act in harmony with the UN framework to push towards a “fair, sustainable, and mutually acceptable political solution.” The AU’s new stance has been perceived as a historic nod to Morocco’s position. It was the first time that the AU took such a direction in the decades-long dispute in Western Sahara. King Mohammed VI underscored his “appreciation” of the move. “I should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks and appreciation to the leaders of African sister nations who have reacted positively to Morocco’s principled stances and responded to the call of the Security Council, which invited the members of the international community to support its efforts,” the King said yesterday in his speech.

Rabat – Algeria is taking the idea seriously. The Algerian cabinet is expected to study a possible joint Maghreb bid to host the 2030 World Cup. The government is expected to study the request in its September ministerial council. Algerian news outlet Ennahar quoted a “reliable source,” who said the president of the Algerian football federation. Kheireddine Zetchi, will submit an official request to Algerian Minister of Youth and Sports Mohamed Hattab on the bid. The request will be for a joint Maghreb bid, uniting Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria. The idea also received applause from the leaders of the North African Football Union (UNAF) at a seminar last Saturday in Tunis. Morocco lost its bid to win the hosting rights for the FIFA 2026 World Cup. However, the country is determined more than ever that its next try will be successful. Both Tunisia and Algeria welcomed the idea of hosting a united Maghreb bid. The president of the Tunisian Football Federation (FTF), Wadie Jary, told BBC in July that his country is open to the idea. “We have not received any official offers, but we are open to this idea and we would like that to happen,” he said. In the same month, Algeria’s Hattab said that “with the sports infrastructure that was built, Algeria is ready to study a possible joint bid.”  Morocco has not yet decided on the possibility of a joint bid. Head of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) Fouzi Lekjaa said in July that the possibility of bidding jointly with neighboring countries is still undecided. For many, including  the secretary-general of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), Taib Baccouche, a Maghreb bid would be strong enough to win the rights to host the World Cup as FIFA’s president expressed recently that he prefers joint bids. In an interview with Jeune Afrique in July, Baccouche said that the “Maghreb has a real card to play this time.” “The idea was born after two observations: the official support of all the Maghreb for the Moroccan bid and the choice of a World Cup held by three countries in 2026.” “All this convinced us, at the general secretariat of the UMA, to coordinate a Maghreb bid for 2030 and to start the process,” he added. Although Morocco did not study the possibility of a Maghreb joint bid, the North African nation could surprise football fans with a joint bid with Spain. The president of the Spanish Royal Football Federation, Luis Rubiales, told news outlet EFE that there would be more cooperation between Morocco’s FRMF and the Spanish federation. His remarks were made on the sidelines of a conference before the Spanish Super Cup, which was played in Tangier on August 12. Rubiales’ administration also pledged that the joint bid is still under discussion, according to EFE. According to Baccouche, there will be a number of bids presented to FIFA to host the tournament. “By 2030, there will be an Asian bid from China and probably one from three South American countries. The competition is serious, but Africa has not often had a chance.” Morocco may also face another strong bid from countries in the UK.

Rabat- King Mohammed VI has removed the Secretariat of State in Charge of Water, headed by Charafat Afilal, at the proposal of the head of government. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani recommended the King incorporate the secretariat into the Ministry of Equipment, Transport, and Logistics, with the aim to improve the management of water-related projects in the kingdom. The King claimed water issues are of “high importance” to him. The decision was also made to “enhance integration and consistency between all the bodies concerned with water management in the ministry,” according to the communique of the Royal Palace released on Monday, August 20. The dismissal of Charafat Afilal and her department is another surprise move after the sacking of the minister of economy and finance, Mohamed Boussaid. The King appointed Mohamed Benchaaboun to replace Boussaid, at the proposal of El Othmani. In accordance with the King’s powers in Article 47 of the 2011 constitution, the King sacked Boussaid on August 1. Boussaid was sacked after the head of the Court of Auditors, Driss Jettou, and the head of Bank al Maghrib, Abdellatif Jouahri, presented reports on the eve of Throne Day, July 29. The annual reports on Morocco’s financial situation in 2017 focused on the management of the accounts handled by all ministers, revealing management dysfunctions in more than 100 accounts by general directors, senior officials, and ministers. Also in August, the government sacked 76 officials, including accountants and presidents of municipalities, provinces, prefectures, and regional councils, for bad management. Morocco’s water projects, such as Al Hoceima Manarat Al Moutawsit projects in the the northern Rif region, are set to improve the potable water situation in the country. With respect to potable water supply in urban areas, Morocco’s National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) will invest MAD 300 million to carry out potable water projects until 2035. ONEE aims for water flow speed to reach 200 liters per second. To raise public awareness of the importance of water and its conservation, the King has ordered the government to launch an awareness campaign in partnership with NGOs and other institutions.

Rabat – The newly-appointed Moroccan economy minister, Mohamed Benchaaboun, has made a successful career in banking and finance in Africa. King Mohammed VI appointed Benchaaboun, 56, as minister of economy and finance on Monday. Benchaaboun replaces the former economy minister, Mohamed Boussaid, whom the King sacked on August 1. Since February 2008, Benchaaboun has served as CEO of Morocco’s Central Popular Bank (BCP), a position he was appointed to by the King. Benchaaboun was born on November 12, 1961. In 1984, he graduated from Telecom ParisTech (ENST), a public institution of higher education and engineering research in France. Benchaaboun began his career at Alcatel Alstom Maroc as director of development strategy and management control. He then became industrial director at the same company, overseeing 5 plants and 800 people for about 10 years. Benchaaboun previously held a position within the Ministry of Economy and Finance as director of the Administration of Customs and Indirect Taxes between 1996 and 1999. He joined BCP for the first time in 2001 as deputy director general. He served in the position until 2003 when the King appointed him as director general of the National Telecommunications Regulatory Agency (ANRT), the public body responsible for the control and regulation of the telecommunications sector. In 2008, the minister served as CEO of BCP. During Benchaaboun’s management of BCP, the bank group consolidated its position as the country’s leading bank and acquired many banks on the continent and now has banks in 13 African countries. At the end of 2017, the net banking income “exceeded for the first time the symbolic threshold of MAD 16 billion, to reach MAD 16.36 billion,” according to the African Press Agency (APA). Benchaaboun also served as an expert for the International Monetary Fund. The newly appointed minister is vice-president of the International Confederation of BCP. He is also a member of the Economic, Social and Environmental Council (CES); a board member of the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity; a member of the Mohammed VI Foundation for the Promotion of Social Works, Education and Training, and a member of the Lalla Salma Foundation against Cancer. In April 2010, Benchaaboun received the Ouissam al Arch, a military decoration bestowed by the King. First to open Moroccan bank representative office in US In November, 2015, Benchaaboun, as CEO of BCP, inaugurated a new representative office in Washington, D.C. This made BCP the first Moroccan bank to open a representative office in the US. The representative office “will facilitate the business relationship of the Moroccan community with BCP and put at the disposal of all of its customers the necessary information on financial products and services offered by the bank in Morocco,” said Benchaaboun during the inauguration celebration. The office would also “give potential American investors a better window on opportunities available under the bank’s programs, and allow us to bring all of the Group’s expertise to bear on implementing those opportunities,” he added. On the occasion, Benchaaboun stated that BCP would take necessary measures to establish agreements with major US financial institutions to make secure money transfers faster and at a reduced cost for Moroccans.

Rabat – A Moroccan ministerial council has approved a draft bill to reintroduce mandatory military service for young Moroccan men and women. The council, which met Monday, was quite eventful. King Mohammed VI chaired the event at which several major issues were discussed, including Bill 44.18 on compulsory military service. The bill has fueled debate among Moroccans of all ages. Like Monday’s government council, the ministerial meeting also approved the bill. However, details were only unveiled later in the evening after both councils approved it. The draft bill must be passed by Parliament to come into effect. According to a statement issued after the ministerial council, the government asserts that the purpose of compelling military service is to “inculcate the spirit of citizenship in young people as part of a correlation between the rights and duties of citizenship.” The bill on military services is in accordance with Article 38 of Morocco’s constitution, emphasizing that citizens—both men and women—should contribute to the defense of the homeland and its territorial integrity. For this purpose, citizens would be subject to mandatory military service in accordance with the terms and conditions in the bill. Are women included? The answer is yes. Both men and women aged 19 to 25 are subject to a 12-month military service, according to the bill. Article 1 of the bill says that people with a physical illness certified by a medical report would be exempt from the service. Young students and people who support their families financially can also be exempted. The bill determines the cases of exemption and that an individual whose exemption expires—due to finishing schooling, for example—may still be called upon for service until the age of 40. Young people who have been sentenced on criminal charges or to an imprisonment of more than six months are excluded from military service until they are rehabilitated, according to Article 2. You people in the military service will receive payment at the end of the training period, according to Article 5. Article 6 of the bill noted that the conscripts are “subject to military laws and regulations, including Law Number 108-13 on military justice, Law Number 01-12 on fundamental guarantees for the FAR [Royal Armed Forces] military and Decree Number 1-74-383 approving the regulations of the general discipline in the FAR.” According to the same article, the conscripts will receive grades according to FAR’s current hierarchy standards. Conscripts with technical or professional skills, according to Article 7 of the bill, may be called to fulfill specific missions within military administrations after completing the common basic training governed by the provisions of Articles 37 and 38 of FAR’s regulations on general discipline. Conscripts who do not belong to a certain category, such as civil servants and public sector employees, would benefit from pay and allowances at rates fixed by regulation, according to Article 8. The reward, according to the same regulation, is exempt from any tax. Clothing and food would be provided for individuals in all grades, according to Article 9. Article 10 of the bill emphasizes that conscripts will benefit from medical coverage, death and disability insurance, and medico-social assistance.  Article 13 of the bill warns potential conscripts that after their release, they must keep all information confidential, in particular anything concerning the facts, information, and documents of which they have been informed. According to Article 15, people who miss the authorities’ call without giving strong justification would be punished with one to three months in prison and a fine of MAD 2,000 to MAD 5,000. Many Moroccans applauded the idea, emphasizing that it would be an excellent idea if the younger relatives of officials and ministers were not exempted. It all started with a press release issued Friday, August 17. The cabinet said that it would discuss “Bill 44.18 on Military Function” at the government council on Monday, August 20. To some people, the government’s decision to discuss the obligatory military service was a surprise. Some media outlets questioned whether such an action could be taken “overnight.” However, the bill received a nod from Monday’s ministerial council, as well as from the government council. First, the government council approved the bill on compulsory military service. A few hours before King Mohammed VI’s speech for the 65th anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the People, the monarch chaired a ministerial meeting where the question was discussed. In the King’s presence, the ministerial council approved the bill. However, the details of the bill were only unveiled last night after King Mohammed VI’s speech to the nation. If passed in parliament, it would not be the first time Morocco has mandatory military service. On June 9, 1966, Morocco introduced an 18-month mandatory military service in accordance with Royal Decree 137-66. Morocco reduced the length of service to 12 months in 1999. But in 2006, King Mohammed VI abolished mandatory military service. Other countries with compulsory military service include: Egypt, Cyprus, Greece, Turkey, Ukraine, Russia, Burma, Thailand, South Korea, and North Korea.

Rabat- Casablanca’s judiciary police have arrested seven individuals suspected of fraud, including three brothers selling forged Hajj visas to pilgrims. According to the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), the suspects were involved with a criminal ring specializing in fraud and manipulation. They were arrested on August 17 and 18 in Casablanca; Inezgane, near Agadir; and Oualidia village, south of Casablanca near El Jadida. The ring is allegedly engaged in criminal activities: hacking into systems and accessing personal data, such as bank accounts from European countries, to transfer money.  In the homes of the suspects, the police found technological equipment and items such as victims’ bank receipts and SIM cards the group used to carry out fraudulent phone calls. The three brothers, Zakaria, Abdelkarim, and Yassir Asenghour, have allegedly distributed fake moujamala (Hajj visas) and fake plane tickets for pilgrims heading to Saudi Arabia. Abdelkarim allegedly produced a total of 200 falsified visas for the fake passports provided to him by another accomplice, Mohamed Ouchen. The visa forger and passport forger allegedly received MAD 1.3 million and 1.4 million in exchange for their forgeries. The DGSN reports that on the eve of Ramadan, Abdelkarim sold plane tickets to Ouchen for umrah (the pilgrimage to Mecca performed at any time of the year). However since some of the tickets were cancelled, Abdelkarim promised to compensate Ouchen for the loss by making fake moujamala visas. The suspects were all placed in custody under the supervision of the public prosecutor for further investigation.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has called on the Moroccan government to put youth at the center of new development model Speaking on the 65th anniversary of the Revolution of the King and People, the King said that Morocco’s rising number of unemployed youth is one of the biggest impediments to the realization of the aspirations and development projects the North African country has heavily invested in for the past decade.  Describing Morocco’s youth as “the country’s true wealth,” the King promised that despite major obstacles to come, “we seek to rise to the challenge of completing the construction of modern Morocco; a revolution through which we aim to give Moroccans the place they deserve in life, especially our young people.” The King instructed the government to devise an “integrated strategy” to upgrade education and training in Moroccan universities and vocational schools and create an attractive work environment for foreign-educated Moroccan youth to return home. Achieving such goals requires that there be incentives to convince young people to be drivers and actors in the country’s march towards further political stability and economic prosperity.  “We cannot ask young people to do their duty without making sure they have the necessary qualifications and opportunities,” he said. The King promised that the social inclusion aspect of the new development model would ensure quality eructation and better job prospects. The King also said that the deepening youth unemployment is “a deeply concerning matter” that requires the government to “enhance their confidence and give them hope in the future.” An extension of the Throne Day speech The King emphasized the social inclusion and effective public administration spirit of the Throne Day speech he gave on July 29.  “As an extension of the orientations outlined in my Throne Day speech, we have to urgently draw attention to youth employment, namely training and educational system. We can no longer accept that our education system continue to function like an unemployment -producing machine.” The King called on education authorities, job creators, and political actors to create an environment that reduces the growing disconnect between graduates’ skills and labor market demands, but also promotes the creation of small and medium-level businesses and self-employed graduates. “Youth issues are not restricted to training and employment opportunities. They also involve a broadening of intellectual horizons, mental well-being and improved health standards.” The king’s remarks on the dire situation of Morocco’s youth come amid reports of desperation and socio-economic frustration among young Moroccans due to inadequate development programs, a failing education model, and sluggish economic activities. Ahmed Lahlimi, the head of the High Commission for Planning (HCP), Morocco’s leading planning and economic forecasting institution, told Reuters earlier this month that one-third of Moroccan graduates are unemployed.  Lahlimi slammed slow economic growth and the underperforming education system as the two main reasons for the country’s labor market’s failure to absorb the increasing number of jobless Moroccan youth.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI delivered a speech to the nation on Monday, on the 65th anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the People. Here follows the full text of the royal speech: “Praise be to God, May peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, His Kith and Kin Dear Citizens, Today, we are proudly commemorating the anniversary of the glorious Revolution of the King and the People – an event which means so much to us. Although it took place in difficult circumstances, it was an enlightening revolution. It taught Moroccans the true meaning of patriotism and helped us move forward. Today, we are witnessing the dawn of a new revolution – one in which we seek to rise to the challenge of completing the construction of modern Morocco; a revolution through which we aim to give Moroccans the place they deserve in life, especially our young people, whom I have always regarded as the country’s true wealth. Dear Citizens, In the speech I delivered at the State Opening of Parliament, I emphasized the need to put young people at the center of the new development model. I also called for the preparation of an integrated youth strategy and asked that special consideration be given to finding the most effective means to improve young people’s circumstances. Indeed, we cannot ask young people to do their duty without making sure they have the necessary qualifications and opportunities. We must give our young people what they need in the areas of education, employment, health and so on. More importantly, we must enhance their confidence and give them hope in the future… Enabling young people to engage in social and professional life is not a favor. Every citizen, whatever his or her social background, is entitled to the same opportunities, to a good education and to a decent job. It pains me to see that the unemployment rate among young people remains high. It is not right that one in four youths should be unemployed, despite Morocco’s overall economic growth record. The figures are even more disturbing in urban areas. Despite the efforts made, the major economic projects launched and the social programs being implemented, the results achieved do not measure up to my ambitions in this regard. In keeping with the spirit and the policy set out in the State of the Nation Address, I wish to draw attention, once again, to the urgent issue of youth employment, particularly its connection with the education and training system. We cannot let our education system continue to produce unemployed people, especially in certain branches of study, where graduates – as everyone knows – find it extremely hard to access the job market. Not only is this an outright waste of public resources and of young people’s energies, but it also hinders development and affects the living conditions of many Moroccans. Strangely enough, many investors and businesses are having difficulty finding the skilled resources they need in a number of trades and specialized sectors. Many young people, especially those with advanced university degrees, are considering leaving the country, not just because of attractive incentives abroad, but also because they do not find the right environment and conditions at home for employment, career advancement, creativity and scientific research. Generally, the same reasons discourage a number of Moroccan students abroad from coming back home to work once they finish their studies. In light of the above, I call for a serious, responsible approach to deal with the issue and to offer the attractive incentives needed as well as the appropriate inducements to encourage qualified people to settle in Morocco and work here. To address the chronic problem of ensuring that skills match labor market needs, and also to reduce joblessness, I call upon the government and the actors concerned to take a series of measures as soon as possible, particularly the following: • Firstly, undertake a comprehensive review of public mechanisms and programs for youth employment so as to make them more effective and to ensure they satisfy more adequately young people’s aspirations. This would be in keeping with what I called for in the State of the Nation Address when I referred to social welfare programs. In this respect, I have decided that a national meeting on employment and training should be convened before the end of the year with a view to making practical decisions, devising new solutions, launching initiatives and charting a specific roadmap to improve the employment situation. • Secondly, give priority to specialties which create jobs and develop an effective means of giving students career guidance two or three years before the baccalaureate to help them choose between academic studies and vocational training, depending on their abilities and personal preference. Concurrently with that, I call for the adoption of a framework agreement, involving the government and the private sector, to give a strong impetus to the re-training of students who drop out of school before earning a diploma so that they may be given a second chance at professional and social integration. • Thirdly, carry out a thorough review of vocational training programs to align them with the needs of businesses and the public sector, and to make sure they are adapted to changes in industry and trades in general, thereby increasing the chances of graduates to access professional life. Further attention therefore needs to be given to vocational training at all levels, and to creating a new generation of centers for the vocational training of young people, keeping in mind current needs as well as the particularities and expectations of each region. The Hassan II Fund for Economic and Social Development will contribute to the construction and equipping of new vocational training centers, in the light of emerging needs. • Fourthly, develop practical mechanisms likely to help achieve a qualitative leap in terms of motivating young people to set up small and medium-sized enterprises in their fields of competence, in addition to promoting self-employment and the creation of socially responsible businesses. Moreover, government agencies – particularly at the local level – should pay what they owe businesses; any delay in payment can potentially lead to bankruptcy and the subsequent loss of many jobs. How can officials claim to lead by example if government agencies and state institutions fail to honor their obligations? • Fifthly, develop new mechanisms to help integrate part of the informal sector into the formal economy by providing proper, motivating training to people involved in the informal sector, as well as social security and assistance for self-employment and business creation. • Sixthly, establish a compulsory three-to-six month foreign language course at each training institution and include foreign language learning at all levels of education, especially in technical and scientific branches. Youth issues are not restricted to training and employment opportunities. They also involve a broadening of intellectual horizons, mental well-being and improved health standards. Dear Citizens, The spirit and values of the 20th of August, and the unanimity, cohesion and sacrifices underpinning it, are the same as those that galvanize Moroccans whenever it comes to the question of our country’s territorial integrity. In this regard, Morocco has been confidently and responsibly engaged in the dynamic action launched by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in cooperation with his Personal Envoy. Our commitment in this connection is based on the same frame of reference I set out last year in my address on the occasion of the anniversary of the Green March. I am pleased to note there is increasing compatibility between these principles and the stances adopted by the international community. Indeed, the recent resolutions of the UN Security Council and the African Union Summit confirm, without a shadow of a doubt, that the United Nations Organization has exclusive authority to manage the political process relating to this question. I should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks and appreciation to the leaders of African sister nations who have reacted positively to Morocco’s principled stances and responded to the call of the Security Council, which invited the members of the international community to support its efforts. Dear Citizens, It is God’s will that, this year, the commemoration of the Revolution of the King and the People should coincide with the celebration of the blessed Eid al-Adha. Although the two events differ in essence – one being national, and the other religious – they nonetheless arouse similar emotions in the hearts and minds of Moroccans, given the values of sacrifice and loyalty underpinning them. In these blessed days, we cannot but pray that Almighty God rest the souls of my revered grandfather, His Majesty King Mohammed V, the hero of liberation and unity, of his comrade in arms, my venerable father, His Majesty King Hassan II and of the nation’s glorious martyrs. This is an opportunity for us to reaffirm our collective commitment to follow in their footsteps, defend Morocco’s unity and stability and seek to achieve the development and progress of the nation and fulfil the aspirations of its sons and daughters. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.” (Peace be upon you, and so may the mercy of God and His blessings.)

Rabat – King Mohammed VI decided today to appoint Mohamed Benchaaboun as minister of economy and finance to replace Mohamed Boussaid. The decision came 20 days after the King sacked Boussaid on August 1.  On August 6, Morocco’s official gazette recorded that the King appointed Abdelkader Amara, minister of equipment, transport, logistics, and water as an interim minister of the economy and finance. A statement from the Royal Cabinet said today that the King received Benchaaboun on Monday at the Royal Palace in Rabat in accordance with the provisions of Article 47 of the Constitution. The King appointed Benchaaboun at the proposal of Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. Born in 1961, Benchaaboun received his undergraduate degree from Telecom ParisTech. He is the chairman and managing director of Morocco’s Centrale Populaire Bank. The official also served as the president of the French-speaking network of Telecommunications Regulations (FRATEL) between 2005 and 2006. In the nearly three weeks since, no details have been revealed regarding Boussaid’s dismissal. After the royal decision to sack Boussaid, the government refused to give a statement on the King’s order. Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi told the press after a weekly cabinet meeting that he had “nothing to add to the royal statement.” Today, the King also agreed to a proposal by El Othmani to remove “the Secretariat of State in charge of Water at the Ministry of Equipment, Transport, Logistics, and Water and the transfer and integration of all its responsibilities within the structures and prerogatives of this ministry.”  According to the statement, this decision aims to improve the governance of water projects and their effectiveness and efficiency and to reinforce the complementarily between the different water services under the ministry. The monarch devotes special importance to the issue of water as Morocco suffered a major water shortage, especially in rural areas. On his Throne Day speech delivered on July 29, the King underscored the importance of water and its preservation. The King emphasized his determination to address issues relating to water resources for the next 30 years. He said that water “plays a fundamental role in development and stability.” “Almighty God says: ‘We made from water every living thing,’” said the monarch in his previous speech. The King also urged his government to take urgent measures to deal with “emergencies that arise from a lack of access to drinking water and to water for irrigation and livestock, especially during the summer.” “To this end, I have always stressed the need to maintain the policy of building dams—a sector in which Morocco is a pioneer,” he added.

Rabat – A 2017 report from OECD has listed Moroccans among the top immigrants who leave their homeland for France for economic reasons. The report, titled “The Recruitment of Immigrant Workers” from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that out of a total of 258,900 permanent immigrants who entered France in 2016, 10.8 percent fell in the “economic” immigration category. In comparison, 38 percent came in the “family” immigration category. The report said that immigrants from non-European countries coming to France for economic reasons enter mainly from the US, Morocco, and Tunisia. Intra-European immigrants come mainly from Portugal, the UK, and Spain. Family immigration, according to OECD, remains the main channel of migration to France, representing 98,400 people.  OECD noted the surge of arrivals in France and other reasons for it. These reasons include: free movement within the European Union (33.6 percent), work (10.8 percent), and humanitarian aid (9 percent). Of “first residence permits” in France, Moroccans and Algerians have 2 percent each. They are followed by Chinese and Tunisians with 7 percent each. In the family category, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia together represent 45 percent of the first-time permits. The OECD added that half of the migrants who land in France under the freedom of movement in the EU arrive in the country to work. Le Figaro commented that France welcomed 170,000 “temporary migrants” in 2016: 22,000 temporary workers and 71,000 students. Quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), OECD emphasized that a “significant percentage of temporary migrants change status and become long-term residents.” In the long term, many of them then live and work in host countries.  In April, the French Agency for the Promotion of Higher Education, Hospitality, and International Mobility, “Campus France,” ranked Moroccans as the largest foreign student body in France during the 2017 academic year. The Campus France report indicated that the number of Moroccan students in France stood at 38,002, or 43.9 percent of foreign students in 2016-2017. The number reflects an increase of 17 percent compared the 2011-2016 period. France also received 351,900 people in 2016, including permanent and temporary immigrants.

By Isabella Wang Rabat – La Vie Campesina, the international movement behind the UN peasants’ rights declaration, has urged Morocco to approve the measure at the UNGA.  Next month, the United Nations General Assembly will take a final vote on the “Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and other People Working in Rural Areas.” Negotiations on the declaration have lasted ten years.  After a decade of debate and negotiating, under the guidance of the Human Rights Council, farmers’ unions and peasant associations are now waiting for the decision in New York.  La Vie Campesina has urged Morocco to vote.  Yabiladi Mohamed Hakach, coordinator of the MENA chapter of La Vie Campesina and member of the National Federation of the Agricultural Sector (FNSA) explained, “This is a very crucial moment for us.” The declaration’s text is created “in the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.” La Vie Campesina is an international organization which coordinates farmers’ organizations from Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe. It is a coalition of 182 organizations in 81 countries.  Why is the declaration important? The declaration sets out to affirm the rights of peasants. It entails the fundamental human rights of peasants and farmers, already recognized by the UN, while also incorporating new rights to protect peasants.  The declaration asserts for peasants new rights, including the right to land in article 4, the right to seeds and traditional agricultural knowledge and practice in article 5, the right to the means of agricultural production in article 6, the right to information and agricultural technology in article 7, the freedom to determine price and market for agricultural production in article 8, the right to the protection of local agricultural values in article 9, the right to biological diversity in article 10, and the right to preserve the environment in article 11.  The first article of the declaration sets out to create an international definition for “peasant,” differentiating the word from big farmers who focus on investment rather than actually working on the land.  In Morocco, peasants, also known as small farmers, constitute a population of approximately 1.5 million people. The number does not include the small professionals who work in sectors involving the rural industry or in other trades in the countryside.   Creating a clear definition for “peasant” helps ensure that a clear set of human rights are applied to peasants, particularly when it comes to lawmaking. The declaration can regulate the parameters and laws applied to peasants and food production.  Hakach stated that the declaration will aim to “strengthen the value of food sovereignty and put an end to the various violations that peasants suffer throughout the world.” Many countries now do not have specific laws in areas of food production and food sovereignty. Under the current laws, small farmers under the control of large corporation, unions, or government, can be prevented from choosing the type of agricultural production which best suits their environment.  By enabling small farmers to have autonomy, the declaration not only aims to assure the rights and freedoms of the farmers but also aims to enable more effective production. The rights and sovereignty of small farmers has been critical to the drafting process of the declaration.  When addressing the challenges which had delayed the treaty, Hakach stated, “The first is related to the parties that have no interest in this declaration being adopted, namely the multinationals and the big decision makers of this world. This vote will be a political decision and we are creating awareness amongst the Moroccan government on this.” He continued, “In addition, another limit is that of the peasant organization. In our country, it was not until last July that the National Union of Peasants was created. In the field, small rural workers have a lot of trouble defending their interests, because we are lacking the organisation [to defend them]. Ramifications for Morocco If the declaration is successful, it is highly likely that Moroccan agricultural policy will undergo greater reform to assure the rights and benefits of peasants.  Faical Ouchen, secretary general of the National Union of Peasants (SNP), one of 17 agricultural unions affiliated to the FNSA, stated that current agricultural policy in Morocco “is mainly based on the Green Morocco Plan (PMV) directed mainly to large farmers.” Consequently, the adoption of the treaty, with or without Morocco’s vote, would lead to reviews in Morocco’s agricultural policy and a greater focus on small farmers. The declaration has garnered support from many other African countries while facing opposition from some European countries. Ouchen highlighted the benefits for small farmers in Morocco.  He explained that the declaration “protects them [small farmers] from random expropriations, which especially in Morocco, are operated by mafia real estate agencies and in addition large seed industries who produce non-reproducible seeds. Both of these force small farmers to depend on these large structures.”

Rabat – The Moroccan people celebrate the 65th anniversary today of the King and People’s Revolution Day, a turning point in the kingdom’s march to independence. Every year, Morocco commemorates the day when French authorities exiled the late King Mohammad V, grandfather of the current King Mohammed VI, on August 20, 1953, to Corsica. He was later exiled to Madagascar on January 1954. “I remember, with reverence and emotion, the anniversary of the royal family’s exile in Madagascar—a country I visited last year,” said King Mohammed VI in last year’s speech for the 64th anniversary of the King and People’s Revolution Day. “The Revolution of the King and the People … is more than a national, epic event which brought together a valiant king and a resolute people, seeking Morocco’s independence and the reinstatement of its legitimate leader,” the King added. According to Moroccan historical accounts, French authorities exiled Morocco’s king because he refused to sign a “pact of surrender” which asked for French domination over Morocco. The French colonial authorities tried to place Mohammed Ben Arafa, a Moroccan sultan born in 1886 in Fez on the Alawite throne after exiling King Mohammed V along with the royal family, and died in 1976 in Nice, During the exile period, the kingdom’s armed resistance rose against the French colonists, especially from Morocco’s National Liberation Army. After two years of revolution and resistance, King Mohammed V returned triumphantly return to reign as King. On November 16, 1955, King Mohammad V returned to Morocco after a 27-month period of exile and received overwhelming support from Moroccan people. After the King’s arrival, the colonial authorities were forced to enter into negotiations with Morocco over independence and had no choice but to accept Moroccans’ demand for freedom. One year after the King’s return, Morocco gained its independence from the French occupation in March 1956. At that point, the French colonists left the kingdom’s territories. “We need to draw inspiration today from the values of sacrifice, loyalty and generosity underpinning that event so as to continue to be torchbearers of that revolution, domestically and continentally,” King Mohammed VI said in his 2017 speech. The King and People’s Revolution Day is a significant event in Morocco’s history. It is an occasion to remember the struggle of Morocco’s people and King Mohammed V against the French occupation and to pay tribute to Moroccans who devoted their lives to liberate the kingdom from colonialization.

Rabat– Authorities have arrested an employee at Sidi Ben Abdellah University of Law in Fez offering to enroll students in master’s programs for MAD 40,000. A recording of a shocking conversation between a student and an administrator called “Youssef” at the Fez university recently circulated on the messaging application Whatsapp. The administrator could be heard negotiating a price for the student to pay to be admitted to a master’s degree program. The administrator offered to be an intermediary to give the student admission in exchange for MAD 40,000. He promised the student that he would allow the student to graduate with merit once the deal was set. “You will not find this kind of offer anywhere else,” Youssef said. He also asked the student if he had any friends who would also be interested in the offer. He also insisted to the student that if he chose the master’s, he would easily be able to find a job. Soon after the recording went viral, the university made an announcement on August 17, saying that the university and the Ministry of Education are conducting a “thorough investigation concerning the content of the audio recording, to gather relevant information and make the necessary legal procedures.” The release emphasized that the university is keen to ensure equal opportunities for all candidates applying for any of its departments.  Meanwhile, the president of the Prosecutor General’s Office, Mohammed Abdennabaoui, ordered an investigation to be opened. The investigation led to the arrest of the suspect on Sunday, August 19. The audio recording has sparked the anger of Moroccans, especially students who have few or no chances of obtaining a master’s degree. It also added to the controversy surrounding the country’s educational system. In Morocco, there are 26-45 placements available for master’s degrees, depending on each department and university. Due to the limited admission numbers and the allegedly “unequal” opportunities, some Moroccan college graduates complain of their inability to pursue graduate studies. Many believe that they would be able to get into graduate studies if they had money or a connection; the same applies to finding a job. According to Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi’s recent press statement, the percentage of unemployed university graduates is over 22 percent. The figure has doubled over the last five years and is expected to keep increasing in the coming years to reach 50 percent. Moroccan higher education is also beset with the growing practice of private institutes of higher education advertising programs with unaccredited university curricula. Some universities have resorted to using fake data to attract students to their departments which have not been authorized by the Ministry of Education. A recent press release from the ministry reminded universities to “uphold the principles of transparency, loyal competition, and equity of opportunities which constitute the bedrock of Morocco’s educational system.” The government allocated MAD 70 billion to improve material resources and educational conditions for university students for the academic years ahead. The move is part of the implementation of the strategic vision of the 2015-2030 reform program and in accordance with the 2016-2021 Government Action Program. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said that about 700 vacant positions will be filled in 2018 to improve human resources management in Moroccan universities. He said recruitment channels will be diversified to attract a maximum of national and international expertise. The incident also raises the issue of corruption that Morocco has vowed to end in all forms by 2050 through strict measures. The government’s initiatives, such as the new corruption hotline (0537718888), have produced results. The hotline enabled security forces to set up a sting operation and catch corruption suspects. Morocco improved slightly in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index in 2017 compared to 2016, owing to the government’s efforts to counter administrative corruption, power abuse, and public funds mismanagement.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI will deliver a speech tonight for the 65th anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the People. According to a statement from the Ministry of the Royal Household, Protocol, and Chancellery, the royal speech will be aired on local television and radio channels at 9:30 p.m. Royal pardons King Mohammed VI on Sunday granted pardons to 450 inmates, including 22 prisoners charged for their involvement in extremism and terrorism cases. The royal pardon was announced by the Moroccan Ministry of Justice. The decision came after the inmates proved they revised their ideological orientations, according to the statement. The ministry added that 17 prisoners were exempted from serving the remainder of their terms. Two inmates had their prison terms reduced, while three had their life imprisonment commuted to a fixed prison period, added the ministry. Brief history on the Revolution of the King and the People August 20 represents a day of heroic struggle in Morocco’s contemporary history. On August 20, 1953, the French government approved a request from the French military forces to remove the late Mohammed V from the throne and exile him to the island of Corsica in the Mediterranean Sea. The decision of the French colonizers came during Eid al-Adha, a situation that sparked outrage among Moroccan citizens and resistant activists. Mohammed V was a beloved monarch and an icon for resistance. August 20 represents a day of courage and pride for all Moroccans, reinforcing the unity of Moroccans. Resistance from Moroccan activists and resistance forces and the National Liberation Army , led the French forces to accept dialogue and open negotiations with nationalists. The resistance resulted in the return from exile of Mohammed V and the declaration of the independence of Morocco. The king returned to Morocco on November 16, 1955. One year later, in 1956, Morocco gained its independence.

Rabat – Nearly 2 million Muslim pilgrims from around the world converged at Mount Arafat to perform a major Hajj ritual on Monday. On a plain about 20 kilometers southeast of Saudi Arabia’s Mecca, Mount Arafat is the great stage of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. Muslims around the world believe that the Prophet Mohammed performed his final farewell sermon on the mount more than 1,400 years ago. On this day, also called Arafat, the Prophet Mohammed called on Muslims to pray to God for forgiveness and mercy. Islam also encourages Muslims to fast on this day, a ritual that is believed to expiate the sins of the past year and the coming years. Rituals on Arafat, also known as Arafah, will end at sunset. The significance of Arafat in Islam At dawn on Arafat, Muslims performing the Hajj pilgrimage make their way from Mina in Mecca to Mt Arafat, 20 kilometers away from Mecca. The pilgrimage, according to Islam, is not considered completed unless pilgrims ascend Mt Arafat. Traditionally, Muslims arrive in Arafat at noon and spend the afternoon to sunset on the mount. People who are physically unable to walk to Arafat are allowed to fulfill the religious rite by fasting. During the afternoon, Muslims pray for God’s forgiveness and listen to religious lectures delivered by Islamic scholars. Muslims also believe that part of the Qur’anic verse announcing that the religion of Islam had been perfected was revealed on this day. “This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion” (Surah al Maa’idah 5:3). Mount Arafat is nearly 70 meters tall and is also known as Jabal Arrahmah (Mountain of Mercy). Arafat is the ninth day of the 12th month in the Islamic calendar, Dhu al-Hijjah. Dhu al-Hijjah also marks Eid al-Adha, which is the second of two Islamic holidays celebrated by Muslims worldwide. Eid al-Adha will be celebrated on Wednesday, August 22. After the sunset, Hajj goers head to Muzdalifah, an area near Mecca that is associated with the pilgrimage. Pilgrims will then perform two combined prayers: sunset and night prayers. After Day of Arafah, pilgrims return to Mecca to perform Tawaf al-Wadaa (farewell circumambulation), which marks the end of the pilgrimage. It is the last ritual performed by nonresident pilgrims before returning home. The 2018 Hajj will end on August 24, the twelfth day of Dhu al-Hijjah. Saudi Arabia announced earlier this month that 1,486,958 foreign pilgrims arrived in the country to perform the 2018 Hajj pilgrimage. The kingdom also undertook major expansion projects to avoid tragic incidents such as the 2015 stampede that killed thousands of Hajj pilgrims.

Rabat – The Moroccan government will discuss a draft bill to reinstate compulsory military service on Monday. “Bill 44.18 on Military Function” will be among the major topics discussed at today’s Government Council in Rabat, according to a statement issued by the government’s administrative office on August 17. If enacted, the bill would call for the training of young men 18 and over for national duties.  However, Moroccan news outlets’ reports about the draft law were varied. Quoting unidentified sources from the government, some outlets, including Telquel, said that the compulsory military service will be debated at Monday’s Government Council. Other government sources quoted by some media, including H24, denied the news. The sources claimed that such changes do not happen overnight. Morocco introduced 18 months mandatory military service on June 9, 1966, in accordance with Royal Decree 137-66. According to the decree, the national military training aimed to enable youth to “contribute effectively and in all circumstances to the defense of their homeland.” The measure aimed to raise their standards to contribute “to the development of their country.” At the time, every 18-year-old Moroccan man had to visit the qaid (governor) of his region, who evaluated whether he was qualified for the military. Men with physical illnesses were exempted from participating in the national military training. Morocco reduced the length of service to 12 months in 1999. But in 2006, King Mohammed VI abolished mandatory military service. “This text of law came to abolish the obligatory military service with immediate effect,” former Delegate-Minister for the Administration of National Defense Abderrahmane Sbai said, after receiving the royal instructions. Quoted by South Africa-based news outlet Independent Online( IOL ) on December 1, 2006, Sbai said that mandatory military service had been breeding a “climate of apathy” as it did not meet “the requirements of professionalism and scientific and technological training.” Reports of the government council’s decision to discuss the military draft stirred discussions on social media. Some people claimed that the measure would ensure more discipline in the country, while others disagreed. Many Moroccans took to Twitter and Facebook to discuss the potential bill, saying that the measure would be reasonable if it would include the young male relatives of politicians. Bilal Jouahri from the Anti-Racist Group for the Defense and Assistance of Foreigners and Immigrants (GADEM) asked why news outlets query citizens about their opinions on the bill as if Morocco is a “country of democracy” and as if people’s “opinion matter.” ??????? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ? ????? ? ??? ?????? ??????? ?????? ???? ??? “?? ??? ?? ?? ?? ??????? ?????????” ???????? ?? ?????? ???????? ????? ??????? ????? ? ???????????? ? ????? ???? …. ? ????? ???? ??? ?? ?? ???? ???? ? ????? ????? ?????? ??? “?? ??? ?? ???????” ? — bilal jouhari (@AljouhariB) August 19, 2018  It remains to be seen whether the bill will be enacted after the government council.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ottman Azaitar won his fight in 22 seconds during Africa’s first MMA competition, Brave 14, against Serbia’s Danijel Kokora in Tangier. It only took 22 seconds for the Moroccan athlete to knock-out his opponent in the fight on Saturday, August 18. From the first seconds of the short and violent encounter, Ottman, who has earned 10 victories out of 10 in his league, dominated the Serbian.  In the 18th second, Ottman Azaitar’s sharp left hook destabilized Kokora, who stumbled, leaving the net to the Moroccan cage fighter, who finished his opponent with a “ground and pound.”  The referee decided to end the duel due to the ferociousness of the blow.  In a statement to the press after the fight, Azaitar said he was “delighted to achieve [his] first victory in Morocco.” He dedicated his victory to Moroccans and King Mohammed VI. For his part, Brave Combat Federation (BCF) President Mohammed Shahid said in a statement to the press shortly before the kick-off event that it was “wonderful that the first African MMA fight is taking place in Morocco.” He praised the “quality of the organization and the facilities that were provided to hold of this exceptional event.” Shahid stressed that Morocco’s strategic geographical position at the crossroads between Europe, Africa, and the Arab world “was decisive.” He asserted, “For us, Morocco is not only an event, but a symbol.” The official said he was confident that the MMA is “promised a bright future in Morocco, since there are great Moroccan names in the discipline around the world.”  The regional director of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Abdelouahed Azaibou, welcomed that “Tangier is hosting a major international sporting event that is likely to strengthen the influence of the city ??of Tangier, and Morocco in general.” Saturday’s night of 9 fights was attended by 18 renowned fighters, representing a dozen countries. The event was attended by Bahrain’s Sheikh Khalid Bin Hamad Al Khalifa, who founded BCF in 2016.

Rabat – Casablanca has mobilized more than 2,300 workers to cope with the thousands of tons of waste accumulated in the metropolis during Eid al-Adha. The initiative aims to improve the living conditions of people in Casablanca particularly in this period of Eid, said the vice-president of the mayor of Casablanca, Mohamed Haddadi. Casablanca’s council has called for the help of 2,370 workers. An expected 1,300 will come from the three companies in charge of Casablanca’s waste collection and cleaning. Another 1,070 will be hired from the community or other areas to participate specifically in this operation. Other measures to keep the “white city” clean include facilitating access to the Mediouna landfill and widening the streets in order to avoid the congestion of dump trucks. Haddadi added that the company in charge of the landfill’s management has reserved an area of ??eight hectares for the collection of Eid al-Adha waste, expected to exceed 10,000 tons. Eid al-Adha commemorates the day that the prophet Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son, but God intervened by providing a ram as a sacrifice. Because every Muslim family who is financially able will sacrifice a sheep, goat, cow, or even a camel on the religious holiday on Wednesday, heavily-populated areas accumulate a lot of waste in a short amount of time.  Haddadi underlined the role of civil society in Casablanca to preserve the cleanliness of Morocco’s economic capital through raising awareness among inhabitants. He noted that 70 tons of plastic bags will be distributed. The leaders of the urban community, the cleaning companies and representatives of the local authorities met earlier in August to discuss measures to prevent the accumulation of waste during Eid.

Rabat – Like many Algerian government officials, Ould Abbes has reasserted Algeria’s unwillingness to take part in the negotiations over Western Sahara. “Algeria, whose support for the Saharawi cause is unwavering and non-negotiable, again reaffirms that it has nothing to do with the direct negotiations that the Security Council called for the end of this year between the Polisario Front and the Kingdom of Morocco,” said Djamel Ould Abbes, secretary-general of Algeria’s National Liberation Front (FLN). Ould-Abbes’ statement was published by Algeria Press Service (APS) on August 15. In April, the Algerian minister of foreign affairs and Algerian prime minister both reaffirmed Algeria’s position refusing to engage in the negotiations over Western Sahara, claiming that the solution lies between Morocco and Polisario, not Algeria. Nevertheless, Ould Abbes explained that Algeria intends to have good neighborly relations with Morocco. “The position of Algeria is not intended in any way to undermine the friendly relations between the Algerian and Moroccan peoples.” “Anyone who tries to ‘stir the fires of the Fitna (sedition)’ between the two neighboring countries is on the wrong track,” he added. Ould Abbes also claimed that “the Algerian leadership supports the UN process led by the personal envoy of the UN secretary-general to Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, aimed at relaunching direct negotiations between the parties to the conflict.” On August 8, Kohler presented the UN Security Council with a briefing on the situation in Western Sahara. He called on the parties in the conflict—Morocco and the Polisario Front—as well as neighboring states such as Algeria to resume negotiations. The aim of negotiations is to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to the Western Sahara conflict. Morocco, however, believes that Algeria should engage in the negotiations and be part of a solution to the regional conflict. Morocco’s permanent representative to the United Nations, Omar Hilale, told Moroccan media that negotiations over the Western Sahara conflict without the participation of Algeria will be a “waste of time.”

Rabat- ADM has advised drivers to plan their trips ahead of time and avoid high traffic times the weekend following Eid al-Adha.   The Moroccan National Motorway Company (ADM) advises drivers to watch out for traffic as travelers return home after the holiday. Eid al-Adha (Festival of Sacrifice) will be celebrated on Wednesday, August 22. The company expects heavy traffic on all roads on Thursday, August 23, between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m., and on Sunday, August 26. For travelers’ safety and comfort, ADM recommends drivers download the ADM traffic application in order to learn more about the traffic situation. ADM also suggests that drivers use the Tag Jawaz, Morocco’s electronic toll pass, so that they can quickly pay the highway toll at toll gates. According to Minister Delegate in Charge of Moroccans Living Abroad Abdelkarim Benatiq, 961,000 Moroccan expats returned to Morocco for Eid, which suggests that there will be more traffic throughout the holiday. To improve road travel, Morocco has invested heavily in road work. The government has plans to spend approximately €23 billion in road construction in the years up to 2035. The minister said that 20 rest areas were recently built on highways across Morocco.

Rabat – The city of Lausanne in Switzerland has denied Swiss citizenship to a Muslim couple over signs of supposedly incompatible cultural differences. The town’s “municipality said it refused to grant the couple’s citizenship application over their lack of respect of gender equality,” Association France-Presse (AFP) reported Saturday, quoting the mayor of Lausanne, Gregoire Junod. According to some conservative interpretations of Islam’s Holy Scriptures, including the Qur’an and the hadith (the record of the deeds and words of the Prophet Mohammed), Muslims are prohibited from physical contact with people of the opposite sex.  An exception to the strict interpretation of the Scriptures is only possible when the person of the opposite sex is a member of the devout Muslim’s family or close circle, for example a cousin or a male relative of a woman’s husband. According to the mayor of Lausanne, months-long interactions between the couple and a three-member commission led to the conclusion that the couple did not qualify for Swiss citizenship.  Explaining his municipality’s ruling to deny the couple citizenship, Junod explained that “they did not shake hands with people of the opposite sex.” The mayor also mentioned that the couple “showed great difficulty in answering questions asked by people of the opposite sex.” ‘A Swiss tradition’ The municipality of Lausanne adheres to the laws of the Cantons of Vaud, Switzerland’s legal system that guarantees freedom of belief and religion.  Although Junod acknowledged the Muslim couple’s right to religious and personal freedom, he argued that “religious practice does not fall outside the law,” a hint at the importance that Swiss tradition gives to handshake. In 2016, many in Switzerland were dissatisfied when a school in the north of the country ruled in favor of two Syrian brothers who refused to shake hands with their teacher, AFP reported. The two brothers had argued that their religious belief prohibited shaking hands with a person of the opposite sex. However, the brothers’ attitude and the school’s approval of it stood in stark contrast with “the Swiss tradition” that children shake their teacher’s hands as a sign of respect. “Amid the outcry regional authorities quickly overruled the school’s decision,” AFP noted. Commenting on the decision to deny the couple citizenship, Pierre-Antoine Hildbrand, the vice-mayor of Lausanne who was also part of the commission that questioned the couple, said that he was “very satisfied with the decision.”  “The constitution and equality between men and women prevails over bigotry,” the vice-mayor argued. The couple has 30 days to appeal to a court for a possibility of overruling should the legal authorities deem the couple’s freedom of conscience more legally convincing than the Lausanne municipality’s adherence to tradition.

Rabat – FC Barcelona is giving Moroccan-Spanish football forward Munir El Haddadi another chance to prove himself.  According to Spanish outlet El Mundo Deportivo, the leader of the Spanish club, Eric Abidal, affirmed to the young player Abidal’s desire to keep El Haddadi, rather than loan him to another club. The French sports secretary, confident of El Haddadi’s abilities, has high hopes to see him rise this season, despite the fact he sat on the bench for two seasons between 2015 and 2017.  But El Haddadi played under the colors of Alaves, where he was loaned, last season and scored 10 goals. His improved performance had raised the interest of French clubs, such as Lille and Olympique Marseille. During his youth, the footballer also played for several Spanish clubs, including Atletico Madrid, FC Valencia, and Rayo Majadahonda.  Born to Moroccan parents in Spain, El Haddadi represented the Spanish national under-19 team and under-20 team. He made a brief appearance on the pitch as a substitute at an international game against Macedonia in 2014. His appearance then ruined his chances to represent the Moroccan national football team, according to FIFA eligibility rules. In 2017, El Haddadi urged Morocco to help him convince FIFA to let him switch sporting nationalities and play with Morocco. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) asked FIFA to let El Haddadi play for Morocco in the 2018 World Cup. The FIFA Players’ Status Committee ruled that El Haddadi’s sporting nationality could not be changed from Spain to Morocco March 13. When the decision was appealed, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) confirmed the FIFA ruling with a verdict in May.

Rabat- A Spanish-Moroccan security unit arrived in Syria to interview Moroccan women previously involved with ISIS in order to repatriate them. Moroccan human rights activists called for the country to repatriate the Moroccan women who had escaped ISIS after joining the group. The women and their children are stranded in refugee camps of the war-torn northern Syria. As part of the repatriation procedure, the security team arrived earlier this week to investigate the women’s relationship with ISIS, the National Observatory for Human Development (ONDH) announced on Wednesday.

“The security intelligence team called the women individually and interrogated them beginning from the time they adopted the radical ideology to the moment they joined ISIS and fell in the hands of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria’s forces,” ONDH stated. The head of ONDH, Mohamed Ben Aissa, told Moroccan news outlet Yabiladi that the investigations focused on the role the women played when they were with ISIS, and how they managed to escape the organization. “These interviews lasted for several hours, given the sensitive nature of the matter. Investigators have been following closely the journeys of these Moroccan women,” he said. Aissa also said that there are approximately 200 Moroccan women in the refugee camps of the northern Syrian federation. The women are in a fragile psychological state because of ISIS’ threats and the harsh treatment they received. Some of the women are wives of ISIS fighters who joined the terrorist organization along their husbands. The Iraqi government decided to repatriate the wives and children under the age of 15 of Moroccan ISIS fighters after the terrorist group was defeated in Iraq at the end of 2017. The operation was carried out in coordination with the United Nations. However, no female ISIS fighters were repatriated. Moroccan ISIS fighters returning to the kingdom typically receive sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years in prison, according to Morocco’s law regarding ISIS returnees established in 2015. According to the head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, there are approximately 1,660 Moroccan fighters affiliated with ISIS and other transnational terrorist networks.

Rabat – Details have emerged of the deal RAM and its pilots agreed to on Tuesday to end a month-long crisis that paralyzed the company’s activities.  But while both Royal Air Maroc (RAM) management and the National Trade Union of Moroccan Pilots (AMPL) offered vague statements about the terms of their “landmark” crisis recovery agreement, the press have published details of the August 14 agreement. Flawed management “RAM’s traditional markets are fragile and under threat,” read the preamble to the “historic” agreement. According to the document, the company’s flawed management philosophy and ineffective PR and sales strategies have hindered its dreams of prominence for 20 years. In what appears to be constructive self-criticism, the document criticized the company’s reckless borrowing and unproductive spending, factors that did not gain costumers’ trust, build a good international reputation, or ultimately fulfill RAM’s hope of “being among the world’s better-equipped and best performing” airlines. Reversing these “structural dysfunctions” is essential for the company to bounce back from the pilots’ strike and capitalize on existing strength, the agreement suggested.  It added that pilots’ concerns and demands will be given more weight than before, because gaining pilots’ full support and adhesion to the company’s long-term plans is the surest way to “achieve peaceful and sustainable growth.” Shifting focus Pilots formally expressed their concerns July 18 about RAM’s “unbearable” and “unreasonable” working conditions. They argued that reopening Morocco’s RAM-funded flight training school closed in 2014 should be a priority if the company wants to recruit more pilots and reach its goals of capacity expansion and customer satisfaction. According to the deal, though, “the training school is no longer a priority” for the short or medium term. Instead, “recruitment needs will continue to be satisfied through partnerships with foreign training institutions.” While it did overtly state it, the agreement appears to suggest that RAM will focus on recuperation efforts in the immediate aftermath of the financially detrimental crisis.  The expansion dream is still a priority, but rather than inflexibly expanding the company’s fleets, RAM and AMPL agreed to set their sights on recuperation efforts, focusing on customer satisfaction and upgrading performance with current personnel and equipment. Although the agreement is chiefly concerned with “looking forward” and “achieving” RAM’s goals, it brought a new focus for the short and medium term: to meet pilots’ demands and extend partnerships with foreign training schools. “AMPL and RAM have agreed to grant pilots four days off monthly” in addition to the traditional two days off weekly, the agreement said, hinting at RAM’s concession to pilots’ demands for more resting time.  But in addition to extended holidays, the agreement also mentioned a pay raise and a grant to pay a third of pilots’ training fees. Based on seniority and competence, pilots and copilots’ monthly salaries will see an increase of MAD 3,000 to 5,175. The agreement terms for the training grant are set to come into force on October 1, but the pay raise will start on November 1. To ensure that all the points in the agreement are satisfactorily met, the two parties also decided to set up a joint appraisal committee. The committee “will meet once a year upon request from either party” to assess the effectiveness of implementation of the deal.

Rabat – Former UN Secretary-General and Noble Peace laureate Kofi Annan died Saturday, August 18, at the age of 80. Annan’s foundation issued a statement on Annan’s Twitter account this morning that described him as a “global statesman and deeply committed internationalist who fought throughout his life for a fairer and more peaceful world.” According to the statement, Annan died after a short illness in hospital in Bern, Switzerland. His wife, Nane, and children Ama, Kojo and Nina, were by his side “during his last days”. It is with immense sadness that the Annan family and the Kofi Annan Foundation announce that Kofi Annan, former Secretary General of the United Nations and Nobel Peace Laureate, passed away peacefully on Saturday 18th August after a short illness… pic.twitter.com/42nGOxmcPZ — Kofi Annan (@KofiAnnan) August 18, 2018  Antonio Guterres, the current UN secretary-general, also published a statement. “Kofi Annan was a guiding force for good.  It is with profound sadness that I learned of his passing.  In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organization into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination.” “Like so many, I was proud to call Kofi Annan a good friend and mentor. I was deeply honoured by his trust in selecting me to serve as UN High Commissioner for Refugees under his leadership. He remained someone I could always turn to for counsel and wisdom — and I know I was not alone,” Guterres added. Kofi Annan was a guiding force for good. I join the world in mourning his loss. In these turbulent and trying times, his legacy as a global champion for peace will remain a true inspiration for us all. https://t.co/psJ9viPIeu pic.twitter.com/SKfBk5zaY2 — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) August 18, 2018  The UN Migration Agency tweeted: “Today we mourn the loss of a great man, a leader, and a visionary.” Annan served as seventh secretary-general of United Nations between 1997 and 2006. Annan was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with the United Nations in 2001 “for their work for a better organized and more peaceful world.” Kofi Annan will be remembered for his AIDS initiatives and global diplomacy. “To live is to choose. But to choose well, you must know who you are and what you stand for, where you want to go and why you want to get there,” he said. Annan’s education The diplomat was born in Kumasi, Ghana, on April 8, 1938. Annan graduated from Mfantsipim School, a high school in Cape Coast in Ghana in 1957, the same year Ghana gained independence from Britain. He then studied at the University of Science and Technology in Kumasi in 1958. He then received a Ford Foundation grant and completed his undergraduate work in the US, studying economics at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1961. Kofi Annan believed that “education is a human right with immense power to transform. On its foundation rest the cornerstones of freedom, democracy and sustainable human development.” In 1961, Annan pursued graduate studies in economics at Geneva’s Graduate Institute of  International and Development Studies. In 1972, Annan received a Master of Science degree in management from the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Annan’s career in the UN The Ghanaian diplomat’s career with the UN began in 1962 when he joined as an administrative and budget officer with the World Health Organization in Geneva. Annan served in many UN organizations across the world in the next 30 years: the UN Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa; the UN Emergency Force (UNEF II) in Ismailia, Egypt; and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva. At UN Headquarters in New York, Annan was an assistant secretary-general for human resources management and security coordinator for the UN System between 1987 and 1990; assistant secretary-general for program planning, budget, and finance; and controller from 1990 to1992. Between 1974 and 1976, Annan took a short break from his international civil service to work as the director of tourism in Ghana from 1974 to 1976. Before being appointed secretary-general, Annan also served as assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations and then as under-secretary-general. Initiatives at the UN As secretary-general, Annan’s first major initiative was his plan for reform, “Renewing the United Nations.” The plan was presented to the member states in July 1997. Annan also launched the “Global Compact” campaign in 1999, the world’s biggest initiative to promote corporate social responsibility. In April 2000, he issued a Millennium Report, named “We the Peoples: The Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century.” In his report, Annan called on member states to “commit themselves to an action plan for ending poverty and inequality, improving education, reducing HIV/AIDS, safeguarding the environment and protecting peoples from deadly conflict and violence,” according to the UN. In April 2001, Annan proposed the establishment of a “Global AIDS and Health Fund” to help developing countries deal with the HIV crisis as he considered the pandemic his “personal priority.” After leaving the UN, Anan returned to Ghana where he got involved with many organizations, such as the Global Humanitarian Forum, The Elders, United Nations Foundation, and One Young World. The former UN secretary-general was fluent in many languages. He spoke English, French and several African languages, including Kru and Akan.

Rabat – Moroccan international football player Youssef En-Nesyri has officially left Malaga FC for Spain’s Leganes, confirming the rumors of his transfer.  The Atlas Lion is saying good bye to Malaga FC where he spent three years by signing a four-year contract, as his new club confirmed in a statement.  The Fez native started his football career in the youth team of the Maghreb AS. Along with Moroccan Hamza Mendyl, En-Neysri joined the Mohammed VI Academy team led by Nasser Larguet. He trained there for several years before he was loaned to Malaga in 2015. A year later, he was bought by the same club for €125,000 and earned a starting position by scoring in the first four games he played. As for his career with Morocco’s national team, the young striker was summoned for the first time on August 31, 2016, to play in a friendly against Albania. He scored his first goal with the Atlas Lions in the 2017 Africa Cup against Togo. In 2018, En-Nesyri scored in a friendly against Estonia, a game played in preparation for the Russian World Cup. In the World Cup, he gave Moroccan fans the joy of winning a second goal against Spain. En-Nesyri’s World Cup goal made quite the impression in Morocco’s last game of the competition. The striker’s 81st-minute header delivered a temporary lead to the national team.

Rabat – A spokesperson of the Russian foreign affairs ministry has said Algeria should join Western Sahara peace talks as an “observer state.” Maria Zakhorova, the spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made the remarks Wednesday, August 15, during a policy briefing in which she addressed major security challenges around the world.  Of the decades-long territorial dispute in Western Sahara, Zakhorova said that Russia is deeply concerned with the fragile status quo in the area.  Russia believes that all players and stakeholders should show enough engagement to facilitate an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political settlement to the longstanding crisis in Sahara, Zakhorova said.  Regarding Algeria’s position, however, she underlined Moscow’s traditional position: only Morocco and the Polisario Front are chiefly concerned with negotiations, and Algeria should be asked to get involved, but only as an observer.  The Russian ministry also expressed satisfaction with the UN secretary-general’s personal envoy’s recent tour in the region, saying that Horst Kohler is gathering momentum in the right direction by trying to commit all parties to negotiations.  But Zakhorova insisted that full involvement in the peace negotiations should only concern Morocco and the Polisario Front. “We support this approach and do not see any sensible alternative to searching for a compromise based on the well-known resolutions of the Security Council and the UN General Assembly within the framework of procedures consistent with the UN Charter’s principles and goals. “We note with satisfaction that Horst Kohler, Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General for Western Sahara and former President of Germany, is stepping up efforts to get the peace process going by resuming direct talks without preconditions between the two protagonists, including neighboring Algeria and Mauritania as observers.” According to the Russian official, part of the reason for the conflict’s escalation is the lack of genuine engagement from all stakeholders.  “The efforts to develop an acceptable conflict resolution approach for the parties to the conflict—Morocco and the POLISARIO Front—undertaken under the auspices of the United Nations have been repeatedly disrupted for various reasons. Meanwhile, the fragile local status quo causes serious concern, because it is fraught with major challenges to regional security.” Diverging interests Russia, a known Algerian ally, has traditionally been wary of UN-led peace talks on the Western Sahara question.  In April, Russia initially stood in the way of a UN Security Council resolution on the extension of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), deferring the UN’s extension of the security body’s mandate in the buffer zone. Russia hoped to water down the supposed bias of the first draft and make the resolution friendlier to the position of its Algerian ally. And although Moscow unexpectedly refrained from vetoing the resolution draft when it came forward again, on April 28, the country’s deputy permanent representative to the UN, Vladmir Safronkov, cast doubt on the reliability of the UN draft.  “The text is unbalanced,” he said, claiming that the US-drafted resolution was slightly one-sided and that “a number of suggestions by other Security council members remained unanswered.” Horst Kohler urged all stakeholders last week to show genuine commitment and responsibility to finally find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to the decades-long territorial dispute in Western Sahara. But with open divergences between key players, including between Algeria and Morocco and between the US and Russia, Kohler’s peace talk plans may hit bigger obstacles than expected. MINURSO’s mandate was extended for a six-month period in April. The Security Council is set to meet in October to decide whether the body’s mandate needs further extension.

Rabat- The British ambassador has shared about his first year in Morocco, saying he would change the driving and the litter in Morocco if he could. Charmed by the Moroccan lifestyle, Thomas Reilly, who has been ambassador to the country for one year, wrote both about the beauty and the challenges he found in Morocco. The official Facebook page of the British Embassy in Morocco shared Reilly’s essay on Thursday.

Reilly recalled his first day in Morocco with his family, writing that although he had visited Morocco as a tourist before, he was aware that “the experience of a tourist is quite different to that of a resident.” Upon his arrival in Tangier after a long drive from the UK, he was greeted by a lorry that rear-ended him on the way to Rabat. He wrote: “In retrospect, that was an appropriate introduction to Moroccan roads. The driving in Morocco is fast and furious; often scary. Never dull. You need to keep your wits about you at all times.” Reilly warned that pedestrians can saunter across the road at any point, noting that one “cannot afford to lose concentration for a second” with the large number of donkeys, dogs, cats, trucks, lorries, and mopeds in Moroccan villages. The ambassador described the beauty of natural scenery as he drove to Rabat: “As we drove, I was amazed by its geographical variety – as we left the hills of the Rif behind, the amazing Atlantic coast opened up,” he wrote. He went on describing roadways, the High Atlas Mountains, and Mount Toubkal, which he climbed. “I have climbed Mount Toubkal and looked across, from that snowy, frozen height to the beautiful Atlas range; down into the infinite desert; and back towards the fecund plains around Marrakech.” “Morocco is not perfect – what country is?” The ambassador wrote about the challenges, stating that if he could change two things about Morocco, it would be the driving and the litter. Reilly recently expressed distaste at the litter surrounding the Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah dam in Rabat through a post on his Twitter account. He wrote: “We went this morning for a walk with our dogs near the dam lake [in Rabat], a very beautiful and peaceful place…but the place was ruined by plastic waste, sandwich leftover, bottles and garbage.” “It was honestly appalling, Morocco deserves better than that!” he said. Ending his essay, Reilly congratulated Morocco on being a leader in banning plastic bags. “Morocco led the world in banning plastic bags and should be congratulated for that leadership, but the plastic scourge legacy (from which many countries are suffering) is more noticeable in Morocco.” Morocco launched the “zero mika” (zero plastic bags) law in July 2016, making it one of the first countries in Africa to impose a ban on plastic bags. However, plastic bags are still manufactured and sold illegally in Morocco. Authorities seized nearly 2.96 tons of banned plastic bags intended for sale in a warehouse in Tangier in March.  Reilly rued the fact that the plastic bags and litter make “such a stark contrast to the outstanding natural and historical beauty of the country.” Reilly asserted that he looks forward to his second year as Ambassador to Morocco. “To continuing to build a real partnership of equals between our two countries; to sharing my experiences; and to visiting more places and learning more about this remarkable country,” Reilly concluded.

Rabat – The government has prioritized education, employment, health, social protection programs, major economic projects, and investment in the forthcoming 2019 Finance Bill. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani published an explanatory note to the 2019 Finance Bill on Wednesday, August 15, in which he listed major sectors and programs that will be central in Morocco’s budget in 2019. According to El Othmani, the priorities in the 2019 Finance Bill demonstrate the commitments of governmental programs and respond to Moroccans’ legitimate expectations. El Othmani said the bill follows the directions King Mohammed VI mentioned in his latest speech for Throne Day, delivered July 29. Education, health, and employment According to the explanatory note, education, health, employment, social protection programs, social dialogue, and supporting citizens’ purchasing power are among the government’s major priorities. “We believe in the importance of improving the social status of citizens. In the 2019 bill, we will attach special importance to social policies, especially education, health, employment, and social protection programs. We will also accelerate the success of social dialogue and support purchasing power,” El Othmani tweeted yesterday, August 16. ???? ??????? ?. #????????_????????: ?????? ??? ?????? ????? ??????? ?????????? ?????????? ????? ?? ????? ????? 2019 ????? ???? ???????? ??????????? ??? ??????? ??????? ?????? ????????? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ??? ????? ??? ??????? ?????? ?????? ????????? ???? ?????? ????????. — ???? ??????? -?????? (@ChefGov_ma) August 16, 2018  According to the explanatory note, the projects funded in 2019 aim to combat school drop out rates, generalize primary and basic education, and simplify school curricula to strengthen students’ critical thinking, analysis, research, and self-learning abilities. In the health sector, the government said it will continue to work towards correcting the issues in the medical aid program RAMED. The government also plans to implement a medical insurance program for professionals, independent workers, and “non-wage earners” in 2019. The government will also “launch comprehensive and in-depth programs and national policies.” The policies will include a “unified social register,” the third phase of the National Initiative for Human Development, and financial support for divorced and marginalized women and their children via the government’s family solidarity fund. According to the explanatory note, the government “will make employment a priority in all public policies by creating decent employment opportunities within the framework of sectorial strategies and infrastructure investments.” The government says it is considering developing funding mechanisms for young people with small businesses and innovative projects. It will also support self-employment and programs aiming at integrating vulnerable people. El Othmani said his government is working to boost public administration reform to implement the national anti-corruption strategy and to continue to reform pension systems and the tax system. Promoting investment and major economic projects According to El Othmani’s explanatory note, the government will provide conditions to promote the economy and support investment and entrepreneurship, as they are among priorities in the draft law. One of the concerns of the government, El Othmani said, is to accelerate the pace of industrialization and achieve the objectives set out in the industrial acceleration plan. The government plans to carry out industrialization by increasing the industrial sector’s contribution to gross domestic product, attracting foreign investment, and reducing the trade deficit. The government will also select projects to improve living conditions for the population, especially those in remote areas. In this regard, the government will complete the preparation of the national water plan and take measures to deal with emergency situations, in particular the shortage of drinking water. The government also hopes to develop alternative energies.

By Vera Sordini Rabat – Agadir will host an EU-funded GLOBAQUA conference in October on management of water shortages and innovations in water management. The event will be held under the title “Managing Water Scarcity in River Basins: Innovation and Sustainable Development.” The conference aims to ensure the sustainability of water sources. The conference’s umbrella project is GLOBAQUA, an “EU-funded project aiming to identify the prevalence of, and interaction between, stressors under water scarcity,” according to the project’s website. European and southern Mediterranean countries’ strategies on water will be the conference’s central theme. Participants will also discuss innovations on water reuse from municipal wastewater treatment, the use of brackish water, seawater desalination, water efficiency, and reusing water in agriculture. Freshwater systems worldwide are vulnerable to various stressors, including organic and inorganic pollution, water abstraction, land use, and others. The conference will study the consequences of stressors combined with water scarcity. In order to manage water, officials must understand how water scarcity interacts with other stressors in freshwater. Scientists and water sector professionals must work together to minimize the impact of scarcity. Managers, stakeholders, approximately 30 policymakers from African and European countries, and representatives from international institutions will come together to exchange expertise at the conference. The event will also offer participants the opportunity to discuss improvements for areas that are affected by water scarcity. The conference will take place October 4-6. The agenda includes a field trip to Morocco’s Souss Massa basin near Agadir. The basin is situated in a very arid area in western Morocco and covers an area of 1,486 square kilometers. The area suffers not only from water scarcity, but also from water abstraction, intensive farming, and saltwater intrusion in the coastal area. Within the framework of the GLOBAQUA project, Agadir is also hosting a “Training course on Knowledge Brokerage for River Basin Management.” The training course is taking place on October 3.

By Vera Sordini Rabat – Nearly half a million Moroccans residing in Italy have boosted bilateral contacts and generated intercultural projects between the two communities. Of the approximately 3 million Moroccans living in Europe, almost half a million reside in Italy. This makes Italy, together with Spain and after France, the second most popular immigration destination for Moroccans. According to the Italian Press Agency ANSA, “Moroccans are currently the largest non-EU immigrant community in Italy.” Italy continues to be a popular migrant destination for Moroccan residents. Nevertheless, the number of immigrants from Morocco has been decreasing since 2014 when it reached a peak of 454,773, according to the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). Despite the decline, the high numbers of Moroccans in Italy has resulted in strong social interactions and bonds between the countries. Outside of the migration sphere, the two countries endeavor to engage culturally. With the goal of promoting bilateral friendships, numerous projects have been initiated in recent years for cultural and religious purposes. An intercultural youth exchange as formative experience One of these projects, “Hallo Ciao Maroc,” was initiated in 2011 to forge intercultural exchanges by Rabat-born Abdelouahed El Abchi, called “Abdel” by everyone in Italy. He moved to South Tyrol, a province in northern Italy, fifteen years ago and has been an Italian resident since. In 2009 Abdel organized an educational journey to Morocco where he and his colleagues met representatives from the Ministry of Youth and a new Rabat non-profit called Bassma. Bassma is a humanitarian organization concerned with the social development of Rabat’s Youssoufia neighborhood. It was founded in 2009 by a group of volunteers and residents of the neighborhood. “We then had the idea to organize such an exchange together,” explained Abdel. “We thought it would be a great opportunity for (partly unprivileged) young people to get to know a foreign culture.” What founders of Bassma had in common was their love for the area they were born and their desire to change the unstable socioeconomic situation of the potentially deprived next generation. In the beginning, Bassma’s activities were mostly aimed at providing educational support for neighborhood children. The volunteers quickly realized that it was not enough. Bassma then added more services such as medical assistance, a soccer school, and more. Two years later, in 2011, Abdel launched “Hallo Ciao Maroc” in cooperation with Bassma. Another Italian organization also joined as co-organizers for the project, the independent non-profit Organization for World Solidarity (OEW). In the following years several of their employees accompanied the project in both countries. Young Italian participants submitted “motivation letters,” and twelve were chosen for the exchange. The project was and is primarily funded by the region of South Tyrol. The teenagers only had to provide a minor financial contribution.  Twelve Italian adolescents journeyed to Rabat where they lived with local host families for a week.  Intercultural talks with the Moroccans filled their mornings and tourist activities their afternoons. The talks covered various topics, and many friendships were formed. The following year, the exchange was carried out in Italy and supervised by members of Bassma. Twelve Moroccan participants were able to experience the Italian way of life. “We have seen that they were able to picture their own perception on Italian culture, which for many was limited to the culinary culture,” Bouchaib, one of Bassma’s founders, told Morocco World News. “They began to take an interest in foreign languages like Italian and English while enrolling in the cultural centers. In short, they have developed a new point of view on Italian citizens.” Abdel stated that that his primary aim was to bring together Moroccan and Italian adolescents to see that there are not so many differences between them after all. “They grew up within different systems and they have very distinct cultural backgrounds, but their talks cover the same topics, they have similar worries and visions for their future. They have a lot more things in common than one would imagine.”  Abdel also wanted the Italian group to dismantle possible stereotypes about Moroccan culture while experiencing it firsthand and to sensitize other teenagers, their families, and other people in their surroundings. They should become “multipliers for a peaceful life and a successful integration of migrants in Italy.” Abdel considers both Morocco and Italy his home country. “For me home is not geographically defined. It is not a country but a feeling. I feel at home where I feel loved, respected and where I have friends and social contacts,” Abdel explained. “Obviously I am still very connected to Morocco, as I was born there.” Abdel first had the idea of creating an intercultural exchange between his birth country and his adopted one after residing in Italy for a few years. As he works at the South Tyrol Department of Youth, it seemed natural for the project to involve young people. A need for greater interaction Italy and the North African country have shared a considerable amount of history in the past centuries. Many North Africans regard Italians more as Mediterranean neighbors than as Europeans, and therefore more similar to them than other European communities. Consequently, Italians are seen in a generally amicable light. This applies no less to the most western of the North African countries: Morocco. Although some Moroccans began migrating in the mid-1970s, it was not until the 1990s that Moroccan migration to Italy reached significant levels. In 1990 Italy joined the Schengen visa regime. From then on, Moroccan migrants were required to present a visa in order to enter Italy. In 1995, Italy introduced annual quotas for workers not originating from an EU-country. Various mischiefs such as bureaucratic delays in issuing authorizations for work permits contributed to the continuation of irregular migration. The quota for Morocco nonetheless never exceeded 4,500 per year. At the beginning of the 21st century, two groups led Italy’s list of foreigners, Albanians and Moroccans. According to a 2015 report by ISTAT the number of Albanian and Moroccan residents in Italy grew from 200,000 people in 2003 to 450,000 in 2014. In 2014 alone, 18,000 arrivals of Moroccan residents were recorded in Italy. Religious and cultural projects  In the past years efforts have been made to facilitate the practice of Islam in Italy. The ability to practice Islam was a challenging issue for not only Moroccan Muslims, but for the entirety of Muslims living in Italy. A major milestone was reached when the “Mosque of Rome” was constructed. Construction began in 1984 and was completed in 1994. The mosque is Europe’s largest. Another problem Muslims in Italy face is the lack of professional training for imams. Most operating imams have had no proper training before starting their preaching. Last September the University of Al Quaraouiyine in Fez and the University of Siena signed a cooperation agreement to create a new major for the latter specialized in training imams. The university in Fez will send professors to Italy who will teach Sharia and Islamic tradition at the University of Siena. The mosque’s construction and the recent implementation of the new major for Islam studies are just two examples of how Muslim integration in Italy is being promoted. Another project, the “Festival Italo-Marocchino” aims at celebrating the bonds between the two communities. Moroccans and Italians should benefit from the different gatherings the festival has to offer. Taking place in the North Italian city of Treviso, it is a primarily cultural endeavor. The festival boasts numerous sporting and cultural activities, discussion meetings, and cinema screenings. According to Abdallah Kerzaji, president of the “Festival Italo-Marocchino” association, the objective is to “promote and consolidate the former social, cultural and economic relations between the two countries and between the Moroccan immigrants in Italy and the locals.” While “Hallo Ciao Maroc,” the Mosque of Rome, and the Festival Italo-Marocchino might only be small pieces in the big puzzle, there are numerous other fruitful efforts being made to both enhance and encourage the need for intercultural exchange.

Rabat- The Moroccan Association for Consumer Protection is calling for authorities to set bus ticket prices over Eid al-Adha. On every Eid holiday, the ticket prices for buses in Morocco skyrocket due to the increase in the number of travelers across the country. In order to combat price increases during Eid al-Adha, the non-governmental association concerned with the protection of consumers’ purchasing power called for strict measures against “price manipulators” during the holiday. The association suggested that authorities set and advertise ticket prices for all destinations in the kingdom so that citizens will not have to pay high prices, the association told Moroccan news outlet Akhbar Alyaoum in a statement. In addition to price increases during Eid, some individuals in bus stations sell fake tickets to travelers, taking advantage of their need for cheaper tickets. During Eid al-Fitr in June, ticket prices increased by 30 to 50 percent, and even more for travelers heading to the southern provinces, who had to pay MAD 200 for a bus ticket that normally costs MAD 100. The association encouraged consumers to reject all “unreasonable” prices some bus companies propose and stressed that there should be monitors at bus stations to prevent the selling of fake tickets. Moroccan consumers have been boycotting three prominent companies for their “high prices” since April 20. The government, however, has made considerable initiatives to end corruption and “manipulation” of consumer products, such as introducing a consumer complaint hotline (57 57), dedicated to countering market monopolization and corrupt business.

Rabat – Spain has denied citizenship to a Moroccan resident for “fundamental institutional and cultural ignorance,” including declaring that the city of Ceuta belonged to Morocco. According to Spanish newspaper El Faro de Ceuta, the National Court’s Chamber explained that the Moroccan resident in Catalonia failed to answer “basic” questions considered “key” information by authorities, despite her fluency in Spanish. The Moroccan did not know the president of Catalonia or the typical dance of the region. Moreover, the citizen candidate said that Ceuta belonged to Morocco, contributing to the court’s denial of her citizenship request.  “It is unjustifiable to be ignorant of the country of which you want to be a national,” said the court according to the Spanish outlet.  The appellant, who is married to a Spaniard and has two daughters born in Spain, said that she was not able to answer the questions due to tiredness caused by pregnancy. “It has nothing to do with pregnancy, this is ignorance, at the most elementary level of the country, of the institutions and the political system despite the fact that she began her legal residence in Spain in 2000,” replied the chamber. Despite being a regularized worker, participating in the life of the company and following training courses in Spain, the court deemed her knowledge insufficient to become a citizen.

Rabat – Following a month-long crisis over pilots’ demands for a pay raise and better working conditions, RAM’s leadership is talking about expansion and quality improvements. In a letter published by le Desk on August 15, Royal Air Maroc (RAM) CEO Abdelhamid Addou praised the pilots’ sacrifice and dedication to RAM’s success.  Calling his meeting with the National Trade Union of Moroccan Pilots (AMPL) “historic,” the CEO said: “It is undeniable, in the history of Royal Air Maroc, that pilots have always been part of the company’s success.” Addou spoke of pilots’ sense of responsibility, presence, and care when “the company called on their devotion and engagement.” “The past few weeks have been trying times for all of us,” the letter read, acknowledging the feud that began July 18 and paralyzed the company for almost a month.  Renewing RAM Rather than causing further financial loss and harm to the company’s struggling reputation, Addou said the month-long crisis should be a morale boost “that will enable us to prompt our company on the path of sustained progress.” “I wish to see Royal Air Maroc propelled in the place it deserves, to be among the [world’s] most performing airlines. Together we can achieve this goal.” Royal Air Maroc reached an agreement with AMPL on August 14, putting a “definite end” to the tense and unfriendly atmosphere between pilots and management. During the breach, the company was reportedly losing MAD 20 million daily as a result of reimbursements and other financial costs due to cancelled and delayed flights. The crisis reached its peak between late July and early August as the executive board and the representatives of pilots blamed each other’s “unreasonable demands” for the company’s troubles.  What started the strike? On July 17, a day prior to the feud, Abdelhamid Addou sent AMPL a letter in which he blamed pilots for RAM’s troubles and “impending” paralysis.  Addou reprimanded pilots for not going along with the company’s expansion plan. He urged them to put aside their demands and grudges and be part of the “dream” of making RAM a better-performing and better-equipped airline.  Should pilots fixate on their salary demands and ignore the company’s long and medium-term plans, they would be responsible for the company’s “collapse,” the letter warned. But the spirits of Addou’s August 15 and July 17 letters stand in stark contrast. And although RAM and AMPL have not yet issued detailed statements regarding the terms of their recent agreement, the company’s August 15 message seems to be making the point that RAM is set to compromise with some of the pilots’ demands but also realize its expansion plan.  All RAM’s troubles—delays and cancellations—will be resolved by next week as the company seeks to deliver on its promise of emerging stronger from the crisis by upgrading the quality of its services to regain the trust of its customers, le 360 reported yesterday.  But for all RAM’s celebratory and optimistic statements since the end of the crisis, it remains to be seen whether the promised improvements will come in time to salvage the company’s bruised reputation.

By Isabella Wang Rabat – ATU has reinstated Morocco as a member at a preparatory meeting in Nairobi. Morocco’s membership will enable Morocco and other African nations to develop their telecommunications systems. The African Telecommunications Union (ATU), also known by its French acronym UAT, announced the move on Tuesday, August 14, in Nairobi. The ATU is a specialized agency of the African Union which combines the telecommunications providers of its member countries to increase the development of Africa’s information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure. The ATU stated in a note, “The Secretary General of the UAT confirms that the request for return of the kingdom has been accepted and that the member countries have been notified of the return of the Kingdom of Morocco.”  Only last year in 2017 was Morocco readmitted to the African Union. It had been more than 3 decades since Morocco had left the continental body in 1984 after a majority of the member states recognized the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in the disputed territory of Western Sahara.  Since the ATU was at the time a specialized agency under the African Union, Morocco became separated from what was at the time the ATU. Only after Morocco’s separation from the African Union in 1999 did the ATU become a fully-fledged Union and gain its current name.  The announcement occurred during the 4th Regional Preparatory Meeting of the Africa Group of the Plenipotentiary Conference of the International Communication Union (ITU). The meeting was held for two days, August 13-14.  The Moroccan delegation was led by Sidi Mohammed Drissi Melyani, the technical director of the National Telecommunications Regulatory Agency (ANRT). Also in the delegation were representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation; the Ministry of Industry, Investment, Trade, and Digital; the Ministry of Economy and Finance; as well as the National Agency for the Regulation of Telecommunications and the Moroccan embassy in Nairobi.  The regional meeting aimed to finalize African joint contributions before their adoption at the Plenipotentiary Conference of the ITU, to be held from October 29 to November 16, 2018, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.  Possible benefits of Morocco’s re-entry  According to analysis by the US Department of Commerce,Morocco’s telecommunications market is one of the most mature in Africa due to its numerous international and local providers. Morocco’s goals to invest in hardware and networking infrastructure aligns with the goals of the ATU.  The mission of the ATU “to promote the rapid development of the ICTs in Africa in order to achieve universal service and access to broadband” will greatly benefit from Morocco’s membership. Morocco’s membership will bring expertise for the ATU while also helping Morocco’s goals to foster ICT development.  In October 2017, members expressed great interest in Morocco’s strategies in telecommunications and digital technology at the 3rd annual Digital Africa Conference.   When discussing the possibility of an integrated digital ecosystem within Africa, the Moroccan ambassador to France, Chakib Benmoussa, underlined Morocco’s efforts to develop the sector and how this would enable greater cooperation policies between Morocco and other African countries.   As a further testament to cooperation in telecommunications, the 2020 Digital Morocco Plan, launched in 2016 seeks to accelerate the digital transformation of Morocco and make Morocco a regional hub. It entailed stimulating digital activities in telecommunications throughout francophone Africa and strengthening Morocco’s digital exports to other nations in Africa.

Rabat – Morocco’s BCIJ plans to expand over the borders to monitor the Moroccan diaspora in Europe, but it needs access to Europol’s intelligence. Morocco “keeps a watchful eye” on its nationals in Europe in coordination with European police services to monitor many cases of young migrants subject to radicalization, said Abdelhak Khiame, head of the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ), in an interview with Spanish outlet Efe. Efe gave the interview on the first anniversary of the terrorist attack which took place in Spain’s Cambrils and Barcelona in August 2017. Some individuals of Moroccan origin were involved in the incident which killed 16 and wounded 150. According to Khiame, Morocco needs to have full access to Europol’s databases. “We have launched a new strategy to monitor the Moroccans who are abroad, and in fact we have called our Western counterparts to share with us the data they have.” “With this request, the BCIJ wants to have direct access to information about all these young people, many of whom are binational and at risk of violent extremism,” explained the Spanish outlet. Referring to last year’s terrorist attack in Catalonia, Khiame said, “We have to learn lessons from cases like this.” “The Spanish security services should count all Moroccans in their territory, and communicate with us if they have suspicions about someone,” he added. Khiame criticized French police The BCIJ chief praised the cooperation between Moroccan and Spanish intelligence services, saying that it is “excellent” and “without failures.” However, Khiame “criticized the French security services which did not inform their Moroccan counterparts about a French-Moroccan involved in a recent attack, a person who was classified in the so-called ‘File S’ as a dangerous criminal.” Khiame believed the information was essential for the BCIJ, the Spanish outlet said. The attack Khiame referred to occurred on March 23 in Trebes, a small town in southern France, when an armed French-Moroccan suspect, Redouane Lakdim, entered a supermarket and took hostages, eventually killing four people, including a high-ranking officer. Lieutenant Colonel Arnaud Beltrame sacrificed his life to save a hostage. Khiame previously criticized Spanish police A week after the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils on August 17, 2017, Khiame criticized the Spanish police’s lack of control over mosques in Spain. “How come the mosque in Ripoll didn’t attract attention? Were the imams not controlled? And I who thought that our Spanish friends understood many things after the Madrid attacks in 2004,” he said in an interview with Efe. Khiame noted the same issue in this year’s interview with Efe. “Khiame praised the ‘professionalism’ of the police, but highlighted some pending issues such as the need to control the religious sphere” in Spain, Efe wrote. “Spain has a strong community of Muslims, including converts and those from other countries,” Khiame told Efe. “These people should receive religious guidance.” For this reason, Khiame called for all worship places in Spain to be “under the tutelage of a governmental institution.” According to Khiame, lack of government control over mosques and social marginalization are some of the main reasons youth turn to extremist ideologies. As for Morocco, the BCIJ chief indicated that the reform of the religious field, including tight control over sermons, have led to “the disappearance of anarchist mosques.” Morocco needs Europol’s intelligence On Europol, Khiame reiterated, “I believe that the database of all agencies responsible for security in Europe such as Europol has to be shared with North African countries like Morocco.” The European Parliament issued a press statement on July 5 which stated that The Council of the EU agreed that its commission could start talks with Morocco and seven other MENA countries on exchanging data with Europol. “The aim of strengthening cooperation is to prevent and combat terrorism and organized crime, and to better address migration-related challenges such as the facilitation of irregular migration and trafficking in human beings.” However, the agreement on exchanging intelligence data between Europol and the MENA countries cannot be concluded if it fails to comply with EU law on the protection of personal data, to ensure equivalent protection, according to the statement. In this regard, a source from security told Efe that “Europol has requested data from Morocco several times, but Europol has been reluctant to give full access to its data because they consider that Morocco’s data protection legislation is not adapted to European legislation.”

Rabat- Approximately 8.1 million sheep and goats have been prepared for the Eid al-Adha sacrifice, exceeding the demand of consumers. The Ministry of Agriculture and Marine Fisheries issued the statement, specifying that the certified livestock include 4.6 million male sheep, 1.38 million ewes, and 2.1 million goats. The number of sheep and goats exceeds the anticipated demand. The number of livestock prepared for slaughter in 2018 increased significantly from 2017, when just 5.43 million sheep and goats were certified. Ranchers and professionals in the sector were able to meet the demands of citizens, in addition to supplying 5.45 million cattle, 48 percent up from the expected number, said the ministry in a statement on Wednesday. The ministry assured consumers that animal health surveillance programs and vaccination campaigns by the National Office of Food Safety (ONSSA) have ensured that the sacrificial livestock are in a healthy condition in all regions of the kingdom. Sheep prices are estimated based on their weight, age, and sex, ranging from around MAD 1500 and MAD 5000. In June, Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch, the Interprofessional Federation of Red Meat (FIVIAR) President Mohamed Karimine, and representatives of several organizations, including ONSSA, discussed the preparations of livestock for the Eid sacrifice. The group assured Moroccans that all necessary measures were taken to deal with failure or non-compliance with quality requirements and that. Eid al-Adha (Festival of Sacrifice) Eid al-Adha will be celebrated on Wednesday, August 22. It is the second of two Islamic holidays celebrated by Muslims worldwide on the 10th day of the Islamic Dhu al-Hijjah (the month of pilgrimage) in which the Hajj (pilgrimage) takes place. After performing the Eid prayer in the morning, the oldest males in Muslim families proceed to sacrifice a sheep, goat, cow, or sometimes even a camel. The sacrifice must be performed after prayer, as the Prophet Mohamed said, according to a hadith related by Sahih al Bukhari: “Whoever slaughtered (his sacrifice) before the Eid prayer, should slaughter again.”

By Carlo Zanetti Rabat – On Tunisian Women’s Day, President Essebsi announced he will submit a bill to parliament asking for equal inheritance rights for men and women having the same kinship level. The bill, announced on Monday, August 13, is in line with an initiative of the Tunisian Individual Freedom and Equality Committee (COLIBE), a committee set up by the president in August 2017 to mediate between the country’s laws and the articles of the 2014 constitution. The need for the governmental organ arose from a discrepancy between the values promoted by the recent constitution and traditional Islamic values.  Though Islam is recognized as Tunisia’s religion of state, the Qur’an is not officially mentioned as a source of legislation in the 2014 constitution. Nevertheless, some laws are still derived from the Islamic sacred text, according to which the deceased’s female relatives, such as daughters and sisters, inherit half of what male relatives with an equal level of kinship, such as sons and brothers, inherit. Along with demanding equal inheritance rights for women, COLIBE has called for the abolition of capital punishment (which many had expected to appear in the 2014 constitution), the decriminalization of homosexuality, freedom of conscience, and the right for Tunisian women to pass on citizenship to their foreign husbands.  In 2017, Essebsi introduced a law which allowed interreligious marriages between a Muslim woman and a non-Muslim man. The measure did not find agreement with local notaries, who, in many instances, have refused to marry interreligious couples. Similarly, COLIBE’s proposals, as well as the president’s statement on inheritance, have been strongly opposed not only by the most conservative forces of the country, but also by a substantial part of the public opinion. ‘Tunisian men and women are against the change’ As pointed out by Sarah Yerkes from the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Essebsi’s proposal “is a controversial decision, particularly because (according to public opinion surveys) the majority of Tunisian men and women are against the change in policy.” She also speculated that, being close to the end of his political career, the Tunisian president  “feels that he is able to take risks other politicians cannot.” On August 11, the “National Coordination for the Defense of the Qur’an, the Constitution and Equitable Development” organized a protest against COLIBE. Thousands of citizens gathered outside parliament to demonstrate their dissent against the government-backed committee, arguing that its projects undermine the Islamic identity of the country. COLIBE head Bochra Belhaj Hmida accused opponents of spreading disinformation to whip up public sentiment. They “fail to point out that it would be possible to opt out of equality of inheritance,” she said in an interview reported by the Financial Times. In order to “unite rather than divide” the citizens and grant the exercise of religious freedom, President Essebsi said that the equal inheritance legislation should, in fact, allow those who wanted to apply traditional inheritance principles can pass down their property according to Sharia. Should the new law pass, Tunisia would move a step further in its gradual process of decentralizing the Qur’an from the legal system. The maneuver would bring the North-African country even closer to the perspective which most Western countries have on gender equality and on the relationship between religion and state.

By Vera Sordini Rabat – Two days after part of a bridge in Genoa, Italy, collapsed, the death toll has risen to at least 39 and the search for survivors has been suspended. The catastrophe came just after 12 noon Tuesday, August 14. The “Ponte Morandi,” named after its architect Riccardo Morandi and part of the Italian A10 motorway, fell 45 meters, taking numerous cars and trucks down with it. According to Italian newspaper La Repubblica, 39 deaths have been confirmed up to now. Three children are among the deceased. 16 people are injured of which 9 severely. The number of deaths could rise in the following hours and days. Rescue operations worked through the entire night from Tuesday to Wednesday. Yesterday afternoon however, rescue workers had to temporarily stop excavating on site. The risk of collapse of another of the motorway’s pylons led to the cessation. Firefighters are now evaluating the pylon’s stability. The area around the bridge has been isolated following the collapse and the supply of gas and electricity has been cut. At least 400 residents had to leave their houses after the disaster. Genoa’s district attorney’s office has now opened an investigation on “culpable disaster” and “multiple culpable homicide.” “It is still early to verify causes and responsibilities, but tragedies of this kind must not occur anymore,” Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conti stressed on Tuesday. “The whole area needs to be secured.” Designed by Italian engineer Riccardo Morandi and built between 1963 and 1967, the collapsed viaduct crossed the Polcevera valley and was proudly dubbed the “Brooklyn Bridge” by locals. On Tuesday, Genoa’s Mayor Marco Bucci proclaimed two days of public mourning. Pope Francis has also expressed his “spiritual vicinity” to the victims’ families. He expressed his closeness “to the hurt ones, to the evacuated ones and to all the ones that suffer due to this dramatic event.”

Rabat – The Daraa-Tafilalet Regional Directorate of Health has said the epidemiological situation in Morocco’s Zagora is “normal and does not cause any concern.” After the deaths of three children infected with meningitis in the southeast province of Zagora, media allegations implied a “worrying spread” of the disease, raising concern among the public. The Ministry of Health released a statement on Wednesday assuring the situation was under control. The statement said: “The province of Zagora has recorded 6 cases of meningitis in 2017, while 7 cases were recorded until 13 August 2018.” The statement went on to establish that six of the seven cases resulted in healing, and only one infant perished from the infection. The Ministry of Health says it has maintained a well-defined, nationally-based surveillance program to control the epidemiological situation regarding meningitis according to the statement. According to the ministry, not only do health officials closely monitor the disease, health providers carefully manage and register cases to ensure the disease will not spread. Vaccinations, preventive treatments, prompt diagnosis, medical examinations, and sensitization are included within the health ministry’s protocol. The ministry continued to reassure the Moroccan public by stating the regional offices in Daraa-Tafilalet will closely monitor the situation as they maintain their mission of preserving the health of the Moroccan population. The health ministry noted its desire to set the public’s mind at ease and stated the department will remain vigilant and mobilized in case of emergencies.

Rabat – After FIFA ranked Morocco’s national football team 41st in June, Herve Renard’s team dropped five spots to 46th.  The Atlas Lions are paying a high price for their early exit in the 2018 World Cup in Russia.  Despite a solid performance in the global competition, the national team have not maintained their rank, especially after two defeats against Iran and Portugal and a draw against Spain in the World Cup.  At the African level, Morocco has the fifth best national football team, behind both Tunisia and Senegal (24), the Republic of Congo (37), and Ghana (45). The national team is also the third among Arab nations, behind Tunisia and Egypt (65).  The 2018 World Cup champion, France, has gained first place for the first time since 2001. Les Bleus are followed by Belgium (2), Brazil (3), Croatia (4), Uruguay (5), England (6), Portugal (7), Switzerland (8), and Spain and Denmark both in 9th.  To earn a better spot in the next FIFA ranking, the Moroccan team will have to prove its worth in the qualification games of the 2019 CAN.  Mehdi Benatia, team captain, and his teammates will play against Malawi September 8, Comoros on October 10, and Cameroon on November 17.

Rabat – Qatar has pledged to inject $15 billion into Turkey’s economy to rescue the country amid US sanctions and financial meltdown. But Turkey’s diplomatic crisis continues. Qatari and Turkish officials made the announcement yesterday afternoon after the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, met in Ankara with Turkey’s strongman, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, over a possible financial package as Turkey struggles with its worst financial crisis in years.  Qatar’s benevolent act comes at a dire time for Turkey’s economy, with the Turkish lira reaching record lows in the last few days as a result of a feud with the US.  Turkey’s currency lost more than 20 percent against the US dollar last week, and the country was in need of an urgent boost to build investor confidence and avoid an escalation of the country’s impending banking collapse. Strategic alliance or Muslim solidarity? The Qatari emir said that beyond financial calculations, his country’s primary motivation was to “stand by our brothers in Turkey,” a hint at the nascent but apparently strong strategic alliance between the two Muslim countries.  Qatar also reportedly instructed some influential Qatari businessmen to buy more Turkish lira to boost the currency’s resilience and speed the recovery process for Turkey. “We stand by our brothers in Turkey that have stood with the issues of the Muslim World and with Qatar,” Sheikh Tamim tweeted.  Ibrahim Kalin, a spokesperson for the Turkish presidency, tweeted: “Qatar has pledged $15 billion of direct investments in Turkey. Turkey-Qatari relations are based on solid foundations of true friendship and solidarity.” The move has nonetheless been widely perceived as Qatar’s way of scratching its Turkish partner’s back, in recognition of Turkey’s support in recent tumultuous times for Qatar. A coalition of Arab countries, led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, isolated Qatar and imposed a diplomatic and trade embargo on the peninsular country in June 2017.  Ankara, which in 2015 set up a military base in Qatar, sent in troops amid the “Gulf Crisis” in June 2017. Ankara also sent a wide range of foodstuffs to Doha to mitigate the food shortage that resulted from the Saudi blockade. “Big deal that could build investor confidence in Turkey, staving off potential economic collapse,” tweeted Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Cagaptay added: “The Qataris believe Turkish deployment saved them from Saudi-UAE invasion. This may be how Qatar is paying back the favor.” Tension with US continues But while Qatar’s financial lifeline has given Turkey a much-needed breath of fresh air in the midst of several suffocating weeks, Turkey’s dispute with its US NATO ally has not diminished and may even escalate.  US officials said after the Qatari announcement that tariffs imposed on Turkish steel and aluminum would see no change until Ankara meets America’s demands. President Trump this month imposed a series of economic sanctions on Turkey, asking for the release of Andrew Brunson, an evangelical pastor who has been detained for two years in Turkey on charges of terrorism.  On Wednesday, however, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the US imposed sanctions against its NATO ally on “national security” grounds and that even if Turkey were to release Brunson—whose situation magnified the Ankara-Washington rift in the first place—US sanctions would still not be lifted. But Sanders’s remarks were made in response to President Erdogan’s latest retaliatory move in what has quickly become a show of force and strongman resolve between Trump and his Turkish counterpart.  The Turkish president on Wednesday announced an unprecedented 50 to 140 percent tariff raise on US alcohol, rice, and cars.  Prior to that, President Erdogan urged Turkish customers to boycott American electronic products. “If they [America] have iPhone, there is Samsung on the other side,” he said to a cheering crowd in Istanbul earlier this week, promising that Turkey would invest in its industrial sector and produce whatever was needed.  “We will no longer buy from the outside. We will produce, consume to our heart’s content, and then export to the world.” Speaking about President Erdogan’s imposition of high tariffs on US goods, Sarah Sanders said that the move was “a step in the wrong direction.” Turkey, meanwhile, has been busy seeking other alliances, including with China, Russia, Iran, and a wide range of other emerging countries, all of which Ankara sees as potential substitutes for its deteriorating relationship with the US and NATO.

By Dil Bola Rabat – The centuries-old practice of henna is an important part of Moroccan culture and has become a common tourist attraction. What many do not know, however, is whether the paste being applied is 100 percent natural henna which results in a reddish-brown tattoo on the skin or black henna, a perilous chemical mixture that can cause lifelong damage.  Henna is an ancient cultural practice wherein a paste created from the Lawsonia inermis or “hina tree” plant is used for various functions such as skin decorations or hair dye. After mashing dried leaves, artists create a reddish brown coloured paste which they use to create elaborate designs on skin for various ceremonies, such as weddings or holidays. The natural tattoo lasts anywhere from several days to a few weeks as the process of exfoliation slowly allows the tattoo to fade. Black henna, in contrast, is a mixture created using para-phenylenediamine (PPD) and other chemicals such as white spirits. PPD is a synthetic coal dye that is now used in henna pastes to create a darker, quicker, and longer-lasting dye in comparison to the natural paste which must sit for six to eight hours to achieve a prominently dark design. PPD has been known to cause severe skin reactions as some are born sensitive to the chemical whereas others can become sensitive. The chemical is a strong sensitizer producing an allergic reaction that will never go away. As a potential carcinogen, it has been associated with “bladder cancer, asthma, and many other health problems,” according to Lori Gordon, a certified henna supervisor. The disastrous results are displayed in a reaction that may appear anywhere from 3 to 10 days after application. When mixed in henna paste and applied to skin, PPD frequently causes a variety of skin problems. This includes itching, bleeding, peeling, burning, painful blistering, and frequently terrible scarring. Black henna has caused many problems for tourists, and even locals, who do not know what is being applied. Earlier this month a British tourist, Toni Feeney, accompanied by her two sons, took to Facebook to share photos and warn others of the experience her family had with black henna while on vacation in Morocco. Feeney shared photos of the aggressive burning and scarring on the arms of her two children. Upon medical examination, the hospital enlightened her about the harmful mixture and diagnosed the children with chemical burns. Her children were put on antihistamines and antibiotics prompting the mother to warn others as she “just presumed it was harmless,” as “loads of people were offering it.” PPD is a banned chemical in the US as well as many other Western states. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spoken out about the perils of PPD whether it is used for skin decoration or hair dye. The Moroccan government does not have a law on the books regarding PPD, but the International Certification for Natural Henna Arts (ICNHA) remains the primary guarantor of safe, natural henna applications. The Marrakech Henna Art Café located in the midst of the Marrakech medina holds the sole safety certification in Morocco. The café is a collaboration between a Moroccan Amazigh (Berber) named Rachid Karkouch and an American artist, Lori Gordon. Together they founded and co-own this art gallery café that “offers authentic cultural experiences that incorporate local community development.” The café works closely with a US-based non-profit organization, Six Degrees Consortium and Morocco based El-Fenn Maroc to achieve their mission of “building bridges across cultures through visual art.” A variety of mixed media art is displayed, and many traditional Moroccan henna artists are employed. According to Gordon, the establishment frequently sees people coming in to complain about the henna tattoos they receive in Marrakech’s Jemaa El-Fna square. More often than not, these tattoos contain harmful chemicals such as PPD. For an experienced henna artist, it is easy to discern when a tattoo indicates signs of PPD application. But many tourists, similar to Feeney, who remain unfamiliar with the practice of henna and lack the ability to discern the presence of chemicals, have experienced a severe reaction. The occurrence is not uncommon as it happens repeatedly all over the state. The safe alternative is to receive henna from an artist certified by ICNHA. Certification requires the passing of an exam on the history, science, and art of natural henna and the perils of black henna. The current henna supervisor at the Marrakech Henna Art Café remains the only member in Morocco providing a dedicated service to tourists while honouring a priceless Moroccan tradition. Although partaking in the ancient art form of henna is a must when visiting Morocco, visitors should be cautious when encountering artisans who cannot provide answers when asked for a list of ingredients. The lifelong effects of PPD may result in not only a distorted cultural impression but a long-lasting physical impression as well.

Rabat- Police have arrested a man for accusing them of mismanagement in a recent video. The judicial police in El Jadida, 106 kilometers south of Casablanca, arrested a man on Monday for accusations he made in a video posted online Sunday, August 12. The video showed the man in front of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) building, shouting and complaining about the “absence of policemen.”  The 27-year-old man frantically complained that some delinquents burgled his family’s house and attacked his parents, saying that when his parents called the police for help, they did not show up. “It had been more than an hour and the police did not show up. When we came to the [police station] they told us to go away,” he stated. The man claimed that the security forces were absent because they went to attend a moussem (festival) in the region. DGSN denied the allegations and placed the man in custody for spreading “false information.” DGSN also claimed that the man has a poor reputation in his neighborhood and had previously engaged in violent acts. An investigation is ongoing, under the supervision of the public prosecutor.

Rabat – Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih declared on Thursday 26th July 2018, that “Saudi Arabia is temporarily halting all oil shipments through Bab El-Mandeb Strait immediately after an earlier attack on two crude vessels by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement until the situation becomes clearer and the maritime transit through Bab El-Mandeb is safe. On August 4, 2018, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih announced in a new statement that oil shipments had resumed and that “the decision to resume shipments through the strait of Bab al-Mandeb was made after the leadership of the coalition has taken necessary measures to protect the coalition states’ ships.” The Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which is 20 miles (32 km) wide and connects the Red Sea (northwest) with the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean (southeast), presents a strategic importance, but it’s more and more destabilized by many threats including recent Houthi attacks against ships crossing the Strait, the Iranian willing to block the routes leading to it and the remaining terrorism activities in the region.  The Bab el-Mandeb Strait is a focal transit point which is every day traversed by an estimated 3.8 million barrels, in addition to being in proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, which accounts for an estimated 17 million barrels of oil that transit the strait per day. More than sixty commercial ships transit the strait every day and several passenger cruise lines use the route as well. It’s also a strait, through which generally an estimated 12.5 to 20 percent of global trade passes every year. This Strait is moreover economically vital for the countries of the region. Egypt relies on it for its own liquefied natural gas importations. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar depend on it as it’s a key maritime passage that reaches the oil pipeline called the Suez-Mediterranean or SUMED pipeline, which transits oil through the Suez Canal towards Egypt. The central position that the Bab el-Mandeb Strait occupy in the global trade compared to other straits drags the countries of the region in a fierce vying for its control. In an interview with the newspaper Al Hayat, the Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi said that “whoever holds the keys to Bab el-Mandeb and the Strait of Hormuz does not need a nuclear bomb.” Situated between Yemen and Somalia, the Bab El-Mandeb Strait is facing some major factors that threaten freedom of navigation through it and that are relevant to the ongoing no end of conflict in Yemen between the Houthi rebels and the Hadi-led government forces on the one hand, and terrorism threat in this country as well as in Somalia on the other hand. In fact, Houthi rebels have led, in many times, multiple missile attacks against Saudi, Emirati and even American vessels crossing the Bab El-Mandeb Strait or near to it. They also always struggled to control the Strait by keeping their domination on the strategic nearest strongholds: the capital Sanaa and especially the Port of Hodeidah, which is a significant rear base for Houthi’s deployment. For this reason, Anwar Gargash, UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, said recently that the only way forward to ensure freedom of navigation in the Red Sea is to get the Houthi rebels. In this context, the Saudi-led Arab coalition airstrikes led in last few days on the Houthi-controlled province of Saada in Northern Yemen can be considered as an attempt to diffuse Houthi attention and facilitate the seizure of the Hodeidah port.        Meanwhile, the Iran suspicious involvement in the ongoing Yemeni civil war in favour of Houthi movement against the government of Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi and its loyal forces, is considered by some analysts as being a part of a military strategy, through which Iran will deploy its naval forces from the Strait of Hormuz, the Red Sea and even to Strait of Mallaca. Iran would be able to block and threaten maritime oil tanker traffic by controlling Strait of Hormuz and Bab el-Mandeb, using the Houthis. This would put new cards in Iran’s hands to utilize in its regional and international relations, as it seems recently from the last military maneuvers held by Iranian navy near the Strait of Hormuz to respond to USA reimposed sanctions.  However, such navigation blocking eventuality is likely to disrupt the supplies, increase the oil market prices and can evolve to a more complex conflict where USA, France and other countries will intervene to secure oil supplies and stabilize its prices by controlling these Straits and all the routes leading to them.    Finally, terrorism threat will remain a serious concern for stability and freedom of navigation in the Bab El-Mandeb Strait, given that the Islamic State (Isis) and Shabaab terrorist groups continue to operate in Somalia and due to the fact that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State groups (Isis) are still active in Yemen’s central and eastern governorates.

By Isabella Wang Rabat – Distance previously kept Australia and Morocco apart, but with Australia’s new Rabat embassy and trade opportunities, bilateral relations are strengthening.  The opening of the new Australian embassy in Morocco in June 2017 signified the burgeoning relationship between Australia and Morocco. Now emerges a partnership of opportunity and necessity from bilateral relations that have historically been scarce. Diplomatic relations only began 30 years ago in 1976 with a joint statement which announced intentions “to consolidate and strengthen mutual understanding and to stimulate cultural and commercial links.” Yet since then, little has been done to galvanize the intentions into actions.  Rather, each country has sought to ascertain its presence within its own geographical region, asserting their significance through a geostrategically multifaceted identity.  Morocco’s Maghreb identity is incredibly fruitful: its geography in North Africa has enabled the country to assert influence within the region while also fostering relations with Europe. Compounded with this is Morocco’s Islamic identity which has enabled the kingdom to forge a continuous dialogue with countries in the Middle East.  Meanwhile, Australia has attained status due to the island’s geographical dominance of Oceania, which in turn has led to a fostering of relations with Southeast Asia. At the same time, Australia’s association with the Commonwealth and the West, heightened by a shared history in fighting wars has solidified the country’s relations with the UK, and more prominently the US.   With both Morocco and Australia’s growing influence, they now look towards further regions in order to achieve a network of bilateral relations and greater international sway.  Like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle uniting, the bilateral relations between Morocco and Australia are ideal; each country’s distinct identity and regional influence provides a gateway for the new territories and relations the other desires.  Opportunity for Trade and Investment At the very basis of bilateral relations between Morocco and Australia is tangible economic gain through trade. With Morocco’s current concentration of trade in the EU region at 59.4 percent, the kingdom is overly dependent on the EU.  In contrast, the European Union is not as reliant on Moroccan exports: Morocco sells 78.5 percent of its apparel exports to France and Spain, but these products are a miniscule portion of the two European countries’ imported clothing. For one of Morocco’s biggest export markets, France, the kingdom only comprises 0.7 percent of the garment imports.  A plethora of opportunity awaits economic relations between Australia and Morocco. While both dominate specific sectors of the agriculture and mining industries, Morocco and Australia’s status within the global market is complementary rather than competitive: Morocco dominates the world’s phosphate and fishing industries while Australia heavily exports iron ore, coal, gas, and gold.   Yet as the Moroccan government noted, “Despite the advances in trade relations, the economic potential of Morocco-Australia relations remains unexploited.” As the impetus to improving economic potential, Morocco and Australia established the Australia-Morocco Business Council (AMBC) in 2017, which establishes a “platform of meetings, interaction and exchange of ideas, experiences and information on business opportunities, regulations, investment and market momentum between Australia, Morocco and their development zones.”  The council makes efforts to bolster trade and investment links, while also emphasizing the strategic gateway that the partnership can be to open up economic relations with further regions.  Signaling the efficacy of the council is Kasbah Resources, an Australia company which has finalized its production of underground mines in Meknes at El Hajeb, an area 55 kilometers southwest of Fez. The project has the potential to produce 750,000 tons of ore per year and has also brought the investment of Japanese companies, Toyota Tsusho and Nittetsu Mining, widening the breadth of Morocco’s investment relations.  Relations dependent on economic benefits are not enough. They craft a superficial interaction focused on narrow gains. For Morocco and Australia’s bilateral relations to truly hold impact, there must be genuine and meaningful dialogue, entrenched in an exchange of politics and ideology.   Such dialogue may impact Australia’s perception of Africa. Before opening its embassy in Morocco last year, Australia, held the least number of diplomatic posts in Africa—a mere eight—among the G20 nations.  The reason behind the diplomatic deficit? Australia’s foreign policy on Africa has been defined by paralysis. Indecision and inaction have seized Australia’s engagement in Africa due to its inability to understand what it wants on the continent.  Australia’s latest Foreign Policy White Paper, which establishes the framework for the government’s international aims, encapsulates both its inability to understand what it wants in Africa as well as an inability to truly understand the nuances of the continent.  The paper lacks specificity and clarity when addressing its goals: it mentioned “Africa” only as a whole with specific mention only to “Morocco” in referencing the newly opened embassy. Such reflects Australia’s dominant political and public discourse on relations with African nations.  Nikola Pijovic, a PhD scholar with the National Security College, Australian National University writes, “While the African continent is home to a very diverse set of 54 states, the traditional lack of foreign policy engagement with most of them, coupled with the general lack of knowledge about African states, allows Australian policymakers and the wider public to refer to the engagement with the continent in such generic terms.” Australia’s new focus on relations with Morocco could signify a closing of the ideological and rhetorical gulf between the realities of Africa and Australia’s perception of the continent. Australia-Morocco relations indeed signify a critical crossroads for Australia: to remain stuck in its indecision or to engage in a genuine dialogue with Morocco in order to truly understand the nuances of Africa.  While the dominant narrative propagated by Australian politicians and diplomats stresses the nation’s support for the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa, focusing on the 1970s-1990s, Australia’s relations with Africa also bear darker underpinnings.  Until the 1970s, Australia directly supported the colonization of Africa and from the end of World War II also showed strong sympathy for “outnumbered whites” in South Africa and what was then Rhodesia. South Africa has been a primary locus of Australia’s relations in Africa, both political and commercial, due to their shared membership in the Commonwealth. The uneasy truth remains that Australia’s engagement with Africa is most prominent in South Africa due to continued colonialist sentiments, which emerges from policies focused on racial exclusion.  The most recent Africa-related political activity has been a wave of conservative politicians from the incumbent Liberal Party stressing the need to help white South African farmers they believe are persecuted, even by means of a special visa category.  At the same time, the rhetoric of politicians towards African residents in Australia, particularly to those of South Sudanese heritage, has resorted to stereotypes of violence and gangs.  In an interview with Australian radio station 3AW, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had stated, “There is certainly concern about street crime in Melbourne. There is real concern about Sudanese gangs.” Similarly, home affairs minister Peter Dutton said people in Melbourne were “scared to go out to restaurants” because of “African gang violence.”  As an integral part of Australia’s catchall understanding of “Africa” and as a nation which holds a multitude of historical, economic, and political bonds with African nations, Morocco presents an alternatively complex and refined view of Africa.  King Mohammed VI himself has sought to play a dominant role in setting African foreign policy, making over 51 visits to 26 African states, with over 952 agreements and partnerships since his ascension to the throne.  With growing relations with both Africa and Australia, Morocco has the potential to be a platform for genuine cross-cultural understanding which could inform Australia’s perception of Africa and demonstrate the richness and intricacies of the many African nations.  The King emphasized in his 2016 royal speech on the King and People’s Revolution Day that Africa is a priority in Moroccan foreign policy: “For Morocco, Africa means more than just being part of a geographical area, or having historical bonds with the continent. Africa also means sincere affection, appreciation, close human and spiritual relations as well as tangible solidarity. Furthermore, Africa is the natural extension of Morocco and the embodiment of the country’s strategic depth.”  The King’s speech in fact addressed colonialist roots to Africa’s problems and public perceptions, saying, “The problems plaguing African peoples today, such as backwardness, poverty, migration, wars and conflicts, in addition to despair and succumbing to extremist and terrorist groups, is the result of the disastrous policy adopted for decades by colonial powers.”  He continued in perpetuating a respectful optimism for Africa, “Despite the extensive damage caused by colonialism, I believe Africa has the means to ensure its development and to take its destiny into its own hands, thanks to the resolve of African peoples and to the continent’s human and natural resources.” It is in both the countries’ national interests for Australia to foster deeper relationships with Africa. As Australia has said, but not acted upon, “The Government is also working to expand and diversify commercial links with Africa. Africa’s population of 1.2 billion will double by 2050 and its growing urban middle class is creating new demand for goods and services.”  Morocco benefits greatly from foreign investment and development in Africa, particularly with Morocco’s various infrastructure projects across North Africa. As analyzed by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), “in Africa, Morocco has a comparative advantage… and the potential to play an active economic, security, and diplomatic role.” Further dialogue with Australia would also enable a thriving and accurate discourse to spread to Southeast Asian countries. With more coverage on Morocco’s and Africa’s opportunity and prosperity could come a shift in the narrative on Africa: it is no longer a locus of poverty in need of aid, but rather a continent of burgeoning states on the rise and establishing its status internationally.  China has embraced the change in the narrative with its national newspaper People’s Daily shifting its news coverage on poverty reduction in Africa to that of bilateral relations and diplomacy. Morocco’s relations with China has solidified the narrative shift: deviating from its traditional aid projects in Africa, China was able to orient the traditional conceptions of economic policy in Africa through a strategic partnership with Morocco.  The bilateral relations were supported by a plethora of joint ventures in late 2017: the Chinese Haite group and Morocco’s BMCE bank signed a deal to invest $1 billion in an industrial and residential park in Tangier. King Mohammed VI’s historic visit to Bali in December 2017 for the 10th Bali Democracy Forum entailed talks with 58 countries, including the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore. There, the King engaged in talks to “promote and foster regional and international cooperation in the field of peace and democracy.”  The forum highlighted the efficacy of Africa’s changing narrative and a dialogue inclusive of Morocco’s insights.   Underpinning the growing relations between Morocco and Australia is also the convergent focus on terrorism and extremism. Described by Australian Ambassador to Morocco Berenice Owen-Jones as a “haven of stability,” Morocco’s image as a liberalized and democratic Arab nation presents Australia an opportunity to collaborate on issues of counter-terrorism and security.   Questioned by Australia’s Joint Standing Committee, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade responded that “an embassy in Morocco would increase Australia’s capacity to engage with a significant player in North Africa, including in the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.” Australia has relatively sparse ties to the Arab world, whereby its policy and monolithic understandings on the MENA region are derived from its alliances with the US and China. For example, at the end of 2014, Australia used its position on the UN Security Council to vote down a resolution for Palestinian statehood; Australia and the US were the only nations to vote down the resolution out of the 15 nations on the council.  Very often, fundamental misconceptions, founded on Islamophobia pervade the political discourse in Australia. The former prime minister, Tony Abbott, had defended people’s rights to target Muslims and Islam, claiming “Islamophobia hasn’t killed anyone, Islamist terrorism has now killed tens of thousands of people. That’s why it’s absolutely critical that there be the strongest possible response at every level.” A study by Australia’s Charles Sturt University found that 79.6 percent of hijab-wearing women and 47.7 percent of their children are the direct or indirect targets of Islamophobic attacks.  Despite only 2.2 percent of Australia’s population identifying as Muslim, prominent politicians capitalize on negative stereotypes and fear-mongering within their political rhetoric.  Pauline Hanson, a Queensland senator and One Nation Party leader delivered a speech in late 2016, provoking fears that Muslims and Sharia law were invading the country: “Australia is now seeing changes in suburbs predominantly Muslim. Tolerance towards other Australians is no longer the case. Our law courts are disrespected and our prisons have become breeding grounds for Muslims to radicalize inmates.” Hanson went on to claim, “Muslims want to see sharia law introduced in Australia. This law is a totalitarian civil code which prescribes harsh feudal rules imposed on everything, firstly for Muslims, later for everyone.” She also called for an end to halal certification and for a ban on the construction of any further mosques, stating that the country was not safe with its current non-prohibitory policies.  Australia’s fear of Islam is present even in the country’s perception of Morocco, as manifested by its smart travel tips for the kingdom.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade warns Australians to “exercise a high degree of caution in Morocco because of the threat of terrorist attacks. Terror group the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) identifies the Maghreb region, which includes Morocco, as a target for terror attacks.” The department also claimed, “There is a general threat of kidnapping against Westerners in North Africa, including Morocco.” Yet, Morocco has experienced no terrorist attack since 2011, and kidnapping is scarce. Other countries, like the US, have refuted the hyperbolized dangers portrayed by Australia, presenting the reality that both terrorist attacks and kidnapping are rare.  Compare Australia’s travel advisory for Morocco with its advisory for Spain, a country which experienced its latest terrorist attack just last year in August 2017 and fervently disruptive demonstrations in December 2017. Despite Spain’s more riotous and precarious conditions, Australia deems Spain more secure than Morocco with a basic notice: “Exercise common sense and look out for suspicious behavior, as you would in Australia.” Morocco has the opportunity to enlighten Australia with a nuanced understanding of the Arab world. This would also align with Australia’s interests to “collaborate further on counter-terrorism and security issues” as outlined by a press release announcing the appointment of Australia’s new ambassador to Morocco.  Understanding Islamic culture is the crux to combatting Islamic terrorism. With the help of Morocco, Australia can move beyond a fearmongering discourse which often obfuscates the real issues.  The need to root out fears of Islam was exemplified in a conference hosted in Australia’s capital Canberra, featuring Youssef Amrani, delegate-minister for foreign affairs and cooperation. Amrani’s focus on reforms, centered on inclusive human development particularly in the religious field to promote a tolerant Islam, is a noteworthy lesson for Australian politics.  Amrani aptly highlighted to Australia the nuances and complexities of Islam. When addressing the various current crises in the MENA region, Amrani emphasized the need for “a more comprehensive, coherent and pragmatic regional approach, in tune with the realities of each country in the region and in line with the aspirations and legitimate needs of the people.” It is this enlightening message to Australia which animates the possibility of Morocco and Australian relations. Amrani closed the conference by emphasizing Morocco and Australia’s common commitment to the values of dialogue, peace, and openness.  Indeed, the future of Australia and Morocco’s bilateral relations depend upon a continual cross-cultural dialogue. This requires honest and genuine feedback with an openness for change so that Australia and Morocco can bridge not only the physical but the ideological distance between them.

Rabat – A new UN report has found that ISIS, with 1,473 Moroccans among its fighters, remains a threat to global security. According to the report, the terrorist organization has found ways to survive and orchestrate terrorist attacks despite the heavy military and territorial losses it experienced at the hand of the US-led coalition of 77 countries. The group still has up to 30,000 fighters evenly distributed between combat zones in Syria and Iraq, according to the report. But there are also significant numbers of ISIS-affiliated fighters in the Sahel and surrounding countries, especially in Libya, Mali, and Niger. “Among these is still a significant component of the many thousands of foreign terrorist fighters,” said the report. It is estimated that 1,473 Moroccan nationals are part of the terrorist organization’s “halting but hardened core of foreign fighters.”  Although the terrorist group no longer has the frightening aura, global appeal, and financial resources it had at the height of its reign between 2014 and 2015, there is still a flow of Moroccan nationals—and other foreign fighters—taking major risks to join the group’s ranks in Yemen, Afghanistan, Libya, and elsewhere. ISIS’s Moroccan fighters are mostly found in Libya, where the UN estimates there are 4,000 ISIS fighters. In addition, Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported today that new waves of Moroccan jihadists are thought to be increasingly heading to the Philippines.  A van bombing on July 31 in the southern Filipino Island of Basilan has been reported to have been carried out by Moroccan ISIS fighter Abu Kathir Al-Magrhibi. Al-Maghribi was reportedly targeting a gathering of school children to avenge the death of his son, killed in a clash between ISIS and the Filipino army. Defeated but not extinguished ISIS, which emerged from the conflict and political instability in Syria and Iraq, shocked the world in 2014 when it proclaimed itself a nation called the “Islamic State.”  At the peak of ISIS’s global reach in 2015, what began as a relatively insignificant rally of insurgents gradually became a rallying point for other extremist groups around the world, gathering as many as 100,000 jihadists and taking over the Syrian city of Raqqa—which they declared as their capital city—and the Iraqi city of Mosul, where the group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared a caliphate in June of the same year. By 2017, however, the international coalition had inflicted heavy defeats on the group, driving it out of its major cities and confining it to small territories in central and southern Syria. The UN report warned, however, that the group is far from completely defeated. “Despite the damage to bureaucratic structures of the so-called ‘caliphate,’ the collective discipline of Isil is intact,” it continued. “Although he is reported to have been injured, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi remains in authority,” the report said. The report explained that ISIS forces have “showed greater resilience” in eastern Syria, as the group “is still able to mount attacks.”  “It does not fully control any territory in Iraq, but it remains active through sleeper cells.”  The group has morphed from “proto-state” into “terrorist network” and still a major threat to Mid-East and global stability, the report said.

By Vera Sordini Rabat – FC Barcelona will bring home the trophy after a 2:1 win in the Spanish Super Cup match against FC Sevilla. Excitement filled the streets of Tangier on Sunday evening as it hosted the match in the Ibn Batouta Stadium. It is the first time that any city outside Spain has been chosen as a “neutral” venue for a Spanish Super Cup game. The Super Cup, which always features two games, broke with tradition this year and only had one decisive match. Traditionally, the two games are scheduled in each team’s home city.  The Super Cup is played between the winner of La Liga and the winner of the Copa del Rey. FC Barcelona was both this year’s La Liga and Copa del Rey winner. Tradition requires that in such cases, the Copa del Rey’s second-placed team—which was FC Sevilla this year—plays against the Spanish championship winner. The game started well for Sevilla. Thay took the lead early when Pablo Sarabia scored only nine minutes into playtime. Initially, the goal was revoked as offside, but it was recognized after consulting the video assistant referee (VAR). In the remainder of the first half, Barcelona tried to compensate for its deficit. Their efforts were enhanced by an omnipresent Messi, but the club’s fans had to wait until the 42nd minute to see Gerard Piqué score an equalizer. The second half was dominated by the Catalans. Ousmane Dembélé turned the game to Barcelona’s favour (2-1) with a powerful kick in the 79th minute. In the 90th minute Barcelona’s fans’ hopes were in jeopardy when Sevilla’s Ben Yedder was awarded a penalty shot. However, the striker was not able to convert the opportunity into a goal. At full time, FC Barcelona secured its 13th win of the Super Cup and its 6th in only 9 years. Last month, the Royal Spanish Football Association (RFEF) and FIFA gave their final consent for the match to be played in Tangier. When RFEF President Luis Manuel Rubiales visited the stadium last week, he said, “For us, it’s an honor to play the Spanish Super Cup in Morocco, a country that is at the forefront of African football.” Ibn Batuta Stadium has previously served as a venue for foreign leagues. Tangier hosted the Super Cup match between Lille and Marseille (4-5) in 2001 and the Super Cup match between Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco (2-1) in 2017.

Rabat- RAM has reached an agreement with the AMPL union, ending a four-week pilot strike that caused 150 flight delays and cancellations. No cancellations of RAM flights were announced on Wednesday. Royal Air Maroc and AMPL announced Tuesday night, August 14, that they reached an agreement to end their dispute, and are ready to rekindle their trust. RAM pilots started a strike on July 18, asking for better working conditions and a salary raise of MAD 15,000 per month. Since the start of the protest, RAM reportedly lost approximately MAD 20 million daily due to the 150 delayed and canceled flights, triggering the fury of passengers and putting RAM in danger of bankruptcy, according to L’Economiste. An AMPL representative told Moroccan news outlet Medias 24 on July 31 that pilots would not settle for any proposal by RAM that did not satisfy their requests. Although it is not certain yet whether RAM decided to increase the salaries of its pilots, both the company and the union pledged to work together to improve flight service. RAM and AMPL said that they are fully aware of the economic and social issues the country is dealing with and the pivotal role that tourism plays in the progress of the Moroccan economy.  Fortunately for RAM, it was able to solve the crisis before the end of August, the most profitable month in summer. The agreement will allow RAM to serve some of Morocco’s 32,000 Hajj pilgrims returning from Mecca, Saudi Arabia, after Eid al-Adha.

Rabat – CAF President Ahmad Ahmad has confirmed the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) 2019 will be hosted by Cameroon, not Morocco.  The Confederation of African Football (CAF) president was responding to rumors that Morocco would host the African competition instead of Cameroon. Cameroon is facing several issues in preparation for CAN, primarily delays in the construction of stadiums after thousands of workers went on strike, and the fact foreign companies have stopped working because the Cameroonian government cannot meet its financial obligations. “CAN 2019 will be held in Cameroon … until proven otherwise,” Ahmad said in an interview with Cameroon outlet Camfoot.  “There is an inspection visit at the moment in Cameroon. The difference today in the new governance of CAF is that everything rests on a whole, a group. The president is here to reorganize, to coordinate. There is a team that is already in place, currently led by the secretary general in charge of football,” he added.  Earlier this month, Morocco’s minister of sports denied that Morocco would replace Cameroon as host of CAN 2019 next June. The minister said, “I can affirm that we have not thought for even one second about hosting the CAN because there is no reason for it.” The minister condemned “how much fake news can invade and pollute information, including in the mainstream media.” He added that “neither for the King Mohammed VI, is there a question of organizing it. I repeat, this idea has never crossed our heads. To be honest, seeing this rumor circulating, I first took it with a smile, so it seemed amazing to me that we can believe it.” For his part, the president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), Fouzi Lekjaa, had already dismissed the fake news.  CAN 2019 will boast the participation of 24 national teams, up from the usual 16.

Rabat – Morocco’s Attijariwafa Bank Group has bought Kuwait’s Path Solutions’ “iMAL” Islamic banking software to run Bank Assafa, the group’s Islamic participative subsidiary. Path Solutions, which provides Sharia-based technologies for Islamic financial services, announced on August 14 it has signed a strategic agreement with Attijariwafa Bank to provide the bank’s clients with interest-free financial services in accordance with Islamic principles. “Under the terms of the agreement, Path Solutions will provide and implement its interest-free core banking platform iMAL across the 31 branches of Attijariwafa Bank participative subsidiary Bank Assafa, including Sharia-compliant financing, delivery channels and trade finance.” “We are delighted to have been chosen by Attijariwafa Bank, the third largest bank in Africa. Bank Assafa is a significant win for Path Solutions; we welcome it to our community of strategic partners,” said Mohammed Kateeb, group chairman and CEO of Path Solutions. According to Path Solutions’ statement, iMAL is a new core banking platform which is “set to deliver competitive edge to Bank Assafa and bring real benefits to the bank’s customers.” The Islamic banking platform covers Sharia-compliant investment, project finance, financial messaging, and financial reporting. Speaking about the bank’s implementation of iMAL, Kateeb said that it “will facilitate Bank Assafa’s entire operations, allowing it to serve its customers with true Sharia-based state-of-the-art core banking platform to launch a wide range of innovative products to advance financial inclusion and attract the majority of the population that are currently unbanked.” Youssef Baghdadi, chairman of Bank Assafa’s management board, said that Attijariwafa Bank chose Path Solutions for the bank’s new Sharia-compliant banking system “following good references from several leading Islamic banks.” According to Abdellatif Jouahri, the governor of Morocco’s central bank—Bank Al Maghrib (BAM), more than 71 “participating” agencies have been created in Morocco since the launch of Islamic participating banks, which follow Islamic principles of interest-free banking, in July 2017. The participating banks have granted a total of MAD 1.1 billion in loans. In January 2017, BAM gave their approval to many Moroccan bank groups to launch participating subsidiaries, including Attijariwafa Bank and its new participative subsidiary Bank Assafa.

Rabat- This year, 1,486,958 foreign pilgrims landed in Saudi Arabia for the 2018 Hajj pilgrimage, which begins August 20 and ends August 24.  The Hajj begins the eighth day of the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah, which falls on Monday, August 20, and ends on the twelfth day (August 24). According to the Saudi General Directorate of Passports, 1,392,928 Muslims arrived by air, 78,282 arrived by land, and 15,748 arrived by sea, representing authorities called a 7 percent (10,529 people) decrease in Hajj arrivals compared to 2017 in the same period. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah previously reported that it had completed preparations for the current Hajj pilgrimage to host more than 2 million pilgrims from more than 80 countries, including Morocco, whose first group of pilgrims arrived on July 27.   Saudi Arabia has undertaken major expansion projects to improve the Hajj experience. The city of Mecca is adding more space in order to avoid tragic incidents such as the stampede that killed thousands of people during the 2015 Hajj pilgrimage. Every year, thousands of Muslims across the world flock to the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, the holiest site in Islam, to perform their pilgrimage. Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam. All Muslims who are physically and financially capable are required to perform the pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime. During Hajj, pilgrims are required to make Tawaf, circling seven times around the Kaaba in a counter-clockwise direction. Pilgrims also celebrate Eid Al Adha on the tenth day of Dhu al-Hijjah. The oldest males in Muslim families slaughter a sheep or goat to make the sacrifice. This year, Morocco will celebrate Eid al-Adha on Wednesday, August 22, as the Ministry of Islamic Affairs confirmed.

Rabat – A driver crashed into security barriers surrounding Parliament in London, injuring cyclists and pedestrians. Police arrested the driver on the scene. “At 07:37 today (0637 GMT) a car collided with the gates in front of Parliament, the driver was arrested by the police on the scene, and several pedestrians were injured,” London’s police said on Twitter. At 0737hrs today, a car was in collision with barriers outside the Houses of Parliament. The male driver of the car was detained by officers at the scene. A number of pedestrians have been injured. Officers remain at the scene. We will issue further info when we have it. — Metropolitan Police (@metpoliceuk) August 14, 2018  On social media, bystanders shared pictures of armed police surrounding the vehicle and pulling out the driver before taking him away. “We treat this as a terrorist incident,” Anti-Terrorism Chief Neil Basu told reporters.  The driver is being held for “suspicion of terrorist acts,” Basu said. “He is not cooperating at the moment.” The chief stressing that the “priority” of the police was to establish his identity and his motive. “It seemed like a deliberate act,” said a witness, Ewalina Ochab, to the UK’s Press Association.  “I was walking across the street, I heard some noise and someone shouted. I turned around and saw a gray car rolling very fast near the gates, maybe even on the sidewalk.” “I looked to my right and there was a cyclist on the ground, obviously injured,” said PA James Maker, a cyclist who was there a few minutes after the attack. “We suspected there was something serious because it was closed. The London attack on Westminster Bridge has been redesigned. Normally, they had put protective barriers,” Emmanuel Guy, a French tourist, told AFP.

Rabat – A new trend in Moroccan night clubs has young people consuming a Chinese drug with an unknown name. According to Akhbar Al Youm, the Chinese drug is consumed when establishments stop serving alcohol after midnight. Known as an “inhalation drug,” the substance is reportedly also used by people living on the streets.  The new poison invading tourist cities, including Marrakech and Agadir, during summer costs between MAD 20 and 80, depending on the dose ordered. The Chinese drug is inhaled in plastic bags to achieve quick euphoria.  The new drug has the same effect of agitation and euphoria as rags soaked in chemicals and other anesthetic products. Consumers inhale fumes or chemical vapors directly from substances in a small plastic or paper bag. The chemicals could have an adverse effect on the health of the consumer by immediately damaging the body and brain. A study conducted by the Biochemistry and Nutrition and Cellular Biology group in affiliation with Casablanca’s Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy found in 2017 that 600,000 Moroccans are addicted to drugs, with 16,000 addicted to hard drugs like heroin and cocaine.  Young people aged 18 to 28 are the most addicted to hard drugs, comprising 70 percent of total Moroccans addicted to the destructive substances. According to the 2015 annual report of the National Observatory of Drugs and Addictions, around 4 to 5 percent of Morocco’s adult population uses drugs, a minimum of 800,000 users.

Rabat – Following allegations that Morocco is not controlling its borders, the country has cracked down on hundreds of sub-Saharan immigrants bound for Europe.  Police patrols and raids have recently succeeded in rounding up hundreds of sub-Saharan migrants trying to reach Europe to relocate them to cities in southern Morocco, local human right advocacy groups have reported. Police raids reportedly intensified last week in northern Morocco, especially in Nador and Tangier, the two most “trafficked” departure points that migrants use for the hazardous journey to Spain by sea.  The arrests, as local human rights groups have described them, come a month after the European Commission cut a €55 million deal to financially assist Morocco and Tunisia in containing the increasing number of Europe-bound immigrants.  In Nador alone, AFP reported, Moroccan authorities stormed immigrant camps and apartments, busing between 600 and 800 migrants to interior towns and cities, kilometers away from the sea and the Morocco-Spain border at the Spanish enclave of Melilla.  ‘Illegal arrests’ The Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH) has lamented the move, calling it illegal and unmindful of basic human rights. The association told AFP that migrants who have been bused away from Nador and Tangier were often handcuffed and some of their belongings were seized while police destroyed their camps. Omar Naji, an AMDH representative, said that there were no court orders for the wave of arrests and that Spain, Morocco, and the EU were “responsible” for the harsh and “illegal” police crackdown. According to AFP, some of the arrested migrants were put in buses prepared for the purpose and then dropped 1,000 kilometers away near the town of Tiznit on the Atlantic, 900 kilometers from the Mediterranean. Others were reportedly taken southeast to cities near the Algerian border. ‘Move to better living conditions’ Despite widespread condemnation from local activists and human rights advocacy groups, Moroccan authorities remain convinced that the move was necessary to dissuade would-be immigrants from crossing to EU countries.  A government official referred to the move as a “mission in the fight against illegal immigration.” He explained that rather than cracking down on migrants, the police brought between 1,600 and 1,800 migrants to places with “better living conditions.” Rabat and its EU partners have recently agreed on greater logistical and financial cooperation to limit the number of migrants taking to the sea to cross to Europe.  On Saturday, August 11, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, and Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, called for a “united European front” to face the migration crisis. They requested that more assistance be extended to partner countries such as Morocco and Tunisia, who are helping Europe secure its borders amid the growing challenge of mass human mobility across the Mediterranean. “We have to intensify our support for Morocco and Tunisia. They are border countries and they need our help,” Merkel said .

Rabat – Following Kohler’s call to resume negotiations on Western Sahara, Polisario confirmed its readiness to engage with Morocco while Algeria is silent. The Polisario Front “reaffirms its readiness to fully engage into negotiations with Morocco, in accordance with the UN Security Council’s resolution 2414,” said Abdelkader Taleb Omar, ambassador of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Republic to Algeria on Sunday, August 12. Horst Kohler, the UN secretary-general’s personal envoy for Western Sahara, gave the UN Security Council a briefing on the situation in Western Sahara on Wednesday, August 8. At the briefing, Kohler called on the parties in the conflict—Morocco and the Polisario Front—as well as neighboring states such as Algeria to resume negotiations to find a mutually agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to the Western Sahara conflict. The majority of the council members also invited Kohler to continue his efforts to push concerned parties to reach a final resolution to the forty-year conflict. Omar affirmed that Polisario is committed to cooperate with Kohler, praising the UN personal envoy’s efforts for “a just and fair solution guaranteeing the right of Sahrawi people to self-determination,” Sahara Press Service (SPS) reported yesterday August 13. The Sahrawi representative also called the UN Security Council to “assume its responsibility in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter and to ensure the respect for Sahrawi people’s inalienable right to self-determination.” Algeria not willing to be part of the negotiations The Security Council stressed the need for Algeria to contribute to the political process and to engage further in the negotiations as stipulated in the council’s Resolution 2414 of April 27, 2018. Morocco has continually called on Algeria to engage in the negotiations and insisted that Algiers must be part of a solution to the regional conflict since it is the fundamental supporter of the Polisario Front. However, Algeria has not yet officially expressed its willingness to take part in negotiations over Western Sahara. On the contrary, Algeria’s government officials have maintained their position to refrain from joining the negotiation process. In mid-April, Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said in a statement that “Moroccans want to make Algeria a part” of the Western Sahara issue, but he claimed the solution lies between Morocco and Polisario, not Algeria. On April 4, King Mohammed VI sent a letter to the United Nations secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, calling for Algeria to fully engage in the ongoing Sahara issue. “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario,” said the King in his letter, which Morocco’s foreign minister delivered to the UNSG in New York. Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel made a similar statement a week before Ouyahia’s, when television channel France 24 asked him about his opinion on the King’s letter. Messahel reaffirmed Algeria’s position refusing to sit at the negotiating table, a position he said would not change. Negotiations on the conflict have always been between “the Polisario representatives and Morocco, it will not change,” Messahel claimed. “It is a case between Morocco and the Sahrawi people, and between Morocco and the decisions of the United Nations.” Later in April, a source at the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, “Algeria’s support of the Sahrawi people and its legitimate representative, the Polisario Front, does not mean that it should be involved in negotiations,” according to a statement by Algeria Press Service (APS). A founding member of the Polisario Front who quitted the front in 1990, Bachir Dhkil, said in an interview on August 9 that “Algeria should come to the negotiation table and help find a solution to the conflict it created in the first place.” Dhkil deemed Algeria “responsible for the genesis and the escalation of the Western Sahara question.” Dhkil asserted that the neighboring country “not only trains and finances the Polisario Front, but it also gets in the way whenever there are peace talks and prospects of a peaceful settlement.” Morocco’s permanent representative to the United Nations, Omar Hilale, told Moroccan media that negotiations over the Western Sahara conflict without the participation of Algeria will be a “waste of time.” While insisting that Algeria must engage in future negotiations, Hilale stressed that Morocco “is definitely not ready for negotiations with a party [Polisario] that has no authority, no independence, and no power to make decisions on its own.”

Rabat – The migrant rescue ship Aquarius has saved 141 migrants from drowning in the Mediterranean. It is now looking for “a safe place” to dock.  “Aquaris is presently positioned between Malta and the Italian island of Lampedusa,” Sophie Beau, president of SOS Mediterranee, a Franco-German humanitarian organization, told AFP yesterday. Beau added: “We are calling on European governments to find a solution. We are urging them to provide us with a safe place to dock.”  Beau underscored the desperation and anguish of the 141 migrants when Aquarius’s rescue crew saved them off European and Libyan coasts las week. She said that the humanitarian vessel has been making surveying trips throughout the Mediterranean since reports emerged of the increasing death toll in the perilous Mediterranean route used by migrants to reach Europe. Of the 141 immigrants on board the Aquarius, 25 were rescued in the early hours of August 10 as their wooden—and unfit for purpose—boat was about to sink. The remaining 116 were rescued in the afternoon of the same day in similar conditions, Beau explained. There were 67 unaccompanied minors in the second group the ship saved on August 10. According to Beau, most of the rescued migrants are from Eritrea and Somalia and were fleeing social unrest and conflict.  Migrants were packed in overloaded boats and were “malnourished” and “extremely weak,” according to the president of SOS Mediteranee. Anti-migrant sentiment and policies “Some of the rescued migrants told our teams that they encountered 5 different ships which did not offer them assistance before they were rescued by Aquarius,” Beau said, adding that Aquarius is urgently looking for a safe haven.  And while Libya is not “a safe place” to dock already “desperate” and “abused” migrants, many of whom have reported fleeing horrendous conditions in Libya, Aquarius has received “negative replies” from Malta and Italy. “No Gibraltar-flagged German vessel carrying migrants will ever dock at an Italian port,” Matteo Salvini, Italy’s rightist interior minister, is reported to have told the vessel on August 11 when they asked Italian authorities for help.  Who will provide this time? Amid the continual and now mounting intra-European spat about receiving rescued migrants, Italy has asked Britain to provide a safe haven for the 141 migrants on board Aquarius, pointing out that Gibraltar is a British territory and that Britain has done little on the subject of migration. “The boat is now in Maltese waters and has a Gibraltar flag. At this point, the United Kingdom should take responsibility for the safeguarding of the shipwreck,” Italian transport minister Danilo Tonineli tweeted yesterday. But the British government has not yet replied, remaining silent about whether it will take in the rescued migrants. Aquarius is not in its first argument with EU authorities, especially the Italian and Maltese governments. In early June, the vessel, which had on board over 600 rescued migrants, spent weeks on the Mediterranean looking for a harbor, having been rejected by the two EU countries.  Spain finally stepped in, offering the port of Valencia in eastern Spain and promising to treat the migrants “totally normally” in accordance with EU migration law. This time, however, a similar Spanish move is highly unlikely.  Last week, the country’s Ministry of Interior revealed that so far this year more than 23,000 irregular migrants have reached Spain.  All Spanish reception centers are reportedly overcrowded as overwhelmed health and migration officials struggle to take care of migrants who have reached the country in grave health conditions.  Even if Spain wanted to reach out to more refugees, asylum seekers, and immigrants in dire conditions, the interior ministry’s report suggested the country was too overwhelmed to do so. The news of the vessel being stranded at sea comes at a particularly emotionally charged moment in European politics, especially after human rights advocacy groups and international organizations slammed EU countries for their “reprehensible” and “deadly” policies on migration.   A UNHCR report noted earlier this month that 1,500 migrants have died at sea this year, while Amnesty International also reported that migrants’ lives at sea and in transition countries—especially in detention centers in Libya—are “deeply concerning” and “horrific” and that Europe is “complicit” in their plight. The report said that migration was a humanitarian crisis and that the EU’s policies are causing the escalation of migration-related deaths.

Rabat – AS Roma has not forgotten Hakim Ziyech. After chasing the Moroccan midfielder for over six months, is Roma in sight of a deal?  According to Calcio Mercato, two weeks before the end of the summer transfer window, AS Roma is eager to have Ziyech’s skills, especially after Ajax Amsterdam showed it was willing to sell the player for €25 million. The club had previously asked for €37 million.  The 25-year-old football player has already expressed his wish to leave the Netherlands, even though his contract with the Dutch team extends until June 2021. if Ziyech joins the ranks of AS Roma, the semi-finalist last season in the Champions League, he will be the third Moroccan player to wear the colors of the club after Houcine Kharja and Mehdi Benatia. Moreover, Ziyech will be the second Ajax player to join the Italian giant following Justin Kluivert, who will join Roma this summer. Kluivert signed with AS Roma for €20 million. Ziyech may consider AS Roma’s offer, especially after his Dutch club replaced his traditional number 10 jersey with number 22. The Moroccan football player learned of the change through Ajax’s official website. The Atlas Lion was not happy to hear he was losing number 10. Not sure it will keep the Atlas Lion, Ajax decided to give Ziyech’s number to one of their new players, Dusan Tadic. In April 2018, Ajax named Ziyech player of the year after he led his Dutch team to a major win over AZ Alkmaar (3-0). The award recognized Ziyech’s excellent performance with the Dutch team this season. Born in the Netherlands to Moroccan parents, Ziyech chose to represent Morocco internationally. On October 2015, the player made his debut for Morocco in a friendly with Côte d’Ivoire, which ended with a 0-1 victory for Côte d’Ivoire. In 2014, Ziyech left Heerenveen for FC Twente, with whom he signed a four year contract. The footballer then signed with Ajax in 2016. Ziyech also played for the Netherlands’ Under 19, Under 20, and Under 21 teams between 2012 and 2014.

The recent deaths of two Palestinian scientists in Algeria once again sparked speculation about Mossad’s nefarious actions in Africa. The two scientists, Suliman al-Farra and Mohammed Albanna, were studying in Algiers, when they died under mysterious circumstances in their apartment. Assassinating scientists involved in nuclear research or the development of sophisticated conventional weapons is allegedly par for the course for Mossad, which is rumored to have a history of targeting Iranian scientists involved in the development of the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programs. Israel’s national intelligence agency also allegedly had a policy of targeting  Hamas operatives and others who had developed drones that targeted Israel or otherwise contributed to significant security threats. The most recent such allegation is the mysterious demise of the Syrian rocket scientist Dr. Aziz Asbar, who presumably helped the Assad regime to advance its nuclear and other WMD goals. Presumably, this assassination would also send a message to Tehran. If so, it would be consistent with the allegations that the Iran presence in Syria may be there to hide the footprint of the nuclear scientists, who are continuing with the Iran nuclear research.  However, not all unsolved deaths are likely the work of Israeli kidonim (assassination units within Mossad).  Some of the rumored assassinations ascribed to Mossad by the Palestinians were more likely results of personal disputes or other criminal incidents, such as the death of a young Palestinian man in Sweden. Although the man’s family allegedly had ties to Hamas, there was no available evidence of the man’s personal involvement in any political activities. Another recent story involves a Hamas engineer, killed under mysterious circumstances in Malaysia. He was known for negotiating arms deals with North Koreans. What business would Hamas have with North Koreans? North Koreans are always looking for new markets, furthermore they also serve as conduits for other countries – such as Iran and Russia – to make deals on their behalf.. That Hamas was willing to make arms deals with whomever was selling is less noteworthy than the apparent North Korean connection extending into Gaza. Likewise, Malaysia is another country where North Korea has a great deal of influence.  Kim Jung Un’s half brother was assassinated there, with four men being seen fleeing. The NY Times, in its original report, cited intelligence sources claiming that Mossad assassinated the Hamas engineer to end Hamas operations abroad, which is plausible. Israel publicly dismissed this claim. If that were to be the case, it would seem that Mossad understands the danger of North Koreans selling arms to Hamas, not only because the Kim regime is lethal and unpredictable, but because Iran might be working through Kim Jung Un to increase volatility in Gaza by any means possible.  However, this story might be more complicated than it appears. Af first glance, in the last few months, there were a number of assassinations against actors seen as adversarial to Israel’s interests among others. Most of them did not appear to involve North Korea, but illustrated the same pattern of involving actors who were a real threat to Israel’s security. Many of them likely were funded by state actors such as Iran, and may have been a part of an organized network. If that is the case, these incidents follow a set pattern of operations which are meant to eliminate the immediate danger and to send a message to other people involved in arms deals or research that Israel finds unacceptable to its own security. A number of these stories involve North Africa. For a while, there seemed to be a lull in the purportedly Mossad-led hits on Hamas and Iran-backed operatives and scientists; however the string of incidents in the past two years shows that with the conclusion of the nuclear deal,  clandestine deals and research seems to continue. This pattern of latest incidents in North Africa would be consistent with the renewal of such operations after a scandalous story involving an assassination of another Hamas member in Dubai, which caused rifts between the Mossad and the French intelligence and other European countries, due to the use of European passports during the operation. Preceding that, Mossad’s alleged assassinations of various other Hamas members, as well at least four Iranian nuclear scientists, drew headlines and international attention for a while. At the time, former Defense Minister Ya’alon  hinted at Israel’s involvement in these hits. Interestingly, the nuclear scientists, for the most part, met their end in Iran, rather than while working in other countries. This dynamic has shifted lately, after the conclusion of the nuclear deal. Just as with Syria, Iran has been making alliances with a number of African countries to facilitate business in the event sanctions are reimposed, and in order to recruit new allies and proxies to ease its geopolitical agenda. For years, the United States has ignored the entire African continent – with the end result of the weakening and destabilization of a number of strategically located countries, and proliferation of extremism. Smuggling, clandestine meetings, and underground research and activities to further that research would find the continent welcoming at a time when Iran is looking to avoid public scrutiny. In preparation for any potential future deals with the Trump administration, Iran would have been wise to clean up any irregularities on its own territory and shift its forbidden activities elsewhere.   Has Iran relocated the bulk of its nuclear program outside the country? These assassinations in North Africa became more frequent in recent months. For instance, what business did a Tunisian national, Mohammed Zouari,  have joining Hamas, a Middle Eastern regional organization, and becoming a drone maker? Whatever the reason, he soon met the same fate as his Middle Eastern counterparts. This incident may have demonstrated the long arm of the Israeli intelligence, but it also showcased the reach of Hamas, supposedly concerned mainly with the cause Islamism in the Palestinian world. Instead, it appears to have connections and supporters all over the world, including in North Africa. Mohammed Zouari, also known as Mohammed al-Zawari, was born in Tunisia but, fleeing the Ben Ali regime’s oppression of the Islamist Ennahdha party, moved to Syria in 1991, where he was likely further radicalized.  He had a background in aeronautics and skills in drone making, which made him a valuable recruit for Hamas, which operated in the vicinity. He ended up supervising the drone program Ababeel1, which was used against Israel in the Gaza War of 2014. Mohammed al-Zawari was not just a drone team member, but the commander of Hamas’ military branch the Qassam Brigades. He eventually returned to Tunisia, where he was assassinated in December 2016. That both alleged terrorists and alleged intelligence operatives are able to operate in Tunisia with such  raises questions about its security protocols. However, that is hardly the only episode showcasing Africa, and particular the North, as a new scene of operations for spy games. Not too long ago, in a similar incident, two Iranian advisers went shopping for uranium in Libya, relying on Tunisia’s porous borders to achieve their goals. Alelgedly, the advisers were part of a senior delegation dispatched by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in furtherance of Iran’s clandestine nuclear research. Their lives came to an end in what appeared to be an assassination consistent with the above-cited episodes, and Iran’s renewed quest for uranium, equally consistent with its public threats to return to its nuclear program in response to the United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) came to the fore. This apparent continuation of Iran’s nuclear research presented a direct threat to Israel’s security. Prime Minister Netanyahu in the past has stated repeatedly that Israel would not tolerate a nuclear Iran. Indeed, in that light, the assassination of the Hamas engineer connected to North Koreans in Malaysia may very well have fit the apparent pattern of Mossad eliminating potential and present security threats If the advisers in Libya were indeed assassinated by Mossad, their liquidation was meant to reinforce the message to Tehran that Israel is watching closely all attempts at furthering this program. Just as with the Hamas technology expert in Malaysia, the two Iranians in Libya were killed by unidentified perpetrators in a roadside hit. The Hamas operative was gunned down by a hail of 14 shots by two men on a motorcycle. The Iranian advisers were likewise shot to death by unidentified gunmen who fled the scene. . In both instances, the individuals were connected to rogue state actors and were involved in deals that were a threat to international security, and certainly to Israel.  On the other hand, there could be another Mossad-related explanation if the intelligence agency was involved at all. Recently, it was discovered that a former Israeli Minister of Energy, Gonen Segev,  had been living in Nigeria as an Iranian spy. Interestingly, he moved to Nigeria to practice as a doctor (with a suspended license), and allegedly started working for Iranians in 2012; around the same time, Israel was alleged to have eliminated several Iranian nuclear scientists. By that point, the Obama administration was involved in secret nuclear deal negotiations with the Islamic Republic. However, Iran’s nuclear research was ongoing and would not be frozen until Iran entered into the agreement with the P5+1 a couple years later. At the time, it most assuredly was on the way to acquire a nuclear bomb, and presented a security threat to Israel, various Gulf states, and others. At the same time, Iran was busy acquiring missile parts and other sophisticated weaponry through third parties, often flying in these parts via Thailand and Ukraine. Iranians were operating all over the world; they already had a significant presence in Western Africa, thanks to the extensive network of the African Hezbullah that was financing the terrorist activity there through various criminal schemes. For Israel, it would have been natural to try to gather intelligence from the local operatives about some of Iran’s most threatening operations – such as the occasional use of Ukrainian airplanes to smuggle missile parts, used to build missiles that could hit Israel – or learning the whereabouts of the nuclear scientists who continued with the program, even as the negotiations with the United States were ongoing. Iran had offered to underwrite Pyongyang’s nuclear missile program – yet another area of cooperation between the Islamic Republic and North Korea that threatened Israel. Gathering intelligence on these threats from Tehran was presumably Segev’s purpose in making contact with the Iranians in Nigeria. With the help of Mossad, Segev was finally arrested as he fled Eritrea in May 2018, whereupon he was detained and turned over to Israel.  Segev was well known for having smuggled drugs into Israel in the past, and serving time for various small frauds; however, at least some of the pattern in this murky story points to the fact that at some point he may have been an Israeli asset playing double agent, who possibly went rogue. The story reveals more than anything, however, the extent of Iranian operations in Africa – as well as the fact that Mossad, aside from its legendary, and possibly conspiratorial escapades in assassinating known threats, is likely also interested in traditional intelligence gathering. If that is the case, it is clear that Mossad engages in traditional intelligence gathering against adversarial regime, not just assassassinations of anyone who appears to be an obstacle. If so, some of the assassinations attributed to Hamas could be interpreted differently. Could it be that the Hamas operative in Malaysia, too, was a double agent for Israel looking to uncover Hamas links to North Korea’s arms trade, and perhaps, clandestine programs – who was caught and eliminated by North Koreans or another involved party? He would have been well positioned to do so. Kim Jong Un, too, is known for eliminating his enemies, including his own half-brother who had allegedly met with a US agent, in Malaysia and elsewhere by similar means. If the Hamas operative had double crossed North Koreans by spying for Israel, his liquidation by the North Korean intelligence could offer a different explanation for that event. China is Iran’s top oil trade partner, and may likely be opening, rather than closing doors facilitating access to other African states for Tehran, throughout the continent where China has successfully established a growing business empire – and itself is rumored to have had aggressive intelligence runs-in with the Mossad.  Iran, however, did not stop at occasional business transactions, but rather set out to create political problems in West and North Africa. Iran-backed  Hezbllah has long been an agent of chaos in West Africa, masterminding various and sundry criminal schemes to finance its terrorist operations elsewhere. Hezbullah has also in the past planned terrorist attacks against Israeli and Saudi targets in West Africa. Iran ha been known to back Shi’a militias in the Sahel, complicating the US and French counterterrorism efforts in the area. The North Africa trajectory appears to be a more recent effort, with Iran sowing divisions between Sunni and Shi’a, which were non-existent prior to Iran’s more aggressive engagement in North Africa since 2016, when the Saudi Embassy in Iran was attacked, and KSA and a number of African allies severed relations with the Islamic Republic. Since then, Iran upped the ante throughout Africa, looking to counter Saudi influence by coopting its allies, and later, in search of new business partners when the Trump administration announced its  intent to withdraw from the nuclear deal. The uptick in Iranian activity in North Africa includes a campaign of Shi’a conversions, according to a former Algerian politician who warned Europe about Iran’s influence campaign in North Africa shortly before Morocco severed relations with Tehran. But just how recent were these operations? Despite the impression made by the media that Iran’s involvement with Algeria, Hezbullah, and Polisario was almost an ad hoc recent effort, Moroccan intelligence records these contacts going back at least two years. In other words, after its break up with Saudi Arabia, Iran looked to challenge and weaken her allies in the continent that was a far reach for a country undergoing rapid internal reforms under a new and much younger government. These developments coincided with the Saudi air campaign in Yemen, which started in 2015 in response to Iran’s backing of the Houthis, who came to target Saudi territory with sophisticated Iran-provided missiles. Likely, the attack on the Saudi embassy in 2016 was a deliberate provocation that would escalate the tensions and give Iran a justification for a more aggressive recruitment of allies against Riyadh. With the election of Donald Trump, whose administration is staunchly opposed to Tehran’s regional expansionism and nuclear ambitions, Iran found a new reason to increase its activity – opposition to the alleged Western bullying. In reality, however, Iran’s threats to block up the Strait of Hormuz, the Bab al-Mandeb in Yemen, and the Horn of Africa threatened international interests, including the United States, Israel, and the Saudis. Rather than resolving the crisis with Riyadh, Iran chose to take its perceived grievances to Africa and to use Africa as a launching pad to advance its interests in Yemen.  Somalian routes and Eritrean ports provided Iran with perfect vehicles for smuggling weapons and people into Yemen. Morocco’s staunch pro-Western stand, however, blocked Iran’s ambitions Northward. Algeria’s role in this instance is to destabilize Morocco, while Iran is looking to expand its influence into Morocco’s mosques, recruit followers, and proxies, and potentially gain access to international waterways, while spreading to West and North Africa. Polisario was seen as a gateway to achieving these goals.  Iran’s cooperation with Algeria goes beyond this focal anti-Morocco point. Only a few days before Morocco’s break with Iran, Tehran and Algiers emphasized their growing parliamentary ties. In other words, Iran’s influence extends far beyond intelligence operations focused on the common adversary. Algeria was also a long time supporter of Iran’s nuclear program, for which Iran’s Foreign Minister Zarif expressed public appreciation. The Morocco-related scandal did not jar either country, both of which denied any wrongdoing. Tracing spy related incidents in Africa, it’s becoming increasingly obvious that a number of state actors, in conjunction with non-state organizations share an interest in nuclear development and illicit weapons procurement. It is no coincidence that Israeli operatives appeared to have focused their efforts on a number of states with a history of interest in nuclear reactors. Perhaps this is also an explanation for more recent contacts with Iran. Shortly after the assassination of the Hamas engineer in Malaysia, assigned to Mossad, in April 2018, Algeria arrested seven Africans accused of spying for Israel, and sentenced them to death and prison time. Given Algeria’s recent 7-year prison sentence for a blogger who interviewed an Israeli official, the “international spy ring” for Mossad may very well have been “fake news”. However, Algeria’s close ties to Iran and Russia and a history of interest in nuclear research makes it clear that its actions may indeed present a significant threat to North African, as well as global, security. In the past two years, , for instance, Algeria was allowing Iran to use its embassy in Algiers for clandestine operations run jointly with Hezbullah, which was training and arming Polisario, a Western Sahara separatist group, known for its opposition to Morocco.  Morocco severed its relations with Iran over that series of episodes on May 2, after accusing the embassy of promoting sectarianism in North Africa.  Morocco then accused Algeria of providing Hezbullah with a backdoor to North Africa. Algeria’s relationship with Iran has been a source of consternation for a number of countries in the Arab world, as well as for Israel, since the restoration of the relations between Tehran and Algiers in 2000. The Sunni majority Algeria had rejected Saudi Arabia’s entreaties to join the coalition of Muslim states against ISIS, instead, aligning itself with the Shi’a Iran, seen as a regional rival to to the Gulf States, and a facilitator of terrorism. Algeria likewise backed Iran when the latter protested the exclusion of Bashir Assad from attending the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Mecca in 2012, at the height of the civil war in Syria. Iran has successfully exploited Algeria’s tensions with Saudi Arabia over energy prices and political differences. Algeria joined the Iranian-Russian alliance against Saudi Arabia, over the latter’s efforts to keep the oil prices low. Iran has viewed Algeria as a sphere of influence in Africa and against the Saudi-led coalition of Sunni states for many years to the escalation of tensions between Tehran and Riyadh. In 2006, Iran and Algeria formed a joint committee which would fund $100 million worth of Iranian project inside Algeria.  Likewise, state visits between high level officials increased since then, becoming more pronounced since the conclusion of the nuclear deal. Algeria itself has been going through a severe economic crisis, including high unemployment rates among its young population. The leadership of the Islamist opposition party in Algeria, believes Iran is set on exploiting the economic situation to further its own agenda and spread influence in Algeria. If that is the case, Iran appears to have succeeded. The two countries continue exploring economic ties, with Algeria growing increasingly dependent on its cooperation with Iran. Indeed, Iran’s Ambassador to Algeria, Reza Ameri, emphasized Algeria’s support of Iran against sanctions, and willingness to cooperate on “peaceful” nuclear activity as part of the foundation for the growing rapprochement between the two states. He also emphasized the similar political positions between Tehran and Algiers, which stand out in light of the important political differences between Iran and the other North African countries. Algeria supports Iran’s position in Syria and Yemen, in particular. Morocco, which is part of the Arab Coalition in Yemen, is an obstacle for the spread of Iranian influence in North Africa. The Ambassador implied in the interview that he saw Algeria as a key independent ally and influencer in Africa, which could be used to challenge the positions of the other Sunni states, in Tehran’s view, more closely aligned with Saudi Arabia. For that reason, Tehran’s use of its embassy in Algiers to facilitate Hezbullah’s contacts with the separatist group Polisario to advance staged attacks on Moroccan Royal Forces, should come as no surprise. Antagonizing and destabilizing Morocco would help Iran spread its ideological influence throughout North Africa, destabilize the region, help gain access to strategic waterways, and find new ground for recruiting extremist proxies. Algeria would benefit from weakening and eliminating its regional rival; Iran’s assistance in that matter furthers its own ambitions in the context of the African Union. Algeria is not the only African country where Iranian influence has increased. South African agent communicating with CIA, Mossad, and other intelligence agencies, in a cable leaked several years ago, expressed concern about Iranian intelligence presence in South Africa, as well as Iran’s ability to coopt the corrupt South African government.  Despite political tensions between South Africa and Israel, the intelligence agencies of the two countries shared a common understanding: they viewed the spread of Iranian influence through Africa as a threat. Iran has viewed Africa as a sphere of influence for ideological influence, humanitarian goodwill, cooptation of weak corrupt governments, evasion of sanctions, illicit arms and gold trade, and procurement of uranium for its nuclear research. Ghana has been one of its top partners for the uranium procurement; in fact, prior to the implementation of the JCPOA, there is evidence of a joint US-China effort to get bomb-grade nuclear effort out of Africa. However, China’s role in the possible facilitation of Iranian operations is less clear. Moreover, only a week after the diplomatic fallout, Iran and Algeria jointly held their first energy summit, further emphasizing their growing ties which the countries are not trying to hide. That angle in the relationship should come as no surprise: both countries have one more thing in common – a history of nuclear ambitions. In the 1990s, Algeria pushed for building a nuclear reactor, much to the consternation of the West.  In another striking coincidence it then asked for Chinese assistance (and also some Argentine help) with the controversial Es Salam reactor.  Could China have been trusted with the denuclearization of the fuel in Africa, given that history and close links to Iran? That question remains open, but the Obama administration, eager to implement the JCPOA, thought that the cooperation with China on that issue was a good idea. Over time, Washington forgot all about Algeria and its potential for nuclear proliferation. But perhaps Iran has not. Perhaps it had nothing much to fear, given Washington’s slow reaction to the news that China was helping Algeria with its nuclear program – contemporaneously, and at the height of concern over that issue. Indeed, evidence points to the fact that Algeria’s interest in nuclear energy renewed along with the hoopla over the JCPOA. In 2014, Algeria and Russia (another close associate of the Islamic Republic) signed a nuclear energy cooperation deal. Algeria’s Western partners have been lackluster in following through on agreements regarding Algeria’s civil nuclear program; Moscow appears to be more interested. While Algeria had refocused on promoting its program, Iran, coincidentally spread its outreach to Brazil, Indonesia, and Algeria in an effort to win allies and counter opposition from the West.  Brazil, reeling from endemic corruption issues, Indonesia, increasingly concerned over the spread of Sunni jihadist organization and the spread of ideological extremism in the mosques, and the poor, corrupt junta-led Algeria suffering from a high youth unemployment rate found a reliable partner in Tehran willing and happy to overlook all of these legitimate business risks. The timing could not be better for Iran – just as Iran outwardly appeared to be willing to put aside its own nuclear program, Algeria put its uranium exploration leases in the south out for tender in 2009 – the time of the very first initial outreach efforts from Islamic Republic to the White House concerning a potential nuclear deal. Algeria has approximately 26,000 tons of uranium, in the high-cost category. Is Iran looking to procure uranium from Algeria, in an unexpected turn of events for the Western intelligence agencies, which, judging by the silence from those circles, have appeared to overlook this possibility? Does Algeria harbor its own clandestine nuclear ambitions, and is Tehran assisting in that effort? Is Hamas, which is funded by Iran with regards to its border operations, a facilitator of best practices between the two countries? These questions are yet to be explored, but provide a variety of troubling scenarios for Morocco’s own security considerations. A nuclear Algeria, with or without Iran’s assistance, is a significantly greater danger than an Algeria, which has been a regional rival and a significant nuisance, but not a direct existential threat. On the surface, Algeria seems disinterested in nuclear bombmaking, and is in fact, has sued  France for the toxic nuclear tests conducted in the 1960s. France agreed to pay compensation to the victims in 2008. Since then, however, Algerian government and Iran have grown closer. Should the country ever be interested in conducting nuclear tests, it has the sites and the legacy knowhow to do so. Outwardly, Algeria calls for the acceleration of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. At the same time, however, it has staunchly supported Iran’s nuclear research despite Tehran’s obvious intent to yield a nuclear weapon. These commens, then, could be nothing more than politically advantageous virtue signaling. Indeed, a former Algerian Minister stated, in 2015, that Algeria should obtain “nuclear weapons” to “drive out Jews from Palestine”. Whether his comments have anything to do with the Palestinian scientists studying in Algiers is unknown. However, what is known is that since the implementation of the Es Salaam nuclear reactor, Algeria likely obtained the capability to produce plutonium, which is a necessary component  for the production of nuclear weapons. In the late 1990s, Spain’s intelligence concluded that the Algerian atomic program exceeds its civil needs. And while Algeria is a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, its support for Iran’s intention to do so, shows that at the very least the Algerian government is conflicted on the issue. Analysts speculate that proliferation of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, including Algeria, is likely to become a norm in the near future. In April 2019, US and Algerian representatives met for an implementation review of the joint framework of cooperation to combat illicit nuclear and radiological weapons. Having a country that is potentially involved in facilitation of illicit activity to be at the vanguard of international cooperation to combat smuggling would be somewhat akin to having a Soviet mole lead the charge in the investigation of his own espionage activity inside the FBI. However, that indeed happened with Robert Hanssen. With the demise of the Palestinian scientists in Algeria, coming only weeks before the mysterious death of a nuclear scientists in Syria, perhaps it is time to reexamine the presumption of innocence, and instead start connecting the dots indicating a potential cover up of nuclear researching favoring Iran’s agenda. And an Iran looking to further its nuclear ambitions right next doors to Morocco is likewise not a welcome development, as such activity would attract bad actors of every possible background to the vicinity, and ,may lead to additional security incidents and clashes at the borders and in Western Sahara.  Whether or not rumors about Mossad’s involvement in clandestine operations which have eliminated Iranian and Hamas operatives in North Africa hold any water,  the issues that have been raised as a result of the discussion these incidents generations are worth the trouble to investigate for the sake of preventing security disasters  in North Africa.  Mossad may or may not be present in North Africa, but Iran is definitely playing spy games – and may be looking to ensnare Morocco next.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI latest throne speech continues to make waves on Moroccan social media. The reaction to the much-anticipated address was a chance for Moroccans to voice their feelings toward the current government, their grievances and complaints about the state of their nation, and their hopes for a better future.  Just like in past speeches, King Mohammed VI was direct, frank and precise in his assessments of the current political, social and economic challenges facing the Kingdom. The Monarch has “invited the Government and all relevant actors to undertake a comprehensive and deep restructuring of national support and social protection programs and policies and to submit proposals for their evaluation modalities.” Moroccans have reasonable expectation that their government would respond competently to their basic demands. However, they have serious doubts about the ability of the current “hard to define” coalition of government ministers and pro-establishment  personalities running the country to deliver the Monarch’s promises. The time to pretend that the current government led by Prime Minister Saadeddine Othmani (Justice and Development Party- Known as PJD) is actually governing is over. The elements who control the decision-making apparatus in the Kingdom must either let the PJD rule or take over the reins of power and assume the responsibilities that comes with “presiding”. The public welcomes and appreciates the King’s directives and his push for the current government to tackle the socio-economic problems facing the nation, however, similar proposals never materialized or failed to meet expectations in the past. Today, the health care and education systems are in shambles and the judiciary remains partial to outside interferences. For the majority of Moroccans, the PJD led government is too feeble to address these issues. PM Othmani is just a figure and his team is nothing but a political ghost hindered from making significant political decisions or adopting substantial policy changes without the blessing of elements close to the circle of power in the establishment.  In fact, Moroccans understand that the Royal palace is the only institution capable of such undertaking. As such, advisers and counsellors  need to devise an executable plan to follow and assess the progress of the King’s initiatives. Despite the recent firing of the Economy and Finance Minister Mohamed Boussaid, the removal of incompetent bureaucrats remains illusory in Morocco. Government bureaucrats, including minsters, must be hold accountable for the failure of their agencies and should be fired for unsatisfactory performances. Resorting to the game of shuffling incompetent government officials from one position to another weakens the public trust in the effectiveness of all the Kingdom’s institutions. In Morocco, it is easy to find responsible individuals at all levels of government. What the public is asking for is to hold the culpable accountable for the multitudes of political and economic failures that led the United Nations’ Development Program to rank Morocco a shameful 123rd out of 188 countries in terms of human development for 2016.  While the King cannot assess the performance of each minster and high-ranking government official, which leaves a lot of opportunity for abuse of power, he can set a clear tone for the consequences of malfeasance and incompetence for all public servants.   Past attempts to clean house did not work. The public education and government run health systems in Morocco are in dire status. Despite repeated calls to improve government agencies’ performances, officials had yet to formulate an executable plan for responding to incompetence and mediocracy. This seems incomprehensible. Moroccans love to look for someone to blame when things go wrong. They think and hope that by identifying and castigating the culpable party or group they can set an example.  Nevertheless, the reality is different today. The Moroccan public is well aware of the complex “power web” that governs the country and conscience of the difficulties and hurdles to hold some officials accountable for their oversights.  Of all the attempts for dealing with incompetent bureaucrats and officeholders, the easiest and straightforward is to let the elected government govern without outside interferences. The Moroccan electorate is smart and perceptive to vote their representatives out of they fail and reward them if they succeed.

Rabat- The Vatican has said that the Pope’s welcoming of Sahrawi children had no political meaning, contrary to Polisario’s speculations. A photo taken in the Vatican in Rome of Pope Francis in a peaceful gathering with Sahrawi children from the disputed region of Western Sahara has caused controversy between political factions. The Polisario-backed news site sprasd.info claimed: “Pope Francis received Sahrawi children in the Vatican in Rome, in presence of Polisario Front’s representative in Italy. Sahrawi children received by Pope Francis were wearing traditional clothes and carrying Sahrawi flags.” Responding to Polisario’s reports, the Vatican’s representative in Morocco, Archbishop Vito Rallo, clarified in a statement to the state-owned news agency, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), on Saturday August 11:  “The Holy See’s position on the Sahara conflict has not changed.” He continued, “The weekly audiences that the Holy Father gives to pilgrims around the world are of a purely pastoral nature. [They] have no political connotations.” Taking advantage of the photo showing Pope Francis surrounded by a number of Sahrawi children, the Polisario Front took to its media platforms to suggest that the Vatican supports their separatist movement.

Rabat- The Ministry of Islamic Affairs has confirmed that Morocco will celebrate Eid Al Adha on Wednesday, August 22. The astronomer and researcher Abdelaziz Khabrouch Al Ifrani’s Eid Al Adha predictions for Morocco World News were correct, similar to his predictions for the first day of Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr. A communique from the ministry announced on Monday that Morocco observed the crescent of the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah on the evening of August 12, making the first day of the month Monday, August 13. The Islamic world celebrates Eid Al Adha, the second of two Islamic holidays celebrated by Muslims worldwide, on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah (the month of pilgrimage) in which the Hajj (pilgrimage) takes place.  On Eid, after Muslims perform the morning Eid prayers, families either hire a butcher to slaughter a sheep or goat, or the oldest male in the family proceeds to make the sacrifice. Other Islamic holidays include Eid al-Fitr marking the end of Ramadan, the month of fasting, and Eid al-Mawlid commemorating the birth of the Prophet Mohammed peace be upon him.

Rabat – The Moroccan-American rapper French Montana has an idea of what life would have been like if he had stayed in Morocco, and it is not glorious.  In an interview with the American magazine Billboard, the singer of “Famous” recalled his journey from little Moroccan kid to American superstar.  The successful 33-year-old artist has come a long way. Born in Casablanca, he left his hometown when he was 13 years old to live the not-so American dream in the Bronx, New York.  The rapper, born Karim Kharbouch, spent his youth wandering the streets of the South Bronx, selling drugs to provide for his family, especially after his father had to go back to Morocco, and French Montana had to take care of his mother.  “My mother had to stay here with us and get on welfare. It was a choice—she sacrificed for us. And it worked, by mistake. I became the biggest artist out of my country by mistake,” he said. Montana finally acquired American citizenship in June, after living in the US for over 20 years and has the same rights as any citizen of the US.  However, things could have gone completely different, of which Karim Kharbouch is well aware.  During his interview, Khloe Kardashian’s ex-boyfriend imagined if his mother had returned to Morocco with his dad.   “Who knows where I’d be right now? I’d be in Morocco, selling corn, cameras. In some countries there’s more opportunity—but I feel like that’s only limited by how many chances you want to take,” he said.  Despite living his dream, Montana has never forgotten where he came from and is still proudly claiming his origins. Kharbouch is also helping the Moroccan community by working with the Pan-African Movement and CARE Morocco in his hometown of Casablanca. These organizations seek to provide the children of Casablanca with full access to a quality education and healthcare.

Rabat – After Andres Iniesta’s exit, Spain’s national team is losing center defender Gerard Pique, a key player for the team.  The 31-year-old Barcelona footballer announced his international retirement on Saturday, August 11, in an interview ahead of his club’s Sunday Super Cup match against Sevilla FC in Tangier. “It was a lovely time with the national team, but now I want to focus on Barcelona,” he said. The central defender explained to his new coach, Luis Enrique, that he wants to concentrate on his career with Spain’s FC Barcelona, where he has just extended his contract until 2022. “I spoke with him a week or two ago and told him that my decision was made,” said the Catalan player.  The Spanish team experienced sudden changes in leadership this summer. Luis Enrique became senior coach in July, succeeding Fernando Hierro, who spent one month doubling as senior coach and sports director with la Roja. Hierro had succeeded Julen Lopetegui, sacked two days before the start of the World Cup for having negotiated to become coach of Real Madrid. Pique is the last remaining member of the Spanish team that won the World Cup in 2010. He is regarded as one of the finest winners in the Spanish selection.  Succeeding Carles Puyol, Pique has played 103 games with la Roja making him one of only 13 “centenarians” of Iberian football.  Pique’s exit follows Iniesta’s, who decided to quit the selection after Spain’s early exit in the 2018 Russian World Cup.  Pique played his first international match in 2009 in a friendly game against England. The Spanish side won the match 2-0. Later, in the FIFA World Cup (2010) qualifier match against Turkey in 2009, he scored the only goal. Since then, Pique appeared in almost every one of Spain’s 2010 World Cup matches.  Despite his success, Pique has had a very tumultuous relationship with la Roja. During the World Cup qualifiers in 2016, Pique was accused of removing Spanish colors from his shirt by cutting off his sleeves. Pique insisted that he cut off the sleeves for comfort, not as a political move.  In 2017, Pique threatened to quit the Spanish national football team if his support for the referendum on Catalan independence was considered “a problem.”

Rabat – Spain and Germany agreed Saturday to push for an integrated EU policy on migration and boost funding for “border” countries. Meeting August 11 in the southern Spanish region of Andalusia, Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called for “a united European front” to face the “concerning” challenges of the recent massive human flows to the European Union. Intra-European framework The two European leaders agreed on shared policy to stem the flow of irregular migrants but also to ease the regularization process for refugees and asylum seekers. The pair also finalized a landmark bilateral deal.  Under the terms of the bilateral agreement, refugees who reach Germany but have already been registered in Spain can be returned to the country within 48 hours.  The German chancellor lauded the bilateral agreement, expressing satisfaction with what she said aimed to achieve “a fair distribution system.” Regarding the continental agenda, both leaders championed the cause of a “firm” but welcoming EU policy on migration, which they described as a global humanitarian crisis. “Germany and Spain are counting on European solutions,” the German leader said, explaining that EU countries with the highest numbers of migrant arrivals—especially Spain, Greece, and Italy—need greater help and support from the EU. “No country can be exempt from this challenge,” Merkel asserted. “The racist tendencies we’re seeing, regrettably, in all member countries is something we have to fight against.” Boosting cooperation with third parties Of EU members’ cooperation with third parties, Merkel said: “We have to intensify our support for Morocco and Tunisia. They are border countries and they need our help.” While also calling for more engagement from EU member states, the Spanish prime minister drew attention to the role that non-EU partners play in helping secure the continent’s external borders. He pledged more EU financial support for Morocco and Tunisia, but underlined the need to address the roots of the crisis in origin and transit countries. “Fourteen kilometers separate the coast of Spain—and therefore Europe—from those of North Africa but there is an infinitely greater distance in terms of development,” Sanchez said. “Reducing the depth of this abyss of inequality must be one of the main tasks of the European Union.” Merkel said negotiations with Italy and Greece are ongoing to achieve similar agreements to the one obtained on Saturday. The talks come amid a tempest of scathing criticism that recently targeted Europe’s “appalling” and “deadly” policy on migration.  On Wednesday, August 8, Amnesty International published a report that blamed populist and anti-migrant rhetoric in a number of EU states for the EU’s “reprehensible” and deadly policies that it claimed were responsible for the death of 721 migrants at sea between June and July.

By Dil Bola Rabat – Three members of a patient’s family have attacked hospital staff at Mohammed V Hospital in El Jadida, vandalizing medical equipment. The latest in frequent and prevalent attacks on health professionals occurred in the coastal town of El Jadida, 100 kilometers southwest of Casablanca, on Thursday night. The family members were visiting a 16-year-old girl who had been admitted to the emergency department unconscious, according to a statement made by the emergency department. After examining the patient and determining she was stable, the department transferred the teenager to intensive care for more tests. During the visiting hours allocated by the hospital, three relatives of the patient not only assaulted staff members but also vandalized the room, including various pieces of medical equipment. Security guards intervened after one staff member’s shoulder was dislocated while nurses and a maid were under continuous assault. Sources told Lematin that guards attempted to “calm the aggressors” but came under attacked as well. The normal operations of the hospital were hindered, and other patients were endangered by the climate of panic. When police arrived, they apprehended one of the attackers and recorded evidence of the damage to open an investigation determining who was responsible. It is not the first time hospital staff have been attacked. A 2010 analysis on violence within emergency departments in Morocco published by the Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology revealed the prevalence of such attacks. Although abuse is primarily exhibited verbally, physical violence remains significant specifically within emergency services departments. “Delay of consultation or care” is the primary cause of violence, according to the data released by the study. Acute drunkenness and neuropsychiatric disease have been allotted as the secondary, yet significant, causes of violence exhibited towards health professionals. The El Jadida incident prompted the Ministry of Health to release an official statement Friday condemning such acts. The ministry reiterated that the destruction of biomedical material and the endangerment of staff creates a climate of fear and panic which affects the essential services of the emergency department. The actions have been deemed “irresponsible” by the Ministry of Health, which affirmed its support for staff members who are frequent victims of attacks. The department has reassured the public they will take the necessary steps not only to prosecute the perpetrators but to eliminate such attacks, taking a zero tolerance stance toward all actions harming health professionals.

Rabat – Fortunately, the shocking attack left no one harmed.  According to AFP, a driver of a Mercedes struck the doors of Al Wifaq Mosque in the French village of Mons-en-Baroeul near Lille, at night on Friday, August 10. The prefecture released a statement dismissing any “racist motivation.”  ???FLASH – Le conducteur d’une voiture a volontairement foncé dans les portes d’une mosquée hier soir à #MonsEnBaroeul près de Lille. Pas de blessé. L’auteur est recherché. Il a été identifié. Ses motivations ne sont pas connues pour l’instant. (France 3 – ?@Ali_Loup) pic.twitter.com/STBliTNAE4 — Brèves de presse (@Brevesdepresse) August 12, 2018  The hit-and-run act occurred at 11:45 p.m., shortly after the isha (evening) prayer, which gathered approximately 200 people, according to French media. The suspect left his car behind, and ran to escape the crime scene.  “The car drove its full length into the mosque. The motives of the suspect, who has been identified will be known when arrested,” said a police source to AFP.  The national police services have made it a priority to find the individual. According to television channel France 3, the suspect is a French Muslim who was previously convicted of a criminal offense.

Rabat – At least 127 American M1A1 Abrams tanks have arrived in Morocco, part of a US-Morocco procurement contract for 200 tanks. “Satellite images show that Morocco already has at least 127 of the almost two hundred Abrams M1A1 tanks that the United States has authorized to sell to the North African country,” the Spanish outlet Infodefensa reported on August 9. The satellites photographed tanks in the Central Establishment and Management of Material Storage (ECGCM) in Nouaceur, a town 20 kilometers south of Casablanca. One picture showed up to 65 of the tanks all together, the Spanish outlet added. Commenting on the tanks’ arrival, Mohammed Chakir, a Moroccan expert on military affairs, told Alyaoum24, “This is a reflection of the Spanish concern as an arming race exists between Rabat, Madrid and Algeria.” “The many disagreements between Spain and Morocco, mainly the dispute over the occupied cities of Ceuta and Melilla, make decision makers in Spain closely follow any military deal concluded by Morocco, especially with the US, which is known for its most sophisticated industry weapons,” he added. In April 2018, a research associate at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) tweeted that “a pre-delivery of 48 Abrams tanks” from the US to Morocco was dispatched from Joint Systems Manufacturing Center in Lima, Ohio and was videoed cruising through La Grange, Kentucky. Nothing to see here… just 48 pre-delivery #Morocco M1A1 SA Abrams tanks cruising down Main Street, La Grange, Kentucky #US (38°24?24?N 85°22?46?W) https://t.co/JeiFJC7BBf pic.twitter.com/FHPc5Y1DqX — Joseph Dempsey (@JosephHDempsey) April 7, 2018  According to the US Defense Security and Cooperation Agency (DSCA), the negotiations between Morocco and the US for the purchase of 200 enhanced and refurbished M1A1 Abrams tanks started in June 2012. The enhancement also included associated parts, equipment, logistical support, and training for over $1 billion. The two countries finalized the deal in September 2015. “This package of M1A1 tank enhancements will contribute to the modernization of Morocco’s tank fleet, enhancing its ability to meet current and future threats,” said DSCA. In July 2016, Morocco officially received the first batch of Abrams M1A1 tanks. A ceremony was held at the ECGCM at Nouaceur in the presence of Moroccan and US civil and military officials. According to the state-owned news agency MAP, the 2016 delivery is part of a procurement contract which would extend over the years 2017 and 2018. The transaction reflects “the shared will of Morocco and of the United States of America to deepen their defense cooperation.”

Rabat- The terrorist behind a van bombing in Basilan Island is strongly believed to be Moroccan ISIS member Abu Kathir al-Maghribi. ISIS has claimed responsibility for a van explosion that killed 11 people, including a 10-year-old child, in the southern Filipino island of Basilan on July 31.  On the same day of the terrorist attack, a Twitter user with the handle @TerrorMonitor shared a photo of al-Maghribi corresponding to the description of eyewitnesses.  #PHILIPPINES#IslamicState Releases Picture Of #Moroccan Suicide Bomber ‘Abu Kathir al-Maghribi’ Who Carried Out Attack On Filipino Soldiers In Lamitan Of Basilan Island. #TerrorMonitor pic.twitter.com/bs8HpWpBso — Terrormonitor.org (@Terror_Monitor) July 31, 2018  Military intelligence services in the Philippines suggested that the jihadist’s main target was a gathering of school children nearby, according to Filipino news site Philippines Lifestyle. Al-Maghribi was allegedly avenging the death of his son, killed in a clash between ISIS and the Filipino army. Philippines’ Interior Undersecretary Eduardo Ano told the Associated Press the van driver “was targeting an event that gathered about 3,000 people but something went wrong with his van,” before it suddenly exploded. Philippines Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana speculated on the suspect, saying, “Maybe he is that guy. There are still doubts as to whether he is behind the attack. But for me, qualifications point to him,” reported AP. According to a recent study by a Madrid-based think tank, Elcano Royal Institute, nearly half of the ISIS jihadists arrested or killed in Spain in the past five years were of Moroccan origin. Elcano’s 2013-2017 database reveals that approximately 46 percent of the 233 people arrested or killed for alleged involvement in terrorism activities in Spain were Moroccan nationals; meanwhile Spanish nationals represented 38 percent. Furthermore, 6 out of 10 of the suspected terrorists were second-generation descendants of Moroccan immigrants. The figures raises the question: “Is it easier for Moroccan nationals to join terrorist groups in foreign countries?” The head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, believes that individuals’ birthplace does not determine whether they will adopt a radical position. “It is rather the environment in which they were raised. Yes, these people have Moroccan roots but they were born, grew and acquired values from Western countries,” Khiame told British news agency BBC two years ago. Other writers and world leaders agree, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said, “Terrorism has no nationality or religion.” Renowned Moroccan author Tahar Benjelloun wrote in 2017: “Those killers belong to no country…. [they] belong to [ISIS] and have no country. They claim belonging to a promised land in a mythical and improbable hereafter.”

Rabat- A bystander has filmed a driver in Laayoune repeatedly backing into a parked car, allegedly belonging to a company director. The video surfaced on social media on Friday, August 10, showing a black Toyota land cruiser without a number plate continually hitting a parked sedan before driving off. No policemen were in sight.  The video was recorded in Laayoune, the desert region south of Morocco’s anti-Atlas Mountains in Western Sahara. The larger car is seen backing into the sedan three times, triggering its alarm as alarmed onlookers in the street stand by. A report by news outlet Lakome2 claimed that the parked car belonged to the director of the housing and urbanism company, Al Omrane Al Janoub, a subsidiary of Al Omrane Group in the region. The driver of the land cruiser reportedly sought revenge from the director because the latter refused him a license to use some land, according to the news outlet. Some social media commenters condemned the driver’s actions and blamed the “chaos” on the absence of security forces.

Rabat – A founding member of the Polisario Front has slammed Algiers’s official position as “observer state” in the Western Sahara dispute. Bachir Dhkil, a founding member of the Polisario Front who fled Tindouf in 1990 over ideological divergences with the separatist group, said in an interview that “Algeria should come to the negotiation table and help find a solution to the conflict it created in the first place.” Dhkil’s remarks come after the latest UN Security Council briefing on the conflict between Morocco and the insurgent group he helped to found in 1973. Dhkil welcomed the UN Security Council’s determination to open negotiations to find a peaceful settlement to the conflict. He said,  however, that negotiations should ensure that “Algiers be a full participant and shoulder more responsibility.”  Calling Kohler’s briefing an extraordinary development, he said: “The Security Council is getting to understand Algeria’s role in the conflict, which will bring them closer to securing a political settlement.” “Algiers is responsible for the genesis and the escalation of the Western Sahara question…. Algeria not only trains and finances the Polisario Front, but it also gets in the way whenever there are peace talks and prospects of a peaceful settlement.”  Dhkil highlighted that there have been in the last 40 years “demographic and geographic changes that show that the Polisario Front is not the sole representative of the people in Western Sahara.” “The most viable and beneficial solution is Sahrawi autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty,” he said.

Rabat- Emmanuel Macron has promised to intervene and try to repatriate a Frenchman imprisoned in Morocco for financing a terrorist cell. Moroccan authorities arrested Thomas Gallay, a 37-year-old French national, in Essaouira, a city along the Atlantic coast south of Casablanca, and sentenced him to six years in prison in 2016 for lending money to a radicalized terrorist group. Gallay’s mother, Beatrice Gallay, recently called on the French president to bring her son home to France, after he has spent two years in a Moroccan prison. Having promised to “personally” intervene, Macron received Gallay’s mother near Fort de Brégancon off the French Mediterranean coast where the president is spending his vacation. Gallay’s mother stood daily in front of Macron’s presidential residence, holding a banner reading “Help Thomas” until she caught the president’s attention. “I trust [Macron] I believe he’s the only person who can solve this problem,” Beatrice told the press after her meeting with Macron and his wife Brigitte Macron. Beatrice Gallay accused Moroccan police of forcing her son to sign a false confession written in Arabic which he did not understand, claiming that he only gave “€70 to an acquaintance” rather than to a terrorist cell.

Rabat – The Trump administration is allegedly “pressuring” Horst Kohler to find a quick settlement to the decades-long conflict in Western Sahara. Assabah reported on Saturday, August 12, that members in President Trump’s inner circles have been pushing Host Kohler, the UN secretary-general’s personal envoy for Western Sahara, to devise a plan that will not only convince all stakeholders to resume peace negotiations to end the long-standing political deadlock, but also to ensure a “quick political settlement.”  According to Assabah’s “diplomatic sources,” Washington’s intensions are mainly military-based, because the Trump administration envisions erecting a stronghold in the MENA region. And in some conservative quarters in Washington, the Sahara dispute allegedly constitutes a major impediment to the realization of Trump’s security plan for North Africa. In addition, the sources mentioned that Washington has held months-long behind-closed-doors meetings with governments in the Middle East to create what President Trump has reportedly referred to as an “Arab NATO.”  The move primarily seeks to create a military stronghold in the Gulf to fight terrorism and the spread of extremist groups. But Washington also wishes to create a Sunni alliance comprising the Gulf states, Jordan, and Egypt to contain and neutralize Shia Iran’s expanding military and ideological influence in the Middle East.  Moroccan diplomatic sources quoted by Assabah believe, however, that Washington is also planning to extend its Iran-containment policy to North Africa.  They underlined recent developments in Western Sahara. The alleged presence in the area of Iran-backed Hezbollah and groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), have persuaded Washington of the urgent need to establish a security stronghold in the area, the sources argued. UN-led negotiations to resume On Wednesday, Horst Kohler briefed the UN Security Council on the situation in Western Sahara.  The German diplomat proposed resumption of peace talks between Morocco and the Polisario Front to find a mutually acceptable political accommodation a decade after the last UN-led negotiations ended in a diplomatic standstill in 2008.  The Security Council welcomed Kohler’s call for resuming negotiations. Morocco, too, expressed satisfaction with Kohler’s plan to resume negotiations. However, the kingdom insisted that a more effective plan be put in place to involve and commit all important stakeholders, including neighboring Algeria, to finding a lasting and sustainable political solution to the conflict in Western Sahara. But it remains to be seen whether both President Trump’s alleged North Africa stronghold and the UN’s latest determination to secure a political settlement will be met with similar fervor by the parties involved, especially given the overt hostility between Algiers and Rabat over the situation in Western Sahara.

Rabat- Omar Hilale said that Polisario is a “mere political tool in the hands of Algeria, and everyone knows it.” During his briefing on the situation in Western Sahara on Wednesday, the UN secretary-general’s personal envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, suggested that Morocco and Polisario should compromise to find a solution to the conflict. On the other hand, Morocco insists that Algeria take full part in direct negotiations and peace talks as the country is part of the conflict. Commenting on Kohler’s speech, Morocco’s permanent representative to the United Nations, Omar Hilale, told Moroccan news outlet Hespress that negotiations on Western Sahara without the participation of Algeria is a “waste of time.” He also said that Morocco cannot accept any solution to the conflict other than its proposed autonomy plan. He stated: “Rabat is definitely not ready for negotiations with a party [Polisario] that has no authority, no independence, and no power to make decisions on its own.” “We do not want to waste time, we were frank with the UN Envoy by insisting that Algeria must take part in next negotiations,” Hilale stated. Hilale pointed out that the UNSC member states advised Kohler to take precaution in proceeding to revive negotiations between the concerned parties, especially when it comes to Morocco’s proposals and autonomy plan to reach an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to the decades-long conflict. In its Resolution 2414 of April 27, 2018, the UN Security Council called on neighboring states, including Algeria, to contribute to the political process and to engage further in the negotiations. Hilale considers the UNSC’s stance a positive one as it respects Morocco’s own claim for territorial integrity and autonomy plan. According to Hilale, it is rather impossible to start negotiations at the moment because the issue needs “dialogue” more than “negotiations.”

Rabat – Germany has granted early release to Mounir El Motassadeq, a Moroccan accomplice in the 9/11 attack, after he served 15 years in jail. Mounir El Motassadeq, 44, was arrested for the first time in November 2002 in Germany for aiding the 9/11 attacks in the US. Motassadeq will be released on October 15 and immediately deported to his home country, Morocco, German news outlet Bild reported Thursday, July 9. Bild said that Motassadeq’s prison term was supposed to end in January 2019. Speaking on the release, Frauke Kohler, a spokesperson from the Federal Prosecutors Office, told DW, “This measure will allow us to arrest him immediately should he set foot on German soil again.” Motassadeq has been in Hamburg prison in Germany for almost 15 years. He was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and for being an accessory to murder in the horrific attack on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., on September 11, 2001. The German Federal Court of Justice had previously rejected Motassadeq’s request for a premature release in 2014. The court considered him to be too dangerous at that time. According to DE News, Motassadeq behaved well in prison, but “he had not moved away from his Islamist jihadist attitude.” Motassadeq’s several trials Motassadeq’s trial was a multi-year legal process. According to BBC, Motassadeq came under suspicion in November 2001 when German police realized that he had power of attorney over Marwan al-Shehhi’s bank account. Shehhi was the one who flew the second plane into the World Trade Center. In February 2003, Motassadeq was first sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to the 9/11 plot, but the court quashed the decision in March 2004. Several lawsuits followed until Motassadeq received 15 years of imprisonment in January 2007, and he has been in Hamburg prison since May 2007. Motassadeq went to Germany in 1993. Two years later, he moved to Hamburg to study electrical engineering in Hamburg University where he met Mohammed Atta-whom Bin Laden chose to lead the terrorist group attacking the US, according to a report by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States. Prosecutors said Motassadeq “maintained intensive contacts over several years” with Atta, Shehhi, and other 9/11 plotters, BBC reported. Motassadeq worked as a cleaner at Hamburg Airport between 1996 and 1998. A security check allowed him to work in secure areas and aircraft in the airport. Motassadeq is married and has two children.

Rabat- RAM passengers waiting at Brussels Airport for 45 hours were furious to learn that their flight was delayed again. Royal Air Maroc passengers heading to Morocco waited for 45 hours at the airport after their flight was canceled on Friday. To their despair, the newly scheduled flight was also delayed. Some RAM passengers were originally scheduled to leave for Morocco on Tuesday evening and others on Wednesday afternoon, however their flights were delayed until Friday morning only to be delayed again to Friday evening before being canceled. Interviewed by Belgian news channel RTL Info, Moroccan passengers expressed frustration, some complaining that they had to go to Morocco for an emergency, but had no choice but to wait for too long. “Some were supposed to attend funerals, and I want to go to my children, we have had enough!” one passenger stated.  Since the start of an RAM pilot strike on July 18, RAM is reportedly losing MAD 20 million daily, a senior RAM managing officer told Moroccan news outlet L’economiste. The pilots are asking for a salary raise of MAD 15,000 per month in order to suspend their protest. However, RAM has not found a solution to save the company from further crisis leading to a growing number of delayed and canceled flights and angry customers. RAM has called off more than 100 flights in two weeks from the third week of July to August.

Rabat – The Moroccan government has warned representatives in the country’s financial and business sectors against trade with Iran. In a letter to the Consortium of Moroccan Banks (GPBM), Morocco’s minister of foreign affairs, Nasser Bourita, instructed the kingdom’s banks to “take all necessary measures” to avoid the political repercussions that may result from trading with Iran, L’Economiste reported on August 9. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned Moroccan banking and financial conglomerates against engaging in trade with Iran, including transactions or deals in the automobile and aviation sectors, the purchase of raw materials, and the acquisition of Iranian carpets. The instruction, in line with Washington’s policy, also targets all financial transactions between Moroccan firms and their Iranian counterparts. On Tuesday, August 7, a US-imposed blanket of economic sanctions hit the Iranian regime. The punitive measures, a follow-up to the US decision in early May to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, restrict Iranian access to US currency, gold, and other precious materials. The US will also sanction companies in third countries, such as Morocco, from trading both with Iran and the US. The sanctions also concern Tehran’s automobile and aviation sector, with tougher sanctions—especially an embargo on Iran’s oil and banking sectors—to follow by November 4 should the Islamic Republic fail to accommodate President Trump’s terms on “WORLD PEACE.”  President Trump warned US partners and the rest of the international community against trading with Iran. “Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!” Trump tweeted. In addition to avoiding economic and political backlash from the US, however, Morocco’s move to halt trade with Iran comes amid months of sour bilateral terms between Tehran and Rabat.  While Washington was busy exiting the Iran nuclear deal in early May, Rabat had its own issues with the Islamic Republic. On May 1, the kingdom severed diplomatic ties with Tehran over the latter’s support for the Polisario Front, the separatist group advocating for independence in Western Sahara.

Rabat – It’s good news for Café Hafa lovers. Tangier’s most popular spot has reopened its doors. The café reopened August 8 after closing for almost four days, according to a report by Medi1TV.  Rumors of a permanent closing were spreading on the news and all over social media.   The mythical place was not shut down because of “illegal constructions,” local media Tanja 24 reported earlier this week. Local authorities went to the cafe on Saturday, August 4, to demolish a terrace that was built without “a license.” “We had to do some work these days, that’s all. Today everything is back to normal, customers are still there,” said a waiter to Medi1TV. Opened in 1921, Hafa is one of the oldest cafes in Tangier. Since then, the cafe has kept its simple decorations and style. Cafe Hafa has maintained its beauty, fame, and a good reputation that inspired numerous international writers.   Despite its popularity, each table at Hafa offers a degree of privacy resulting in a sense of artistic freedom. The unique atmosphere inspired many artists, including Tennessee Williams, Paul Bowles, the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones.

Isabella Wang Rabat- Through the medium of photography, Moroccan artists have battled stereotypes and redefined what it means to be a Moroccan woman.  After the French conquest of Algeria, it was Delacroix who first ventured into North Africa and initiated the West’s artistic fascination with the region. With bright costumes and the deep warmth of the dark, earthy colors, wonder permeates his artwork. For in what was to him the unknown, he fantasized the orientalized myth of North Africa. Predicating his experiences upon the folk tales of Arabian nights, his paintings, including the iconic “Women of Algiers,” conjured the lands of Algeria and Morocco as one of exoticism, adventure, and the harem fantasy. Delacroix intended to reveal the lives of North African Muslim women behind the construct of their veil. Yet in so doing, he imposed upon them a sexualized and Westernized male gaze, whereby the languid poses and unbound clothing, alongside the tokenistic symbols of the hookah pipe and chambermaid, underpin an inaccurate oriental fantasy.  The distorted views propagated by Delacroix’ artistry have remained constant within the Western collective conscience. It has become the very crux of the monolithic perceptions of Morocco which pervade the discourse on the nation and, more specifically, Moroccan women.  Only a month ago, Rihanna’s makeup brand Fenty Beauty, which had been previously heralded for its diverse representation and inclusivity, played upon this orientalist myth. After releasing a new palette called “Moroccan Spice,” the subsequent advertising espoused a tokenistic amalgamation of Arab fusion music, shawl costumes, and desert settings, including a camel.  Such imagery embodies the exoticized Maghreb region, a testament to how perceptions of Morocco are misrepresented and reduced to one-dimensional tropes of Arab women.  Writing in Al Araby, British-Iraqi journalist Ruqaya Izzidien said, “The Moroccan Spice does nothing to acknowledge true Moroccan culture. Instead it cracks cheap puns that betrays Fenty’s lack of understanding or research on North Africa while benefiting from the on-trend Arabian imagery that clearly lacks any input by Moroccans.” The appropriative inaccuracies of Fenty Beauty’s fetishized and orientalized depictions of Morocco only embody the underlying problems with cultural perceptions of the country and its population.  Yet to dispel the inaccuracies and stereotypes, Moroccan photographers have harnessed their artwork to redefine what it truly means to be a Moroccan woman. Photography is a medium predicated on a paradox: in the authentic depiction of the photograph is a reflection of reality, yet underlying the art is its innately constructed nature.  In the balance between reality and representation, Moroccan photographers Hassan Hajjaj and Lalla Essaydi have featured the subject of real Moroccan women and embedded a network of cultural symbolism to explore the uneasy tension between the visual and the symbolic; appearance and reality; and preconceived perceptions of Moroccan women and the complex, multi-faceted identities behind such perceptions.  Their artwork creates a dialogue with the audience, confronting them with authentic, nuanced portrayals of Moroccan individuals while imposing a critique on how previous artistic discourse has constructed and imposed a false cultural identity on Morocco.  Lalla Essaydi’s art champions the Moroccan woman. She highlights the multi-faceted intricacies which have often been ignored or exoticized in the exploration of Moroccan female identity. Behind this diatribe is a deeply autobiographical quest.  Her photographs stem from the need to assert her personal voice as she grapples with what it was like to grow up as a female in Morocco. She stated, “In my art, I wish to present myself through multiple lenses—as artist, as Moroccan, as traditionalist, as Liberal, as Muslim.  In short, I invite viewers to resist stereotypes.” Moroccan photographer and street-wear artist Hassan Hajjaj was similarly displeased with depictions of Morocco; on fashion shoots in Morocco, he perceived that the scenery of the nation was exploited as a flat exotic backdrop for European models. His work thus embraces a playfulness and urban trendiness which embodies the life of Morocco beyond the perceptions of the exoticized and antiquated.  He commented on the decision behind his artwork, “I wanted to do something to present my own people who stand between the traditional and the modern. I wanted to represent my own friends.”   While Delacroix sought to “unveil” the women of the Maghreb region and propagated the belief of the veil as a construct imposed upon women, Essaydi and Hajjaj now embrace it. They redress the stereotypes and perceptions attached to the veil as a commentary on modern female identity in Morocco.  Lalla Essaydi’s photographic series “Les Femmes du Maroc” (The Women of Morocco) revisits the contentious locus of the harem and unravels the byzantine layers of meaning attached to the space. Within the harem, her subjects of real Moroccan women reclining while donning the veil and even the depiction of a chambermaid mimic and directly retort the orientalist gaze of artists such as Delacroix.  As a Muslim woman who had grown up in a harem before moving to Saudi Arabia, France, and the United States, Essaydi has profound insight into the complexities of cross-cultural identity politics. Yet, Morocco and the harem have remained intrinsic to her identity.  She recalls in an interview with Jadliyya, “My work is haunted by space, actual and metaphorical, remembered and constructed. My photographs grew out of the need I felt to document actual spaces, especially the space of my childhood.” Hence, integral to Essaydi’s photography is her exploration of the dichotomy between private and public space.  She notes, “Arab women traditionally occupy a private space, but wherever a woman is, when a man enters that space, he establishes it as public. This separation of public and private is testament to the power of women’s sexuality.” The powerful gaze of each subject to the camera is powerful and confronting. It challenges the audience’s preconceptions of Moroccan women, and emphasizes the voyeurism of the past Western gaze, which has disrupted and distorted the private space of Arab women.  For Essaydi, the veil becomes a corrective force against the disintegration of the public and private. Behind the veil, the woman retains her private space and dictates how she is viewed.  She is both empowered and subversive.  Hassan Hajjaj’s photographic presentation of the veil similarly evokes power. In his ongoing series “Kesh Angels,” his photography is rebellious yet playful. Hajjaj depicts female bikers wearing the hijab to debunk the monolithic representations of the West and showcase a subculture, which embodies the exuberance and complexities of Moroccan women.  The women in the series pose, wink, kick, lift, and run, all with irreverence and cheek. Their hijabs are marked by bright prints and sportswear logos, such as the iconic Nike tick, emphasizing the commonality and ubiquity of their experiences. In the cheerful, familiar, and bold, Hajjaj pokes fun at the West’s notion that Arab women are isolated and powerless.  In an interview with Dazed Digital, Hajjaj commented, “Firstly, the headscarf is not always religious. Now, in the west, it is always seen as such, but the origins of it are not solely Islamic. People are just reading into it and making their own assumptions of the work. For me, it is all very Moroccan with the bright colors and the strong patterns that play on busy textiles.” Yet, Moroccan female identity transcends the traditional symbols of the harem and the veil. To be a Moroccan woman is to embrace the vivacity and complexities of Moroccan culture itself.  Embedded within Essaydi’s artwork is the rich interplay of traditional artistic practices, representative of Moroccan culture. With her use of calligraphy, textiles, zellige tiling, and henna also comes their reinvention. Artistic reinvention provides a platform to assert her own voice and, by extension, to represent the evolving nature of Moroccan female identity.  Essaydi fuses Kufic calligraphy with the application of henna to create a poetic script, which sprawls across her female subjects’ bodies, clothing, and the spaces around them. The script features a stream of consciousness chronicle of the subjects’ and her own experiences as women, forging a platform for their own stories. It is a subversive act, which feminizes and reclaims what Essaydi posits in Islamic culture is a traditional male domain of writing and calligraphy. Yet, the script is also deliberately indecipherable.  For Essaydi, calligraphy transcends mere representation. It is a performative act; drawing upon the Amazigh beliefs that henna is a purifying rite which infuses the body with healing energy, the very act of inscribing in henna emphasizes the perpetual, and collaborative processes of becoming and creating.  It is thus in the amalgamation of masculine art forms and feminine henna, writing and imagery in which Essaydi dissolves the contradictions she perceives within her culture, contradictions between fluidity and hierarchy and between the richness and confining aspects of Islamic traditions. In an ode to the architectural masteries of Morocco, Essaydi incorporates the zellige technique from her setting, the harem quarters of the Dar al Basha palace in Marrakech, and transfers them to the very garments of her subject. In the mesmerizing and almost surreal melding of clothing and setting, Essaydi highlights that identity is inextricably linked to place.  In the past, the locus of the harem was one of isolation and concealment, yet also female solidarity. The changing dynamics of Moroccan households and, more generally, its culture, have made it possible for Essaydi to revel in its beauty and richness.  Morocco’s status on women has evolved vastly from the days of the secluded harem. Underpinning the isolation of the harem was the 1957 Mudawana, a personal status code based upon the Malikite school of Islamic law. It governed the status of Moroccan women in civil law, where women were treated as legal minors, deprived of the ability to deny marriage contracts and required to obey their husband in all matters.  In opposition to their lesser legal status, Moroccan women’s rights activists called for reforms.  Islamic feminist activists called for new readings of the Qur’anic texts and engaged in “ijtihad” reasoning (the process of deriving the laws of the Shariah from its sources) to counter the effect of Islamic fundamentalism, which they perceived to be present in the code. 2003 was a momentous year for change. In October, King Mohammed VI announced a draft family law in Moroccan Parliament, consulting women’s rights organizations during the process of drafting in order to assure the pertinence of the law.  In his address to the opening session of Morocco’s parliament, the King asked, “How can society achieve progress while women, who represent half the nation, see their rights violated and suffer as a result of injustice, violence and marginalization? The final text of the Mudawana reform was promulgated in 2004, securing women’s rights to self-guardianship, divorce, and child custody. A report from Freedom House outlined that the law “also placed new restrictions on polygamy, raised the legal age of marriage from 15 to 18, and made sexual harassment punishable by law.” The law was considered by the UK’s Overseas Development Institute (ODI) as “one of the most progressive in the Arab world.” It initiated women into Morocco’s political and religious discourse, while embodying the evolving and renewed perspectives on women in Morocco.  Inspired by the memories of his childhood, Hajjaj celebrates the vivacity of Moroccan identity. He imbues his shoots with movement and life: the energetic freedom of his subjects and the addition of live musicians and dancers verge upon performance art, reflecting the constant bustle of the medinas (walled cities). Compounded with this is the exuberance of color: the female subjects are dressed in jolts of color, posing against bright mats and geometric patterns which evoke the zellige of Moroccan architecture.  Further adding to the artistic mosaic, Hajjaj uses everyday household items from Moroccan corner grocers to frame his work. Ranging from Arabic Coca-Cola cans to butterfly matchbook and coconut milk containers, Hajjaj evocatively celebrates the life of the souk while also creating a Warhol-esque aesthetic. Playing upon the roots of pop art as a platform for irreverence and critique, Hajjaj humorously depicts the urbanism and consumer culture which is often overlooked in Western perceptions of Morocco.  Morocco has undoubtedly become globalized. Hajjaj serves to emphasize this fact in his work. The culmination of brands, ranging from Nike to Louis Vuitton, reflect the urban streetwear trends and the counterfeit culture which is integral to the shops of the Moroccan medinas. In fact, Hajjaj had turned down a collaboration deal with Louis Vuitton after the fashion company dictated that he would have to cease using counterfeit materials and incorporate authentic couture.  In an interview with L’officiel, he stated, “If I am using the real thing, it becomes more of a fashion shoot. When I shoot it’s about making the person look grand even if the whole setup costs $40.”  In the friction between counterfeit and couture, Hajjaj harkens back to his origins as a fashion photographer on the exoticized backdrop of Morocco. He now can assert his agency in critiquing the schism between the reality of Morocco and the West’s fantasies of it.  He debunks the cultural appropriation of the traditional discourse and instead celebrates the multi-faceted, paradoxical, and clashing identities which embody Moroccan identity: the amalgamation of religious tradition with modern consumerism, the customary with the urban, haute couture with hip-hop street style.  In the symbiosis between past and present, feminine and masculine, Arab, African, Amazigh, and French, Essaydi and Hajjaj uncover the multitudinous and byzantine facets which make up Moroccan female identity.

Rabat – Moroccan physicist Latifa Elouadrhiri was the first to measure how pressure is distributed inside a proton. This discovery made quite the impression internationally in the world of science.  Elouadrhiri and her colleagues at the American Jefferson Lab has opened up new fields of research to help solve the mysteries of the proton and the universe. In an article named “The pressure distribution inside the proton” published in American magazine “Nature,” the researches of the Moroccan scientist were revealed. The internatial proton that Elouadrhiri and her colleagues measured is the densest matter that scientists know of.  “Prior to the 90s, the only thing we could study is one-dimensional structure of the proton. And in the 90s there were developments of new formalism that enabled us to connect electromagnetic processes to do three-dimensional structure of the proton,” said Elouadrhiri during her interview with the magazine. “So what we have we been doing prior to the 90s and 00s, is like we want to study the heart, and we are studying it through electrography, which is the process of just recording electrical activity of the heart that give us one-dimensional structure that tells us lots about the heart, but not everything,” she added.  « Now with the heart, we have the medical 3D imaging technology that now allow the doctors to learn more in non-invasive manner, the structure of the heart. And this is what we want to do with the new generation of experiments, » added the researcher.  Latifa Elouadrhiri is a Senior Staff Scientist in Hall B. The Moroccan researcher did most of her studies at Mohamed V University in Rabat before moving to France where she received her Ph.D. from the University of Clermont- Ferrand in 1992 for research on the nucleon axial form factor. She came to Jefferson Lab in in 1994, and joined the Hall B staff in 2001.

The UN secretary-general’s personal envoy for Western Sahara has briefed the UN Security Council on the situation in Western Sahara. The personal envoy, Horst Kohler, expressed Wednesday his gratitude to the Moroccan authorities for facilitating his visit to the southern provinces and enabling him to have access to several people he wished to meet. He was also grateful he could witness directly the economic and social development of the region, according to state-owned news agency MAP. Several members of the council welcomed the atmosphere in which the regional tour of the personal envoy took place, particularly his visit to the Moroccan Sahara. The majority of the council members also expressed their satisfaction with the results of the various meetings and visits undertaken by the personal envoy. They called on Kohler to continue working with all parties to maintain the momentum and resume the process to find a solution to the conflict. In its Resolution 2414 of April 27, 2018, the Security Council called on neighboring states, including Algeria, to contribute to the political process and to engage further in the negotiations. UN observers said Moroccan authorities have always shown their full cooperation with the UN to relaunch the political process. MAP noted that many members of the Security Council emphasized, during Wednesday’s briefing, the need to tread carefully to relaunch negotiations in consultation with the parties, and in particular Morocco. Kohler’s Wednesday’s briefing emphatically called on all involved parties to make compromises to ease the way towards finding a lasting political settlement to the conflict in Western Sahara. Negotiations for a mutually acceptable solution hit a wall in 2008, and the Sahara issue has since then been locked in a diplomatic stalemate. A decade after the failed UN-led attempts at peace, Kohler suggested a resumption of negotiations in hopes of making up for the decade-long diplomatic failure. But in addition to the UN Security Council’s newfound resolve to finally commit all stakeholders—including Algeria—Kohler’s move comes at an especially propitious moment in continental politics. During the 31st AU Heads of State Summit on July 1 in Nouakchott, Mauritania, the continental organization unveiled its latest report on the Sahara question. The much-anticipated report acknowledged—for the first time—the prominence of the UN-led negotiation process in Western Sahara, pledging total allegiance to the UN Security Council’s agenda and priorities. It noted that Africa will no longer have a “parallel agenda” on Western Sahara, and the AU will limit its involvement in the conflict to “supporting and accompanying UN efforts.” Moroccan authorities, while nodding at Kohler’s resolve to resume peace talks, are adamant that Algeria take full part in negotiations. Rabat insists on the precondition of a comprehensive assessment of the discussions between the personal envoy and the parties in conflict during Kohler’s last regional tour. Calling for the need of a transparent, responsible, and peaceful dialogue to resume negotiations, Moroccan authorities also asserted that there can be no solution to the regional dispute over Western Sahara without consulting Morocco and without the involvement of Algeria, which they say is the main party responsible for the beginning and maintenance of the dispute.

Rabat- Emmanuel Macron is expected in Morocco at the end of summer to discuss EU migration crisis with Moroccan government officials. The French president will visit Morocco for the second time since his election in May 2017. In June 2017, Macron chose Morocco as his destination on his first trip to North Africa, emphasizing that the friendship and cooperation between Morocco and France will continue under his presidency. This time, Macron will come to Morocco in the midst of concerns over the numbers of irregular migrants arriving in France. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), some 119,000 Africans were arrested in 2017 attempting to enter the EU on migrant boats departing from Libya, compared to 23,000 total from both Algeria and Morocco to Spain. While the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean along eastern routes has decreased, the number crossing the sea from Morocco to Spain has tripled since 2015. Thousands of sub-Saharan Africans immigrate irregularly to Europe through Morocco annually. Over 1,000 migrants have died in the Mediterranean so far this year.   To prevent migration, the European Union announced a €55 million fund to assist Morocco and Tunisia in managing their borders.  Recently, European activists, politicians, and academics accused Morocco of using migrants as political bait to secure deals with European partners instead of restricting flows of irregular migration from its contiguous borders with the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. However, Moroccan authorities stopped more than 65,000 migration attempts in 2017, up from 32,000 the previous year, according to Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi.

Rabat – Approximately 5.1 million tourists visited Morocco in the first six months of 2018, up 10 percent from the same period in 2017. According to statistics from Morocco’s Tourism Observatory, the number of foreign tourist arrivals increased by 10 percent from the same period in 2017, while the arrival of Moroccans living abroad increased by 1 percent. Morocco registered a notable increase in the rate of tourist arrivals from Italy, up 18 percent; Germany, up 13 percent; France, up 10 percent; Holland, up 8 percent; the United Kingdom, up 7 percent; and Spain, up 6 percent. In overnight stays, Morocco’s hotels and guest house registered an increase of 10 percent in the first half of 2018, with an increase of 13 percent for non-resident tourists and 3 percent for residents. Marrakech and Agadir recorded 56 percent and 55 percent, respectively, increases in overnight stays. Casablanca also showed a notable increase of 56 percent in overnight stays. The country’s overall occupancy rate of classified hotels reached 44 percent.  Revenue generated from non-resident tourists in Morocco increased by 15.2 percent to reach MAD 31.2 billion at the end of June, up from MAD 27 billion a year earlier. An increasing number of Chinese tourists have visited Morocco since they were exempted from applying for visas in June 2016. Chinese passport holders are entitled to 90-day visas on arrival in Morocco. The Chinese People’s Daily noted that, since the start of visa exemption, Morocco has received a large number of Chinese tourists in all seasons. The newspaper added that, especially in the summer, “we can see the Chinese everywhere” across Morocco from north to south. According to the newspaper, approximately 120,000 Chinese tourists visited Morocco in the first five months of 2018. In 2017, 107,500 Chinese tourists arrived in Morocco, compared with 43,000 in 2016. The tourism sector is one of Morocco’s economic pillars, and the government aims to make the kingdom one of the top 20 destinations worldwide for China’s 500,000 tourists by 2020.

Rabat – Drama among the children of high officials has struck again.  The daughter of Ahmed Akhchichine, the leader of the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM) and president of the Marrakech-Safi region is facing justice.  Kenza Akhchichine, 18, was arrested after causing a traffic accident last Thursday, when she lost the control of her vehicle and hit an electric pole in the Hay Riad neighborhood of Rabat. She was driving her father’s government car without a driver’s license.  The Court of First Instance in Rabat decided to sue the young girl on Thursday, August 9 for “driving without a license” and “causing material damage to the public property.” The teenager is on temporary release.  Speaking to Arabic outlet Alyaoum 24, Larbi Mahrachi, a member of the PAM party, described the behavior as “wrong and unacceptable” and denounced Akhchichine’s reckless decision to lend his government vehicle to his teenage daughter.  The Moroccan Organization for the Protection of Public Funds demanded an investigation into the use of the vehicle. The same source added, “The daughter of Akhchichine was driving the subject of the incident without legal basis, and against all customs, laws, and in complete disregard of the royal instructions.” The incident stirred controversy on social media. Social media users blamed the PAM leader for “lack of parental authority,” and “irresponsibility” and “negligence,” and for spoiling his daughter too much. The incident may remind Moroccans of another case involving the child of a high official that made headlines causing controversy in Rabat: Hamza Derhem. The 26-year old is the son of the late Mohamed Derham, former managing director of Atlas Sahara and the nephew of Rkia Derhem, the secretary of state for foreign trade. The young man was arrested in April 2017 after uploading a video of himself driving under the influence of alcohol, taking selfies near his smashed Ferrari after crashing into three cars, while singing and making fun of police officers and other officials. He was released June 5, after spending a year and 14 days in the local jail of Sale.

Rabat – An Amnesty International report has accused EU policy of being “complicit” in the deaths of over 700 migrants. In a scathing report published on Wednesday, August 8, Amnesty said that European hostility towards migrants is to blame for hundreds of deaths at sea between June and July. Basing its figures on estimates from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), Amnesty indicated that 1,111 migrants died or went missing at sea between January and June this year. The death toll suddenly surged between June and July, however. Over 700 migrants died in this period alone, and Amnesty claimed that the EU’s “deadly policy” on migration during this time was the primary reason for the sudden surge in the number of deaths. The report especially denounced Europe’s hawkish policy on migration, including financial and logistical support for the Libyan coast guard.  ‘Horrific’ conditions in Libya The number of people living in “squalid” conditions in Libyan detention centers is a “deadly consequence” of the EU’s hostility towards migrants, according to Amnesty. “Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea,” as the report is titled, shed a light on the perilous journey that economic migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers from sub-Saharan Africa and the MENA region attempt at sea. The report claimed that European governments are complicit in the “appalling” and “reprehensible” treatment that migrants face when intercepted by the EU-funded and trained Libyan coast guard.   When they escape death at sea and are picked up by the Libyan coast guard, migrants are detained in “horrific” centers where they suffer torture and forced labor that sometimes end in death, the report alleged. Matteo de Bellis, an Amnesty researcher on asylum and migration, said: “Responsibility for the mounting death toll falls squarely on European governments who are more concerned with keeping people out than they are with saving lives.” “European governments are colluding with the Libyan authorities to contain migrants and refugees in Libya, despite the horrific abuses they face at the hand of the Libyan coastguard and in detention centers in Libya.” A ‘tragedy’ and a ‘shame’ Of Malta and Italy’s controversial decision to block the Acquaris, a rescue ship with more than 600 migrants on board, from docking in early June, Amnesty said that the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean is both a “tragedy” and a “shame.” According to the Guardian, the number of migrants detained in Libyan centers was 4,400 in March. By early July, IOM reported that the Libyan coast guard had brought 10,000 back to shore, but living conditions there keep deteriorating as migrants are victims of torture and physical abuse, aid agencies have said. “Despite this [situation in Libya], Italy and the EU are bolstering their policy of supporting the Libyan coast guard to ensure it prevents departures and carries out interceptions of refugees and migrants on the high seas in order to pull them back to Libya.” De Bellis called out Italy and Malta for their “callous refusal” to let rescue vessels dock at their ports. “Desperate people have been left stranded at sea with insufficient food, water, and shelter,” he said. “On top of this, the Italian and Maltese authorities have smeared, intimidated, and criminalized the NGOs that try to save lives at sea, refused their boats permission to disembark and even impounded them. These serious incidents must be promptly and adequately investigated—they highlight the deadly consequences of Europe’s policies.”

Rabat – A report by Spain’s interior ministry has notably included Morocco among countries sending an “alarming” number of undocumented migrants to Spain. The report, which assessed the number of illegal attempts at migration to Spain since early 2016, revealed that Moroccans are among the most-represented nationals in the scramble for Europe. According to Spain’s official estimates, 10,104 undocumented Moroccans arrived in Spain between 2016 and 2018. The Spanish Ministry of Interior also indicated that more than 250,000 undocumented Moroccans are currently living in Spain, with close to 5,000 identified as “unaccompanied minors.” The figures put Morocco at the top of the countries with the most undocumented nationals living in Spain or crossing to other EU countries through Spain. According to Spanish authorities, Moroccans accounted for 17 percent of the over 20,000 migrants who reached Spanish coasts between January and July this year.  There were 3,403 Moroccans in this year’s “concerning” flow of undocumented migrants that reached Spain. The North African country was followed by Guinea (2,712), Mali (2,217), Côte d’Ivoire (1,116), and Gambia (1,031). Although “alarming,” this year’s numbers attest to a decrease in the scale of successful attempts to reach Europe. In 2017, Morocco again led the dance of successful crossings to Spain. Last year, 5,391 Moroccans made it to Spain, followed by 5,200 Algerians, 4,267 Guineans, and 2,845 Gambians.  The figures come at a time of heightened concern about Europe’s ability to absorb the large number of migrants and asylum seekers arriving at its shores. But there is also a growing climate of concern in certain Europe quarters about Morocco’s role in protecting Europe’s external borders from the flow of irregular migration. EU suspicion Earlier this week, a number of European politicians, academics, and activists raised red flags regarding Morocco’s role in Europe’s migration policy. They cast doubt on Morocco’s recent actions, telling Euronews on August 7 that the North African country may have let more migrants cross to Spain to force Europe into making deals. “Traditionally, the Moroccan state security forces squeeze or raise their hands depending on the circumstance,” Gonzalo Fanjul, an investigator at Spain-based PorCausa Foundation, said of Morocco’s alleged political manipulation of migration control to Europe. “One of the elements that make us think that this is a factor is that among the flows that are coming there are many Moroccans, and these immigrants are not displaced from Libya.” Economic hardship in Morocco Others have dismissed claims that the increase in numbers reaching Spain was a deliberate move by Morocco to compel the EU into signing deals with Rabat. They instead argued that socio-economic hardship in some of the kingdom’s regions is such that authorities are overwhelmed by the increasing number of economically distressed Moroccan youth who dream of reaching Europe, too. Mohamed Daadaoui, a specialist of North African politics at Oklahoma City University, said that recent uprisings in Morocco showed Moroccan authorities’ “inability to cope with the sheer range of socio-economic needs of the Moroccan youth.” “Moroccan youth are all too eager to take the risk of crossing [to Europe] given the dire socio-economic situation in Morocco. Their prospects for jobs and economic empowerment have not improved, especially in the Northern part of the country.”

Rabat – Zinedine Machach is following in Adel Taarabt’s footsteps.  The Moroccan football player is making headlines again for the wrong reasons. The 22-year-old got himself in trouble with his club after fighting with two of his teammates.  The incident occurred during training Tuesday, August 7. According to Italian outlet Gazzetta di Modena, Machach could be dismissed from his loan at Carpi (Serie B), three weeks after he was loaned by Naples where he signed a 4.5 year contract in January.  The Italian club has not yet given a disciplinary sanction to the player, choosing not to comment on the incident.   Machach’s behaviour reminds fans of another Moroccan football player: Adel Taarabt. The 29-year-old midfielder had trouble getting along with his teammates in multiple clubs. He also had the bad habit of leaving the field during games.  Machach has built himself quite the bad boy reputation. In the fall of 2017, the Atlas Lion assaulted Denis Zanko, coach of the Toulouse reserve team, for whom he was playing at the time. Toulouse fired him for his behavior. Machach quickly rebounded, joining Naples in January 2018. However, just months after his arrival in Italy, the player was accused of assaulting a doctor after he blocked Machach’s car.  Troubles aside, Machach has already decided on his international career. Earlier this year, Herve Renard convinced the Moroccan-Algerian to join the Moroccan national football team. Born in France to a Moroccan father and an Algerian mother, the young footballer began his youth career with AS Cannes and Olympique Marseille before signing with Toulouse in 2014.

Rabat- The judicial police opened an investigation on Tuesday after a 30-year-old woman fell from a 10th floor apartment window and died.  The woman’s fall from a building at Hay Mohammadi in Agadir raised questions post-observation. The initial on-site observation of the body revealed the woman had died on the spot according to a statement released by the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN).  Due to the unclear nature of the incident, police pursed an investigation which revealed the woman had spent the previous night intoxicated in the company of three other people. One woman and two other men aged 30 to 32 were with the deceased and were arrested in a state of emergency.  The owner of the apartment was brought in for questioning as well. The four suspects are being held by the judicial police as subjects of the investigation.  The nature of the fall is yet to be determined, but it is evident the judicial police have not yet ruled the case accidental.

Rabat – The minor accident caused more fear than harm.  A Royal Air Maroc plane’s wing hit a Turkish Airlines plane’s tail at Istanbul’s Ataturk International Airport while on the ground. No injuries were reported and both aircraft were only slightly damaged. According to Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, the accident caused slight damage to the right wing of RAM’s Boeing 787 (CN-RGT) and also damaged the Turkish plane.  The Moroccan aircraft was supposed to take off from Istanbul to Casablanca. The airliner was close to the tail of a Turkish Boeing 777 that was parked near a terminal and was preparing to accommodate passengers for a flight to Athens. Passengers on the Turkish airplane were transferred to on another plane.

By Anna Schaeffer Rabat – In a Facebook post, 19-year-old Hilel Garmi declared his refusal to fight for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), acting in civil disobedience. His conscription into the IDF hovered at the end of July. However, during the unarmed demonstrations near the Gaza strip earlier this year, Garmi read writings by protest leader Ahmed Abu Ratima that made him reconsider his nearing entrance to the Israeli army. “I was impressed to discover these people who prefer unarmed alternatives to address the question of the situation between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River,” Garmi wrote. “Like them, I believe in civil disobedience to underline the illegitimacy of our regime.” Both his older brother and two sisters joined the army; as a child, the mandatory two years and eight months of service “in an elite unit” seemed not only inevitable but fascinating for Garmi. “But growing up, and being convinced that all human beings are equal, I changed my mind,” read his August 5 Facebook post. “I do not believe in the existence of a common denominator between Jews that made them different from Arabs. I do not see why I should be treated differently as a child of Gaza or Jenin. And I do not think that the suffering or joy are more important for some than for others.” Garmi said he asked himself why three million inhabitants of the West Bank and East Jerusalem have lived under military occupation for over a century and why two million Gazans suffer under a 10-year-long military siege. “Who gave Israel the right to manage the life of these five million human beings? To decide their right to drive, import, export, fish, to have electricity? To be able to arrest them at any time?” The teenager staunchly declared his position against participating in “a regime so anti-democratic,” especially with Israel’s daily actions taken against the Palestinian people. “There is a red line that we cannot cross, and for me this is insurmountable.” He wrote that his decision to make the declaration public on Facebook was directly tied to his belief in civil disobedience leading the way for social change by appealing to the sense of justice for the most privileged individuals in Israel. “If the Gaza protesters have the courage to do so, I feel the obligation and the power, as a person born on the side of those who hold the power, to engage equally in this way.”

Rabat – German luxury automaker BMW will recall over 323,700 cars across Europe due to a malfunction in the exhaust gas recirculation module. After numerous BMW car engines caught fire in South Korea, prompting a South Korean government investigation and backlash from customers, BMW spokesperson Kim Hyo-Joon offered his sincere apologies to the government and consumers. “We offer our sincere apology with our heads down for causing concern and anxiety among customers, the public and the government due to recent fire accidents,” Kim said in a press conference in Seoul on Wednesday, August 8. “We also offer a sincere apology to customers who suffered the latest fire accidents.” BMW said that it will launch a recall of more than 100,000 diesel vehicles in South Korea alone, mostly the 520d sedans.  Similar cases have been reported in numerous European countries. In Germany 96,300 will be recalled, as well as 75,000 units in the UK, 23,500 in France, and 24,000 in Italy. The malfunction in the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) module that was initially aimed at reducing emissions from diesel engines, was revealed two years after the first cars caught fire.  The company’s Korean customers expressed anger because BMW knew of the problems, and they urged the government to open an investigation into BMW’s alleged delay in announcing a recall. The recall, expected to begin on August 20, aims to fix all issues related to the EGR that generated excessive sediment and caused fire. However, according to South Korean media, all BMWs including those with a gasoline engine, are prevented from entering parking garages for fear they will cause a fire. BMW says that it has not yet determined the cost of the recall as it will first examine how many cars require to be fixed. The German giant is the second most popular luxury car in South Korea after Mercedes. It sold more than 59,624 vehicles in South Korea this year, according to the Korea Automobile Importers and Distributors Association.

This does not sound good for Tariq Ramadan. Rabat – The Islamic scholar’s desire to get out of prison has been denied again. Ramadan was hoping for release, especially after the story of one of his alleged victims, Henda Ayari, was contradicted by wedding pictures.  According to AFP, the Court of Appeals in Paris confirmed on Wednesday, August 8, the rejection of the second application for release of Tariq Ramadan, who has been held in custody for six months. In support of the request, the defense once again invoked the Swiss academic’s deteriorating health, in reference to the multiple sclerosis he has had since 2006. The judges, however, had on two occasions, in February and April, estimated that the medical treatment he was receiving in detention was adequate. According to his lawyers, Ramadan’s health deteriorated upon his arrival at the Fleury-Mérogis Prison in Paris. The 55-year-old Islamic scholar was indicted in February for rape, including that of a “vulnerable person.” At the end of October, two women filed a complaint against the professsor, whom they accused of having raped them. One accused him of having raped and beaten her during their only meeting in a hotel in Lyon in 2009 and the second accused him of having abused her in a hotel in Paris in 2012. However, the first complainant’s story was contradicted in July by her brother, who showed investigators pictures of her celebrating his wedding on the night she claimed to have been raped. In June, a third woman filed a complaint against the Islamic scholar with a similar story. If the charges are confirmed, the scholar will face up to 15 years in prison on the charge of rape, and up to 20 years on the separate charge of rape of a vulnerable person, since the second complainant is disabled.

By Zanetti Carlo Rabat – Zeineb, a 40-year-old Tunisian woman, and Sergio, her Italian fiancé, are fighting a bureaucratic battle to get married in Tunisia. The couple decided to wed back in June and had prepared all the necessary documentation for the legal procedure. Unfortunately, they have not been able to find any notary in Hammamet, a coastal town 65 kilometers southeast of Tunis, willing to marry them so far. The hang up is that Sergio is not a Muslim. Religious principles in most Muslim-majority countries prevent a non-Muslim man from marrying a Muslim woman, unless the man decides to convert to Islam. Under the initiative of Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi, since 2017 the law of Tunisia has officially allowed interreligious legal unions, a revolutionary act in the history of the country and of Islam. However, since the Tunisian legal code is still being revised to abide with the country’s 2014 constitution, it is unclear whether private notaries are legally obliged to marry all interreligious couples. Notaries appear to be motivated by religious principles, which were the law of the land until last year. In response, human rights groups have demanded that the new law be applied more strictly and efficiently.  The Tunisian Association for The Rights of Minorities said in a statement that the Justice Ministry should take “strong action against those who do not apply the law”. Yamina Thabet, the group’s president, told AFP that the ministry should “force all notaries to apply the law” and blamed some legal professionals who are “putting their religious conviction before the law.” Situations like Zeineb and Sergio’s show how easily the introduction of “progressive” laws, to quote Tunisian MP Rym Mahjoub, might clash with religious and cultural identity in Muslim-majority countries.  Sometimes, the strive for enhancing international reputation leads governments to pass laws that do not reflect problems that might arise from their social contextualization. Although, especially after the country’s 2011 revolution, Tunisia has been considered one of the most progressive countries in the Arab world, campaigners say that civil society is still ideologically torn between conservative and progressive forces. In Morocco, according to the 2011 constitution, a Muslim man may marry a Christian or Jewish woman, but a Muslim woman can only marry a Muslim man.

Rabat – Following the recent free trade agreement allowing imports of US poultry, Morocco’s agriculture ministry stated its conditions on poultry imports. Imports of poultry meat and poultry products from the US concern only frozen products and must be accompanied by a halal slaughter certificate and a health certificate, the Ministry of Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries said Tuesday, August 7, in a statement. The US Trade Representative (USTR) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced on August 7 that the Moroccan government had agreed “to allow commercial imports of U.S. poultry meat and products into Morocco for the first time.” The ministry indicated that the agreement is not new. It is a follow-up of the implementation of the free trade agreement (FTA) between Morocco and the US signed June 15, 2004, and effective since January 1, 2006. The Moroccan department of agriculture and the USTR reached an agreement in May on the content of the health certificate which must accompany any poultry imports from the US, according to the statement. The Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice Monday, July 6, for interested importers of US poultry meat and poultry products. Poultry must have a certificate to certify that the animals were slaughtered in accordance with Islamic halal religious requirements.  According to the ministry’s notice, the poultry must also have a health certificate in “accord with a valid model provided by mutual agreement between the Moroccan National Health Security Office of Food (ONSSA) and the competent US authorities.” The ministry also set specific regulations for labelling and packaging. Bulk packaging of imported poultry should be labelled with a halal logo on the outside of the box. As for retail packaging, each bundle must be packaged separately and labeled with a halal logo placed by the production facility of origin. The imports will be subject to tariff rate quotas (TRQs) which entered into effect July 6. The ministry specified that certain quantities of US imported poultry and poultry products will benefit from preferential tariff advantages until December 31, 2018. “The concerned TRQs will be distributed according to the principle of first come first served (PVPS), borne by the Administration of Customs and Indirect Taxes (ADII).” The total quantity of chickens and turkeys subject to tariff advantages is limited to 2,450 tons while the quantity of poultry thighs and wings is fixed at 6,400 tons. For other poultry meat, which are “frozen and boned but not mechanically boned,” the total quantity is limited to 135 tons. All mentioned quantities will have a preferential rate of 0 percent in accordance with the “first come first served” principle. For quota-free imports, the preferential tariff is 82 percent for chickens and turkeys and other poultry meats, and 106 percent for poultry thighs and wings.

Rabat – The Staffordshire bull terrier, the American Staffordshire bull terrier, the pit bull, the mastiff, the boerboel, and the tosa inu are no longer welcome.  The ministries of the interior and of agriculture finalized the law prohibiting the dangerous dog breeds from being imported, trained, possessed, adopted, or exported, as announced in the official government gazette on August 6. The text came into force following its publication.  To implement the law, the government has defined a dangerous dog as “any dog that by its race or morphology is characterized by dangerous ferocity to humans.” Any offender is liable to pay a fine of up to MAD 20,000 and serve a six-month prison sentence. Previously, the acquisition, importation, and breeding of some mastiffs and dogs was not regulated.  What does the law say? The breed-specific legislation, passed in August 2013, seeks to “protect people against the danger of dogs” and clamp down on the owners of aggressive dog breeds.  However, the law does not apply to “dogs used by members of the police force when carrying out their missions.” The law was Morocco’s first legislation seeking to tackle the problem of people being bitten by dogs. If a dog belonging to a dangerous breed is found, the police can seize and euthanize it. The owners of banned dogs without record of biting are required to present their dogs to veterinary services by September 6.  Criminal purposes  More than 10,000 cases of people being bitten by dogs are registered each year, as well as deaths, especially by dogs used for criminal purposes.  These dogs are supposedly used by criminals for illegal purposes such as assault, robbery, rape, and fighting, and by drug dealers seeking to protect themselves or repel inspectors of the narcotics brigade. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, large numbers of the dogs were imported from Europe on the black market. Many came from France, especially after France introduced a law on dangerous dogs in 1999. In reality, the acquisition of a “dangerous” dog is not affordable for many. For example, a pit bull can cost between MAD 2,000 and MAD 5,000. A rottweiler can cost between MAD 5,000 and MAD 10,000. What about the non-dangerous dogs?  For other dogs not on the banned list, the owner should declare them to the competent authority and make sure they hold a health record and rabies vaccination.  It is preferable for owners to keep their dogs on a leash, muzzle them in public, and prevent them from rummaging through garbage cans.  Trade in livestock is subject to authorization. Dogs must be in good condition, maintain certain breed characteristics, and receive veterinarian approval.

Rabat – Morocco’s ambassador to Chile has ignited controversy for inviting an Iranian diplomat to the Moroccan embassy in Santiago.  Ambassador Kenza El Ghali extended official invitation letters to a number of diplomatic representations to attend a cultural event Monday, August 6, at the Moroccan embassy in Santiago. El Ghali controversially included the ambassador of Iran among her invitees, apparently ignoring the fact that Morocco cut diplomatic ties with Tehran in May.  The Iranian ambassador, Abolfazl Khazaee Torshizi, “readily accepted the offer and was spotted at the Moroccan embassy in the VIP row,” Al Akhbar reported today. According Al Akhbar, the event was significant as it was “an international congress on cultural diplomacy organized by Morocco.”  The congress was themed “Cultural Diplomacy as a Bridge for Dialogue between Civilizations.” Hosts at the Moroccan embassy in Santiago celebrated culture and underlined its importance in the diplomacy of fast-moving global affairs. At the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, however, El Ghali’s move did not sit well with officials, and she was harshly rebuked for it, Al Akhbar’s source asserted. When asked about her motives for inviting the Iranian ambassador, El Ghali reportedly said that she did not know of the diplomatic rift between Rabat and Tehran.  Some Moroccans trolled El Ghali, expressing disbelief at “her ignorance of Morocco’s stance” on a serious diplomatic issue. Others requested that she be sacked from her post. “This is the sort of things that happen when we appoint high officials based on party-affiliation, rather than on competence in their supposed area of expertise,” one online commenter said. Morocco severed diplomatic ties with Iran over Iran’s support—through Hezbollah—for the Polisario Front, the separatist movement calling for independence in Western Sahara.  “We have strong and indisputable proof, including names and specific incidents, that indicate that Hezbollah is logistically and strategically supporting the Polisario Front,” Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s foreign affairs minister, said at the time.

By Dil Bola Rabat – Saudi Arabia has declared plans to withdraw funding for Saudi students in Canada after officially suspending Saudia flights to Toronto. In response to the Canadian critique of Saudi Arabia’s human-rights record, young and ambitious Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman was quick to act: expelling the Canadian ambassador and subsequently withdrawing the Saudi envoy from Ottawa. The kingdom’s brash foreign policy moves continued as the Saudis ordered an official suspension of all Saudia, also known as Saudi Arabian Airlines, flights to Toronto on Monday, August 6, coupled with the ordered withdrawal of Saudi international students studying at Canadian universities. Over 15,000 Saudi students currently attend Canadian universities; accompanied family members bring the number to more than 20,000 Saudis associated with universities in the country. The withdrawal would consist of these students and their hefty tuition funds being shifted to other universities in countries with similar education systems, such as the UK or the US. Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign affairs minister, initiated the diplomatic feud after reprimanding the Saudi government’s crackdown on civil society and women’s rights activists on Twitter last Thursday, August 2. Her statements were corroborated by Lynn Maalouf, the Amnesty International Middle East research director, who continued her support of the Canadian government with several subsequent tweets. The Saudi foreign minister labelled the criticisms as “blatant interference” in the kingdom’s domestic affairs as the arrests were lawful and considered Freeland’s statements not only negative but “unfounded” as well. The official Twitter account of Canada’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded by expressing their grave concerns, urging the Saudi government to “immediately release” the activists. From then on, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia began taking direct action against the country; the suspension of “all new business and investment transactions” and the expulsion of diplomats were just the beginning. In terms of the impact on the Canadian economy, it is evident there will be a significant decline in respect to the loss of tuition and living expenses. International students attending major schools such as McGill University in Montreal can pay up to CAD 30,000 (MAD 216,587) for tuition. Adding living expenses, money spent on each student can reach up to CAD 80,000 (MAD 577,567). What is more pressing is the controversial and incomplete CAD 12 billion arms deal permitting the export and sale of light armored vehicles equipped with machine guns and canons. The Trudeau government has been widely criticized for issuing export permits allowing Canadian corporations to pursue the deal, and the negativity had already led to a chill in Saudi-Canadian relations. Freeland remained unapologetic in her response on each problematic aspect of the situation after the Saudis’ bold statements on Monday. She affirmed the Canadian “embassy is still in place in Saudi Arabia” and asserted Saudi Arabia’s education decision was “a shame for those students.” In terms of the arms deal, she remained unsure on how the situation would affect the deal: “We’re waiting for answers on how Saudi Arabia intends to go forward with the relationship.”

By Anna Schaeffer Rabat – Even though it tests an acceptable number of women annually, Morocco’s Breast Cancer Screening Program comes “up short.” The France-based International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) issued an evaluation on stage distribution and quality of life and compared survival rates between screen-detected and self-reported breast cancer patients in the kingdom.  Dr. Pathu Basu led the IARC branch Early Detection and Prevention Section in partnership with the Lalla Salma Foundation for Cancer Prevention and Treatment to evaluate major Moroccan oncology centers.  The screening program comes “up short in terms of the cancer detection rate even though the rate of annual screening coverage achieved was acceptable,” Basu said.  Although 60 percent of the yearly target population in the kingdom received screening tests, detection rate for cancer measures far below where it should be. In fact, cancer detection may be as low as 1 in 1,000 women, a figure far below average; in comparison, mammography-based screening in Europe measures approximately 6 in 1,000 while the US reports 5 in 1,000. The disparity leads researchers to believe many cases of breast cancer are going undetected. Breast cancer ranked first in female cancer in Morocco in 2015, constituting 36.1 percent of cases. Female breast cancer prevalence stands relatively low in Morocco compared to Western countries but evidence suggests rising numbers.  In 2015, 1.1 million women received a screening, covering just under 63 percent of the target population and surpassing the acceptable standard level of 60 percent. The figure grew to 1.5 million in 2016.  The two years marked 3.2 and 5.2 percent, respectively, for clinical breast exam positivity, measuring far below the expected range of 10 to 13 percent. According to Basu and his colleagues, the key issue in the kingdom’s breast cancer screening lies in the means of detection. Morocco uses clinical breast exam-based screening in place of mammograms, a technology whose relatively expensive cost and complex implementation decrease its accessibility to less-developed nations. The country launched its cancer screening program in 2010 for women aged between 40 and 69.  Trained nurses, midwives, and general practitioners perform clinical breast exams at primary health centers—each of which receive an annual target number of women to test—to determine which women should then move to early detection centers. Twenty-seven early detection centers offer breast ultrasound, core biopsy, surgical consultation, digital mammography, and fine-needle aspiration cytology. However, through the process of data collection, interviews, randomly-selected site visits, and focus group discussions, Basu and his colleagues identified crucial elements missing from the system. A “mechanism to identify and invite the eligible women individually” does not exist. Although politically supported, well-documented, and structured intelligently, the program remains opportunistic: women in need of services may need to elect to receive a test themselves.  Additionally, potential cases are simply missed due to screening age.  “It is possible that the opportunistic program is screening a proportionately higher number of younger women, and the elderly women with much higher risk of breast cancer are being left out,” said the study.  The average age for testing hovers at about 49.5, 10 years older than the average in Western medicine. Age matters in early detection of cancer; by decreasing screening age, the program may lower positive predictive values of detection tests and also decrease the detection rate for breast cancer. Efficiency goes down and costs go up. Basu and his colleagues developed a series of solutions following the evaluation: digital data collection, age-based analysis, and regular monitoring. Stratification of age groups, a suggestion outlined in the report, divides detection rates into categories for more effective assessment. In addition, breast screening program can gather data from oncology centers and population-based cancer registries to “document the stage shift achieved through screening.” The research team indicated, however, that data collection alone is not enough. “The performance of the program in terms of inputs and outcomes should be monitored and evaluated, and specific actions need to be taken to fill in the gaps identified during evaluation,” the authors wrote. The “gaps” mentioned by the study include a lack of adequate structured training and public knowledge.  “[Clinical breast exam] positivity should be regularly monitored across [health centers] and either too high or low values would necessitate retraining of the service providers.” “Basu’s group looked into the program policy, protocol and financing, community mobilization efforts, quality and performance of the screening and the diagnostic services, referral mechanisms, training of service providers, and the current practices on program monitoring and coordination,” wrote Rebekah Moan for medical imaging community website AuntMinnie. This comprehensive, systematic program evaluation demonstrated how to “identify the gaps and create the opportunity to implement corrective measures for improving the program outcomes,” according to its authors. “The experience will be useful for other developing countries implementing clinical breast exam-based breast cancer screening programs.” “The Moroccan experience also highlights that effective program leadership, a written standard operating procedure of data collection for program monitoring, appropriate coordination between different service delivery settings, meticulous maintenance of paper-based records, and orientation of the service providers to the importance of proper record-keeping can help collect performance data even in absence of a computerized information system from a mass-scale screening program in a developing country.” According to the report, the Moroccan Ministry of Health has already taken steps to introduce the computerized database at the cancer early detection centers around the kingdom.

Rabat – Has irregular immigration become political bait used by Morocco to secure deals and gain concessions from partners? The EU and Morocco have given the impression in recent weeks that they have finally bridged their differences regarding Morocco’s role in the organization’s migration policy and the appropriate amount of financial means to curb the flow of undocumented migrants to Europe.  Following a series of negotiations and reportedly hot discussions in late July, the EU announced a €55 million fund to assist Morocco and Tunisia in stemming the migration flow. In Brussels, however, suspicion about “Moroccan politicking” has far from faded as many European politicians and experts have qualms about Rabat’s intentions.  In some circles, the suspicion has even shifted to certainty: “Morocco may have relaxed migration controls into Europe as leverage in key negotiations with Brussels,” Euronews reported on August 7.  The outlet claimed that, in the heat of the EU migration crisis in recent months, EU governments and partner countries—mainly from North Africa—were apparently engaged in a no-holds-barred contest where every shot was meant to make a point. Quoting multiple European politicians and academics as well as a Moroccan professor, Euronews claimed that Morocco “may have” used the migration card to showcase its importance in protecting Europe’s external borders. Morocco allegedly resorted to relaxing controls at its contiguous borders with the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla to force the EU’s hand on both the EU-Morocco migration deal and the recently sealed EU-Morocco fisheries agreement, experts told the outlet. Gonzalo Fazul, an investigator at porCausa, the foundation which is believed to have spurred the suspicion of Morocco, said that the information is highly credible because there were many Moroccans among the migrants who recently crossed to Europe.  He suggested that Moroccan security forces traditionally act “depending on the circumstances,” a hint that in the past few weeks Moroccan border patrols allowed people to cross instead of preventing the large flows that Spain recently witnessed. “It is more difficult to say with absolute certainty, but several observers I trust suggest that Morocco, as it has done in the past, is using [migration] as part of the negotiation on very sensitive issues such as the fisheries agreement, or in the negotiation of the aid that the EU will give the country to manage these [migration] flows.” ‘No evidence’ But while rumors of Morocco’s laxity make the rounds in a number of European circles, the EU Commission is apparently adamant about the partnership with its North African ally. An EU Commission spokeswoman said that there is currently no evidence to back the claim that Morocco is using migrants as leverage.  Others claimed that while it is possible that Rabat “blackmailed” the EU in recent months, the situation is more complex than simple Moroccan “politicking.” They argued that the recent increase in numbers crossing to Europe may be due to the country’s own rampant unemployment issues or the overwhelming number of sub-Saharan migrants fleeing other parts of North Africa— predominantly Libya and Algeria—to try their chance in a supposedly more welcoming Morocco. Francesca Fabbri, a Morocco expert at the European Policy Centre, said that while “Morocco has relaxed border controls for political leverage in the past,” recent developments do not suggest such a move from Rabat.  She said that Morocco is presently keen to improve relations with its partners in Europe and Africa, and “it is against Moroccan interest to have the message spread that it is easy to pass from there to Europe.” What is Morocco’s position? Although Moroccan authorities have not responded to the “politicking “and “blackmail” rumors, similar developments in late July stimulated a firm answer from Rabat, with the Moroccan government strongly denying an increase in the number of migrants who have crossed from Morocco. Mustapha El Khalfi, the Moroccan government’s spokesperson, said last week that while Morocco is “doing its best and alone” to secure Europe’s external borders, some in the EU still doubt the kingdom’s commitment to the alliance and downplay the effort and resources the country has invested in recent years to keep its part of the bargain. Insisting that the number of thwarted migration attempts “has doubled this year,” El Khalfi called on Brussels to acknowledge Morocco’s commitment by cutting a deal that ensures that the financial compensation from the EU “matches the kingdom’s efforts.”

Rabat – Morocco’s position in the UN’s e-Government Survey has fallen by 25 places, now ranked 110th globally among 193 countries. The e-government development index (EGDI) measures the readiness and capacity of national institutions to use information and communication technologies (ICTs) to deliver public services. Morocco has fallen 25 places since 2016 and 28 places since 2014. While Morocco’s current EGDI score has plateaued, it improved gradually in the years leading up to 2016, but not as fast as in some other countries. The kingdom’s score is currently 0.51, but was 0.52 (85th globally) in 2016, 0.51 (82nd) in 2014, 0.42 (120th) in 2012, and 0.33 (126th) in 2010. The 2018 survey shows that 40 countries registered a very high level in EGDI compared to only 10 countries in 2003, and 29 countries in 2016. The world current average of EGDI on a scale of 0 to 1, rose from 0.47 in 2014 to 0.55 in 2018. The survey notes that despite development and major investment, the 14 countries with low EGDI are African and belong to the least developed countries. According to the survey, European countries lead in e-government development, while American and Asian countries share almost equal levels in EGDI. The top 10 leading countries in EGDI are Denmark, Australia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, Singapore, New Zealand, France, and Japan. In the Middle East region, the UAE came first with a high level of EGDI established at 0.82 (21st globally), followed by Bahrain with 0.81 (26th globally), Kuwait with 0.73 (41st globally), Qatar with 0.713 (51st globally), Saudi Arabia with 0.711 (52nd globally), Oman with 0.68 (63rd globally), Jordan with 0.554 (98th globally), and Lebanon with 0.553 (99th globally). In Africa, Mauritius tops the list, with a high level of EGDI of 0.667 (66th globally), followed by South Africa with 0.661 (68th globally), Tunisia with 0.62 (80th globally), Seychelles with 0.61 (83rd globally), Ghana with 0.53 (101st globally), and Morocco takes 6th with 0.52 (110th globally). Three African countries bottomed the list: South Sudan, Niger, and Somalia. Many people in these countries are unable to benefit from ICTs because of poor connectivity, high cost of access, and lacking the necessary skills.  In order to build a well-functioning e-government, countries need to strengthen investments in developing human capital and telecommunication infrastructure.

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat – Mount Zerhoun’s conservators invite tourists to come admire the ancient site of Volubilis, located north of Meknes.  Volubilis, the abandoned ancient capital of Rome’s Mauretania-Tingitana province, has been accumulating hundreds of thousands of visitors and has in recent years expanded to include a new museum and visitor center. In 1997, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) evaluated the site and released a statement saying that “some of the reconstructions, such as those on the triumphal arch, the capitolium, and the oil-pressing workshop, are radical and at the limit of currently accepted practice.” Nevertheless, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) unanimously agreed that the site was “an exceptionally well preserved example of a large Roman colonial town on the fringes of the Empire.” Volubilis, known in Arabic as “Oualili,” has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1997, and many of its artifacts are on display at the Rabat Archaeological Museum. History in brief In the 3rd century BC, Volubilis was an Amazigh settlement, but it became the capital of the Kingdom of Mauretania under Roman rule during the 1st century AD. The Romans greatly expanded the city during the 2nd century, adding a basilica, temple, and triumphal arch. Plentiful olive trees helped Volubilis prosper, as evidenced by the city’s large houses with fine mosaic flooring. Around 285 AD, local tribes overtook Volubilis, and Rome did not attempt to recapture it, deeming the area too remote and vulnerable. For the following 700 years, the city was still inhabited; first by Latinised Christians, then by a Muslim group. In the 8th century, Idris ibn Abdallah (founder of the Idrisid dynasty and the Moroccan state) chose the city for his seat of power. But in the 11th century the seat of power was transferred to Fez, and the population relocated to Moulay Idriss, located about 5 kilometers outside of Volubilis, leaving the city abandoned. The city’s buildings remained largely preserved until an earthquake in the mid-18th century. Moroccan rulers also pillaged in search of stones to build Meknes. In the second half of the 19th century, both during and after French occupation, Volubilis was partially excavated and identified as an ancient Roman city. Since then, prominent buildings, high-status houses, and mosaics have been restored.  Archaeologists estimate that at any point in time, the greatest population in Volubilis was 15,000.

Rabat – Is Moroccan international football player Manuel Da Costa leaving the Turkish League?  The summer mercato (transfer window) continues for Moroccan football players as the French league keeps on enrolling Atlas Lions. This time, it’s Istanbul’s Basaksehir defender Da Costa who is linked with France’s Reims. According to French outlet France Football, the French club, which is looking for experienced executives to strengthen its team, thinks that the 32-year-old football player will fit perfectly with the club’s needs. Da Costa is currently negotiating with the president of Reims.  The French-Moroccan-Portuguese footballer, who played in the last World Cup with Morocco, has solid experience. Da Costa was vice-champion of Turkey in his last season with Istanbul Basaksehir. The defender, who trained in Nancy, has already played in Italy (with Fiorentina and Sampdoria of Genoa), the Netherlands (with PSV Eindhoven), England (with West Ham) and even Russia (with Lokomotiv Moscow). He also played for the Greek championship between 2015 and 2017 at the Olympiakos.  Da Costa had a hard choice to make when it came to choosing the country he wanted to play for. Born in France to a Moroccan mother and a Portuguese father, the Atlas Lion was eligible for the three different selections, but he finally chose Morocco. He played with the under-21 selection of Portugal and France before opting for the Atlas Lions under Badou Zaki. Da Costa’s first match as a Lion took place on May 23, 2014, when Morocco won a match against Mozambique (4-0). He scored his first goal with the selection on March 27 of the same year, during a match against Uzbekistan. Since then, Manuel da Costa has been vice-captain of the Lions in many games.

Rabat – A joint Spanish-Moroccan security collaboration resulted in the arrest of a Moroccan national in Spain with alleged ties to ISIS. The Spanish national police arrested a 21-year-old Moroccan individual on Tuesday, July 7, at a gas station in Vitoria, in northern Spain, El Pais reported. The suspect was accused of recruiting and indoctrinating people to join a terrorist organization. According to El Correo, the Moroccan national used audio-visual material to incite an individual to commit attacks in Spain. The Spanish outlet quoted police resources as saying, “In fact, it was Morocco which put the Spanish security forces on alert.” Following the North African country’s warning, the suspect “was subject to discreet surveillance.” The Interior Ministry later reported in a statement that the man was known for belonging “to radical circles of jihadist ideology in Algeciras,” where he usually resided. According to Europa Press, the Spanish interior ministry stressed that “the cooperation between Spain and Morocco and the constant alert of both countries is fruitful in operations that allow the deactivation of this type of threat on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar.” According to police investigations, the suspect was in contact with another individual who was arrested late last year in Morocco. Their ultimate goal was to commit attacks. Not the first arrest in Vitoria The Spanish police have collaborated often with Moroccan authorities to arrest Moroccan nationals allegedly linked to terrorist groups. In February 2017, Spanish police arrested a 41-year-old Moroccan man, also in Vitoria, on suspicion of links to ISIS. A 36-year-old Spanish woman was arrested in Alicante on the same day. In the same month, Spanish authorities arrested two Moroccan nationals aged 25 and 27 in Barcelona. They were convicted of supporting ISIS financially through illegal activities. In March 2017, the Spanish interior ministry announced the arrest of three Moroccans in Roda de Ter, eastern Spain. The suspects were accused of inciting jihadists to carry out terrorist acts on social media.

Rabat – Over 200 Kenyans and Americans gathered together Tuesday to in solidarity, remember the 20th anniversary of the 1998 US Eembassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya. The crowd congregated at August 7th Memorial Park in Nairobi, built on the original site of the US eEmbassy in Kenya. On August 7, 1998, Al-Qaeda targeted the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania with simultaneous truck bomb explosions. In both attacks combined, 258 people lost their lives. Nearly 5,000 were injured.  The deadly day in 1998 marked eight years since US troops, near the beginning of the Persian Gulf War, arrived in Saudi Arabia. It also marked the first major Aal- Qaeda attack in history, the publicized debut of the terrorist group responsible for killing thousands of civilians and fellow Muslims. Remembering August 7 At Nairobi’s commemorative event, singers performed both the Kenyan and American national anthems. Participants held candles, listening to the names of victims read aloud.  Of the approximately 200 guests at, many had survived the 1998 attack or lost close relatives to the bombs. Thaddeus Mutiiria Nyaga’s son, Emmanuel, lost his life August 7, 1998. “We forgive those who hurt us, but we may not forget,” Nyaga said. “Let’s pray for them to change their mind so that we can live happily together.” At the memorial event, US Ambassador Robert Godec spoke about the moment when “twenty years ago today, evil showed its terrible face in Kenya and Tanzania.” “The terrorists really sought to divide us. They sought to divide Kenyans and Americans. They sought to attack civilization. And they failed.” Who is Aal -Qaeda? Their name means “The Base” or “The Foundation.” Composed of Sunni Muslim militants, Aal- Qaeda stretches across multiple nations, with territorial control in Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. Believing in an alliance between Jews and Christians to dismantle Islam, the organization holds a staunch anti-JewishSemitic position. Al -Qaeda ascribes to interpretations of the Qur’an that condone killing non-combatants and stands in opposition to “man-made” laws, instead advocating for absolute sSharia law. Currently leading the organization is Ayman al-Zawahiri, who assumed his position following the 2011 death of Osama bin Laden. In recent years, the focus of anti-terror efforts has turned to the Levant and ( ISIS) rather than aAl- Qaeda.  Kenya still suffers the effects of al-Qaeda’s terrorism in east Africa from al-Shabab, affiliated with Al Qaeda. In 2013, al-Shabab’sthe Westgate Mall attack killed 67, and in al-Shabab’sthe 2015 Garissa University attack the 147 people killed were mostly students.  Additionally, Kenyans affected by the 1998 bombing still wait for compensation from the US, as the nation had compensated US citizen embassy employees. Kenyan victims’ association spokesman Douglas Sidialo lost his sight in the 1998 attack. “You have to ask, do they care about the dreams and aspirations of the survivors? The unity the ambassador is talking about is a fallacy.”  Attorney Philip Musolino, based in Washington, D.C., currently represents 538 victims of the attack hoping for compensation. Kenya’s Director of Counter-Terrorism Martin Kimani acknowledged the threat and past scars of terrorism during a speech at the August 7 gathering, but asserted, “Our country has taken giant strides to prepare better to be more ready, and part of that readiness is our cooperation with our friends.” Hope for a future for peace At August 7th Memorial Park in Nairobi, a Peace Memorial Museum honors the victims of the 1998 Al al-Qaeda attack, as well as those who survived to tell of the national tragedy. It seeks to tell their stories, educate the public on terrorism and its consequences, and teach its visitors the value of peace and reconciliation. Their mission statement reads: “By the end of the museum tour it is hoped that each person will be inspired to support peace.” By Anna Schaeffer

Rabat – A violent storm hit Ourika Valley, 90 kilometers from Marrakech, causing floods and damage to many merchants and restaurateurs.  According to local media, the storm hit Monday night, August 6, causing the Ourika river to overflow, instantly creating landslides in the village of Sti Fadma and other areas.  Local authorities rushed to the scene and urged people to leave high-risk areas. The people of Sti Fadma, a village 60 kilometers south of Marrakech, have been on alert with sirens alerting visitors to take precautions and move away from the edges of the river. Ourika Valley often experiences floods in the summer. In 1995, flash floods in the valley caused the deaths of at least 100 Moroccans and foreigners.

Rabat- Horst Kohler will run a meeting today at the UN Security Council to discuss developments in the region. Kohler, the UN Secretary General’s Personal Envoy for Western Sahara, will present his first briefing on the situation in the region since the adoption of the UN’s Resolution 2414 on April 27. The resolution extended the mandate of MINURSO’s mission until October 31, 2018, and called for a “realistic, practicable and enduring” political solution to the conflict. The meeting is also set to revive negotiations between Morocco and Polisario and discuss the future of MINURSO’s mandate. Kohler will brief the council about his 10-day tour of the region from June 23 to July 1, including his visit to the regional human rights commissions’ headquarters in the Western Saharan cities of Laayoune and Dakhla in southern Morocco The envoy’s tour was aimed at monitoring progress in the region with regard to human rights in the wake of reforms Morocco initiated. Kohler displayed satisfaction with his tour: “I am satisfied with this visit during which I met many people and visited different places,” he told the state-owned news, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), at his departure from Hassan I Airport in Laayoune at the end of his visit. Kohler’s visit came after a series of controversial actions by the Polisario Front in the restricted region. On May 20, Polisario carried out a parade east of Morocco’s defense wall to celebrate the “45th anniversary of its armed struggle,” a move the Moroccan government considered a violation of the resolution just a few weeks after its adoption. Morocco strongly denounced the destabilizing maneuver as a defiance of the 1991 ceasefire agreement between the kingdom and Polisario and of Resolution 2414.

Rabat – DGSN will rejuvenate its leadership by appointing younger commanding officers to several units across Morocco. Al Ahdath Al Magrhibia reported today that the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) is planning a general structural overhaul to rejuvenate the body’s hierarchy and make it more dynamic and efficient in meeting the challenges of a complex and shifting world.  Many young officers are set to be appointed to leadership positions in the coming weeks. The newspaper said that the appointees will be officially announced on the eve of Youth Day, which will be celebrated on August 21. While responding to the King’s recent appeal that promotions in all sectors should be both inclusive—regardless of age and socio-economic status—and be based on merit and dedication, the DGSN envisions pumping “more fresh life” in its commanding body by honoring and acknowledging the services of some its dedicated young officers. The structural overhaul is also said to be a required by the new security apparatus Morocco has adopted in recent years. Morocco has been equipping its anti-terrorism elite units with the latest technology and state-of-the-art intelligence equipment since the appointment of Abdellatif Hamouchi as head of DGSN and the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST) in 2015. There is a need for younger and more technologically savvy commanding officers to effectively monitor and use Morocco’s modernized anti-terrorism umbrella. On April 24, King Mohammed VI inaugurated the Institute for Specialized Training, a DGSN-DGST affiliated training center to prepare Morocco’s elite police and intelligence units in communication decoding, interception operations, and criminal investigations.  DGSN, which has been described by international observers as “Morocco’s FBI,” has been largely successful in its fight against domestic and transnational terrorism, gaining Morocco an established reputation as the most stable country in North Africa.

Rabat – The Moroccan government will intervene to regulate private schools’ tuition, a government source has alleged. The government has finally decided to “to besiege private school sharks” by “legally intervening” to uphold parents’ rights and mitigate the “financial distress” caused by what it deems excessive and constantly changing school fees, according to a government source quoted by Assabah today. The government claimed to be sensitive and sympathetic towards the hardships and “distress” that Moroccan households experience when they pay for their children’s education.  According to the source, the move aims to regulate the “unreasonable” price fluctuations in education-related costs, including annual courses fees, registration and re-registration fees, and social insurance fees charged by private schools for each enrolled student.  Monitoring price changes The source noted, however, that government intervention is not aimed at dictating pricing boundaries and rules, as schools provide different services in line with required fees. Instead, the government will intervene to ensure a “constant pricing scale” and similar fees on certain education-related services, while at the same time preserving schools’ freedom to fix their own fees. At the start of the 2018-2019 academic year in September, the government will allegedly request pricing designs from each private school.  According to Assabah, the government’s rationale is to achieve the expected “constant pricing scale” by limiting sudden increases in school fees. (A school that tells the government that it is charging MAD 100 for registration in 2018 would know that it cannot tell the government next year that the same fee has suddenly jumped to MAD 200.) Curbing social inequalities Also mentioned in the report is the government’s intention to further decrease parents’ burden by supporting a percentage of their expenditures on education.  While the move has not been officially announced, a source told Assabah that the government is planning to help parents’ in their education-related expenses by introducing the income tax law (IGR) as used in the real estate sector.  In line with Morocco’s fiscal law and based on their net incomes, the potential move will ensure that households are reimbursed a certain percentage of the income spent on the education of their children. The government’s move is a direct response to the central bank’s annual report on 2017. The report indicated that private education costs increased by 40 percent in the last 10 years. Whereas other commodity prices increased by 15 percent between 2007 and 2017, education-related costs jumped by 44 percent, affecting Moroccan household’s financial wellbeing and deepening social inequalities.  By intervening to regulate pricing in private schools and bear part of the financial burden, the government hopes to bridge social inequalities by ensuring higher education levels among children from low-income backgrounds, government sources indicated. Could there be unintended consequences? While some believe the government’s concern with high tuition fees should be encouraged, critics may raise serious concerns regarding negative side effects. Cushioning tuition fees may deepen the socio-economic disparities that the move aims to curb in the first place, because only those with the means to send their children to private schools will receive the benefits.  Subjecting private schools to a rigorous “constant pricing scale” may discourage them from investing in upgrading curriculum and teaching quality, such as purchasing state-of-the-art course materials or hiring more qualified teaching staff. Perhaps a more sensible government intervention in the education sector would be to invest more in public schools.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Equipment, Transport, Logistics, and Water Abdelkader Amara has replaced the recently dismissed minister of economy and finance. Morocco’s King Mohammed VI sacked Mohamed Boussaid from his position as minister of economy and finance on August 1. The government’s spokesperson refused to give any details behind the King’s decision. In accordance with royal decree No. 1.17.07, issued on April 7, 2017, concerning the appointment of government members, the King relieved Boussaid, of the National Rally of Independents (RNI) party from his ministerial duties and assigned Amara, of the Development and Justice (PJD) party, to take over the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Both decisions came following consultation with the head of government, and the appointment was published on the Moroccan official gazette on August 6. According to the royal cabinet’s statement, the decision to dismiss Boussaid is part of “efforts for accountability and holding authorities to responsibility,” which the King attempts to apply to all officials “regardless of their status and affiliations.” Abdelkader Amara Amara was born January 28, 1962, in Bouarfa, in the far eastern Figuig province. In 1986, he obtained a PhD from Hassan II Agricultural and Veterinary Institute of Rabat. Since then, he was professor at the Agricultural and Veterinary Institute Hassan II of Rabat until 2002. Amara held the position of minister of industry, trade, and new technologies from January 2012 to October 2013. He then became minister of energy, mines, water, and environment, a position he held from 2013 to 2016. King Mohammed VI appointed Amara as minister of equipment, transport, logistics, and water on April 5, 2017. According to the ministry of equipment, Amara oversaw many projects, including the establishment of Bombardier in Morocco and the launch of Renault Tangier’s second production line. He also developed and implemented structural reforms in the energy and mining sectors, particularly a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project and the reform of artisanal mining activity. Amara was behind the creation of the Nuclear and Radiological Safety and Security Agency and the Electricity Regulatory Agency. On the political level, Amara is a founding member of the PJD party and was the first vice-president of the PJD group to the first Chamber in charge of Communication. He is also a founding member of the association of Moroccan parliamentarians against corruption. Why was Boussaid sacked? The government spokesperson has not revealed any specific information concerning Boussaid’s dismissal, saying that “he has nothing to add to the Royal Cabinet’s statement.” According to Lesiteinfo, Boussaid travelled with his family to Marbella in Spain just a few hours after the King announced he had discharged Boussaid from his duties. Boussaid refused to comment to Lesiteinfo: “I’m very busy and I’m not going to talk about this issue.” According to speculations, King Mohammed VI fired Boussaid as a “follow-up” to the 2017 political earthquake when he sacked four ministers for irregularities in development projects in Al Hoceima. Boussaid’s dismissal can also be referred to the recent report on Morocco’s economic situation which Ahmed Jouahri, governor of Morocco’s central bank, presented to the King on July 29. Jouahri stated that investment is still limited in Morocco despite incentives. As for the business climate in Morocco, Jouahri affirmed that some constitutional institutions are not performing their functions as expected to provide convenient conditions for investment and creating job opportunities. “The two sectors are suffering stagnation because of delay in some constitutional institutions’ decision-making.” Jouahri also said there are enduring social disparities, especially in rural areas, despite social and economic programs, namely the National Initiative for Human Development’s programs. Mohammed Boussaid Boussaid was born in September 1961. He became minister of economy and finance in 2013. The King re-appointed him to the same position on April 5, 2017. In 1986, Boussaid earned a degree in engineering from the École des Ponts ParisTech (ENPC) in Paris. In 2004, he was appointed Minister of Public Sector Modernization and in October 2007, Minister of Tourism and Handicraft. In March 2010, Boussaid was appointed governor of Morocco’s southern Souss-Massa-Draa region. A former minister of RNI told Telquel that Aziz Akhannouch, minister of agriculture, was behind Boussaid’s appointment. “Thanks to Aziz Akhannouch [Boussaid] could make a comeback as governor of Souss-Massa-Daraa region, the stronghold of Akhannouch.” In May 2012, Boussaid became governor of the Prefecture of Casablanca.

Rabat – Usain Bolt is turning his career around. After breaking world sprinting records, the Jamaican now wants to break records in football.  The 31-year-old athlete scored a try-out with the Australian club Central Coast Mariners, the club said Tuesday in a statement. “The agreement between the Central Coast Mariners and Usain Bolt does not guarantee a professional playing contract but does provide the eight-time Olympic gold medallist with an opportunity to achieve his burning desire to play football professionally,” added the club.  We’re set to welcome @usainbolt to @CCMariners for an indefinite training period. Let’s hear from the world’s fastest man. Read more ? https://t.co/kOtlPUPWz8 #CCMFC pic.twitter.com/LsSxYLSbhl — Central Coast Mariners (@CCMariners) August 7, 2018  In a video shared by the Australian club, the Olympic champion said that he was really looking forward to coming to Australia. “It’s my dream to become a professional footballer and I know it will take a lot of hard work and training to reach the level necessary to play and make an impact in A-League.” On the club’s website, Mariners CEO Shaun Mielekamp spoke about the champion’s integration process. “His training program is structured to see if he can reach a level of play that would allow him to have a pro contract.” He continued, “It may take three weeks, but also three months, or six, or maybe even more time, who knows, time will tell.” The Jamaican tried to launch his career as a professional footballer by performing a two-day test at Borussia Dortmund, training in southern France’s Saint-Jean-Beaulieu. Bolt also played a friendly match with the Norwegian club Stromsgodset and played a charity match at Old Trafford. In June, he played in the FIFA team against the “98” France team during a game when France’s 1998 champions came together to remember their 20-year-old World Cup win.  Usain Bolt ended his running career in in 2017 because of an injury coupled with losing the men’s 4×100 relay race during the World Athletics Championships in London. The race was the last in Bolt’s marvelous career in which he became the most decorated sprinter with 22 medals in the Olympics and World Championships, 19 of them gold.

Rabat – Morocco’s bid to join ECOWAS is facing “serious obstacles” and may take years to materialize, according to Fitch Solutions. The analysis, which was published on August 2 by Fitch Solutions, argued that despite Morocco’s newfound diplomatic assertiveness on the African continent, Morocco’s attempt to join one of the continent’s foremost economic unions, is being held back by “significant hurdles.” While it is no secret that Morocco’s readmission to the African Union (AU) in early 2017 indicated a strong geopolitical shift in the kingdom’s diplomatic ambitions and economic aspirations, regional rivalry is likely to get in the kingdom’s way, the report said. “Morocco’s bid to join the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is another clear indicator of the country’s ambition to broaden its economic relations and become a trade hub between Europe and Africa.” The report underlined Morocco’s recent Africa-oriented foreign policy, explaining that since its readmission to the AU in early 2017, Morocco has shown signs of “increasingly turning its gaze away from Europe” to focus more on the vast trade and investment opportunities on its home continent. When it comes to the kingdom’s ECOWAS ambition, however, Fitch Solutions warned: “We note that signi?cant obstacles to accession remain, due to both political and economic concerns, particularly from Nigeria. This implies that membership is likely years rather than months away, and may ultimately be blocked entirely.” Bold African presence Morocco’s presence in sub-Saharan Africa’s trade and investments landscape reached a record high in 2017 as a result of King Mohammed VI’s numerous working and official visits to a number of sub-Saharan countries.  Morocco’s “Africa-bound exports hit 8.8 percent of its total exports in 2017, up from 5 percent a decade previously,” and Moroccan investments in Africa also rose impressively during the same period.  According to the report, the upward trend has been maintained by Morocco’s readmission to the AU and its boldness to sustain regional and continental influence.  Africa alone accounted for 77.5 percent of Morocco’s foreign investments, with the banking and telecommunications sectors leading the dance. Attijariwafa Bank, for example, “had 476 branches in sub-Saharan Africa in 2016, up from 322 in 2011.” In terms of agriculture, Morocco has been using its rich phosphates and fertilizers industry to boost and accompany agricultural productivity in a number of ECOWAS countries, including, among others, Nigeria, Mali, Senegal, Guinea, and Côte d’Ivoire. The Nigerian factor For all of Morocco’s efforts to showcase itself to ECOWAS member states as a growth driver and an indispensable investor and commercial partner, accession to the regional organization is “far from certain.” And while many ECOWAS member states fear that Morocco’s membership would create enormous and sudden economic shocks—rapid inflows of EU goods, for instance—which many members’ economies are not yet ready to deal with, Nigeria’s hostility towards the Moroccan bid is expected to play an important role in delaying or altogether refusing Morocco’s application. Nigeria’s disapproval has both political and economic dimensions, the report argued. The West African federation is by far the leading economy in the regional body, and many in Nigeria allegedly fear that admitting Morocco would pose serious challenges to Nigeria’s regional influence. On economic grounds, Nigerian manufacturers and business leaders are also said to be lobbying the Nigerian government to oppose Morocco’s bid. They argue that, in addition to upsetting the regional power balance in terms of political influence, Morocco, given its rising manufacturing sector, would greatly undermine Nigerian interests.  But it is no secret that President Buhari of Nigeria and King Mohammed VI are on fist-bumping terms, and Fitch Solutions’ report comes at a time when Rabat and Abuja have taken remarkable steps to cement their warming bilateral ties.  During President Buhari’s most recent visit to Morocco in June, Nigeria and Morocco signed a cooperation agreement on agricultural and vocational training, and—most importantly—President Buhari and Mohammed VI signed the final text of an offshore/onshore gas pipeline project agreed in December 2016.  The 6,500-kilometer pipeline is set to cross many ECOWAS member states and may play a crucial role in pushing for further political and economic integration and softening the stance of a number of hardliners inside the regional body.

Rabat – Spanish far-left party Podemos has voiced its disapproval of Spain’s migration control policy and agreements with Morocco. Quoted by Spanish news agency Europa Press, Ionne Belarra, Podemos’ deputy speaker in the Congress of Deputies, urged Sanchez’s cabinet to solve migration problems with its own means, saying, “Having Morocco playing the role of a watchdog to our borders might have negative consequences. It would be a mistake for a democratic country like ours.” She continued, “You cannot export [border control] to countries where human rights are violated.” The rhetoric comes after current Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez of the left-wing Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party urged the European Union to grant Morocco more aid to manage its borders.  Podemos, in opposition, considers it an error for Spain to let Morocco influence the way migration on the southern border is managed, growing suspicious of the agreement. Belarra said that Morocco could use the migration crisis to “blackmail” Spain.   Podemos has always been very critical of Morocco, particularly calling for a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara.  Indeed, last Friday, August 3, a group of deputies from Podemos, the Basque Nationalist Party, the Republican Left of Catalonia, the Compromise Coalition, and Bildu from the Basque Country United asked the government not to accept the new fisheries agreement between the European Commission and Morocco. They considered the agreement, which enables European fishing boats to work off Morocco’s coasts in exchange for compensation, in disrespect of the EU Court of Justice’s ruling that the waters off Western Sahara should not be included in the deal. Proposing alternative solutions On behalf of Podemos, Belarra has proposed alternative solutions to Spain’s border control agreements. Belarra has called for the government to focus its priority on “articulating legal and safe entry ways to our country.”  Belara’s proposal arises from the dangers of migration from the south, where many migrants resort to jumping the border fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla or take precarious vessels across the Mediterranean, “risking their lives at sea.” The 6-meter-high razor wire fences which separate Ceuta and Melilla from Morocco has been a contentious issue. The fences were first introduced in 2005, but removed 2 years later when a Senegalese national died while attempting to climb the fence.  However, in 2013, Spain’s former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of the People’s Party reinstated the fences.  The fence area has become a dangerous place where migrants have used quicklime, feces, and flamethrowers against the border guards in attempts to jump the fence.   Consequently, the government permits Spanish border guards in Ceuta and Melilla to send migrants back to Morocco. Only last year on October 3 did the European Court of Human Rights condemn Spain for its deportation of migrants to Morocco. The Rajoy government appealed the ruling and awaits a verdict this coming October.   In parliament, Belarra referenced the complications which migrants face: “It is not possible to get a visa from any African country and it cannot be requested in the embassies of third world countries. That is the basic problem. People have to migrate irregularly because there is no way to migrate legally, and in that the government of Pedro Sánchez should be focused.”  In particular, she emphasized the need for investment in the Asylum Migration and Integration Fund (FAMI) in order to provide a “decent welcome” for migrants, instead of “spending it in Foreigners Detention Centers (CIE) and in greater repression and border control.”  She added, “That could be done immediately and would help resolve the situation we are in.” By Isabella Wang

Rabat – From July 30 to August 5, 27 people were killed and 2,000 others injured in 1,466 urban traffic accidents. In a statement, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said the accidents were mainly due to loss of control of vehicles, failing to yield, excessive speeding, and pedestrian and driver errors. Of the many injured by vehicular accidents last week, the DGSN noted that 82 suffered severe injuries. Over 6,308 records have been transmitted to the Department of Public Prosecution; 3,169 vehicles have been detained; and 3,085 car registration documents were withdrawn. The statement added that national police issued a total of 22,439 tickets. The sum of fines paid by road traffic violators stood at MAD 3,669,275.

Rabat – Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal announced Tuesday on Twitter that he has acquired a 2.3 percent share in Snapchat.
 Bin Talal, who said the deal was made May 25, initially met Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and the company’s chief strategy officer Imran Khan, in 2015. The investment in the social media platform cost the Saudi prince $250 million at an average cost of $11 per share. “Snapchat is one of the most innovative social media platforms in the world and we believe it has only just begun to scratch the surface of its true potential and we are blessed to be part of it,” Prince Alwaleed said in a statement. The announcement came at the same time Snap released its second-quarter financial results. It posted a big loss and reported that its number of daily active users has dropped for the first time since it went public in March 2017. After the report, Snap shares rose as much as 11 percent. Prince Alwaleed’s investment in Snap is not his first social media buy. He previously bought shares in Twitter. Prince Alwaleed will not have a say in the management of Snapchat, however, because the class A shares that he acquired do not include the right to vote on business matters.  Alwaleed Bin Talal is a member of the Saudi royal family, and was a top official arrested for alleged corruption. He was released after reaching a financial settlement estimated at $6 billion with the Saudi attorney general

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat- We have all heard of the most popular tourist destinations in Morocco—Marrakech, Fez, the Sahara, Casablanca, Tangier, Rabat, Chefchaouen, Essaouira…. But what if you are working or studying abroad in Morocco for a period of months or even years? What are some of the overlooked locations and activities to do in Morocco when you run out of other options?  Oualidia is a coastal village 170 kilometers southwest of Casablanca, next to a beautiful protected, natural lagoon.  It is a lesser known location famous for its seafood—especially its oysters. Oualidia is also truly one of Morocco’s most beautiful areas for surfing and kayaking. With the help of a guide, you can kayak your way through the region’s scenic lagoon.  Oualidia is more of a quick weekend getaway or a relaxation destination. Outdoor activities (the beach, water sports, exploring) are its primary features. Also consider taking a tour of the oystery to better understand the mechanism of one of the city’s major exports. Note: If you’re not a fan of the outdoors, pass this one by. English speakers in this region are harder to come by. Even if you are not a “horse junkie,” this is not an experience to be missed. Skhirat (located about 25 minutes south of Rabat by train) has some wonderful beaches, and for a small price, you can take a lovely tour of them on horseback. Club Equestre Oued Ykem is highly recommended. They cater to all levels, take good care of their horses, and also send a guide along with you in case you have trouble managing your horse. The ride costs MAD 100 an hour, and horses are available beginning at 3:30 p.m.  Note: You do not need reservations to ride, but you must communicate in Darija (Moroccan Arabic) or French. The staff do not speak English. Lastly, specify your level of riding if you are looking for more than a leisurely pace. Day trip to Ourika Valley The valley contains various Amazigh villages located approximately 60 kilometers southeast of Marrakech. There are a lovely set of gardens along with an elevated cafe and many hiking opportunities to see the valley. You will find some of the cheapest argan oil in the valley, and some of the Amazigh village markets offer handicrafts and jewelry that are harder to come by in other cities or are more expensive than buying them from the source. The locals are incredibly interactive and friendly.  Note: As with most other locations, be aware that you will have to bargain, as tourists may be quoted higher prices. Additionally, note that English speakers are few to none and that most of the Amazigh in this region speak a language of their own, not Darija or French.  Ifrane provides a nice break from the heat of Morocco. It is located in the Middle Atlas Mountains and has cooler temperatures. Visitors say that the architecture style and landscape is more evocative of Switzerland than of Morocco. Ifrane is definitely a unique location to see a “different” side of Morocco. Although the town has a relaxing atmosphere and can be fun to visit all-year round, the best time to go is in the winter, when there is snow and skiing opportunities. The town is most famous for its independent and reputable university “Al Akhawayn,” which teaches its courses in English and aims to give students an “American liberal arts” experience. Note: You need a student to accompany you if you wish to access the university.  Asilah is situated about 31 kilometers south of Tangier. Like Tangier, Asilah was formerly occupied by the Phoenicians, and it was part of “Spanish Morocco” from 1912 to 1956. Asilah is lesser known and smaller than Tangier, but it is worth taking a stop there to appreciate some of its beautiful architecture. Asilah is also a bit like Essaouira’s smaller, calmer cousin—a small seaside location with a low population. Asilah hosts a weekly Thursday market and annual music and art festivals, including a mural-painting festival. There is also a yearly International Festival held in August which features both jazz and Moroccan music.  Located in an Amazigh region, this hotel and park combination is not to be missed. It is situated just 30 minutes outside of Marrakech at the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. The park offers a wide variety of activities including horseback riding, archery, Amazigh arts and crafts, a zipline, swimming, and all-terrain mountain biking. You do not have to be a resident of the hotel to visit the park, and activities are priced individually, usually ranging from MAD 100 to 200 per 30 minutes to 1 hour of an activity. This location is popular with native Moroccans for a fun day and highly recommended.  Chances are that if you are a foreigner in Rabat you will at least have heard about this place. Docked in the water next to Rabat’s kasbah (fortress), the bar offers various alcoholic beverages and dining options. Chill under the sails on deck or go below at night to listen to the music. Note: As the menu can be a bit more expensive, the boat is recommended for drinks after dinner over a dinner option. There are better restaurant options in Rabat. The Amal Center is a non-profit organization that trains disadvantaged women between the ages of 18 and 35 so that they can find jobs, achieve socio-economic stability, and support themselves and their families. The center is a great place to spend some time volunteering. Even if you are busy and do not have time to actively volunteer, you can support the center just by choosing to eat at the restaurant or by taking a one-time cooking class. The American Fondouk is a non-profit organization that treats working equines for free in order to help out both the animals and their families.  Visitors are welcome and advised to come in the morning. Staff will take you on a tour to see the animals and to observe the treatment of the animals, as well as interactions between the owners and their animals. The center offers internships and on-site housing to medical students. Animal welfare in Morocco is not afforded as much of a priority as other issues. If you are staying a long time in Morocco, you may notice a higher reliance on donkeys, mules, and horses than in your native country. To see some of the issues the equines face, the poorer families they serve, and the people fighting to improve their conditions is truly enlightening.  If you have time to spare, consider checking out the various plays, ballet, and both musical and cinematic performances at the National Mohammed V Theater. Performances include Shakespearean plays and operas!

By Chase Lacy Rabat- Israel and Turkey have had relatively stable relations since the creation of Israel. There have been some areas of tension, such as Israeli support for Kurdish independence, a hot topic because of Turkey’s large Kurdish population in its southern regions that seek independence. Israel has been angered by the fact that Turkey has supported Palestine’s Hamas and allows them to operate offices on Turkish soil. Turkish President Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) reportedly has ties with Hamas, and Israel suspects Erdogan loyalists have warmed to Iranian officials.  Relations became especially strained after the 2010 slaying of 10 Turkish activists on the ship Mavi Mamara. The ship was part of a flotilla attempting to break through the Israeli naval blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian aid. Israeli commandos boarded the ship, and in the ensuing conflict, shot and killed 10 activists. Turkey cut ties with Israel in response to the event, and tensions heightened again during the 2014 Gaza War, but in 2016 both countries undertook a diplomatic rapprochement. Israel apologized for the Mavi Mamara event and agreed to pay the families of the victims $20 million. In exchange, Turkey dismissed arrest warrants for the Israeli military officers and soldiers involved. However, the remaining obstacles to rapprochement were Israel’s Gaza siege and Hamas offices operating in Turkey.   Turkey eventually relinquished its demand for Israel to lift the Gaza siege, and Israel allowed Turkey to conduct construction projects in Gaza if materials went through the port at Ashdod for inspection. On the other hand Israel agreed to allow Hamas government officials in Turkey to continue operations, however Turkey (reluctantly, as they do not label Hamas as a terror organization) expelled officials of Hamas’ military wing, the al-Qassam brigades. In the past Turkey and Israel signed military training and defense industrial cooperation agreements, and Turkey permitted Israeli pilots to conduct training operations within Turkish airspace. Turkey has even purportedly allowed Israel to use its territory for surveillance and intelligence on Syria and Iran.  The author by no means claims the two countries are friends. However, despite the tensions that have made headlines in recent years, economic trade between the countries has remained strong with some exceptions, such as a dip in Israeli tourism to Turkey during the aftermath of the Mavi Mamara debacle.  Turkish-Israeli trade has been valued in billions of US dollars for years, especially since they have an investment agreement, a free trade agreement, and a treaty to avoid double taxation signed in 1996. Both are also members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  Trade reached a total of $4.3 billion in 2017, with Turkish exports—cars, metals, machinery, and textiles—to Israel reaching $2.9 million. Imports of primarily chemicals and refined oil from Israel totalled $1.4 billion.  In one sense, Syria’s bloody and brutal civil war has been advantageous for Israel, because it has become a throughway for Turkish exports destined for Jordan. Goods previously passed through Syria, but the situation has become too dangerous for freight drivers to use their old routes. While most trade has been redirected to pass through Egypt, some has been redirected through Israel’s port at Haifa. From Haifa, trucks will drive to Jordan. Turkish Airlines is the second largest carrier in Israel, only behind Israel’s national carrier El Al. Turkish Airlines transported over 1 million passengers to and from Israel in 2017. Economic ties extend also to a lucrative gas deal Israel and Turkey are seeking to ink. The plan is to build an undersea natural gas pipeline that will transport natural gas from Israel’s Leviathan and Tamar natural gas fields to Turkey. From Turkey the gas would be exported to Europe. However, the US embassy move to Jerusalem and President Erdogan’s recent comments about the move have endangered the prospects of the deal being formalized. Erdogan said that Turkey “won’t leave Jerusalem to the mercy of a child killing nation,” and said, on record, that Israeli soldiers are “terrorists.” However negotiations for the deal are still underway, and in fact oil tankers still continued their routes between the two countries. To solidify the deal, Turkey’s ruling AKP and the ultra-nationalist Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) rejected a proposal by the pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic Party (HDP) that would annul all political, military, and economic agreements with Israel and promptly impose sanctions.   Turkey’s willingness to let the Gaza siege remain in place for reconciliation shows that money has more value than the lives of Palestinians. If it continues to engage in multi-billion dollar trade with Israel, continues shipping goods through Israel, and persists in allowing businesses such as Turkish Airlines to operate in Israel, or if it signs the gas pipeline deal, then it is indeed willing to engage in partnership with what Erdogan calls “a child killing nation.” This is the fourth in a 5-part opinion series evaluating the conduct of MENA region states in upholding their commitments to Palestine. Read the first part about Egypt here, the second about the Gulf states here, and the third about Lebanon and Jordan here. The final part in this series will investigate the nature of Morocco’s relationship with Israel.

Rabat – The Royal Spanish Football Federation president has said he is delighted with Morocco’s organization of the Spanish Super Cup final. President Luis Manuel Rubiales made his appreciatory remarks today in a press conference with the president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), Fouzi Lekjaa.  Rubiales is convinced that all conditions are fulfilled for a great football meeting between Sevilla FC and FC Barcelona, on August 12, in Tangier’s Ibn Batouta stadium.  “It was an easy decision to go for Morocco and Tangier. I am convinced that we will experience a joint celebration with a great Moroccan public, who are great football fans,” Rubiales said. “For us, it’s an honor to play the Spanish Super Cup in Morocco, a country that is at the forefront of African football,” he added, highlighting the ancestral relations uniting Spain and Morocco in all fields. “Spain and Morocco are two friendly countries united by history and geography, but also by values and passion for football,” said the former player of Levante and Alicante. He said that thanks to this match, the milestones of a fruitful cooperation are set to move forward in the cooperation between the football authorities of the two countries. “The great goal of this meeting FC Barcelona / FC Sevilla is to unite our two populations, which is the essence of sports and football,” said Rubiales. Morocco is a nation of football whose team showed professionalism and high technical quality at the last World Cup held in Russia, concluded the president of the FRMF. This will not be Tangier’s first experience as a “neutral site” for foreign leagues, as the city’s stadium hosted the French Super Cup on two occasions: the 2011 Super Cup between Lille and Marseille (4-5) and the 2017 Super Cup between Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco (2-1).

Rabat – The USDA has announced that Morocco will import US poultry, opening up an estimated “$10 million market.” The US Trade Representative (USTR) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced today that the Moroccan government has agreed “to allow commercial imports of U.S. poultry meat and products into Morocco for the first time.” “The Trump Administration continues to prioritize the opening of new markets for U.S. agricultural products.  This new access to the Moroccan market is an important step in ensuring that American farmers and ranchers can continue to expand their exports,” said Robert Lighthizer, the USTR’s representative. “I welcome Morocco’s agreement to allow imports of U.S. poultry meat and products and the economic opportunities that will be afforded to U.S. producers,” he added. U.S. poultry gains new market access in Morocco. The U.S. is the world’s 2nd largest poultry exporter, with global sales of poultry meat &amp; products of $4.3 billion last year. Full press release: https://t.co/aoCrse6bLt pic.twitter.com/QPerLpgii4 — Dept. of Agriculture (@USDA) August 7, 2018  According to Reuters, the agreement reverses Morocco’s previous ban on US poultry for “food safety concerns,” although the two countries have a free trade agreement. This new market could alleviate the pressure put on the American farmers as many countries such as China, the EU, Mexico, and Canada have been imposing taxes on US agricultural products. The levy was a response to new US tariffs on steel and aluminum against these countries. USDA and USTR said their offices worked with Morocco’s government “to provide assurances on the safety of U.S. poultry.” USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue said that opening new markets for US poultry and agricultural products is a major priority. “I am convinced that when the Moroccan people get a taste of U.S. poultry, they’re going to want more of it.” Perdue asserted that the US products which will be exported to Morocco “are safe, wholesome, and very delicious.” He also expressed his optimism over the cooperation, noting that “this kind of relationship can be developed.” “We hope there are other things we can cooperate on as USDA works to expand markets around the globe.” Earlier this year, Morocco also approved the import of Russia’s beef products and Ukraine’s beef and poultry. In 2016, the Moroccan National Health Security Office of Food (ONSSA) suspended the import of poultry meat and products from France following an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5 avian flu in French poultry. In 2015, ONSSA also banned the importation of poultry from Germany since its birds were infected with the avian flu virus.

By Dil Bola Rabat – The UN’s human rights body has expressed concerns on Algeria’s treatment of Sahrawis and made a joint visit for migration observations. The early July release of the UN’s periodic report on Algerian commitments to respect human rights obligations, dictated under international norms, extensively highlighted Algeria’s treatment of Sahrawi refugee camps. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) based its observations on information provided by the state coupled with NGO reports. The UN is also concerned about Algeria’s treatment of migrants. Last week, the UN migration agency (IOM) reported on a joint trip with the UNHCR in a mission to observe the condition of migrant deportations. Both the IOM and the UNHCR noted the necessity of the mission for enhanced cooperation in southern Algeria. They maintained positive dialogue that is crucial for cooperation and reaffirmed their commitment to support and aid asylum seekers within the Algerian state. The Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration framework is the UN’s primary methodology to enhance coordination with Algerian authorities in respect to the migrant crisis. The framework prioritizes international refugee and human rights principles and standards while facilitating the positive dialogue they aimed to preserve. The OHCHR committee that initially challenged the state on the treatment of Sahrawis in Tindouf is composed of 18 specialists who expressed their “concerns” that Algeria has delegated jurisdictional powers to Polisario in the camps. The OHCHR maintained the situation runs afoul of Algeria’s obligations under the Covenant on Human Rights, which dictate the government must “respect and guarantee their rights to all individuals on their territory.” As one of the “most prestigious and respected committees” this particular body of the UN remains a high-ranking and senior consultant on human rights issues. Several requests from the Moroccan state had been made to the UN in respect to the fighters of the Polisario Front, thus the issue is not unheard of within the intergovernmental organization. The Western Sahara Conflict has not only resulted in severe human rights abuses but is also among the most protracted refugee crises’ worldwide. Algeria’s forced exodus of Sahrawi civilians and the forced expulsion of Moroccan expatriates by the Algerian government are all breaches of the Geneva convention. The convention has seen modifications and additions since its original establishment in 1949, but primarily remains the same. The convention’s goal is to establish “standards of international law for humanitarian treatment in war.” On the migrant issue, the IOM remains confident their work with the UNHCR and the Algerian government will not only serve “as a framework for dialogue with the authorities,” but additionally, will aid “enhanced concerted efforts on migration and asylum issues in Algeria.”

By Carlo Zanetti Rabat – The chief rabbi of Morocco, Aharon Monsonego, passed away today at age 90 in the Shaarei Tzedek Hospital in Jerusalem. The rabbi’s death was reported by Israeli news outlet Jerusalem Post. His state of health became critical on Monday, August 6, when he was taken to the hospital.  Monsonego was a significant figure in the history of Jewish Morocco. Born in 1929, he was the son of Yedidya, the rabbi of Fez. Between 1945 and 1952, he studied at the Talmudic and Science High School in Aix-les-Bains, eastern France, where he also taught between 1950 and 1952. He obtained his diploma of rabbi and rabbi judge at the Council of the Three Great Orthodox Rabbis of Paris in 1951. In 1952, Monsonego returned to Morocco following the call of Itshak Chalom, president of the Jewish community of Casablanca. Monsonego ran the Talmud Torah school in Casablanca, which, at that time, had more than 1,500 students. Rabbi Aharon Monsonego has been head of Morocco’s chief rabbinate since 1998, when he was appointed to replace Shimon Suissa, his predecessor. Due to his elderly age and worsening health, Monsonego decided to leave Morocco for Israel four years ago, in order to be able to live his last years with his children. The role of chief rabbi in Morocco is particularly important, considering that, along with Sunni Muslims, the Jews are the only other religious community recognized as native by the 2011 constitution. According to the data provided by Jewish community leaders to the US Department of State, there are an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 Jews living in Morocco, approximately 2,500 of whom reside in Casablanca. Monsonego’s funeral is scheduled for tomorrow, August 8, at 3:30 p.m., followed by his burial in the Har Hamenouhot cemetery in Jerusalem.

Rabat – After three years with Malaga CF, Moroccan international football player Youssef En-Nesyri is thinking about joining Leganes.   According to Spanish outlet AS, the Atlas Lion’s current club is negotiating his transfer to Leganes. Malaga is asking for €10 million to release its striker. However, Leganes is only ready to offer €6 million to enroll the 21-year-old football player.  Malaga has recently signed two of En-Nesyri’s national teammates, Morocco’s goalkeeper Munir El Kajoui for a 4-year contract and midfielder Badr Boulahroud for a 3-year contract.  Since the 2018 World Cup in Russia, Youssef En-Nesyri has earned the respect of millions of Moroccans, especially after he scored during Morocco’s last game against Spain. En-Nesyri’s 81st-minute header delivered a temporary lead to the national team.  The native from Fez started his football career in the youth team of the Maghreb AS. He joined the Mohammed VI Academy team led by Nasser Larguet, along with Moroccan Hamza Mendyl, where he trained for a few years before being loaned to the Malaga CF club in 2015.  A year later, he was bought by the same club for €125,000 and managed to earn a starting position by scoring in the first four games in which he participated. As for his career with the Moroccan team, the young striker was summoned for the first time on August 31, 2016, to play in a friendly against Albania. He scored his first goal with the Atlas Lions in the 2017 Africa Cup against Togo.  In 2018, En-Nesyri scored in a friendly against Estonia, a game played in preparation for the Russian World Cup, before offering Moroccan fans the joy of winning a second goal against La Roja.

In May, the French court allowed him to spend the holy month of Ramadan with his family.   The Moroccan sensation was also granted the right to travel to the kingdom in March on a “temporary” visit to present his single “Ghazali” Though the singer’s electronic monitoring bracelet was removed in October 2017, Lamjarred is still technically prohibited from leaving French territory, pending the end of the investigation and the start of his trial. French authorities arrested Lamjarred on October 26, 2016, for sexual assault of a woman named Laura Prioul.

Rabat- Centrale Danone’s “Ntwaslou w Nwaslou” (we communicate and proceed) consultation campaign has gathered 485 proposals from consumers across Morocco. The dairy company has not given up in the midst of a major boycott against its dairy products. Danone is continuing to host consultations in Moroccan cities as part of its “Ntwasslou w Nwaslou” campaign. The campaign aims to find a compromise on price in response to the purchasing power of consumers and boycotters’ demands: a decrease in prices for Centrale Danone’s dairy products, especially milk. After holding public meetings in Casablanca, Marrakech, and Rabat, Centrale Danone has organized its next public meeting in Meknes today, and will hold its final meeting in Agadir.

Centrale Danone has mobilized 1,000 employees to meet consumers and grocers to listen and discuss their proposals with them. So far, the campaign’s electronic platform, natwaslo.com has received 458 proposals since its launch on August 1. The campaign will continue until August 15. moroccans expressed mixed reactions on the campaign.  While some want to give the company a second chance and make proposals, others scorned Danone’s attempts to overcome the boycott. One social media user wrote on Centrale Danone’s Facebook page: “This is what happens when you don’t listen to people in the right time. Unfortunately, you ignored the demands of Moroccans and now look, you reached a dead end.” Another commenter wrote: “If only you took me with you in your tour to see a bit of Morocco!” “Just decrease the price and stop this nonsense,” another wrote. During his visit to Casablanca on June 26, Centrale Danone’s CEO, Emmanuel Faber, promised Moroccan customers that the company would adjust its dairy prices. He promised to be transparent in costs and quality at all times, not to make a profit from the pasteurized milk, and to trust all stakeholders of Centrale’s pasteurized fresh milk to find a fair and equitable price.

Rabat – A number of high-profile music festivals and other cultural events in Algeria have been met with waves of “Islamist” protests.  Local outlets reported the series of incidents late last week. Protesters, who at first said that they were demonstrating against government policies and bad governance, started increasingly targeting cultural events, including concerts and festivals. According to Algerian outlet Casbah Tribune, the wave of protests gained traction in Sidi Bel-Abbes, a town in western Algeria. As festival-goers prepared to attend the National Festival of Rai Music, a number of people blocked the entrance to the festival hall, settling down in front of the facility to pray the isha (evening) prayer.  After barring attendees from accessing the festival, demonstrators also sought to storm the hall. Only police intervention prevented the disruption and allowed the festival to continue. According to some accounts in other local outlets, the protest movement actually began on July 26 as a wake-up call to the government and local authorities in places where cultural events were scheduled.  Through their online platform, protesters reportedly raised concerns about living conditions, requesting higher wages and measures to curb unemployment. They also asked for festivals to be cancelled, claiming that the money ploughed into organizing “these illicit and immoral” events could be used better for the public good. ‘Culture is an easy target’ In towns like Bechar, Ouargla, and Bejaia, the wave of “pacifist public collective prayers” succeeded in compelling authorities to cancel festivals.  “We are being targeted for trafficking music and possessing musical instruments of massive destruction,” joked Abdou El Ksouri, a musician due to perform at the Ourgla Rai Festival, after his concert was cancelled. He spoke of Algerian Islamists’ “issue with culture,” claiming that they hated its liberating potential. “There are those for whom these festivals were just a pretext to vent their ideology-based anger,” wrote Algerian outlet El Watan.  Algerian poet and academic Achour Fenni told El Watan that some in Algeria would do anything to keep culture and cultural events at bay to sustain their hardline religious convictions. “Culture is an easy target,” the academic said, explaining that instigators of such demonstrations want a society of uncritical and follow-the-rules subjects. “Why do they schedule their protests only when festivals and cultural events are programmed? Have they ever demonstrated during football matches, for example?” the poet asked.  Like many in Algeria’s “intellectual” circles, Fenni linked the recent wave of “anti-culture demonstrations” to the possible return of the FIS (Islamic Salvation Front), the defunct Islamist party that troubled Algeria’s political landscape in the late 1980s and early 1990s.   “Terrorism is not only fought with weapons; it does not only nest in compounds,” Fenni said. He suggested that towns where authorities gave in to “Islamist” pressures have indirectly legitimized the “backward” ideology demonstrators want the whole Algerian society to espouse.

Rabat – Italy has announced it will give Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia funds in order to restrict the immigration flow to Europe. The Italian government says it will invest “at least €1 billion” in the countries’ economies, as announced on Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini’s Twitter account on August 3. Italy should become “a protagonist” on migration policy in Europe, Salvini added. He also announced that he would “soon” visit Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria. #Salvini: Sarò presto in Tunisia, Marocco e Algeria, voglio che l’Italia torni PROTAGONISTA!
Stiamo preparando un progetto che prevede almeno 1 miliardo di sostegno all’economia e al lavoro in quei Paesi, quello che non ha fatto il Pd in anni di governo lo farà la Lega. #skytg24 — Matteo Salvini (@matteosalvinimi) August 3, 2018  Salvini said that the budget will be allocated to investments in agriculture, trade, and fishing. In an interview with Sky TG24, Salvini explained that the Italian government aims to control its southern borders and “to reply to all of those who see me as Satan.” Earlier in June, Salvini refused to let a humanitarian boat carrying more than 600 migrants enter Italy’s ports. “From now also Italy begins to say NO to the traffic of human beings, No to the business of irregular migration,” Salvini tweeted on June 10. “My goal is to guarantee a peaceful life for these children in Africa and for our children in Italy,” he added. The western Mediterranean route from Morocco has been the main passage route that irregular migrants use to cross to Spain and the EU. According to British news outlet Euractiv, by July 30, 23,993 migrants entered Europe through this route in 2018, in addition to 18,298 arriving in Italy alone. The interior minister considered tackling the problem of migration to Europe from within countries of origin. “It is not enough to close [ports] and send [migrants] back home. It is also necessary to create prospects of growth and work in these countries,” Salvini said Friday. According to the news organization Politico, Salvini said he will make “serious and stable agreements” with African countries to deport people who did not qualify for asylum. He will also call for a law to deport asylum-seekers who committed “any sort of crime” in their countries of origin. More than 600,000 migrants and refugees have arrived in Italy by boat from Africa in the past five years, Al Jazeera reported. On July 6, the EU approved a €55 million fund to assist Morocco and Tunisia to combat migration. Morocco then requested resources estimated at €60 million for border management and migration control. The Spanish prime minister supported Morocco’s request by sending a letter to the European Union Commission, asking the body to provide Morocco with the resources it requested. EU President Jean-Claude Juncker responded that “Spain and Morocco can be assured of the full support of the EU Commission.”

By Carlo Zanetti Rabat – On Saturday and Sunday, the Spanish coast guard rescued 397 migrants near the Strait of Gibraltar. The migrants, trying to cross from Morocco to Spain, came on nine different boats, as reported on the official Twitter account of the coast guard.  The numbers of the last month testify to the increasingly delicate situation which the Spanish interior ministry is handling. On July 26, 602 migrants illegally crossed the Morocco-Spain border into Ceuta. On July 27 and 28, the Spanish coast guard rescued approximately 1,000 migrants in the sea.  Although the migrating influx from North Africa to Europe has decreased considerably since 2015, Spain has witnessed a major increase in the number of arrivals over the last months. The trend has certainly been influenced by the new political maneuvers of the Italian Ministry of the Interior, geared towards implementing policies on refusal of entry. For the first time, Spain has taken over Italy as the main destination for migrants leaving North Africa, having recorded almost 21,000 arrivals during the first half of 2018 alone, according to numbers released by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The EU had originally agreed to spend €55 million to help Tunisia and Morocco manage their frontiers, but at the end of July European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker tweeted that Brussels is willing to increase funding to both Morocco and Spain. Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska has asked the EU for a contribution of €35 million.  Given Juncker’s notice, it appears that Madrid’s request will be granted. Meanwhile, Spanish Prime Minister Sanchez is facing protests from his opponents, who are blaming his welcoming policies as the cause of the sharp increase of undocumented immigration into the country.

Rabat – A British tourist and her children have suffered the harmful effects of black henna tattoos they got in Agadir. When Toni Feeney and her two boys got black henna tattoos, things did not go as planned. The ephemeral tattoos gave the boys severe arm burns. To warn others about the dangers of these tattoos, Toni shared several pictures of the burns on her Facebook page.  “This is what black henna can do to your skin! We let our children have them on holiday not thinking for a second it would be dangerous,” wrote the mother. She went on, “The hospital have said that the chemicals/dyes in black henna are too strong.”  Feen said her children now have chemical burns and are on antibiotics and antihistamines “in the hope that they don’t get infection or get poorly. If you are offered it say NO” Speaking after the incident with British outlet The Sun, the mom of two said: “I’m gutted! Wouldn’t have gone near it if I’d have known. I just presumed it was harmless. Feel so bad, didn’t even know black henna was dangerous. There were loads of people offering it too. It makes me so mad how many people are doing it over there. The docs have said not to put anything on them, once it’s started to heal I’ll try something, maybe bio oil.” Many cases of serious allergic reactions have been reported following black henna tattoos. The allergy usually results in eczema-type reactions occurring within 48 to 72 hours, or even as late as 7 to 15 days after tattooing. Henna can cause inflammatory reactions and leave permanent scars. The reaction can permanently mark the skin with scars or pigmentation disorders. The reactions are mainly due to paraphenylenediamine or phenylenediamine (PPD), an illicit substance added to natural brown henna to obtain a black tattoo.

Rabat- Morocco’s interior ministry has announced that 76 government officials have been dismissed, following the sacking of the economy minister. The 76 sacked officials include accountants, and presidents of municipalities, provinces, prefectures, and regional councils, who are undergoing investigation for bad management. The officials are not allowed to leave the country throughout the investigation period. The Ministry of Interior is conducting more investigations regarding thousands of hectares of state-owned communal lands which some government officials sold to foreign investors at low prices. The ministry will remove more officials whose jobs are tainted by “corrupt” management, in line with a report by the head of the Court of Auditors, Driss Jettou.  The report focuses on the management of the accounts handled by all ministers and is set to ensure transparency in government finances. The report revealed management dysfunctions in more than 100 accounts by general directors, senior officials, and ministers, reported Moroccan newspaper Assabah. On the eve of Throne Day, July 29, the head of Bank al Maghrib, Abdellatif Jouahri, and Jettou, presented the King with their 2017 annual reports on Morocco’s financial situation. Both reports showed that social disparities are still an issue that hampers Morocco’s social and economic development. On August 1, after the monarch received the report, the royal cabinet announced that the King sacked the minister of economy and finance, Mohamed Boussaid, in accordance with the King’s powers in Article 47 of the 2011 constitution.  To Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, who commented on the incident to L’economiste news outlet, Boussaid’s dismissal signifies that no one is above the law.

Rabat – Saudi Arabia has expelled the Canadian ambassador over criticism from Canada’s foreign minister on the kingdom’s arrest of human rights activists. Saudi Arabia considered Canada’s criticism as interference in the kingdom’s internal affairs. Saudi Arabia also recalled its ambassador in Canada and announced Canada’s ambassador in Saudi Arabia to be “Persona-Non-Grata who must leave the Kingdom within the next 24 hours,” the Saudi press agency (SPA) reported today, August 6. The kingdom made the decision after Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland had denounced the arrest of two Saudi activists Samar Badawi and Raif Badawi by Saudi authorities. Canada is “very alarmed to learn that Samar Badawi, Raif Badawi’s sister, has been imprisoned in Saudi Arabia. Canada stands together with the Badawi family in this difficult time, and we continue to strongly call for the release of both Raif and Samar Badawi,” wrote Freeland on her Twitter account on August 2. Samar Badawi and Nassima al-Sadah, both Saudi women’s rights activists, were arrested on July 30. “This unprecedented level of persecution of human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia is a disturbing sign that the crackdown is far from over,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East research director. “These brave women represented the last vestiges of the human rights community in the country, and now they too have been detained,” he added. According to SPA, the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs found Freeland’s statement surprising. The Canadian ministry’s statement “is a negative unfounded comment, which was not based in any accurate or true information,” said the Saudi foreign ministry. “The persons referred to were lawfully detained by the Public Prosecution for committing crimes punishable by applicable law,” the foreign ministry added. The ministry also deemed the Canadian statement “a blatant interference” in domestic affairs. Just one day after Freeland’s tweet, Canada’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that it “was gravely concerned” about arrested women’s rights activists, including Samar Badawi. Canada is gravely concerned about additional arrests of civil society and women’s rights activists in #SaudiArabia, including Samar Badawi. We urge the Saudi authorities to immediately release them and all other peaceful #humanrights activists. — Foreign Policy CAN (@CanadaFP) August 3, 2018  Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry responded to the statement and asserted that “Canada and all other nations need to know that they can’t claim to be more concerned than the Kingdom over its own citizens.” “The Kingdom will put on hold all new business and investment transactions with Canada while retaining its right to take further action,” it added. Canada’s official response Marie-Pier Baril, a spokeswoman for the Canadian foreign ministry, said Canada was “seriously concerned” by Saudi Arabia’s recent actions on suspending trade between the two countries, according to CTV News. Despite the kingdom’s action, Canada’s position towards detained Saudi activists is constant. “Canada will always stand up for the protection of human rights, very much including women’s rights, and freedom of expression around the world,” Baril said in a statement. “Our government will never hesitate to promote these values and believes that this dialogue is critical to international diplomacy,” she added. Saudi crackdown on women’s right activists According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), Saudi authorities arrested many activists and intellectuals in September 2017 in a “coordinated crackdown on dissent.” Saudi’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman “has overseen a widespread crackdown on prominent activists, lawyers, and human rights defenders,” HRW said. According to HRW, many detained activists were campaigning against “the ban on women driving and publicly advocating abolishing the male guardianship system.” The Canadian foreign minister expressed her disappointment over the arrest of Saudi women activists. “We are extremely disappointed by the arrest of civil society and women’s rights activists in Saudi Arabia,” said Freeland in May. “The entire Canadian government is prepared to speak up for Saudi women.” She also called on Saudi authorities to release the activists. Canada is extremely concerned by the arrests of civil society and women’s rights activists in #SaudiArabia. We call on Saudi authorities to release peaceful activists. pic.twitter.com/jz8Q7rvjes — Chrystia Freeland (@cafreeland) May 24, 2018  Raif Badawi’s family and detention Raif Badawi is a Saudi blogger who was arrested in 2012 in Jeddah. He was sentenced to 7 years in prison and 600 lashes for allegedly insulting Islam through his liberal blog. The court also ordered that Badawi’s website be shut down since it criticized Saudi Arabia’s religious police. In 2014, Saudi Arabia’s Supreme Court upheld the verdict against the Saudi blogger on appeal and increased the sentence to 10 years in prison, 1,000 lashes, and a $266,000 fine. Badawi’s arrest caused uproar worldwide. His case was raised by many international human rights activists and organizations, which called for his release. Since 2013, Badawi’s wife, Ensaf Haidar, has been living in Canada with their three children. They four obtained Canadian nationality earlier this summer, according to Radio Canada International.

Rabat – Following his exit from Germany’s national football team over “racism and disrespect,” Mesut Ozil has received a lot of support. This time, it is football players who are paying him tribute. Moroccan international football player Khalid Boutaib and his teammates in Turkey’s Yeni Malatyaspor club wore a jersey with the Turkish-German football player’s face and a message of support during a friendly game on Saturday.  The players were standing in solidarity with Ozil, who complained of racism and unfair treatment.  Two weeks ago, the 29-year-old midfielder for Arsenal announced that he was leaving the Germany team on his Twitter account. He wrote, “It is with a heavy heart and after much consideration that because of recent events, I will no longer be playing for Germany at international level whilst I have this feeling of racism and disrespect.” The decision came after he was harshly criticized for appearing in a picture with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at an event in May, during the Turkish presidential campaign. Ozil was also targeted by angry fans who lashed out at him after Germany’s shocking loss to South Korea which resulted in an early exit from the 2018 World Cup.  Political figures, including President Erdogan, have applauded Ozil’s decision to quit.

Rabat – AMPL has denied its pilots are on strike, claiming that RAM’s management policy is solely responsible for the company’s troubles. The National Trade Union of Moroccan Pilots (AMPL) published the accusation in a statement posted on the weekend on its Facebook page. The union slammed the much-rumored allegations of pilots striking and said that AMPL members were going about their activities as usual.  Since July 18, Royal Air Maroc (RAM), Morocco’s national carrier, has been forced to cancel a series of flights and make last-minute changes in flight schedules. According to the latest reports, the company has cancelled more than 100 flights over the last two weeks, igniting the wrath of some customers. “AMPL strongly denies allegations that RAM’s pilots are on strike,” the group’s statement declared, saying that “at no time did RAM’s pilots fail to perform their duty as set by the company’s monthly working hours’ requirements.” While AMPL has been widely reported to have declined negotiation offers from RAM management, the group’s statement offered a strikingly different account. According to AMPL, pilots have been fulfilling their duty “without disruption,” but RAM’s “chaotic management” and its unreasonable requirements have created “a tense social atmosphere” seriously plaguing the company’s finances and flight schedules. AMPL acknowledged it has been engaged with RAM’s management in a “twenty month-long unproductive social dialogue” amid deteriorating working conditions. But, AMPL asserted, its pilots have been doing their best to perform their duty and avoid wronging “loyal” passengers.  “We, aircraft commanders and crew members, want to seize this opportunity to thank passengers who have honored us with their loyalty and trust,” the statement concluded. Meanwhile, RAM has been losing MAD 20 million daily since July 18, according to management sources at the company.

Rabat – After his arrest July 26, an activist, opposed to the use of wheel clamps, has had his trial postponed twice. In Tangier, several citizens have started a campaign to protest wheel clamps, questioning the legality of the practice. The council, in conjunction with partnered parking companies uses wheel clamps to immobilize cars whose owners have not paid parking fees.  The wheel clamps can also considerable damage cars, leading to disputes over the clamps’ legality.   Most prominently representing the campaign is Mohamed Said Bouhaja, the owner of a car rental agency. On July 26, Bouhaja was arrested on six different charges which include “theft and destruction of public property, acquisition of tools to open or break locks and incitement to crime.”  The charges followed a complaint lodged against him by Somagec Parkings, the company which currently manages the underground car parks and ticket machines in Tangier. Somagec have accused Bouhaja of stealing 150 wheel clamps. Upon his arrest, nearly 20 lawyers appeared to support Bouhaja, demanding that he be prosecuted on bail. However, the prosecutor general refused to grant him provisional release and has postponed his trial twice.  The court postponed the trial first until Thursday, August 2, and then until Thursday, August 16.  Bouhaja is currently being held in the Tang village prison in Tangier.  In a statement to H24, Omar Benaajiba, Bouhaja’s lawyer expressed his dissatisfaction with the arrest: “The police found no hoof or hoof key,” referring to the wheel clamps and the tools used to unlock and remove them. Benaajiba perceived the arrest of Bouhaja as “a way to scare the people involved in the fight against the laying of wheel clamps in Tangier.” The issue of wheel clamps in Morocco The battle against wheel clamps in Morocco is not new. In Rabat, the fight goes back as far as 1997. Abderrahmane Benameur was one of the leading figures against the non-legality of wheel clamps to immobilize cars. In an interview with H24, he stated, “In the year 1997 or 1998, the Rabat City Council authorized a company to organize the circulation of part of the capital and to impose specific charges and set traps commonly called ‘sabots.’  So, I decided to fight in order to prove that these activities were illegal.”  After many years, Benameur was successful in his fight against wheel clamps. In 2014, the Court of Appeals in Rabat confirmed the illegality of immobilizing vehicles with a wheel clamp. The court decided that it was up to the Municipal Council to take the appropriate measures to implement the decision.  However, because the authority of the court’s decision was only local, other Moroccan cities still deal with wheel clamps.  Benameur stated, “In Casablanca, we can get today only compensation which ranges from 3,000 to 20,000 MAD depending on the severity of the damage inflicted and this may only be 1 or 2 years later.”  Many Casablanca residents in fact have complained that wheel clamps damage their cars, but few have dared to complain about their use and imposed taxes.  Benaemur emphasized to Moroccans the need for associations and further action in order to permanently suspend the practice of wheel clamping. By Isabella Wang

Rabat – After a decade of work and a series of delays and un-kept promises, Mohammed V Airport’s Terminal 1 is still not open. The Terminal 1 project, which was undertaken nearly a decade ago to expand the Casablanca-based airport’s reception capacity, was reportedly completed in March and expected to open in July.  In early June, airport authorities, together with Royal Air Maroc (RAM) management, issued a statement saying the terminal was undergoing its final trial period and would be operational by July.  “Finally ready to welcome [its first] passengers, Terminal 1 should start operating by late June or early July,” a source at the Ministry of Tourism and Transportation said at the time. The source then apologized for delays and previous unfulfilled promises which he said were “due to a long period of tests which started in early March.” Despite promises that the facility would open this summer to meet Casablanca’s status as a rising international hub for air travel, Terminal 1 is still not operational and travelers continue to face Mohammed V Airport’s traditional issues—overcrowding, long hours for check-in, and long lines at customs. It’s ‘complicated’ Speaking to Moroccan outlet Medias 24 on Friday, August 3, a source from Royal Air Maroc (RAM) described the situation as “complicated.”  He mentioned “overcrowding due to increasing international arrivals this summer and ongoing troubles at RAM” among the many factors making a number of customers’ experiences at Mohammed V “uncomfortable.” In RAM’s defense, however, the source added that “everything is ready” at Terminal 1, but “RAM has still not received the green light from ONDA, the National Office of Airports.” A source from ONDA blamed the delay on the current situation at the airport, saying that the reasons for the delay are “more complicated than it would seem” and that opening the facility in this busy period of summer would have created further complications at the airport. He said it would be more convenient to the facility in a less busy period, to avoid “technical concerns” that may result from having to close some parts of the airport.  “After a series of delays, it is becoming gradually obvious that that the terminal will open in September. The only explanation for this is that authorities are trying to avoid creating further technical problems in this peak period.” When challenged about the discomfort and the lack of trust caused by delays and unfulfilled promises, another ONDA official said that customers and users have waited for a long time and can be now be patient enough fore few more months as the project is being held back by minor technical issues.  “Months-long delays are nothing compared to the ten years it took to complete [building] the facility,” he said. With 84 check-in counters and 17 boarding gates, authorities expect that Terminal 1 will double Casablanca’s airport reception capacity and meet the demands of customers by making Mohamed V “a modernized airport equipped with state-of-the-art technology.”

Rabat – A fight erupted in Denmark when a bystander attempted to remove a woman’s niqab, now illegal in the country. The 28-year-old woman wore her niqab on Friday, August 3, to a shopping mall in Horsholm, north of Copenhagen; at the top of an escalator, another woman attempted to take off her niqab. Onlookers called the police, who gave her two options: remove the veil or leave the mall. Either way, she would receive a fine—the equivalent of MAD 1,470—in the mail. If she continues to wear the niqab in public, she could receive a fine of up to MAD 14,684—or a jail sentence of up to six months.  The Danish Parliament passed the legislation, which mandates that “anyone who wears a garment that hides the face in public will be punished with a fine,” on May 31. The law does not specifically mention the niqab or burqa; the judgment of what does and does not constitute an illegal face covering falls to the police. On the evening of August 1st, the day the law officially entered into effect, hundreds of people of varying religions and ethnic backgrounds gathered in Copenhagen to demonstrate against the legislation—in niqabs and burqas, colorful scarves, horse heads, and fake beards. The crowd marched behind a sign reading, “My clothes, my choice.”  Denmark’s second-largest city, Aarhus, saw a protest against the ban the same night. The facially-covered demonstrators did not receive a fine, as the law makes an exception for those peacefully protesting. A 2009 study by University of Copenhagen professor Margit Warburg measured niqab- or burqa-wearing individuals at less than 0.2 percent of Muslim women in the country—approximately 150 women in a country of 5.7 million. However, to the women wearing the burqa or niqab, the issue is critical. Sabina, a 21-year-old education student in Denmark, began wearing the niqab two years before the ban. She said she donned the face veil to feel more connected to God.  “It’s not just about us fighting for the right to wear our niqab,” she said. “It’s also about us fighting for right to live our lives as practicing Muslims in Denmark. We are saying to the government: we do not accept this form of racist, Islamophobic and oppressive politics.” “The niqab is a huge part of my identity. It’s a very spiritual choice—and now it has also become a sign of protest.”  Sabina is one of the founders of Kvinder i Dialog (Women in Dialogue). Begun by niqab-wearing women, the organization strives to create a link between Muslim women and the population of Denmark.   Fellow Kvinder i Dialog founder Sarah, 30, is a student and mother. She said she once believed in Denmark’s tradition of tolerance; now, if she wants to go somewhere, she thinks, “Is it worth getting a fine?” “I have never felt like a victim before,” she said. “This is the first time I’ve felt oppressed.”  “You have to be very strong to wear the niqab in Denmark. We are not going to lie down and let people kick us. We are going to fight to the end.” Although the law does not mention Islamic face veils specifically, MP Naser Khader plainly said, “We don’t want the burqa and niqab in Denmark.” Human Rights Watch called the “discriminatory” ban “the latest in a harmful trend,” referencing the “decidedly anti-Muslim tone” present in legal discussion.  Danish Minister of Justice Soren Pape Poulsen said the face coverings are “incompatible with Danish values.” A spokesperson from the Danish People’s Party asserted the need for measures against the “Islamization of Denmark.” Similar bans exist across Europe, in France, Belgium, and Austria. Globally, Spain, Italy, Cameroon, and Chad have partial bans. Morocco banned the production and sale of burqas in January 2017, but women may still legally wear them in public. By Anna Schaeffer

Rabat- The “poor people’s doctor” must pay an MAD 20,000 fine to the Tiznit Provincial Hospital’s chief for libel and defamation. The Court of First Instance in Tiznit, a town 97 kilometers south of Agadir, sentenced a Moroccan pediatric surgeon, Mehdi Echafai, nicknamed the “poor people’s doctor,” on Monday to pay a compensation fine to the chief of the hospital. The 34-year-old practitioner will also pay MAD 10,000 to the court. Initially, the hospital’s chief medical officer sued Echafai for libel and defamation, demanding that Echafai pay him MAD 80,000 as a compensation for his “insults.” Echafai had posted a video online in February in which he denounced his superiors’ moral harassment, the failing health system, poor management, and corruption within the hospital. The doctor earned his nickname for helping hundreds of families treat their children. Since 2017, Echafai carried out more than 560 free operations for the poorest patients in 8 months in the same hospital, before he decided to resign on July 23 in the midst of defamation hearings. Echafai submitted a complaint to the health minister to protest “corruption” on July 25, deploring the “many dysfunctions of the health sector in general” and the “corruption that is commonplace within the hospital center.”  Following his resignation, the doctor’s supporters launched a campaign on social media, called “I’m Doctor Mehdi Echafai” to show their support for him and bemoan his resignation which “deprived the people of Tiznit of a serious doctor, dedicated and honest.”

Rabat – More than 1,500 migrants have died in the Mediterranean in 2018 while trying to reach Europe, according to UNHCR. Recent EU and partner governments’ measures to curb the flow of irregular migration to Europe has reportedly borne fruit: the number of undocumented migrants who reached EU countries by sea has halved in 2018 when compared to figures for the years 2014-2017, according to AFP.  Last week, Mustafa El Khalfi, the Moroccan government’s spokesperson, said that in 2017 Moroccan authorities stopped more than 65,000 irregular migrants from crossing to Europe. El Khalfi was trying to convince the EU of Morocco’s improving performance in stemming the flow of migrants to the EU. But while the number of migrants’ successful attempts to reach EU countries has considerably decreased, the migrant death toll has jumped in recent months, UNHCR has found. The rate of deaths in the Mediterranean this year is far higher than previous years. According to the UN body, more than 1,500 people have died at sea since January 2018.  The UN agency noted that the large majority of at-sea deaths this year were refugees fleeing the war in Syria. More noticeably perhaps, HCR’s statement noted that more than half of the deaths occurred between June and July, suggesting worsening conditions this summer as EU governments convened in the last two weeks to devise a collective policy to tackle the crisis.  Although the statement shied away from calling out names, it suggested that the rise in migrants’ deaths in the Mediterranean was caused by a recent crackdown on irregular migration. Some EU member states began to refuse entrance to rescue ships with “desperate migrants” on board.  In late June, Italy and Malta sparked international criticism when they shut down ports to vessels carrying rescued migrants. Precarious conditions at sea But the primary problem noted in the UN’s agency report is the precarious conditions in which migrants cross the sea. The document cited the surge of human traffickers making a profit off the desperation of migrants wanting to reach Europe at all costs.  Traffickers put migrants’ lives at risk by packing them in “overloaded, unseaworthy and flimsy vessels.” The vessels “are then left to sail out at sea in the hope that rescue will come in time.” “In order to save lives at sea, we must use appropriate and necessary measures to hold to account those who seek to gain profit from the exploitation of vulnerable human beings.” Calling for more international cooperation to fight human trafficking networks, Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR’s special envoy for the Mediterranean, said that “states and authorities along transit routes” should push for “all necessary action to dismantle and disrupt smuggler networks.” Humanitarian measures UNHCR also urged EU governments to consider the humanitarian aspect of the migration crisis. Indirectly referring to Italy and Malta’s recent controversial decision to prevent rescue ships from docking, the UN agency said that Europe should be more receptive and welcoming in cases where lives are at stake, especially of refugees fleeing war and other devastating living conditions. “With so many lives at stake, it’s vital that we give shipmasters confidence that they will be able to dock rescued passengers, and thereby ensure that the long-standing principle of rescuing people in distress at sea is protected,” Cochetel said.

Rabat – Air Arabia Morocco has announced it will expand its network from Agadir with a new direct flight to Basel, Switzerland.  Air Arabia, Morocco’s leading low-budget airline, has collaborated with the Moroccan National Office of Tourism (ONMT) to operate the new flight weekly on Mondays, beginning October 29, said the company in a statement. The new service will be the second flight operated by the airline from Basel to Morocco. ”Our first flight experience between Casablanca and Basel has been satisfactory and we are confident that this additional flight will bring added value in terms of tourist arrivals, for Basel airport covers three countries which are Switzerland, Germany and France,” said Adel Ali, president of the Air Arabia Group. Basel-Mulhouse Airport, better known as ”EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg,” is a tri-national airport in France, less than five kilometers from both the Swiss and German borders. Tourists from all three countries will now be able to fly to Agadir on the low-cost flight.

Rabat- A video has circulated social media, capturing the distressing conditions of a psychiatric hospital in an unspecified location in Morocco. Not long after a distressing video of Casablanca’s Ibn Rochd University Hospital (CHU) circulated online, a new video showing the distressing conditions in a public psychiatric hospital has surfaced.   The hospital’s reception room was filled with the hysterical cries of a patient who was lying on the ground, in apparent need of medical attention. Similar to the video shot in Ibn Rochd Hospital, no doctors or nurses were in sight. Only the panicked families of patients were seen, expressing distress and condemning the poor conditions of the hospital. “People are dying, look how many people are waiting here. Shame,” stated the man who recorded the video. The man also said doctors rarely show up to the hospital: “All doctors show up only for 30 minutes and leave.” A woman whose son was suffering from an illness tearfully shared about how doctors would not even make an appointment to treat her son.  In the video taken by a French tourist at CHU, patients were seen lying on the unhygienic floor of the hospital’s emergency wing where no emergency equipment, doctors, or nurses could be seen. The tourist denounced the poor conditions of the hospital, saying:  “People are dying, and if you don’t have money you can’t get treated… do you find this normal? In a country like Morocco that prefers to construct roads and other things rather than treat the sick.” The videos were not the first to record the tragic state of Moroccan hospitals, especially public hospitals which lack equipment, medicine, and medical staff. The government has promised to improve the country’s healthcare system, measures which include its new agreement with the World Health Organization (WHO). Recently, the director general of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, pledged to support Morocco’s ambition to extend the national health insurance to low-income and disadvantaged people.

Rabat – It is the end of an era. Hafa, Tangier’s historical cafe, will no longer receive its faithful customers and tourists. The mythical place has closed doors because of “illegal constructions,” according to local media Tanja 24. Local authorities went to the cafe on Saturday, August 4, to demolish a terrace that was built without “a license.” The café added the terrace during the month of Ramadan without the prior permission of the prefecture.  In a statement to Arabic outlet Hespress, the owner of the café, Abderrahman El Akel, explained, “The authorities invaded the cafe and asked people to leave the place, including a dozen tourists. They cut off electricity and started to destroy the terrace they accuse me of annexing.” Opened in 1921, Hafa is one of the oldest cafes in Tangier. Since then, the cafe has kept its simple decorations and style. Cafe Hafa has maintained its beauty, fame, and a good reputation that inspired numerous international writers.    Despite its popularity, each table at Hafa offered a degree of privacy resulting in a sense of artistic freedom. The unique atmosphere inspired many artists, including Tennessee Williams, Paul Bowles, the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones. The cafe’s air will no longer be perfumed with the smell of cannabis, and the sounds of dice and dominoes will no longer echo through the open air terraces. The scenic cafe is located outside of the Kasbah, overlooking the sea. Guests were often treated to enjoy music in the evening.

Rabat – Spain’s government will include the teaching of Moroccan Arabic, culture, history, and civilization in the Spanish educational system. As a development of diplomatic relations between Morocco and Spain, the two neighboring countries have signed a bilateral agreement to promote educational and cultural development. Named “Strategic Association Agreement on Cultural, Educational, and Sports Development and Cooperation,” the agreement entered into force on July 18. The agreement was signed in 2012 by Spain’s minister of foreign affairs, but it did not go into effect until conditions were met, according to the Spanish outlet Ok Diario. The agreement was published in full Wednesday, August 1, on the Spanish government’s official gazette. The agreement aims to strengthen the “deep historical and cultural ties” between Spain and Morocco through “knowledge and understanding between both peoples and the dissemination of their respective languages ??and cultural heritage.” The educational sectors targeted in the cooperation are primary, secondary, university, and vocational. Spain and Morocco will encourage education officials to exchange visits in order to transfer successful experiences and learn about the educational systems of the two countries, Ok Diario added. According to the agreement, the Moroccan government will practice guardianship over the content of the Spanish educational curriculum. Spain and Morocco agreed on some measures to reinforce Moroccan and Spanish languages in their schools. The Spanish outlet stated that the Spanish government committed to promote “the teaching and dissemination of the [Moroccan] language, history, and civilization” in its official educational programs. In addition, Morocco’s government will include the teaching of the Spanish language in primary and secondary schools. The Spanish language will then be “an optional subject for students in the regions of Morocco where it is most practiced,” according to the agreement. The bilateral cooperation also considered the implication of higher education in the agreement. Moroccan students will have access to Spanish universities and Spanish students can enroll in Moroccan universities according to the terms of the agreement. According to Ok Diaro, the cooperation also encourages the education ministries to grant scholarships and promote student and teacher exchanges between both countries.

Rabat – One in three Moroccan graduates are jobless due to a sluggish economy and failing education system, according to HCP. Ahmed Lahlimi, the head of the High Commission for Planning (HCP), Morocco’s leading institution for economic forecasting and institutional planning, sat down recently for an interview with Reuters. Lahlimi pointed out the country’s underperforming and down-sliding economic activities.  Despite increased efforts in recent years to reduce investment hurdles and attract more investors to some promising sectors, including renewable energies, aeronautics, and automobile manufacturing, Morocco’s labor market has been unable to absorb many young graduates, keeping the unemployment rate at 9.1 in 2018. “In the last five years, an average 60,000 people have graduated annually from Moroccan higher education institutions, of whom 20,000 can’t find a job,” Lahlimi said. Disconnect between education and market demands Morocco’s unemployment rate in 2017 was 9.3 percent. And while that number has slightly decreased this year, the slim improvement has been due to the farming sector rather than any formal or state measures to make labor and education sectors more responsive to the country’s increasing needs, he explained. According to Morocco’s chief planner, part of the reason for the underperformance of the country’s labor market is the great disconnect between the increasingly demanding labor market and school curricula. Moroccan universities have not kept pace with technological advances and do not currently equip their graduates with the skills needed in an evolving job market, Lahlimi suggested. Most worryingly perhaps, vocational and training schools, which Lahlimi said were supposed to bridge the gap between labor market and the education sector, have only attracted “failed students” in recent years. On average, graduates’ motivation does not match the country’s highly demanding and increasingly shifting labor fabric, he noted. “Education is the social ladder that could lift people out of poverty, reduce disparities and fight social inequalities,” he said of Morocco’s underperforming education sector. Grim economic prospects for 2019 Speaking of how vocational schools could make up for the mismatch between university graduates and Morocco’s evolving job environment, he added: “It should attract people who are motivated to do jobs that meet the needs of the job market in tandem with technological improvements.” Lahlimi also mentioned some of the economy’s systemic inadequacies, especially decreasing economic output and sluggish GDP growth. He said that a predicted low agriculture level in 2019 is expected to bring the country’s GDP growth rate lower than its current level. From 3.1 percent this year, Morocco’s GDP is forecasted to decrease to 2.1 percent in 2019, according to HCP’s chief. “With such slow growth, Morocco is not doing enough to curb unemployment and bridge social disparities. The impact of growth on job creation has continued to diminish since 2000.” Given such prospects that worry Lahlimi—slowing growth, high unemployment, and a widening trade deficit (7.8 percent in the first half of 2018)—he said, “Morocco needs to strengthen the competitiveness of its economic fabric, notably small and medium-sized enterprises.”

Rabat – Despite being eliminated from the 2018 World Cup in the first round, the Atlas Lions can comfort themselves with their lavish award.  The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) has thanked each player for their impressive efforts during the World Cup competition with an MAD 200,000 bonus, according to Al Ahdath Al Maghribia.  The Lions’ World Cup performance did not go unnoticed. The Moroccan team was praised internationally for its amazing team work and technique, despite controversy over the use of video assistant referee (VAR).  The team’s last two matches against Portugal and Spain frustrated fans and footballers alike. Many believed Morocco tactically dominated both games and could have written a different story had it not been for refereeing errors. The World Cup aside, the national team and their coach Herve Renard have another challenge awaiting them: the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). For the qualifier games, Morocco will play against Malawi next month. The bonus is also a way for FRMF’s president, Fouzi Lekjaa, to motivate the players in the months leading up to CAN, which will take place June 7-30 in Cameroon. Fouzi Lekjaa has set himself the goal of winning the Africa Cup, long awaited since the last trophy won by the Atlas Lions in 1976 in Ethiopia.

Rabat – After 17 years of state control and self-imposed seclusion and silence, Osama bin Laden’s family has finally agreed to an interview. Nearly two decades after Osama bin Laden, a Saudi national, brought global terrorism to new heights on 9/11, altering the course of the 21st century, what legacy has he left for his close associates and country? What side of him does his close family remember? An ambivalent legacy In a recent interview with the Guardian’s Martin Chulov, bin Laden’s mother, Alia Ghanem, spoke of a beloved son. She recalled a kindhearted, passionate, and smart boy, though she complained about the distance—both physical and emotional—that bin Laden’s political convictions created between them. “My life was very difficult because he was far away from me. He was a very good kid and he loved me so much.” But what about the other side, the one that terrified the world on 9/11? What memory does she keep of a son whom many in the world now associate with the bloodiest terror strike in contemporary history?  For all the negative repercussions that 9/11 has had on the family’s life—from travel bans to tighter state control of movement inside the Saudi kingdom—Ghanem still harbors memories of a shy, academically gifted, and devout boy. Osama’s misfortune was that his path crossed that of a “cult” whose members indoctrinated him and put him on a wrong path when he was still an impressionable young man, she said.  “The people at the university changed him. He became a different man.” Ghanem was referring to bin Laden’s formative years while studying economics at King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia’s commercial capital. “He was a very good child until he met some people who pretty much brainwashed him in his early 20s. You can call it a cult. They got money for their cause. I would always tell him to stay away from them, and he would never admit to me what he was doing, because he loved me so much.” The two Osamas If anything, the man who masterminded the epoch-defining strike that claimed nearly 3,000 lives on September 11, 2001, has left a mixed legacy: a martyr and freedom fighter to many and a bloodthirsty, vengeful terrorist to many more. Osama’s family, too, is ambivalent about how to remember him, despite his mother’s denial of his darker side that makes her most uncomfortable. Hassan, one of Osama’s younger brothers, said that their mother cannot blame Osama because of her motherly love for him. He said that Ghanem only knew the “good side” of her son, and she “blames those around him.”  Hassan added: “Everyone who met him in the early days respected him. At the start, we were very proud of him. Even the Saudi government would treat him in a very noble, respectful way.” But that was the 1970s, and Osama was fighting for what many at the time called a just and noble cause, risking his life to liberate Afghanistan from the grip of communism. For Hassan, his memory of Osama from those years is one of a kind and affectionate brother he looked up to and wanted to emulate. But Osama’s early years of political engagement were also that of a “proud” freedom fighter that Saudis and others in the Muslim world revered and admired, the brother suggested.  “And then came Osama the mujahid” Hassan said, referring to his brother as a struggler. He said Osama attained “global stardom” fighting for the wrong cause, “all for nothing.” “There are two Osama bin Ladens. One before the end of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, and one after it,” Turki al-Faisal, former chief of Saudi intelligence, told the Guardian. “Before, he was very much an idealistic mujahid. He was not a fighter.” Transcending bin Laden “Bin Laden’s legacy remains one of the Kingdom’s most pressing issues,” the Guardian’s report noted of Saudi Arabia’s and the bin Laden family’s decision to finally agree to an interview. While Saudi Arabia seeks to salvage its bruised reputation of condoning terrorism by casting Osama as an “outcast” rather than a “Saudi agent,” the bin Laden family wants to transcend the lasting clouds of a kinsman’s haunting past.  But then there is Hamza bin Laden, Osama’s 29-year-old son, who has vowed to avenge his father’s death. Hamza is now a prominent figure in his father’s organization, and the US last year designated him “a global terrorist.” When asked about the family’s relationship with Hamza, his uncle Hassan said: “We thought everyone was over this. Then the next thing I knew, Hamza was saying, ‘I am going to avenge my father.’ I don’t want to go through that again. If Hamza was in front of me now, I would tell him, ‘God guide you. Think twice about what you are doing. Don’t retake the steps of your father. You are entering horrible parts of your soul.’” Mohammad Bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s 32-year-old crown prince, has been lauded for the kingdom’s recent liberal-minded reforms, including the extension of the right to drive to women and the re-introduction of cinema. (The Western media profusely commented on the Saudi Arabia screening of Black Panther in April.) But it remains to be seen whether both the bin Laden family and the Saudi kingdom can really leave behind and once and for all push to the side the perennial legacy of global terrorism’s godfather.

By Mohamed Brahimi “You have an amazing country” this pretty much sums up the sentiment that is echoed by all students and professors that we have had the fortune to accompany to Morocco under the banner of Glocal Impacts. We are convinced that Morocco should be at the top of everyone’s bucket list. Despite all the hiccups that we work hard to manage, despite all the price gauging that occasionally happen when we are not around to set things straight with some greedy unscrupulous vendors. Despite the careless restaurateurs who could care less about sanitation and quality. Despite some in the hospitality sectors who seem to be so color blind that they can’t tell a white sheet from one that is too old and too stained that it turned brown. Despite all of that, Morocco still commends the love and the infatuation to most who visit. As a native of Morocco, I can totally understand the infatuation. Moroccans are far beyond kind and generous to foreign visitors. Always aiming to please!! Morocco is home to some historical sites that are just awe inspiring. I happen to have a very warm spot in my heart for the city of Fes. I can feel my heart expand merely for spotting of the highway blue billboard sign as we approach the city. I spent two glorious years of my life in Dahr Al Mahraz studying Jurisprudence at the hand of top scholars like Abdelkarim Daoudi and Abu AL Waleed Al Marini. Walking the labyrinth of the old city has always felt like a treat and a privilege that I never took for granted. The work that the Naji family is doing with artisans at Moresque is to be lauded. Unfortunately, this ancient city is being forsaken by those who don’t have the slightest idea about the value of a city that the UNESCO has designated as preserved world heritage. Singling out Fes should not give one the impression that it is the only forgotten city. My own city, Casablanca is pushed to the fringes and so is Sale and the entire North and South East… etc. Fes, however, remains a place worthy of all care and attention. The city has adversely been affected by rural migration and those who have their interest above the value of the city that ought not to be compromised regardless the personal gains. People speak of several security slip ups that the city has done very little to reign in.
While I sound very disheartened by all of this, I still think that Fes is a city that can be saved if there is enough political will to do so. In representing Glocal Impacts, we can’t think of a better city to visit and we can’t deny that our students love it. But I know this to be a lackluster performance on the part of the people in charge. This is way beneath what Fes is. The city deserves much much more.

Rabat – Kechbal, one of Morocco’s most popular comedians, died at the age of 86 in his home city Settat. Ali Bachar, who used the stage name Kechbal, died Thursday morning following a long illness, according to his family. In 1950, Kechbal and his nephew Mohammed Bachar, who called himself Zeroual, formed the famous comedy duo “Kechbal and Zeroual.” Kechbal and Zeroual were both born in 1932 and worked as farmers in Settat, 80 kilometers south of Casablanca, where Zeroual is currently living. The endearing duo were known to the public since the early 1950s but became especially popular in the 1970s and 1980s. They guest-starred in several comedy and music programs that were broadcast on Moroccan television every Saturday night. The two comedians began their artistic career in “halqa” (a circle theatre or street show) in the big souks (markets) of the Chaouia region in central Morocco. They quickly achieved great success, especially in wedding ceremonies in Settat. Both comedians began to feature in public shows across Morocco. In the 1970s, Kechbal and Zeroual started recording cassettes of their songs and shows in the Ain Chok studios in Casablanca. Kechbal and Zeroual combined gags with music in their shows. Kechbal played the “loutar,” a traditional Moroccan instrument and sang and chanted comedy songs about everyday social issues. Zeroual played the “bendir” (a wooden-framed drum), another famous Moroccan traditional instrument used mostly by traditional music bands.  According to Aujourd’hui le Maroc, Kechbal was married twice and had a total of 10 children, the youngest of whom is only 13. He had 7 children with his first wife. After her death, he married again and had three more children. “My children give me the joy of living. I forget everything when I’m with my little Selma,” Kechbal told Aujourd’hui le Maroc in 2007. When asked about their future, Kechbal said, “The most important thing is that you are satisfied with what you have. Our children have built their lives, they always come to see us and they are healthy.” “What more could anyone want?” he added. In 2013, the Moroccan Association for the Protection of Heritage paid tribute to the comedy duo in its national loutar festival. “Last year, we were eager to honor Kechbal but he was not able to overcome his illness. The next edition of the Loutar Festival will be in honor of Kechbal,” Abdallah Chakhs, president of the association told Telquel on Thursday. The association organizes the “Loutar Festival: Rhythms of Morocco” in Settat. Although Kechbal and Zeroual were once considered prominent figures inside and outside Morocco, Chakhs said, they have not been given the recognition they deserve in their last days.

Rabat – Is Hakim Ziyech on the verge of leaving Ajax Amsterdam?  While Ziyech’s future remains a mystery, his relationship with his club has deteriorated.  The Atlas Lion was not happy to hear that the Dutch club replaced the number 10 jersey he always wore with number 22. The Moroccan football player learned of it through Ajax’s official website.  The Dutch club is not sure it will keep Ziyech, who has been rumored to possibly transfer to AS Roma, Olympique Lyon, and Arsenal. In the meantime, Ajax decided to give Ziyech’s number to one of their new players, Dusan Tadic.  The change might help the football player to make up his mind about his future career. Earlier this month, the Moroccan-Dutchman told Dutch outlet 11 Lions that he “is not sure to leave Ajax.” He added, “Football can be unpredictable.” Ajax is asking for €23 million to release its midfielder. Earlier this year, Ziyech was named best player of the year in Netherlands’ national league.  Ziyech chose to represent Morocco’s Atlas Lions when he had the opportunity to join the Netherlands’ team. The football player made his debut with Morocco in a friendly match against Côte d’Ivoire in October 2015.

Rabat – Is Morocco a reliable partner for the EU in the organization’s bid to curb waves of irregular migrants? Even though European officials have not bluntly voiced their dissatisfaction with the North African kingdom’s performance on migration management, recent developments in Brussels suggested a discernible loss of confidence in Rabat’s efforts to limit the flow of irregular migration to Europe.  But while EU leaders hesitate, pondering whether Morocco is being helpful at all in Europe’s bid to contain and limit the number of people crossing to the continent, Mustapha El Khalfi, Morocco’s government spokesperon, is adamant that the country has doubled its commitment to the cooperation.  Instead, it is Brussels that has not been doing enough to acknowledge and adequately accompany the North African kingdom’s efforts, El Khalfi said on Friday, July 3, speaking to the press after a government council.  “Morocco is making great sacrifices alone and with its own means as the amount of the [EU’s financial] support remains below the kingdom’s efforts.”  Morocco’s performance has improved Whereas El Khalfi’s defense of Morocco’ migration policy was in many ways a direct response to the mounting skepticism in Brussels about Morocco’s partnership on migration, the spokesperson is believed to have been directly addressing the Spanish government’s most recent request that “Morocco should deliver better results.”  According to El Khalfi, Morocco’s performance has markedly improved in thwarting migration attempts, making it quite unclear why the EU is asking for better results. “The number of thwarted migration attempts has doubled in 2017 when compared to the figures of previous years,” he said. He explained that Moroccan authorities stopped more than 65,000 migration attempts in 2017, up from 32,000 the previous year.  Instead of giving the kingdom stern lectures on what to do, the EU needs to “push for a stronger cooperation of shared responsibility,” the Moroccan official suggested. He also urged Brussels to revise its position and ensure that “the financial compensation matches the kingdom’s efforts.” The Spain dilemma On Thursday, July 26, more than 600 migrants forced their way over the border to Spain through Ceuta, a Spanish enclave bordering Morocco. The following day, a boat with 30 irregular migrants onboard landed at a beach in Tarifa, southern Spain, causing shock among sunbathers.  The second incident was essential in sparking debates about Morocco-EU cooperation on migration, especially after the Spanish interior ministry said in an official statement that the number of irregular migrants entering Spain through Morocco reached a record high in 2018.  The ministry estimated that over 20,000 migrants have so far entered Spain in 2018. Spain has now overtaken Italy as the number one entry point for irregular migrants, giving Rabat’s critics grounds to cast doubts on the kingdom’s commitment to the partnership on migration. On July 31, German outlet Deutsche Welle headlined that Morocco is “a risky parter for the EU on migration.”  As the closure of the Balkan route—a migration path to continental Europe that passed through Turkey and southeast Europe—has left the North African path as the “most popular” entry point to Europe, Moroccan authorities must put more efforts into reducing the massive flow of irregular migrants, the German newspaper suggested. Deutsche Welle wrote: “Since the majority of the migrants arriving in Spain are coming through Morocco, EU leaders want the North African country’s government to play a greater role in stemming the flow of people.” What does Brussels want? But what does Brussels really want from Morocco? Are the recent developments in Spain a pretext to lecture Morocco and force it to be more accommodating of earlier EU requests that Morocco had declined? Is there a far bigger iceberg hiding beneath Brussels’ complaints of laxity on Morocco’s part? “For the past 15 years, the EU has been pushing hard for a deal that would see some of the migrants who came to the continent via Morocco returned there,” Deutsche Welle noted. More recently, in late June, differences between Rabat and Brussels came to the fore as another point of divergence was added to the decade-long stalemate regarding the return of some irregular migrants to Morocco.  Brussels had asked for the outsourcing of migration reception centers to Morocco and some other North African countries.  To stop the increasing flow of migrants in the Mediterranean path to Europe, Brussels demanded that Rabat take the same role Ankara took in 2016 to stem the flow of migrants in the Balkans.  In 2016, Turkey and the EU agreed that Ankara should hold migrants seeking to cross to Europe in return for various political privileges and a financial compensation of €5 billion, and the EU wanted almost the same deal for Rabat. But that offer, too, was declined. “Morocco rejects and has always rejected these kinds of methods for managing the issue of migration,” Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s foreign affairs minister, said in June. Back to square one Only after rounds of discussion and hesitation did Brussels finally decide to disburse more funds to assist Morocco.  A €55 million plan has been earmarked to help Morocco and Tunisia, with the bulk of the funds expected to go to Rabat. And according to the European Commission, the decision to heed Morocco’s requests “is only the start of a longer term operation.” “We are fully aware of the needs as conveyed by Morocco that require much higher financial effort and we are prepared to deliver this,” Mina Andreeva, the EU Commission’s spokeswoman, told reporters on August 1. On August 3, Pedro Sanchez, the Spanish prime minister, announced Spain’s €30 million “national plan” to tackle migration and the “deeply concerning flow of migrants.”  The announcement called for more coordination between Spanish authorities for a “better handling of migration.” Sanchez also pointed out the “necessity” of “stronger dialogue and cooperation with Morocco.” According to the Spanish prime minister, Morocco is “a fundamental ally” in Spain’s bid to “manage and contain” the flow of migrants.

Rabat – Morocco’s minister of education has decided to reintroduce the teaching of philosophy to high school students. Minister of Education Said Amzazi wrote to directors of regional academies for education and vocational training, calling for them to “give instructions to high school directors within academies they are managing to generalize the teaching of philosophy in all professional Baccalaureate fields.” The decision will go into effect in the 2018-2019 academic year for first year Baccalaureate students. In the 2019-2020 academic year, second year Baccalaureate students will also be taught philosophy.  The purpose of the schedule is to prepare students for standardized exams for the professional Baccalaureate 2019-2020. High school students in vocational programs will be taught the same philosophy content and receive the same number of hours as students in the scientific and technical fields. In 2017, the content of the controversial “Manar” Islamic education textbooks sparked anger from the Moroccan Association of Philosophy Teachers. The teachers found the text’s views on philosophy offensive. The association also viewed the content as a call for fanaticism, inertia, and extremism. In response, the Ministry of Education removed philosophy classes from the professional Baccalaureate.

Rabat – British actor Sacha Baron Cohen, known for his role as “Borat,” is currently filming in Morocco.  The actor is shooting scenes for a new Netflix show called “The Spy,” according to Arabic news outlet Hespress.  The six-episode series is being filmed in several locations in the kingdom, including Rabat, Sale, Kenitra, and Fez.  In April, a recruitment agency in Casablanca was looking for actors and extras—men and women, Arabs and Europeans of all ages—for the brand new show. The agency also posted a notice on social media explaining that the team for the American series was seeking actors in the kingdom.  The mini-series will focus on the journey of the Israeli spy Eli Cohen (interpreted by Sacha Baron Cohen) known for his actions in Egypt and Syria in the 1950s. Eli Cohen spied for Israel in Damascus in the 1960s. Cohen’s cover was blown, and Syria publicly hanged him in 1965.

Rabat – Mio Sugita, a member of the Japanese parliament, has sparked a wave of criticism by calling LGBT people “unproductive.” The controversy-prone MP from the parliament’s lower house argued in a recent article that taxpayer money should not be used to support same-sex couples because they are unproductive and of no use to Japanese society, the Guardian reported.  They “don’t produce children,” Sugita’s article said of same-sex couples. She added: “In other words, they lack productivity and, therefore, do not contribute to the prosperity of the nation.” Sugita, a member of the incumbent Liberal and Democratic Party (LDP) and an ally of Prime Minister Abe, has not offered an apology for her remarks, despite the shock and the nationwide criticism her article has caused. A statement from her office has said, however, that the MP “took the matter seriously.” While Sugita is not new to political firestorms—she once said that the use of sex slaves by Japanese soldiers during the second war, a historically documented fact, was a Korean fabrication—her LGBT comments were roundly dismissed by her own party. Expressing its commitment to diversity and respect for minority rights, the party said in a statement that they did not support the MP’s controversial article because “it shows her lack of understanding of (LGBT) issues and consideration for the feelings of the people involved.  Despite Prime Minister Abe subsequently saying that it is “natural to aim to create a society where human rights are respected and diversity is cherished,” the party’s perceived offhand attitude towards LGBT and minority issues ignited further criticism earlier this week when Tomu Tanigawa, another LDP MP, said that homosexuality was “a matter of choice.” When asked to comment on his “matter of choice” statement, Tanigawa offered a more ambivalent explanation, saying that while he did not oppose same-sex relationships, he disapproved of the legalization of same-sex marriages.  “A man and woman get married and have children. That is how a traditional family is formed,” Tanigawa said. “Humans have been doing so from antiquity to prevent nations from falling into decline and ruin.”

Rabat – Morocco’s human rights minister has declared that the worst day of his life was the day Taoufik Bouachrine was arrested. Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid said that when he first learned that the journalist and director of Akhbar Alyaoum newspaper was arrested, he could not sleep. Ramid commented on the arrest during a symposium themed “Human Rights in Morocco: Achievements and Challenges.”  The human rights minister said he spent the entire night making calls to find out why Bouachrine was arrested.  Bouachrine was arrested on February 28 and is facing heavy charges for of sexual harassment, gender-based violence, and rape. Prosecutors say they have 50 videos backing the charges against him. Ramid also revealed that he used to be Bouachrine’s personal lawyer for 10 years before he became a minister. Throughout the symposium, Ramid stressed that the cases of the two prominent journalists, Bouachrine and Hamid El Mahdaoui, are in the hands of justice, and he cannot intervene or exercise any authority as a human rights minister. A Casablanca court sentenced journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui on June 28 to 3 years of prison and a fine of MAD 20,000 for “inciting participation in a banned [Hirak Rif] protest” and “breaking the law through speeches and shouting in public places.” El Mahdaoui gave a speech to a crowd gathered at Place Mohammed VI in the Riffian city of Al Hoceima encouraging the public to take part in the July 20, 2017, protest which had been banned by the government. He was arrested later that same day. Fifty-three other Hirak activists and journalists, including the protest’s leader Nasser Zefzafi, were sentenced from 1 to 20 years.

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat – Over 10 years, Morocco is expected to decrease its current deficit with limited risk to its external finances.  “Morocco’s current account deficit will narrow gradually over the coming decade thanks to strong exports of manufactured goods and tourism services. Meanwhile, external stability will be aided by relatively large FDI [foreign direct investment] stocks and small amounts of short-term debt,” according to Fitch Solutions Macro Research in their August 2 report. “Meanwhile, external stability will be aided by relatively large FDI stocks and small amounts of short-term debt,” the report continues. While Morocco’s financial debts to the global system will be long term, a result of “persistent current account deficits,” Fitch believes “risk of a balance of payments crisis will remain low.” While Morocco’s FDI stocks and low-volatility accounts are dominant and hence stabilizing its net external liabilities, it’s Net International Investment Position (NIIP) remains negative. The kingdom has become increasingly attractive to businesses and its politics have remained relatively stable, garnering more attention from foreign investors. Additionally, a new government reform includes a “five-year corporate tax exemption for new industrial companies,” according to Fitch. The government is also promoting the extension and creation of free trade zones in upcoming years as valuable economic hubs. Fitch expanded, “We believe the external debt stock will shrink over the coming decade largely thanks to a narrowing fiscal deficit, which we forecast at 1.5% of GDP in 2027, down from 3.6% in 2018. While this downward trend will be moderated by continued strong debt uptake in state-owned enterprises, we see a potential for this counter-weighing effect to diminish if the government pushes ahead with planned privatisations, as this would likely impose greater financial prudence on these entities.” However, Fitch warns of potential risks. Currently oil prices are fluctuating heavily, and as the “MENA region’s largest net oil importer,” Morocco could potentially be at the mercy of the oil market if prices soar. “Any stronger-than-expected recovery in prices over the coming decade would, therefore, have a negative impact on the country’s current account balance. Furthermore, with most exports (68.3% in 2017) going to Europe, Morocco’s external sector remains largely at the mercy of European demand. While ongoing efforts to diversify trade towards Africa will moderate this risk somewhat over the long term, we believe the majority of trade activity will still be directed at Europe, leaving exports vulnerable to an economic downturn among Morocco’s main European trading partners.”

He came back to where it all started. Rabat – Moroccan footballer Faycal Fajr has left the Spanish league and Getafe to play again for French club Stade Malhereb Caen (SMC) where he played 2011-2014.  The Atlas Lion will play alongside another Moroccan football player, Yacine Bammou, who joined the club recently with a 4-year contract. Bammou was actually the one who teased Fajr’s return to SMC by sharing a video of his introduction to the club.  Fajr, who turned 30 on Wednesday, has left Spain’s La Liga to be close to his family. The decision pleased his coach Fabien Mercadal who spoke positively of his return. “He is a player that I have enjoyed a lot for a very, very long time since I was already following him when he was in Frejus. If we can bring a boy like that, I think it’s a good recruitment from a technical point of view but also from a human point of view. It fits totally with what I was looking for,” he said. “It’s a chance for us to have a player like him. He can play a lot of positions, he hits the set pieces very well. I know you know him in Caen, but you knew him at one point in his career when he was not at the top. He has progressed since.” Originally from Rouen and trained in Le Havre, Fajr played in Ligue 1 at the Malherbe stadium in the 2011-2012 season, before playing two seasons in Ligue 2, contributing to the rise of the elite of red and blue in 2014. An offensive midfielder, Fajr then left for Spain, playing nearly 140 games in La Liga with Elche, Deportivo La Coruna, and Getafe, which allowed him to become a Moroccan international in 2015.

Rabat – Although Morocco has no official diplomatic ties with Israel, the North African country traded $37 million worth of goods with Israel in 2017 according to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). The Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs published data through its Arabic Facebook page revealing data about its trade with some Arab and Islamic countries, based on CBS statistics. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Israel maintains a network of trade relations with many Arab and Islamic countries, including countries that do not have diplomatic ties with Israel, asserting that trade relations serve the interests of both countries. Morocco’s trade with Israel in 2017 dropped by $21 million compared to 2016, including imports and exports by both countries. According to CBS data, Morocco’s imports from Israel totaled $22 million compared to $41 million in 2016. Moroccan exports to Israel were valued at $15 million in 2017 against $17 million in 2016.  According to CBS statistics for 2017, Morocco ranked third among Arab countries trading with Israel. Jordan ranked the first as its exports to Israel totaled $278 million and imports nearly $57 million. Israel’s imports from Egypt reached $64 million while its exports amounted to $84 million to Egypt. Based on this value, Egypt had the second highest amount of trade for an Arab country with Israel. Turkey remained the Islamic state with the most foreign trade with Israel. The value of Turkey’s total exports to Tel Aviv was $2.856 billion while its imports reached $1.410 billion. Indonesia’s imports from Israel were valued at $82 million while its exports reached $48 million. Notably, CBS data cannot be accessed from a Moroccan IP address. Israel imports by selected countries in the period 2012-2017  Morocco-Israeli cooperation Overall, Moroccans object vociferously to any normalization of relations with Israel, and Morocco has no official diplomatic ties with the Jewish entity. After the US transferred its embassy to Jerusalem, many Moroccan parliamentarians asked for a vote on a draft bill to criminalize normalization with Israel. The bill states that “anyone who contributes to, participates in or attempts to commit acts of normalization with Israel shall receive a sentence ranging from 2 to 5 years in prison and shall pay a fine of between MAD 100,000 and MAD 1 million.” “The court may judge those convicted of one of the penalties provided for in Article 36 of the Criminal Code.” According to Einat Levy of Mitvim, the Israel Institute for Regional Foreign Policies, “There are many contacts [between Israel and Morocco], both open and secret, in almost every field you could think of.” In an article published by Levy on Israeli outlet Yedioth Ahronoth, the researcher praised the Morocco-Israeli cooperation and stated there are many collaborations taking place between Israel and Morocco, including agriculture. “Significant cooperation, albeit limited, can also be found in agriculture. Morocco supplies Israel with agricultural products such as sardines and olives, while Israel supplies Morocco with professional knowledge and technological equipment such as Netafim irrigation systems, which also operates a Facebook page for the Moroccan public.” El Khalfi denied trade with Israel According to the World Israel News, 30,000 Israeli tourists visited Morocco in 2017. The Israeli outlet also quoted a significantly higher level of Moroccan exports to Israel than the CBS: “Moroccan exports to Israel have gone from $5 million to $25 million in the past five years.” Early last month, Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi asserted, “Morocco does not have any relations of any kind with Israel” after media reported a five-time increase in trade between Morocco Israel over the past five years. “With regard to what is stated in some reports on our country’s exports to Israel, I confirm that Morocco has no official relations of any kind,” he added.

Rabat – Moroccan football player Ayoub El Kaabi has made an impressive debut at China’s Hebei Fortune club. It did not take long for the 25-year-old Atlas Lion to show the extent of his talent. RSB Berkane’s former player scored his first goal in China, Thursday, August 2.  Despite losing to Beijing Guoan (6-3), the international football player can be proud of his beautiful performance. Earlier this month, El Kaabi joined the Chinese league by signing a two-year contract with Hebei Fortune. Morocco’s striker left the Moroccan league for the Chinese championship after scoring 12 goals last season for RSB Berkane. The club agreed to let go of one of its best players for almost €6 million. Throughout 2018, El Kaabi proved his worth. At the African Nations Championship (CHAN) 2018, the Moroccan sensation was the top scorer in the history of the competition. His performance helped him secure a spot among the 23 Moroccan players selected to play in the World Cup. El Kaabi made his international debut for Morocco on January 13 during the 2018 CHAN match against Mauritania, scoring 3 goals. The RSB Berkane striker was named Man of the Match on January 31 in the Morocco-Libya semi-final of CHAN. Morocco won the game 3-1. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) chose El Kaabi as the best player in CHAN 2018 due to the world-class performance and pure talent he displayed in the tournament, scoring 9 goals in 5 matches.

Rabat – Morocco’s BNPJ summoned Amal El Houari, a journalist and alleged victim, for the Taoufik Bouachrine case on Thursday. The National Brigade of the Judicial Police (BNPJ) allegedly summoned El Houari for investigation. When previously summoned, she was found hiding in a car trunk owned by one of the other alleged victims, who filed complaints in February against journalist Taoufik Bouachrine for alleged sexual assault and violent rape. The car, according to a statement issued by Rabat’s public prosecutor on June 6, was parked in front of a house owned by a member of Bouachrine’s defense team. Local news outlets, including H24, said the house belonged to Bouachrine’s lawyer, Mohammed Ziane. According to the statement, the alleged victim hid in the car trunk to avoid a court hearing. The public prosecutor then ordered the arrest of El Houari. The alleged victim was released on June 8. Commenting on BNPJ’s recent request for investigation, Ziane said, “If the public prosecution has initiated a prosecutor in this matter, my sons and I should have been summoned but that is not the case.” He told H24 that according to “the law of criminal procedure, the refusal of a court summons is punishable by a fine and is not criminal.” “I think the prosecutor’s office is doing a new episode like what it did in the Afaf El Bernani’s case. I think they will accuse her of not denouncing a slander. And the slander in this case is that she was raped by Bouachrine, but we will see,” he said. Bernani is another alleged victim of Bouachrine. In April, Casablanca’s Court of First Instance gave Bernani a six-month sentence for accusing the BNPJ of falsifying her statement against Bouachrine. In March, the public prosecutor of Casablanca’s Court of Appeal, Najim Bensami, announced in a press conference his intention to prosecute Bernani. He told the press that Bernani confirmed that she was sexually harassed by Bouachrine and that the police have a video of her initial statement, in which she allegedly confirmed that she was assaulted. El Houari denied that she lodged a complaint against Bouachrine, who is still facing charges for his alleged sexual assaults on other journalists at his office.  El Houari, who has deactivated her Facebook, wrote a post emphasizing that Bouachrine never tried to rape her. “He did not rape me, he did not try to rape me and I had never had a sexual relationship with him, and I did not even file a complaint. I don’t know where all these things come from,” the journalist wrote. Bouachrine’s case is still ongoing. He will appear before the court again on September 10. Since his arrest in February, Bouachrine along with his defense team, have denied the accusations filed against him. However, authorities have alleged that they have more than 50 tapes supporting the charges filed against him.

Rabat – The UN envoy to Western Sahara is expected to hold a meeting at the Security Council on developments in Western Sahara. The UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy to Western Sahara Horst Kohler requested the meeting, expected to take place next week behind closed doors, according to the Spanish news agency EFE. The discussion will follow Kohler’s round of visits in Morocco’s Rabat and Laayoune in June. He also visited the other parties to the conflict—Algeria and Mauritania—to deepen his understanding of the case. On July 1, Kohler expressed satisfaction with his visit to the region, emphasizing that he met with many people and “visited different places.” Kohler also applauded the progress and development in the region, especially in economic and social spheres. The personal envoy expressed determination to work with all parties to the conflict to find a mutually acceptable political solution to the 40-year dispute over Western Sahara. Kohler also met with officials in Morocco’s southern provinces, who reaffirmed that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is the only solution. The personal envoy visited the regional human rights commissions’ headquarters in Laayoune and Dakhla, cities in Western Sahara. The regional tour came after the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2414 on April 27, which reaffirmed support for the United Nations mission to agree upon and mutually acceptable political solution. The resolution also extended the mandate of the UN Mission for Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for six months. The resolution also urged Algeria to contribute to the UN-led political process. The resolution’s demand backed Morocco’s recent calls to Algeria to make an important contribution to the process and to engage more strongly to progress toward a political solution.

Rabat – “We must be able to complete our country’s achievements despite obstacles,” said Head of Government El Othmani in Casablanca. While speaking Wednesday at the opening of the 14th session of the National Assembly of the Justice and Development Party (PJD), El Othmani said that his government is currently prioritizing education, health, and employment to achieve the targeted reform. During the forum, attended by representatives from several Arab and African countries—including Jordan, Algeria, Tunisia, Sudan, Chad, and Mauritania—El Othmani said his government will revolutionize the education sector and will soon announce important procedures in the employment sector. El Othmani added that there are certain political bodies that do not care about citizens’ involvement in politics and try to exhaust all serious attempts to address corruption. El Othmani, who is also the leader of the Islamist PJD, claimed there is a ferocious media war against his party. The PJD attempts to counterattack the so-called media war with the “necessary vigilance.” Additionally, PJD’s national secretary, Mohamed Amzaz, called for “protecting the democratic opinion and facing defections with the necessary determination.”  “A real democracy cannot be established with the absence of independency within political bodies,” added Amzazi. Over the course of a week, with one forum per day, the PJD assembly will discuss topics related to democracy, reform strategies, and the Moroccan experience in economy, education, and human rights. Realities on the ground The three sectors El Othmani says he prioritizes present great challenges to Morocco. According to figures from research group BMI, the current unemployment rate in Morocco is on the rise, up from 9.9 percent to 10.5 percent between 2016 and 2018.  The high unemployment rate is due to several factors. First, employment in the agriculture and public sector, which constitute 40 percent of the country’s formal employment, has declined. Secondly, the poor education system has led to high unemployment. In the health sector, the main issue to be addressed is the lack of doctors and nurses, especially in rural areas. Morocco is suffering from a shortage of 32,000 doctors and 64,000 nurses. Health coverage (RAMED) is also an important challenge to be faced. At its launch, RAMED covered 8.5 million beneficiaries; by August 2017, it now must assist more than 12 million beneficiaries. In the education sector, only 71.7 percent of the population can read and write, while just 64.4 percent of the working-age population has completed secondary education or above. Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi has unveiled his new national education plan which focuses on totally reforming the sector.  The new plan aims to develop infrastructure and staff, rethink pedagogy, expand student enrollment and accessible education, support students against violence, and reform education in the private sector.

Rabat – Two days after the King dismissed Morocco’s minister of economy and finance, the government has not revealed the reasons behind the royal decision. Following Thursday’s weekly cabinet meeting in Rabat, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi refused to give details behind the decision of King Mohammed VI to sack Mohamed Boussaid. He told the press that he had “nothing to add to the royal statement.” King Mohammed VI’s royal cabinet issued a statement on Wednesday announcing the monarch’s decision to dismiss the minister. El Khalfi said that Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani had signed a decree to appoint an acting economy minister, but he did not name the official. Speculations have abounded that Abdelkader Amara, who is already holding the position of minister of transport, will replace Boussaid. Since the dismissal, thousands of Moroccans have been asking why Boussaid was dismissed.  Some have linked the King’s decision to Boussaid’s remarks on a major boycott against three prominent companies and high prices, as the sacked minister described people supporting the boycott as “morons.” Other theories have also been circulating. Several Moroccan news outlets and newspapers dedicated their headlines to the royal decision. Akhbar Al Yaoum reported that the royal decision instilled fear among El Othmani’s cabinet, who are now waiting for more potential announcements. According to the newspaper, the dismissal was expected as King Mohammed VI summoned his ministers for a meeting on Sunday in Al Hoceima before his customary Throne Day speech. An unidentified source quoted in Akhbar Al Yaoum said that Boussaid’s absence from the Throne Day ceremony in Tangier was notable. According to another source cited by the same newspaper, Boussaid was actually in the Tangier royal palace during the ceremony, but he was having a meeting. The source added that Boussaid might have been informed of his dismissal at the Monday ceremony in Tangier. Observers, according to the newspaper, analyzed the King’s decision as a “follow-up” to the 2017 political earthquake when the King fired four ministers for irregularities in development projects in Al Hoceima called Manarat Al Mutawassit. However, Boussaid’s dismissal can also be referred to the recent reports issued by both Bank Al Maghrib, Morocco’s central bank, and the Court of Auditors. On the eve of Throne Day, on July 29, the head of Bank al Maghrib, Abdellatif Jouahri, and the president of Morocco’s Court of Auditors, Driss Jettou, presented the King with their 2017 annual reports on Morocco’s financial situation in 2017. Both reports showed that social disparities are still an issue that hampers Morocco’s development. Moroccan newspaper Al Massae backed Akhbar Al Yaoum’s arguments. The newspaper claimed that the King’s decision came after his evaluation of the country’s development programs, which have failed to meet social demands. Ministry of Economy is the core of the cabinet According to the newspaper’s sources, the Ministry of Economy and Finance is the core of the cabinet as it is the body specializing in funding projects estimated at billions of dirhams. In his 2017 report, Jouahri denounced the unemployment rate and the increase of internal debt by 4.8 percent, while external debt increased by 7.2 percent. Business expert Rachid Ourzar told Akhbar Al Yaoum that the Ministry of Economy is the most important department in every government. “Whoever manages the ministry monitors the whole government, and of course affects public policies,” he added. According to Akhbar Al Yaoum, Morocco’s Ministry of Economy, led by Boussaid since 2013, minimized development programs, investment, and small enterprises. The newspaper added that Boussaid had also failed to attract foreign investment. Despite many multinational companies operating in Morocco, foreign direct investments (FDI) declined by 33.1 percent in the first six months of 2018 against a rise of 24 percent in 2017. Morocco’s development model has also not improved, despite the King’s multiple calls in his recent speeches. On the eve of Throne Day, the King made it clear to the government that he is not satisfied with either the delay of development projects or the current development model, which has failed to answer the demands of citizens. The speech caused the head of government to reiterate his calls for his ministers to increase their efforts to implement projects. The government has also launched an investigation into the delayed projects, promising to recover “lost funds.” El Othmani said that the cabinet will appoint a staff of auditors to investigate a number of projects in the coming weeks to learn why they have been delayed and ensure that the money allocated was not used for other purposes, Assabah reported today. The government made similar promises in the aftermath of the 2017 political earthquake. Moroccans are waiting to see whether the cabinet will roll up its sleeves and implement the long-awaited programs to curb social disparities.

Rabat – Despite reforms, Morocco’s pension fund deficit is expected to increase to MAD 36.4 billion by 2045. Since 2014, the Moroccan pension fund (CMR) has been facing a deficit, according to a report on social protection by the Economic, Social, and Environmental Council (CECE). According to the CECE report, the National Social Security Fund (CNSS) will operate on a “technical” deficit starting in 2018 and a total deficit in 2027. Its reserves will be bankrupt in 2044. Reform is needed to ensure long-term financial balance. The same source stressed that Morocco’s gap in social protection is due to the lack of many factors, namely, common political vision, a formal strategy, an integrated accounting system and a unified system of information regarding social protection. The report also stated other causes including poor coordination between state institutions particularly the government, ministries of finance, employment, social Affairs, family and, solidarity, and the Supreme Council of Accounts. The two major pension funds for government employees are CMR and the Collective Retirement Benefit Scheme (RCAR). The CNSS covers private sector employees. The Oxford Business Group (OBG) painted an even bleaker picture than CECE. According to an OBG report, CMR will become bankrupt by 2021. CNSS and RCAR could collapse by 2021 and 2037, respectively. To prevent CMR’s collapse, the government had begun to raise the retirement age for most government employees from 60 to 62, beginning in July 2015. The retirement age was set to be gradually raised—by six months every year—until it reaches 65 years. In 2013, Abdelilah Benkirane, then head of government, said, “Our pension systems are at stake. No one wants to reach a situation like in Greece…. Of course we will negotiate with unions, but raising the retirement age is an obligation to avoid a collapse disaster.” In 2016, the Benkirane Moroccan government reformed the pension system established in 1971 by taking gradual measures. The reform planned to gradually increase the retirement age from 62 to 63 over three years, starting January 1, 2017. It also aims to gradually increase the pension contributions (now 12 percent) of both employees’ salaries and employers to 14 percent in January 2019. Despite their economic and social importance to the state and citizens, Moroccan pension systems and compulsory social security systems currently cover just over 40 percent of the total working population, according to CECE. Contributors to pension system are mainly civil servants, employees of state-owned companies, and private sector employees. Those not covered include freelancers, entrepreneurs, and workers in the informal sector—particularly in agriculture, handicrafts, and small cooperatives. Individuals who do not work because of accidents or being fired are also not covered, as well as unworking divorced spouses whose former spouses may be covered. According to CECE’s 2018 report, the rise in the number of pensioners and the decline in the number of contributors to the pension will make today’s young people bear the financial burden. The government will be forced to raise the retirement age, increase required pension contributions, or reduce pensions. Although the system’s reserves can make up the deficit until 2027, the CECE claimed that the 2016 reform will not resolve the deficit, which necessitates the government find ways to fund the system in the near future. Speaking to King Mohammed VI on Sunday, Abdellatif Jouahri, the governor of Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM), Morocco’s central bank, said the measures the government implemented to reform the pension system in 2016 were “only a first step providing a temporary treatment.” “The number of pensioners gradually accelerates the depletion of the CNSS’s resources and thus stresses the urgent need to embark on the next steps to complete comprehensive reform in a way that ensures the sustainability of the pension system.” CECE made several specific recommendations for pension reforms. It recommended the unification of the three pension funds within a period of 5 to 7 years. It also recommended that elderly people who do not benefit from a pension should be given a minimum income equal to the poverty threshold. CECE also called for the establishment of a “compulsory basic public pension system” to include all workers from both public and private sectors.

By Isabella Wang Rabat- The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has partnered with Moroccan company Gaia Energy to develop renewable energy in Africa.  The partnership will create a joint platform which will enable the development of wind power and renewable energy projects in Africa. The venture will start with a pipeline of 22 projects in 9 countries in north, west, and east Africa, which will generate more than 3 gigawatts of energy. The platform will then seek to progressively enlarge to new countries across the continent.  Gaia Energy is a Moroccan renewable energy developer, currently active in 10 counties across the continent. The company’s mission is to develop and finance large scale renewable energy projects in emerging markets. Such a mission aligns with the IFC, a sister organization of the World Bank, the largest global development institution focused on the private sector of emerging markets. Moundir Zniber, founder and president of Gaia Energy, said “IFC’s expertise in financial structuring and mobilization, as well as its environmental and social safeguards ideally, complements Gaia’s tailor-made approach to develop projects in new markets. Our partnership is a key step in expanding our business in the countries where we are present, and hopefully beyond.” He continued that “IFC and Gaia share the same values and vision regarding sustainability and the importance of South/South Cooperation to build tomorrow’s Africa. Both work to power the continent through the adoption of renewable energies and sustainable development principles.” IFC InfraVentures, a $150 million global infrastructure project development fund, will fund the joint platform, advancing the World Bank Group’s efforts to increase the pipeline of bankable projects in developing countries.  Further support will come from the €114 million Finland-IFC Blended Finance for Climate Program, which aims to encourage private sector financing for climate change solutions.  David Donaldson, IFC head of InfraVentures for Sub-Saharan Africa stated, “Wind energy and renewable energy in general are priority areas identified in the World Bank Group’s strategy to advance climate solutions led by the private sector. IFC is pleased to partner with Gaia Energy and leverage a quality project pipeline in countries with strong wind potential.” Energy is critical to Africa’s development. Africa currently holds the largest concentration of people without electricity access: 650 million people on the continent do not have access to electricity. Increased investment in the energy sector will spur economic growth and also help close the energy deficit, a major impediment to the continent’s development.  Particularly, renewable energy offers an opportunity accelerate Africa’s access to clean, affordable electricity, while also improving public health by reducing pollution levels. Renewable energy will also create an environment conducive for a burgeoning economy by creating value chains for development and job creation.

By Isabella Wang Rabat – President Trump has proposed a security and political alliance in the Middle East.  Known formally as the Middle East Strategic Alliance, the proposed alliance would include the six Gulf Arab states—Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates—as well as Egypt and Jordan.   The White House confirmed that they have been working on the prospects of an alliance with “our regional partners now and have been for several months.” The plans arise after President Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia last year, where officials had raised the idea of a security pact.  Sources revealed to Reuters that the administration hopes to discuss the plans for the alliance at a summit, provisionally scheduled for Washington on October 12-13.  The proposed pan-Arab alliance is intended to foster deeper cooperation between the countries on military defense, training, and counter-terrorism and to strengthen economic and diplomatic ties, predicated upon the Sunni Muslim identity of the participating nations.  Antagonistic characterization of Iran Inherent to the proposed alliance is opposition to Iran.  Some are even calling it the “Arab NATO.” In the easy ring of the disyllabic nickname and the association to the familiar “NATO,” the Trump administration is constructing an analogous narrative in which the alliance would contend against Iran’s looming expansionist powers, likened to that of the Soviet Union.  As a spokesperson from the White House’s National Security Council said, “MESA will serve as a bulwark against Iranian aggression, terrorism, extremism, and will bring stability to the Middle East.”  Such rhetoric has been characteristic of the Trump administration. His foreign policy has depicted Iran as the sole source of instability and conflict in the Middle East. In his remarks on the Iran strategy on October 13, 2017, Trump outlined that Iran is a “dictatorship” which “remains the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism,” and “proliferates missiles,” and “fueled sectarian violence in Iraq, and vicious civil wars in Yemen and Syria,” holding a “sinister vision for the future.”  Similarly, his 2017 National Security Strategy described Iran as a “dictatorship” and “rogue state” which is “determined to destabilize regions, threaten Americans and our allies and brutalize [its] own people.”   Yet, the administration’s depiction of Iran has hyperbolically inflated the threat of Iran, portraying Iran as a sole catchall catalyst for the instability permeating the Middle East region.  While Iran has certainly sought to limit and undermine US influence in the region, many sources of instability in the Middle East are internal, entrenched in problems of ineffective governance and weak civil society. Exacerbation of sectarian conflict The rhetoric of an Arab NATO is predicated upon an ideological and religious divide, establishing a dichotomy between the “unified Sunni coalition” and Iran’s threatening Shi’ite expansionism.   It reaffirms the narrative prominently disseminated by the Arab Gulf states that Iran is pursuing a hegemonic design which undermines the legitimacy of their Sunni dynastic rule.  A senior Iranian official told Reuters, “Under the pretext of securing stability in the Middle East, Americans and their regional allies are fomenting tension in the region.” It would only be “deepening the gaps between Iran, its regional allies and the US-backed Arab countries.”   By constructing a narrative of Iran’s hostile expansionism, the rhetoric behind the alliance and the greater Trump administration only submerges the region into further sectarian conflict. The rhetoric defines the alliance as the countries involved by the proxy war of Saudi Arabia versus Iran and as the religious dichotomy of Sunni versus Shiite.  While Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are nations with dominant Sunni populations, majorities in Iraq and Bahrain as well as minorities in Kuwait are not Sunni. Egypt has only an insignificant Shia population, and Iran is only a tertiary concern.  The Arab NATO’s sole mission as a bulwark against Iran and its Shi’ite expansionism thus compels such countries to engage in a proxy war and sectarian conflict which does not align with or may even go against their interests. The US has focused upon the problems of Shia sectarianism in the Islamic Republic of Iran, but has not acknowledged concerns about Sunni sectarian bigotry and takfirist jihadi terrorism. The ideology has treated Shias as kuffar (unbelievers), mushrikin (idolaters) and rawafid (rejecters of Sunni orthodoxy).  Possibility of further military action? By constructing a narrative of Iran’s belligerence and the necessity for security, the proposal for an Arab NATO allows the US political cover to sponsor further militancy and intervention in the Middle East.  As part of Trump’s new “America First” policy, the White House exhorts its allies to play an active role in confronting regional security threats.  In a press briefing in 2017, H. R. McMaster, US National Security Advisor stated that Trump “will encourage our Arab and Muslim partners to take bold, new steps to promote peace and to confront those, from ISIS to al-Qaeda to the Assad regime, who perpetuate chaos and violence that has inflicted so much suffering throughout the Muslim world and beyond.” Currently, the most concrete part of the proposal is a US arms package for Saudi Arabia, which Trump announced in Riyadh in May last year. Although details have not been finalized, the deal will be incredibly lucrative for the US. Officials stated that the package will include between $98-$128 billion in arms sales and has the potential to reach $350 billion in total over 10 years.   The arms deal and the US ideological supporting of Saudi Arabia and the alliance establishes the political basis for possible further military assistance or interventions in the Middle East.  The consequences of such have already been demonstrated in Yemen. In late 2017, after Houthi rebels fired ballistic missiles at Saudi cities, the US sent special forces to the Saudi-Yemen border to aid the Saudi military in finding and destroying Houthi missile sites.  The clandestine mission has only escalated the US participation in the Saudi-led war. The war in Yemen has no end in sight, and the US’ military and logistical support of Saudi Arabia has only exacerbated the severity of the humanitarian crisis. Currently in Yemen more than 22 million people, 75 percent of the population, is in need of humanitarian aid. Further, at least 8 million Yemenis are on the brink of famine and 1 million are infected with cholera.  Is an alliance viable? The Middle East has already made many attempts to establish regional alliances, yet each has been undermined by the fractious geopolitics of the region.  The Gulf Cooperation Council, comprised of only the six Gulf monarchies, has struggled to agree on key security issues, ranging from Iran to Yemen and the role of political Islam.  Only a year ago in June did the Gulf Cooperation Council abruptly sever all diplomatic ties with Qatar. Qatar’s history with the Council had already been precarious. Tensions over Qatar’s on-and-off support of the Muslim Brotherhood and its long-standing disagreements on relations with Iran culminated in the April 2017 hostage crisis which saw Qatar negotiate with both Sunni and Shi’ite militants in Iraq and Syria. As a result, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt imposed a land, air, and sea embargo on Qatar.   There are also underlying divisions in the policies of Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. While Saudi Arabia, with its vast oil reserves and strengthening relationship with the US, views itself as a beacon of non-extremist Islam fighting against Iran and Islamist activists, the UAE also seeks regional leadership as a more economically and politically secure nation.  Their divergent perspectives on Yemen has also left the coalition between Saudi Arabia and UAE vulnerable.  Naysan Longley of the International Crisis Group stated, “Riyadh is converging with Yemen’s influential Yemeni Congregation for Reform, which is one of the branches of the Muslim Brotherhood, at a time when Abu Dhabi is opposed to any cooperation with this party.” The proposal for the alliance represents an effort to foster cooperation that transcends mere short-term parochial goals in Middle Eastern policy.  Yet nevertheless, the Middle East cannot be simplified into a dichotomous narrative of a neatly packaged Arab alliance against the hostility of Iran.  There are a myriad of geopolitically rooted divisions, fractious politics, and individual political aims within the Middle East which could undermine the viability of the alliance.

Rabat – The Moroccan government is pushing for thorough investigations into a number of yet-to-be-completed government-funded projects, promising to recover “lost funds.” The move, which was announced by the head of government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, comes days after King Mohammed VI’s Throne Day speech which called for a more accountable and responsible management of national resources.  El Othmani said that a team of auditors will investigate a number of pending government-funded projects in the coming weeks to learn the reasons for the delay and ensure that the money allocated was not used for other purposes, Moroccan newspaper Assabah reported. The newspaper added that the investigations will primarily focus on the education and health sectors, especially as the government is keen to implement reforms to improve quality of education and health facilities.  Beginning in October, both the Court of Auditors and teams of independent investigators will assess the performance of health and education-related projects awaiting completion, years after funding was allocated and received, according to a government source cited by Assabah. In response to the announcement, the education ministry has launched its own investigation, requesting a full account of project progress from schools that received funding in recent years. The Ain Chock Faculty of Sciences in Casablanca is one of the many learning institutions targeted by the education ministry. The ministry has reportedly sent the university’s administration a letter asking for progress updates on an MAD 9 million project for which Ain Chock received government funding in 2017.  Assabah further noted that the Ain Chock Faculty is also likely to be asked to account for a 2014 project that has still not been completed. The school’s administration had requested government funds to expand its capacity by building two amphitheaters, “but the facilities were never built.”  The education ministry is also reported to be working on a bill to make access to government scholarships more inclusive and more transparent.

Rabat- The United Nations has urged countries to promote early breastfeeding and restrict the marketing of formula and other breastmilk substitutes. A new report published on Monday by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF on the occasion of World-Breastfeeding Week, warned of the health risks to newborns who are not breastfed within the first hour after birth.  The report notes that approximately 78 million babies worldwide are not breastfed or receive delayed breastfeeding, and face an increased risk of death since the first contact with their mothers is critical. According to the report, early skin-to-skin contact helps infants learn to breastfeed from their mothers. The executive director of UNICEF, Henrietta Fore, said, “Each year, millions of newborns miss out on the benefits of early breastfeeding and the reasons are things we can change. Mothers simply don’t receive enough support to breastfeed within those crucial minutes after birth, even from medical personnel at health facilities.” Some mothers do not breastfeed their newborns immediately because of a lack of encouragement or awareness regarding the significance of the act or even because of hospital procedures. “Mothers and babies are separated immediately after birth and support and guidance on optimal breastfeeding is limited,” the report emphasized. The report placed Morocco among the list of countries with the largest decrease in the prevalence of early initiation of breastfeeding or “first milk.”  Despite the benefits of breastfeeding, which include strengthening the baby’s immune system and providing nutrition for healthy growth, many mothers dispose of their milk and feed their babies formula. Between 2005 and 2017, the percentage of mothers across the world who gave their first milk to their newborns decreased. In Morocco, only 26.8 percent of newborns were breastfed immediately after birth, according to data from 2010. World Breastfeeding Week, which runs from August 1 to 7, seeks to raise awareness about the benefits of breastfeeding. “Breastfeeding is one of the most effective ways to provide children everywhere with the best start to life,” asserted the WHO. Some mothers have no other choice but to feed infant formula to their children because their milk might negatively affect the newborn’s health. For example, infectious diseases, medication, or drug abuse can impact the milk. Other women may not breastfeed because of a low breast milk supply. The International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes aims to ensure the proper use of infant formula and to monitor inappropriate feeding practices leading to infant malnutrition, morbidity, and mortality in all countries. The code dictates that infant formula labels “should be designed to provide the necessary information about the appropriate use of the product, and so as not to discourage breastfeeding.” Moreover, the code urges operators in the healthcare department to encourage and protect breastfeeding. In case the mother cannot breastfeed due to health issues, the code emphasizes: “Feeding with infant formula, whether manufactured or home-prepared, should be demonstrated only by health workers, or other community workers if necessary; and only to the mothers or family members who need to use it; and the information given should include a clear explanation of the hazards of improper use.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister Delegate Abdelkarim Benatiq’s prediction was right: Tangier-Med port received 33,091 travelers on July 29 alone. The minister delegate in charge of Moroccans residing abroad expected the number of Moroccans returning home for the summer to peak in the last two weeks of July before Eid Al Adha (Festival of Sacrifice), the second of two Islamic holidays celebrated worldwide annually. Morocco is expected to celebrate Eid Al Adha on August 22. A statement from the Tangier-Med port proved the minister right, as it said that 33,091 travelers and 6,849 vehicles entered Morocco on July 29 alone. The press release added that since the launch of the “Marhaba” operation to welcome home Moroccan expats on July 5, more than 474,562 travelers returned to Morocco through the Tangier-Med port, as well as 125,707 vehicles. The port noted that the Marhaba campaign is proceeding under “optimal conditions and measures,” owing to the contribution of all involved actors, including local authorities, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), the gendarmerie, and customs, under the auspices of the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity. Eleven ferries were mobilized for the Tangier-Med to Algeciras (southern Spain) sea route. The ferries make 45 daily crossings and have a capacity exceeding 39,000 passengers. They also make four weekly trips to Barcelona, Spain; Sète, France; and Genoa, Italy. Last month, many Moroccan expats protested expensive ticket prices for the ferry between Morocco and Spain. In response, Morocco’s Ministry of Equipment, Transport, and Logistics negotiated with ferry companies to reduce ticket prices for the ferry between Tangier and Tarifa and between Tangier-Med and Algeciras. In July, Secretary of State for Transport Mohamed Najib Boulif shared a statement from the ministry showing ticket prices for each crossing point on Facebook. The official also said that the ministry was closely monitoring the situation and communicating with the ferry companies.

By Chase Lacy Rabat- Israel has begun blocking the shipment of gas and fuels to the besieged Gaza Strip in a “retaliatory” measure.  Israel’s minister of defense, Avigdor Lieberman, ordered the complete halt of fuel shipments Thursday, August 2, through the already partially-closed Karem Abu Salem border.  The move will place a further strain on the already distressed Gaza strip, which suffers from economic devastation, supply shortages, and a severe lack of electricity. The enclave frequently experiences prolonged power outages and relies on gas generators during those times.   To exasperate conditions, Gaza’s sole power company announced a reduction in service. Now Gazans will be without power for 18 hours a day, an increase from the previous 16 hours. Lieberman asserted, “The decision has been taken in view of the continued terror of incendiary balloons and friction along the fence.” The flaming balloons have burned down swaths of forests and agricultural land in Israel, causing over a million dollars in damage. Israel responded to Gazan protests and incendiary balloons on July 9 by banning all non-essential goods from entering Gaza and launching air strikes.  In the month of July alone, Israeli airstrikes killed three Palestinians.  The only goods allowed to enter Gaza are what Israel cites to be for humanitarian purposes such cooking gas, wheat, flour, and medicine. The few Gazan exports were cut off as well. Previously 40-50 trucks were permitted to cross daily, before Lieberman’s decision last month. Palestinians have held weekly Friday protests in the “Great March of Return” since March 30. Since then, Israeli forces have killed 155 Palestinians and injured thousands more. In the same period, only one Israeli soldier has been killed by a Gazan sniper.

Rabat – Morocco’s interior minister has met senior officials and high-ranking military and police officers to discuss the King’s major projects. Following the oath taking ceremony chaired by King Mohammed VI Tuesday, Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit held a meeting on Wednesday with region governors, province governors in Tetouan. The aim of the meeting was to highlight the monarch’s guidelines and directives contained in his Throne Day speech on Sunday. Many Moroccan high-ranking military and police officers attended the meeting, including the lieutenant general commander of the Royal Gendarmerie, the head of the General Directorate for National Security (DGSN), and the head of the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST). Major generals, brigadier generals, and other senior officials were also present at the high-level meeting. According to the ministry’s statement, the meeting examined ways to implement the three major projects King Mohammed VI ordered. The projects include administrative decentralization, reform of regional investment centers, and adopting a legal arsenal promoting investment. The King asserted, “Jobs cannot be created, nor can a proper, modern social system be set up without a qualitative leap in investment, and without support for the nation’s productive sector.” The King further asserted in his last speech that the administrative decentralization charter should be adopted by the end of October. As for the reform of regional investment centers, the monarch stated that the reform will give centers “the powers they need to carry out their mission, including the possibility for the majority of attending members to make decisions, instead of applying the current rule of unanimous decision-making.” “Group all investment commissions into a single regional investment commission in order to put an end to obstacles and to the excuses made by certain ministries,” he ordered. The King said government agencies should have only one month to “respond to investment-related requests.” If the concerned agencies did not give an answer within the prescribed deadline, the request can be considered approved. The King further asserted that government agencies should not require information on paper or documents regarding investment requests from applicants. Instead government agencies “will coordinate and exchange information, using modern computer-based technology to this end.” “I hope these crucial measures will provide a strong, unprecedented incentive to boost investment, create job opportunities, improve the quality of services offered to citizens and reduce foot-dragging which, as all Moroccans know, leads to corruption.” According to the ministry’s statement, officials also discussed measures to strengthen the contribution of the Ministry of the Interior, together with the rest of the sectors involved and to create a “consolidated social register.” The register is intended “to improve targeting and strengthen coordination between social programs to enable more effective, transparent, and equitable social support programs.” The “consolidated social register” is a program established by King Mohammed VI to gradually improve social welfare projects in the short and medium term. In his last speech, the King defined the program as “a national registration system to identify families that truly deserve to benefit from social assistance programs.” The Ministry of the Interior expressed its “commitment through its entire staff and all its central and territorial services, together with all security services, in order to serve the country and its citizens with integrity, commitment and responsibility.”

Rabat – Clubs in Saudi Arabia seem to be very attracted to Moroccan football players. According to Al Massae, Al Wahda has offered MAD 6 million to recruit Moroccan football player Badr Banoune. However, his current club, Raja of Casablanca is not ready to let go of its central defender and wants a bigger offer.  Raja has refused to negotiate with the Arabian club and thinks that the Atlas Lion is worth much more than the offer.  The 24-year-old football player has already expressed his willingness to transfer to Saudi Arabia. However, Banoune has just committed for two new seasons with the Raja Greenboys.  Banoune is not the only Moroccan to receive an offer from the Saudi Arabian championship. Earlier this year, Wydad of Casablanca gave in to the appeal of another Saudi club, selling its striker Achraf Bencherki to Al Hilal for $9 million. As for Atlas Lion Karim El Ahmadi, he signed three weeks ago with Al Ittihad Jeddah for a two-year contract. Even Morocco’s hero in the World Cup, Nordin Amrabat, joined Nasr Riyadh, after being convinced with an €8.5 million offer.  However, Saudi Arabia’s charm did not work on Benfica’s Adel Taarabt. Earlier this week, the Atlas Lion revealed that he was approached by a club in Saudi Arabia that offered him a “contract of €3 million.” Badr Banoune is a Moroccan footballer, playing the position of central defender for Raja Casablanca and for the national team of Morocco. In 2013, after two seasons with the reserve team, Banoune went on loan at the beginning of 2014 for six months to Wydad de Fes. Banoune made his first steps in his professional career playing a few games there. In 2014, Raja decided to loan out the player to Berkane Renaissance (RSB). During his time with the club, Banoune managed to become a regular starter and attract the attention of major clubs. RSB wanted him permanently, but Raja did not accept their offer. In 2015, Banoune returned to his training club and officially signed a four-year contract with Raja Casablanca.  As for his career with the national team, Banoune played in the 2018 African Nations Championship as captain of the team and led Morocco to win CHAN for the first time in its history.  But he made his debut with the Atlas Lions last year. On October 2, 2017, he was called in as a substitute by the French coach Herve Renard to replace Jaouad El Yamiq in a qualifying game for the World Cup 2018 against Gabon. Benoune will be one of the only players of the Botola Pro with Ahmed Reda Tagnaouti and Ayoub El Kaabi to be selected from the list of 26 players to take part in the 2018 World Cup in Russia. However he didn’t make the cut for the final list.

Rabat – A survey has shown three-quarters of ECOWAS members support Morocco’s admission to the regional economic union.  The French Institute for European Perspective and Security (IPSE) conducted the survey on attitudes towards several countries inclusion in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The survey shows that the majority—75 percent—of MPs in the ECOWAS parliament back Morocco’s accession. The remaining 25 percent said the question of Morocco’s membership requires more consultation. ECOWAS, which aims to promote economic integration among states, is made up of 15 members: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Côte d’Ivoire, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The survey also revealed positive attitudes towards Mauritania’s potential return to ECOWAS. Mauritania announced its withdrawal from ECOWAS in 2000, justifying its exit by saying it wanted to focus more on Maghreb issues. Seventy-three percent of MPs also support Tunisia’s potential membership, while Algeria’s accession was only viewed positively by 31 percent. Following Morocco’s readmission into the African Union in January 2017, King Mohammed VI informed Liberia’s Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former chairperson of ECOWAS, that Morocco desired to join the regional economic community as a full member. On July 31, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari was elected the new chairman of (ECOWAS). Buhari’s election took place at the end of the 53rd Ordinary Summit of ECOWAS Heads of State which ended on Monday evening. Will Buhari’s election open the door for Morocco’s membership? Nigeria and Morocco maintain strong diplomatic ties. Buhari visited Morocco in June at the request of King Mohammed VI. During the meeting, both countries pointed out significant developments in other areas of bilateral cooperation. During the visit, the Nigerian president said he backed Morocco’s return to the African Union and congratulated the King for his agenda to address migration issues in Africa. Morocco’s application to join the union was endorsed by several members of the ECOWAS parliament, including its speaker. In March, Moustapha Cissé Lo of Senegal reaffirmed his support for Morocco’s application. Cissé Lo said during a conference in Rabat that Morocco’s accession to ECOWAS would undoubtedly add value to the community, adding that his parliament will “fully play its role in the process of Morocco’s admission to ECOWAS.”

By Renee Sang Rabat- Although Morocco is working to improve its education system and literacy rate, one of the contributors to this problem is the school attendance rate among students. For many students, school has become more of a chore and less of a positive learning experience. Educall, a social enterprise located in Rabat is taking new and alternative approaches to education that allow youth to find it more enjoyable. Created by Moroccans Yassine Ettayal and Nada Bouzid, Educall started as an idea in 2012 when the founders were university students and balancing their studies with volunteering in the education sector. Morocco World News spoke with co-founder and Operations Manager Ettayal about the organization and how it fits with the Moroccan education system.  “We are delivering modern techniques of teaching, modern techniques of accompanying kids. At the same time, working with underprivileged kids, orphans, in specific areas so that we can implement the same quality services for kids who can afford our services.” He added, “Our vision for Educall is to bring fulfillment to kids and to do so we are aiming, or we are working to make education funny and an amusing process. This is the idea, we are working on gamifying education.” Educall utilizes a very hands-on curriculum to keep students engaged. Educators use art, music, and technology to make lessons more enjoyable and pro-active. For example, history lessons may often be taught via a virtual reality (VR) system. “Usually, kids find it difficult to understand the history lesson or they find it boring… kids need to practice, need to live things to understand them.”  During the summer, kids may attend an educational summer camp, while during the academic year kids may come in after school to get a more individualized and creative form of learning outside of the public education system. Ettayal stated that the volunteers and workers will often stay the whole day “working on developing the programs, on monitoring kids,” while lessons run from 4 p.m. until 8 or 9 p.m. Some of the activities that kids have gotten to participate in this summer include a girls’ empowerment camp, an interactive field trip to a local bakery, and a “Back to the Roots” farm trip to learn about food systems. Alex Cummings is an American student interning at Educall for the summer. She conveyed her thoughts on Educall’s unconventional approach to education with Morocco World News.   “I think it’s interesting and innovative. The student-centered approach they take is obviously effective. Kids are excited to learn and everyone is attentive—students and teachers…. They really are aware of where the education system is lacking and try to do everything they can to add what’s missing into their student’s life.” Ettayal stated that in Morocco, there is a lack of “the concept of goal or objective” within kids. The organization works to help students define these concepts and ultimately “prepar[e] kids to the future.” They focus on separate aspects of educating kids, with one program designed to gamify the material that kids learn in school, while the other consists of an extracurricular system targeting three fields—technology and science, art and culture, and communication. Educall goes beyond traditional schooling in that they also integrate valuable life lessons that into their material.  “We are also focusing on the culture part because we want kids to be open-minded. We want them to be tolerant, we want them to know that they are not the center of the world. There are other people that they need to respect, there are also other people that they need to know about so that they can live at ease and also the other people can also live at ease. This is the idea of what we are doing with them and it is applied to mathematics, science, languages.” Ettayal urged that “education needs to follow the development and the progress of technology” in the twenty-first century. In addition, this involves improving the education not only through the students but all those involved in the system.  “We are convinced that if we work only with kids, [we are] isolated from the ecosystem, we won’t make great or huge results. Since we are aiming to bring fulfillment for kids, we are conscious that we need to work with the whole ecosystem—with kids, with parents, with teachers, with schools.” Some of the ways in which the association works with students outside the program through other events, programs, and partnerships. For example, Educall delivers a seven-month training for teachers where they can be placed as ambassadors within schools afterwards. They often hold events such as a Moroccan and American university exchanges to facilitate discussion between students of different educational backgrounds on the school system in their own country. In addition, career professionals are often invited to the center to speak to kids about the workforce. “We are also conscious that we can’t do it alone” said Ettayal.  For the future, Ettayal stated that Educall is not yet a final product, as they have plans to continue developing their role in the educational system. There may be plans to expand to more centers in Rabat and perhaps even all over Morocco. Ettayal hopes that by eventually expanding out of their current apartment location they can create an environment where “kids can feel the center as their home…. This is the home where they can be creative, they can act naturally, they can be a kid.”

Rabat – Authorities have arrested 30 sub-Saharan undocumented migrants in Nador, a city in north-eastern Morocco. Their arrests, on July 29, came after a police operation on buses, where, despite having paid for their tickets, the 30 migrants were detained and refused reimbursement. The group of migrants were separated in their detention. The first 20 migrants were taken to a military camp. After 26 hours of detention, they were released in Toussit, a town south of Oujda near the border with Algeria. According to the Nador branch of the Moroccan Association of Human Rights (AMDH) who was in contact with the detained migrants and posting updates on their Facebook page, a member of the security forces told the first group, “You’re lucky because the second group will be sent back to the Algerian-Moroccan border.” The second group of 10 migrants included women of Senegalese, Malian, Guinean, and Burkinabe descent. They were detained in military barracks until Tuesday morning, and have now lost all contact with the AMDH Nador. Their location is unknown. AMDH writes, “Their phones do not work anymore. They may be unloaded or have been seized by Moroccan authorities.” Sub-Saharan migrants in Morocco Over the past years, the number of sub-Saharan migrants has steadily increased. According to the Pew Research Center, sub-Saharan African nations have accounted for 8 of the 10 fastest growing international migrant populations since 2010. Many sub-Saharan migrants use Morocco as a transit point for reaching Europe, even if it entails multiple attempted crossings. In 2017, the number of illegal border crossings of the Morocco’s western Mediterranean Sea route tripled, as migrants seek the Spanish territories of Melilla and Ceuta. Morocco must be diplomatic in balancing its relations with both other African nations and the European Union when dealing with sub-Saharan migrants. In 2014, Morocco launched reforms funded by the EU to encourage migrants to stay in Morocco. The European Union in return has praised Morocco on its migrant policy, which as King Mohammed VI underlined in 2016 “is rooted in humanitarian values, designed to make sure migrants’ rights and dignity are safeguarded.” Criticism of the operations Yet, in Morocco’s difficult balancing act, certain issues still remain. While Morocco attempts to retain diplomacy in its dealings with sub-Saharan migrants, AMDH Nador has been critical of police operations which target sub-Saharan Africans. In a statement to Yabiladi, Omar Naji, the president of the local chapter of the AMDH, said that operations are “fairly common in the city” even when the reasons for the arrest remain unknown. AMDH states “while the big traffickers live peacefully and circulate freely in Nador, the Nador authorities continue to hunt down and arrest the simple migrants.” With Facebook as a platform, AMDH Nador has used its posts to expose the main traffickers and mafia organizations which have exploited migrants through extortionate payments and passport seizures. The Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights (LADDH) has also raised concerns over the expulsion of migrants to the Algerian-Moroccan border due to its terrain as a “desert area” and “no man’s land.” In a statement made public and signed by vice president Said Salhi, the LADHH calls on the Moroccan government to “give up” the operations “in the middle of the summer when heat poses a risk to the health and safety to the migrants.” The arbitrary deportation operations in the extreme climate and environment imperils the rights and dignity of migrants and refuges, contrary to international conventions and rights.

Rabat – The rift between RAM management and pilots union has created an unending series of last-minute flight cancellations and angry customers. The Royal Air Maroc (RAM) pilots, represented by the National Association of Pilots (AMPL), have grown “inflexible” in their salary demands. RAM has called off more than 100 flights in two weeks, causing the frustration of passengers, who, despite the company’s ongoing troubles continued buying RAM tickets. Passengers hoped that the company’s trouble would not last as long as it now has, according to Moroccan newspaper L’Economiste. Since the start of the strike on July 18, RAM reportedly loses MAD 20 million daily, and the situation is “growing wayward and unmanageable.” The company is “overwhelmed and does not know what to say,” L’Economiste quoted a senior RAM managing officer as saying. The rapidly rising costs of the strike pressured RAM’s CEO Abdelhamid Abdou to call for a meeting with AMPL members on Wednesday, July 25. And while the general expectation was that a crisis recovery strategy would be found by August to avoid the grim prospect of losing the busiest and most profitable month of the summer period, the company’s pilots have recently hardened their position, claiming that RAM’s work requirements are “untenable.” An AMPL representative told Moroccan outlet Medias 24 on Tuesday, July 31, that pilots will only resume work when all their demands are met. He said that the pilots would not be lured by a crisis recovery plan that does not address all their requests. He also explained that AMPL’s position is “inflexible” and that RAM could remain paralyzed for the remaining days of the summer period. “For years we were flexible and we did not speak up, but now the situation has become unbearable,” he said. “As far as we are concerned RAM’s commercial office is the only one responsible for the ongoing disturbances at airports.” Meanwhile, RAM’s bruised reputation continues to be further affected as the company’s customers complain about long delays and last-minute changes of schedule.  RAM has set up special units to inform passengers in a timely manner—a day or two before set departure time—and take care of hotel and restaurants costs for passengers of cancelled night flights. These “preventive measures are a very heavy burden on the company’s finances,” the managing officer was quoted as saying.

Rabat- A distressing video by a French tourist in a Casablanca hospital has triggered anger and condemnation from Moroccan social media. In the video, taken at Ibn Rochd Hospital (CHU), patients are seen lying on the unhygienic floor of CHU’s emergency wing. No emergency equipment, doctors, or nurses can be seen, but only the weary faces of patients and their relatives waiting to be treated.   The tourist filmed a young woman who had suffered from a brain hemorrhage and had been waiting for a doctor from 1 a.m. until 4 a.m. but still had not yet been treated. Shocked by the sight, the French woman lamented: “People are dying, and if you don’t have money you can’t get treated… do you find this normal? In a country like Morocco that prefers to construct roads and other things rather than treat the sick.” Since Tuesday, July 31, the video has been circulating on social media. In response, the hospital published a press release on Wednesday, describing the video content as misleading while providing its own clarifications. The statement claimed that the lady who appeared in the video underwent brain imaging soon after she entered the hospital, but since it revealed that she did not suffer from any serious injuries, the neurologist allowed her to leave the hospital. It further stated, regarding the emergency rooms, “The emergency department receives hundreds of patients daily from all of Casablanca, Settat, and outside the region… for example, on 31/7/2018 [the day the video was filmed and published] it had received 214 cases.”  The healthcare system in Morocco is notorious for its many flaws, especially when it comes to public hospitals which are lacking in equipment, medicine, and medical staff. As for health insurance coverage, only 60 percent of Moroccans are covered by the Compulsory Health Insurance (AMO) and Medical Assistance Plan (RAMED), both of which are government initiatives to improve the healthcare system. The 2011 Constitution dictates equal access of citizens to health care, basic medical coverage, solidarity, health equality, and equal distribution of health resources. Unfortunately, more than 25 percent of Moroccans—8.5 million people—do not have access to medical care, especially the poor who live in rural areas, according to the World Bank 2017 Economic Memorandum.  To develop the health system, the government is investing efforts. Recently, Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus pledged to support Morocco’s ambition to extend the national health insurance to low-income and disadvantaged people. RAMED, which has been in place for six years, extended health coverage to 60 percent of the Moroccan population. Morocco’s Minister of Health Anas Doukkali previously said that while the results are “honorable,” there is still a long way to go for health care to be more effective and inclusive of all  low-income and disadvantaged people.

Rabat – Authorities in Saudi Arabia have arrested two more women’s rights activists, adding to a growing number detained since May. Human Rights Watch calls for justice for Samar Badawi and Nassima al-Sadah, arrested July 30, and “the latest victims of an unprecedented government crackdown on the women’s rights movement.” Who are they? Badawi, honored in 2012 with the United States’ International Women of Courage Award, stands as a prominent figure for gender rights in Saudi Arabia. Abused by her father for 15 years, Badawi escaped the violence in her home for shelter at a women’s protection house in 2008. Her father filed an adhl, or disobedience charge, against her, his legal basis founded in the male guardianship system. After years of legal battles between father and daughter, as well as multiple arrests and imprisonments for her disobedience under the guardianship system, Badawi became a vocal spokesperson for human rights. She filed a lawsuit against the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs in 2011 for their refusal to register her as a voter or candidate; with this action, she became the first person in Saudi Arabia to file a lawsuit for women’s suffrage. Joining other women, she signed a petition for voting rights, ability to run as a candidate in local election, and the right to drive. And drive she did, seven years before her right was legally confirmed; during the 2011-2012 women driving campaign Badawi drove in Jeddah weekly and challenged the legislative basis behind the now-defunct only female driving ban in the world. In 2014 the Saudi government banned Badawi from international travel, and in 2016 authorities briefly jailed her for peaceful activism. Two of her closest relatives already wait for justice behind bars. Her former husband, jailed for human rights activism, is currently serving 15 years. Her brother Raif Badawi received a 10-year sentence and 1,000 lashes for posting controversial opinions on his well-known blog and  creating an online space for public debate. Although harassed and targeted by the Saudi government for years, Badawi continued to fight for human rights for women. “The current situation is simply that there is a severe case of repression against human rights activists and peaceful political activism; we do not oppose the government and do not want its downfall, but we are calling for civil and political rights, a constitutional monarchy, an elected parliament and an independent, just judiciary.” Al-Sadah is her colleague in activism. From the Shia-majority Qatif province, she advocates for the abolishment of the guardianship system and actively opposed the female driving ban until its removal from law in June 2018. In 2015 al-Sadah ran as a candidate in local elections—the first year legally possible for her to do so—until authorities opposed her campaign by eliminating her from the ballot. Both faced repeated targeting from the Saudi government, including a travel ban, for years before their arrests. A third woman, Amal al-Harbi, was arrested this week as well. The charges against the wife of imprisoned civil rights advocate Fowzan al-Harbi, arrested for his work with a now-banned civic organization, are unknown. What do they stand for? Saudi Arabia has targeted over a dozen advocates for women’s rights since May, when authorities arrested prominent activists, like Loujain al-Hathlou, Aisha al-Manea, and Eman al-Nafjan, under accusations of undermining national security. Many, however, were detained without charge. Media outlets linked to the Saudi government developed a campaign against the activists—called “traitors”—that accuses them of “violat[ing] national unity.” Potential sentences could last up to 20 years. The rights advocates are campaigning for include the abolishment of the male guardianship system, a legislative structure placing various rights of the woman in the hands of her wali, usually a father, brother, or husband. The system requires women to ask permission of their male guardians for marriage and divorce, to enroll in higher education, to obtain a passport, to travel, to open a bank account, and to receive elective surgery. In 2012 the government developed a network in which male guardians receive a text update if a woman under their responsibility leaves the country, more heavily enforcing the travel stipulations under the guardian system. Not all Saudi women, however, agree on the gender-based framework; a 2008 “My Guardian Knows What’s Best for Me” petition, actively opposed to “equality between men and women,” garnered over 5,000 signatures. A contradictory 2016 petition, the first of its kind, gathered nearly 15,000 signatures for the end of the male guardianship system. Prominent activist Wajeha Al-Huwaider analogized the legislation to slavery. In 2015, the Global Gender Gap Report ranked Saudi Arabia as 141 out of 144 nations for gender parity. The 2018 lifting of a historical ban on female drivers, the only such legislation in the world, marked a seemingly progressive change under King Salman. Some Saudis, however, criticize the reform as merely “cosmetic.” Madawi al-Rasheed, a Saudi visiting professor at the London School of Economics, said the May arrests of women’s rights activists “exposed the myth that Mohammed bin Salman is a revolutionary conducting a top-down transformation of Saudi Arabia.” “There is an ongoing campaign to silence everybody in Saudi Arabia from religious scholars to intellectuals, lawyers, activists, teachers, women, men: everybody.” Following the same May arrests, Amnesty International’s Middle East Director of Campaigns Samah Hadid denounced the cognitive dissonance displayed by a government proclaiming reform while detaining advocates for human rights. “Saudi Arabian authorities cannot continue to publicly state they are dedicated to reform, while treating women’s rights campaigners in this cruel way.” Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth expressed similar sentiments in a tweet. “As the Saudi Crown Prince tours the world presenting himself as a ‘reformer,’ he is arresting the women’s rights activists who refuse to accept his tokenism, leaving it to us to make their voices heard.” What does this mean for the future? Human Rights Watch Middle East Director Sarah Leah Whitson said Saudi Arabia and its allies must “question what ‘reform’ really means in a country where the rule of law is disdainfully ignored.” “Allies and partners considering opportunities for closer ties with Saudi Arabia during this period of ‘reform’ should speak out against Mohammad bin Salman’s ultimately self-defeating repression. Any economic vision that seeks to open up Saudi Arabia while throwing real reformers in jail may well end badly for everyone.” Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director Lynn Maalouf pointed to the arrests of Badawi and al-Sadah as a “disturbing sign that the crackdown is far from over.” “These brave women represented the last vestiges of the human rights community in the country, and now they too have been detained. Saudi Arabia’s new leadership under Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman has crushed any space for the existence of human rights defenders in the country.” Maalouf called upon the international community—specifically the US, UK, and France—to pressure Saudi Arabia to “end this draconian crackdown and targeted repression of human rights activists.” “The US, the UK, and France … have remained silent for far too long. Their silence is deafening.” By Anna Schaeffer

Rabat – The trafficking of wild animals to the Middle East has been thriving in recent years, despite the fact the animals are already critically endangered.  The United Arab Emirates is considered a major intersection for trafficking animals and their products due to close proximity to Asia and Africa. Animals such as big cats, primates, and exotic birds are being purchased illegally by people in hopes of flaunting their wealth. Elephants and rhinos are being poached for their ivory. Animal trafficking is the world’s fourth-largest criminal enterprise cashing in at over MAD 200 billion, 26 percent higher than what the UN Environment-Interpol estimated.  The numbers In 2016, just over 7,000 cheetahs were left in the wild. According to USA Today, the population of cheetahs in Zimbabwe declined from 1,200 to about 170 in only 16 years. The Asiatic cheetah, which is found only in Iran, has a population of less than 50 in the wild.  The African lion population has declined 43 percent in the past 20 years. Just under 4,000 tigers remain in the wild today. There are an estimated 450,000 to 700,000 African elephants and 35,000 to 40,000 Asian elephants left in the wild.  Earlier this year, the last male northern white rhino died due to old age, but scientists managed to preserve his genetic material in hopes of artificially inseminating the last two female northern white rhinos.  The other five species of white rhinos are also at low numbers. The Javan rhino, native to a national park in Indonesia, is considered one of the most endangered species in the world, with only about 60 animals remaining. The Sumatran rhino, another native to Indonesia, has numbers below 80. Black rhinos, greater one-horned rhinos, and southern white rhinos have growing numbers, but still have a low population.  Monkeys and great apes are also being trafficked and sold to entertainment and tourist industries, inhumane zoos, and to people seeking to buy them for status symbols. From 2005 to 2013, Stolen Apes, a program under the United Nations Environmental Program, reported that 22,218 great apes had been killed, stolen, or had died while in captivity. Every year, almost 3,000 great apes are lost from the wild.  How does this happen? In 2014, the International Fund for Animal Welfare found 120 online advertisements in the UAE for illegally trafficked animals. Other nearby nations such as Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and Jordan have also had posts selling these animals, but none to the extent of the UAE.  In an interview with The National, Patricia Tricorache of the International Cheetah Conservation Fund stated there are 50 social media accounts for trading illegal animals in the UAE and estimated an average of 250 cheetahs for sale each year.  However, traders have become more wary of public selling, and Tricorache estimates about 300 cheetahs are stolen from Somalia every year. The organization has investigated the problem by questioning village people involved in the trade, who say at the height of the trading period about 100 cheetahs were smuggled a month to the Middle East.  Sad fates for stolen animals Once purchased by their owners, many animals are treated cruelly and forced to undergo procedures such as being declawed and having their teeth removed. Removing claws and teeth alters the animals’ gaits and can cause chronic pain.  Big cats require an expansive diet. Many of the owners feed the animals raw chicken without knowing the nutritional needs of their animals to grow and survive. The animals can become malnourished, paralyzed, and have an undeveloped nervous system.  Raised in captivity, animals do not grow up learning how to hunt or to have instincts. Owners will sometimes give their pets a live animal to eat, but the potential food ends up suffering because the pet will only attack and not kill the animal. Once owners realize a wild animal is too much to handle, they often turn the animals to zoos, veterinarians, or organizations as part of an amnesty. In an interview with the Middle Eastern Eye, a foreman from the Dubai Zoo says they will receive 10 “donations” of animals a month.  A number of those belong to endangered species. However, some of these big cats do not even have a chance to live in a zoo. Many zoos are already at capacity. If the animals do not have claws or teeth, they can not be put with other animals of their kind because they would be vulnerable. The animals are also not able to reproduce if they are domesticated, and therefore have no other fate but to be put down.  Owners also give up monkeys, apes, and birds once they become tired of them. A member of the Dubai Safari stated to The National that about 20 monkeys had been turned in due to an amnesty program. After captivity, they have more social and behavioral problems than other animals. One baboon came into the program wearing children clothes.  Owners bring exotic birds to the Dubai Safari park after they realize the birds are too loud and can bite. The birds often have bad health problems and at least 70 percent of the birds in the park have chlamydia.  Some veterinarians in these areas receive dead endangered animals from owners due to their lack of knowledge and resources. What is being done now The UN passed a resolution in 2015 that strengthened national measures and enhanced regional and global responses to the illegal trafficking of wildlife in the UAE.  In 2016, the president of the UAE passed Federal Law 22 to protect animals and people. It stated that only zoos, wildlife parks, circuses, and research centers are allowed to keep wild animals such as big cats, primates, ostriches, seagulls, spiders, and scorpions.  Although the trade of wild animals and their products has been illegal many years in the UAE, the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, Dubai Police, Dubai Municipality, and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) teamed up to eradicate the illegal trade of endangered species.  However, since the trading of animals crosses jurisdictions, there needs to be international cooperation in order to save these animals from ill-treatment. 
Even though the government has decided to crackdown on the issue, the illegal trade of animals and their byproducts continue to exist. On July 4, almost 2,000 pieces of ivory were confiscated at the Dubai International Airport.  Animals such as cheetahs are still being posted for sale on Instagram. The TRA is currently working to surveil illegal ads.  Companies such as Facebook and Instagram provide a way for users to report a post if there are any signs of animal trafficking. Google also has specific policies that state advertisements for endangered or extinct animals are prohibited and also allow a feature for users to report such advertisements. By Maria Kuiper

Rabat – The EU president has responded to Spain’s request to provide Morocco with resources to tackle migration and borders issues.  President Jean-Claude Juncker tweeted on Wednesday that he “confirmed” to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez that both “#Spain and #Morocco can be assured of the full support of the @EU_Commission in effectively responding to the increasing migratory pressure along the Western Mediterranean route.” The head of the EU Commission also shared his response letter to Sanchez. In July, the Spanish head of government asked the EU to provide Morocco with emergency assistance to tackle the migration issue. I confirmed to @sanchezcastejon on the phone that #Spain and #Morocco can be assured of the full support of the @EU_Commission in effectively responding to the increasing migratory pressure along the Western Mediterranean route pic.twitter.com/ZS66gZra7L — Jean-Claude Juncker (@JunckerEU) August 1, 2018  In response, Juncker said that although he shared the same concerns over the issue of migration, the EU’s “resources are limited.” Not enough The head of the EU commission also acknowledged that the situation “requires a much higher financial effort.” However, the EU official added that “the resources of the EU Trust Fund for Africa are, unfortunately, limited.” Created in 2015, The fund aims to address the circumstances and root causes of undocumented migration. The initiative also aims to boost stability and contribute to better migration management. On July 7, Morocco’s Ministry of Interior allegedly drafted a long list of requested resources estimated at €60 million to fight undocumented migration and border issues. The demand followed a statement made by Spain and France, which called for more collaboration with countries of origin, destination, and transit to tackle the issue of migration. On July 26, nearly 700 migrants violently stormed the border fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. The EU has already approved a €55 million fund to assist Tunisia and Morocco to tackle migration and border issues. Morocco received €30 of the assigned budget approved by the EU. “The Commission is doing everything in its power to guarantee the speedy execution of this program,” Juncker in a written letter. In his response to Sanchez, Juncker said that he asked EU members to “feed the Fund with amounts that meet real expectations, in parallel with the efforts of the Union budget.” According to El Pais, the commission budget has since contributed €3.5 billion. Juncker said that each EU country should have contributed the same amount. However, some EU members and other countries, including Switzerland and Norway have only pledged €439 million. The head of the commission then promised Sanchez that there will be “additional financing for the management of the borders in Morocco as soon as these contributions materialize.” Recalling the fund that Morocco has benefited from, Juncker said that the North African country has received over €100 million in 10 years now. He added that Morocco received in December a €6 million payment to purchase equipment.

Rabat – Morocco’s minister of sports has denied that Morocco will replace Cameroon as host of CAN 2019 next June. Alami was responding to the French online news outlet Mediapart, which said that Cameroon would be deprived of hosting the 2019 CAN in favor of Morocco because of issues related to sporting and tourism infrastructure. The minister said, “I can affirm that we have not thought for even one second about hosting the CAN because there is no reason for it.” The minister condemned “how much fake news can invade and pollute information, including in the mainstream media.” He added that “neither for the King Mohammed VI, is there a question of organizing it. I repeat, this idea has never crossed our heads. To be honest, seeing this rumor circulating, I first took it with a smile, so it seemed amazing to me that we can believe it.” The minister noted that Cameroon is a friendly country and that “we are brother countries.” Alami also considered the assertion that Cameroon would be unable to organize the 2019 CAN as a personal insult, saying, “When it is claimed that Cameroon will not be ready, we also take it as a personal insult whose purpose is the ability of African countries to organize major sporting events.” Cameroon is facing several issues related to CAN, mainly delays in the construction of stadiums after thousands of workers went on strike, and the fact foreign companies have stopped working because the Cameroonian government cannot meet its financial obligations.

Rabat – A BAM report found that despite high costs, increasing numbers of Moroccans are enrolling their children in private schools. The trend is due to deteriorating infrastructure and declining teaching quality in public schools, according to Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM). The estimates are part of BAM’s annual report for the year 2017, published last week. The report pointed out a large and expanding income gap between Moroccan households and called for more government actions to promote inclusive policies and curb the increasing social and economic consequences of income inequality. Private schools charge ‘excessive’ fees In its assessment of price fluctuations and inflation in Morocco in the last two decades, the report found that education-related costs take the lion’s share of Moroccan households’ income.  On average, households spent 1.6 percent of their income on education in 2001. But by 2014, the percentage had skyrocketed to 3.7 percent. In major cities, like Marrakech, Rabat, Fez, and others, the increase in education costs has been even more pointed, reaching 4.4 percent, according to the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP). Part of the reason for the “rapid increase” in education-related costs is that Moroccan households are increasingly resorting to private schools to make up for the declining quality of teaching and curriculum in public schools.  Private school education brings ‘social prestige’ In 2017, private schools accounted for 87 percent of preschool enrolments and 16.7 percent of primary school enrolments. The percentage of primary school students in private school was a mere 4.4 percent in 2011, indicating that the perceived social difference between a private and public school diploma has reached new heights in recent years. Many Moroccan parents perceive a good education for their children—generally in French medium private institutions—as the surest way to climb high in the social ladder. And since private schools are aware of the value and social prestige that their services represent to most Moroccan parents, there is high probability that schooling costs will only get higher in coming years, the report noted. Whereas private schools have attracted more pupils in the last decade, prices have not decreased. In fact, between 2007 and 2017, school fees in private institutions have tripled when compared to the pace of price fluctuations in other sectors, according to BAM.  Commodity prices experienced an inflation rate of 15 percent in the last decade, while education-related costs jumped by 44 percent. Specifically, preschool fees increased by 53 percent between 2007 and 2017, while primary school, high school, and university fees increased by 27 percent. BAM’s “concerning” figures confirmed findings late last month by a government-sponsored assessment of Moroccan schools’ performance. The report noted that children from lower levels of socio-economic status are increasingly dropping out of school, perpetuating the deep-seated socio-economic chasm between those with prestigious diplomas and the rest—the large majority of Moroccans.

Rabat – President Trump ordered his attorney general to fire special counsel Mueller and end the Russia investigation “right now.” Trump, who has repeatedly said that there was no collusion in the 2016 presidential election, reiterated his position this week when he said that the ongoing investigations into alleged Russian interference in the US’ domestic politics were a “disgrace” to the US and that special counsel Robert Mueller is a pawn in the Democrats’ “conspiracy” to tarnish his presidency.  “This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to strain our country any further,” read Trump’s tweet on Wednesday, August 1. The president then lashed out at Robert Mueller, comparing the special counsel’s entourage to a biased angry and anti-Republican mob only interested in causing further trouble for the Trump administration. “Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to the USA!” Trump’s Wednesday tweet seems to have been ignited by the ongoing trial of the president’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is facing 18 charges of bank fraud and tax evasion.  In a Tuesday tweet immediately following the start of Manafort’s trial, Trump said that charges against his former campaign manager had “nothing to do with collusion” and suggested that any attempt to establish links to Russia was “a Hoax.” Obstruction of justice But while Trump was busy taking jabs at Mueller, the president’s critics were quick to weigh in, pointing out that Trump’s “order” that Mueller be fired is an obstruction of justice and belies the values that America stands for as a democracy. “This is an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight. America must never accept it,” Democratic congressman Adam Schiff tweeted. Schiff asserted that the president cannot request an end to an investigation in which he and his entourage may be implicated. But Trump’s entourage denied the obstruction of justice claim, saying that the president’s tweet was an opinion, not an order. “It’s not an order, it’s the president’s opinion,” Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters at the White House. Chiming in with Sanders, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, also former mayor of New York, said: “I think it’s very well established the president uses tweets to express his opinions.”  Is Russia-gate a distraction? While it is tempting to see Trump’s dismissal of ‘Russia gate’ as a traditional Trumpist bombast, some Trump critics have raised concerns about Democrats’ fixation on Russia and Trump’s PR blunders.  Even though they are very critical of Trump, even describing him as a threat to democracy, they are urging Democrats to focus their time and energy on more salient issues, namely winning the working and middle classes back, instead of sitting back and waiting for Trump to self-destruct. “Beating the right cannot simply be a matter of waiting for a dolt in the Oval office to screw things up,” prominent US journalist and political historian Thomas Frank wrote in an op-ed on July 27.  In a subsequent interview with the Guardian, Frank said that Democrats’ attitudes over the years is actually helping Trump widen his fan base. He suggested that Democrats’ perceived detachment from working and middle class Americans’ hardships reinforces the mounting impression that only Trump and the Republican Party speak for the downtrodden and left-behind. Speaking to Democracy Now on July 30, MIT emeritus professor Noam Chomsky referred to the media’s obsession with Russian collusion as “marginalia.” “The media is focusing on issues which are pretty marginal. There are much more serious issues that are being put to the side.”

Rabat – Following the UNRWA announcement of major job cuts on July 25, thousands of Palestinian employees have protested at the organization’s main offices in Gaza, blocking the entrances and preventing staff from reaching them. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) decided to end work contracts for approximately 145 out of 1,000 employees hired as part of an emergency appeal program.  Gaza’s UNRWA employees were shocked at the job suspensions, fearing the deteriorating rate of funds and resources available. The deputy chairman of the UNRWA’s staff union, Amal al-Batsch, told Al Jazeera, “This is a massacre against the employees. The solution to the crisis should not be at the expense of the staff providing services to the tens of thousands of refugees in the Gaza Strip.” Employees are also concerned that more cuts are to follow. The jobs provided by the UNRWA in the health, education, and service sectors are indispensable sources of income for families in Gaza. With the cuts also come the psychological effects of being laid off, which only adds to the deteriorating living conditions in Gaza.  One man attempted to self-immolate outside the headquarters in Gaza but was stopped by his colleagues. Another UNRWA worker Huwaida al-Ghoul cried, “I can’t express the amount of pain and sadness in my heart. I spent 16 years working and gave my best to my job.” Financial crisis for the UNRWA In response, the UNRWA administration have stressed their struggle. The UNRWA has provided social services, education, healthcare, food, and other aid to millions of Palestinian refugees since 1950. It is funded mainly by voluntary contributions from UN member states.  The decision by the Trump administration to cut aid from $365 million to $65 million at the beginning of the year has dramatically impacted the UNRWA. The largest ever reduction in UNRWA’s funding has left the organization battling to sustain its services.  Currently, the urgent priorities of the UNRWA are to feed, clothe, house, and educate the millions of people displaced by bombing. Gaza has become a region so devastated that according to the UN, it will be completely uninhabitable in 2 years. Electricity has become limited to 4 hours a day and clean water sources are depleted. Eighty percent of Gaza’s 2 million population are dependent on the UNRWA for survival.  In an interview with Ynet, Adnan Abu Hasna, a media advisor for the UNRWA, said, “We have no money to continue to supply food to these people here, and we don’t know what is going to happen.” He continued, “I think that UNRWA’s situation is not the same as it was six months ago. The situation has deteriorated. We are the main body in Gaza that supplies aid, food, medicine and education, practically the only one.” During its weekly meeting in Ramallah today, the Palestinian Cabinet appealed to the international community and donor countries to provide support for the UNRWA in order to ensure that the essential services of food, shelter, and education can be provided for Palestinian refugees. Criticism and debate surrounding the UNRWA Yet, the job cuts are emblematic of more insipid policy within the UNRWA. They have become a pressing point of concern, as many worry that the UNRWA’s decisions to cut jobs and withdraw services is a decision both out of economic necessity and to align with the pressures of the international milieu. Employees of the UNRWA and critics regard the job cuts as an adaptation to the Middle East Peace Plan propagated by the Trump administration, worrying that the job cuts are prescient of the agency’s eventual dismantlement, which align with the perception that Trump administration’s seeks to replace the Palestinian cause of autonomy with promises of economic prosperity and an aid package directly to the Gaza strip.   Mohsen Abu Ramadan, an economic analyst in Gaza, was critical of the organization: “UNRWA and many international organizations, especially those funded by the US in Gaza, are moving towards one direction, which is to replace the Palestinian cause – an end to the Israeli occupation and siege and the right of return for refugees – with a humanitarian agenda.”  The issue of UNRWA’s intentions has always been a source of controversy and critique. Within the discourse, the UNRWA has teetered the boundaries between an organization which serves Palestinian interests or humanitarianism, imposed by external actors.  Since its inception in 1950, many have regarded the UNRWA and its services for the Palestinian people as a quintessential example of “humanitarian management.” For many Palestinians, the very creation of the UNRWA was an implicit agreement within the international community that there was no need to return Palestinian refugees to their land. The agency’s aid thus became equated with placation of their yearning to return and a stultification of their dissent.  Protesters vow that they will continue their protests. They are protesting against what they see as the unfair measures of the UNRWA but also for the agency to continue and for Palestinian desires to be heard.   By Isabella Wang

Rabat – A video of a Moroccan police officer refusing to shake hands with the mayor-president of Ceuta has gone viral. The video, which went viral August 1, shows the policeman standing next to the border crossing between the Spanish enclave of Ceuta and Morocco. When Mayor-President Juan Jesus Vivas approached and extended his hand, the police officer ignored the Spanish official. The mayor-president then gently touched the police officer’s shoulder and left. Morocco World News spoke with a ranking police officer at the Hassan police station in Rabat, asking about the protocol on shaking hands. He told MWN that he could not make further comment on the video at this time because he is not aware of the specifics of the law when police officers are on duty at borders. However, in general, an armed police officer is not permitted to make physical contact with any person and is encouraged to maintain a distance. He added that the police do not yet know if the police officer in the video was acting of his own accord or if he was just following protocol for the situation.  The action of the police officer prompted reactions in Morocco and overseas.  Egyptian journalist Moataz Matar paid a special tribute to the police officer, calling for Morocco to honor him. “Here, a man with dignity stands,” said Matar. He dedicated an episode of his television show “With Moataz” to the police officer’s action. In his television show, the journalist also gave his audience a brief history of the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. Moataz said the police officer was “suffering as he stands in the crossing border everyday to see his colonized territory.”  Moataz added that the Ceuta mayor-president is a “deputy of colonizers.” “His eyes said everything that should have been said. He did not think of post reactions … my dignity refuses that I should extend my hands to shake them with you,” he said. “No peace with a colonizer,” Moataz added.  A number of social media users in Morocco shared the video, saluting the police officer. One wrote on her Facebook page, “A stance is better than a thousand words. Moroccan and proud.”

Rabat – Despite Moroccan governmental and royal social projects and the governmental reform of the subsidy fund, there are still social disparities and reforms lack follow-up. Abdellatif Jouahri, the governor of Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM), Morocco’s central bank, presented the King with the annual report of the economic and social situation in Morocco on Sunday. Subsidy fund lacks follow-up Morocco’s government introduced subsidy reform five years ago to make the subsidy fund beneficial for poor Moroccan people. Nevertheless, the subsidy system still needs continuous follow-up, according to Jouahri. The Moroccan government has phased in the removal of subsidies on sugar and floor. According to government, the removal of subsidies on food products will be offset by the government funding social development projects dedicated to supporting poor Moroccan people. Subsidy reform on butane gas has not been implemented yet. According to government, it will enter into force in 2022. However, there have been calls within the Parliament to remove subsidies on butane gas. On May 29, MP Abdellah Bouanou of the Justice and Development party (PJD) criticized the delay of subsidy reform regarding butane gas. He urged the government to start removing subsidies on butane gas. Speaking to King Mohammed VI, Jouahri said the reform of the subsidy fund has been successful. However, he asserted that the reform should be completed following a comprehensive policy. The policy should be based on the adoption of real prices for better distribution of resources. “At the same time, most vulnerable families should be given support,” he added. According to Jouahri’s report, after the implementation of subsidy fund reform and fuel price deregulation, in favorable conditions characterized by low oil prices, there was no follow-up on fuel prices. “Five years after the launch of the reform, the upward trend in oil prices currently puts the reform at stake and again raises questions about the circumstances surrounding its implementation.” Bouanou stated in May that the difference between the government’s set prices and today’s prices is nearly MAD 1 per liter. “Moroccans annually consume some 6.5 million tons [of fuel]. So, we easily reach 7 billion dirhams in additional profit in one year.” On July 10, Omar Balafrej, an MP for the Federation of the Democratic Left (FGD), also claimed that oil companies in Morocco made an additional profit of MAD 17 billion from the deregulation of fuel prices enacted in December 2015. He proposed the government confiscate the extra profit earned by fuel distribution companies and spend it on government projects. Enduring social disparities despite social and economic programs Although the state made efforts as part of the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) and social programs, Jouahri said there are growing social disparities, especially in rural areas. “The disparities remain large between different social classes, which creates a sense of exclusion among large parts of the population,” he added. In 2017, the INDH created 44,000 projects for the benefit for 10.3 million people, 50 percent of whom were in rural areas. According to INDH, a total of 4.2 million women participated in income-generating projects in 2017. Since the beginning of 2018, King Mohammed VI has launched many development projects across Morocco. In January, during King Mohammed VI’s visit to Agadir, eight agreements intended to promote the industrial sectors of the region were signed before him. The agreements were part of an industrial plan in the Souss Massa region. In May, the King also launched three humanitarian projects in the Kenitra region, 40 kilometers north of Rabat, to promote economic and social conditions of poor women. With an estimated budget of MAD 26 million, the King launched a building project to provide housing for families of fishermen in Mehdia, a center for vocational training and job integration in Sidi Taibi, and a center for vocational training in agricultural logistics in Souk El Arbaa. In his speech on Throne Day, the King stressed the need to continue developing projects and overcoming the obstacles that hinder economic and social development. “We shall continue to move forward together and work hand in hand to overcome transient as well as objective hurdles and bring about conditions that allow us to continue implementing development programs and projects, create jobs, and provide for a dignified life.” The King also spoke about a new initiative to establish a “consolidated social register,” to gradually improve social welfare projects in the short and medium term.   “This is a national registration system to identify families that truly deserve to benefit from social assistance programs.” “It is a strategic and ambitious social project which concerns large segments of the Moroccan population,” he added. Government reforms should be completed According to Jouahri’s report, “Morocco has made great efforts in recent years, but the level of achievements indicates that our country not only needs to continue and expand its reforms, but also, in particular, to implement and complete them in a timely manner.” The governor of BAM pointed out that “many of the major projects that were launched have not yet been completed, and others have not achieved the desired results.” As for the business climate in Morocco, Jouahri stated that some constitutional institutions are not performing their functions as expected regarding providing convenient conditions for investment and creating job opportunities. “The two sectors are suffering stagnation because of delay in some constitutional institutions’ decision-making.” Corruption, weak labor force training, and the informal sector are among the main obstacles that affect the Moroccan business climate, Jouahri claimed.

This is a story that sends shivers down your spine.  Rabat – Judicial Police in Inezgane district near Agadir arrested a couple on Tuesday, July 31, for their alleged involvement in kidnapping a child.

Through the investigation, authorities discovered that the mother had sold the child to a couple living in Tiznit, 100 kilometers south of Agadir, for MAD 2,500, via two intermediaries. The intermediaries and the suspect’s husband were also apprehended and brought before the public prosecutor. Further investigations by security services on Tuesday morning identified the couple involved in the alleged kidnapping and arrested them in Tiznit.

By Dil Bola  Rabat – After posting her poetry on social media in 2015, Arab-Israeli poet Dareen Tatour was arrested on grounds of hate speech, initiating an Israeli court case that was finally settled in her conviction and sentencing on Tuesday.  Dareen Tatour, a 36-year-old Palestinian poet and photographer who resides in Reinah, Israel, took to YouTube and Facebook in October of 2016 to release her poem “Qawem Ya Shaabi Qawemahum” or “Resist, My People, Resist.” In the recording of her reading, the poem was used as a soundtrack over footage of Palestinian youths flinging stones and firebombs at Israeli soldiers.  In May 2018, Tatour was convicted guilty of incitement to violence online and of supporting the Palestinian militant group aimed at the uprising, ‘Islamic Jihad.’ The final sentencing took place on July 31. Official minutes released by the state’s Justice Ministry declared a five-month imprisonment for the poet coupled with a six-month suspended sentence to her jail time.  Tatour’s reaction was nonchalant as she “…wasn’t expecting justice to be done.” She maintained in her statement to reporters, “The case was political from the start, because I am Palestinian and support freedom of speech.”  ‘Resist, My People, Resist’ The most significant lines in Tatour’s poem, as translated by Tariq al Haydar, are:  “Resist, my people, resist them. Resist the settler’s robbery And follow the caravan of martyrs. Shred the disgraceful constitution Which imposed degradation and humiliation And deterred us from restoring justice.” After posting the poem, Tatour took to Facebook once again, this time sharing her views in the form of a news story. Coupled with what Israeli officials claim was a call for “a continuation of the Intifada,” she posted three photos exhibiting Israeli security forces and Jewish extremists killing an Israeli-Arab woman and two Palestinian children. Tatour had added a description in Arabic: “I am the next shahid” (referring to the Arabic word for martyr).  The Israeli interpretation The publishing of the poem coincided with an outbreak of frequent and fatal attacks by Palestinians on Israelis coined the “Stabbing Intifada.” The string of attacks led the Israeli government to believe online incitement fueled the violence; thus the government launched a legal crackdown. The number of indictments and prosecutions has tripled since 2014 primarily in charging young Palestinians. Due to the situational context, authorities claimed Tatour’s poem was a call for violence, and she was arrested a few days later.  Tatour vehemently denied the charges, claiming the Israeli authorities were misinterpreting her work as she called for non-violence within the struggle rather than an exacerbation of the existing brutality regardless of which side exhibited it. The case quickly became notable in the debate of freedom of speech. Advocates both within Israel and abroad began to advocate for Tatour’s rights. Furthermore, the case drew attention, causing the world to question the Israeli government’s use of technology as they search social media for suspicious users inciting violence or attacks on Israel.

Rabat – Following his Monday meeting with the president of FC Nantes, Waldemar Kita, to negotiate a contract, Moroccan football player Adel Taarabt is ready to make a big comeback in the French league. In an interview with French outlet l’Equipe, the 29-year-old Atlas Lion expressed his wish to play in France again and to prove that he still has all his talent.  “I really want to come back to France and I had a good chat with President Kita. He’s not afraid to tell you things, and I like that,” said Taarabt. “The coach really wants me and his speech touched me. When you hear it, it gives you even more desire to smash everything.”  To prove his determination to return to the French league where he received training with Lens, Taarabt explained that he refused Spanish clubs, an Italian club, and a contract of €3 million in Saudi Arabia. “FC Nantes reminds me of Lens. I am passionate, I love football, and I can’t wait to show what I can do technically,” he said.  As for the bad reputation he developed throughout the years by getting himself in trouble, the Moroccan international football player made it clear that he is not the bad boy he used to be.  “I’m not 22 or 23 anymore. I have matured, I have no more problems. This reputation is over! When I was young, I did not like being replaced, that’s right, I wanted things to go faster than music,” said the midfielder.  Taarabt immigrated to France with his family when he was only 11 years old. He was formed at RC Lens. He has since played with several prestigious clubs, including Tottenham, Fulham, AC Milan, and Benfica.

Rabat – An Al Qaeda attack on Sunday during the Malian presidential vote joined hundreds of other violent interferences in the democratic process.  The unprecedentedly close and contested election, made more complex by violence and voter disenfranchisement, now includes three major figures claiming a spot in August’s run-off. In Aguelhok, a village in Mali’s northern Kidal region, militants fired 10 mortar rounds near a voting site and temporarily shut down a polling station. Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin’ (JNIM)—the official Sahara branch of Al Qaeda—claimed responsibility for the terror attack.  “This bombardment … in Mali is a clear message from us to France and its pawns in the country that the war between us will not end,” read a statement from the terror group.  “Everyone knows that the winner in this election is only a pawn in the hands of France and the countries of the Cross.” JNIM leader Iyad Ag Ghaly asserted, “These elections are nothing other than the pursuit of a mirage, and our peoples will reap nothing but illusions, as they are used to doing.” Burning ballot boxes Attacks across north and central Mali, where militant Islamists hold the greatest control, continue to stand between voters and the polling stations in the presidential election.  According to the Ministry of Territorial Administration, armed attacks or violence affected 4,632 of 23,000 polling stations—over one in five. Nearly 650 were rendered completely inoperable.  Half of the disrupted polling stations are in Mopti, the nation’s central region.  At 39, teacher Hamid Bore held responsibility for a station in Dembere village, a small community in Mopti. When polls opened at 8 a.m., he expected to see voters; instead, right at voting time, militants arrived.  “They were firing shots and then they asked for the bureau chief,” he said. “They beat us up, then stole the ballot boxes and our bikes. I had to walk back. This is our only means of travel. How am I going to survive now?” Hawa Cisse of the “Let’s Save Mopti” platform said, “We are going to vote, but we are very afraid, afraid for our children, our husbands, our brothers, sisters, for everything. We can’t even go to the market; we can’t go beyond the river.” She referenced significant inconsistencies between physical and online voter lists, an aberration sparking tensions as the government claims only one list exists.  In contrasting optimism, Mopti Governor General Sidi Alassane Toure had expressed hope for high regional participation as over three-quarters of eligible voters procured a registration card before the election. The figure of disenfranchised voters is unknown but significant. Traditionally, voter turnout fails to reach even 50 percent, but many Malians in this election who want their voice heard are blocked by the anti-democratic militant violence. In Timbuktu, locals reported armed men seizing and setting fire to ballot boxes. “They came, they fired their weapons and then they took the ballot boxes away,” said Timbuktu resident Insubdar Inaboud. He said that, if able, he would have cast his vote for Cisse. “I’m so angry. I don’t think this vote is valid, because we are also Malians,” he said. Quicksand foundation Sunday’s poll was only Mali’s second presidential election; in July 2013, a year and a half after the coup d’etat ousting Amadou Toumani Toure, the nation chose current President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. Returning to the polls for the 2018 election, however, means confronting a system rife with irregularities and confusion.  Keita seeks reelection, although his first term did little to improve the nation’s conditions. His election rival Soumaila Cisse promises hope for a united, peaceful Mali. Cisse’s political party, Union for the Republic and Democracy, announced a run-off vote between Cisse and Keita Monday.  Unexpectedly, a spokesman for the political party Democratic Alliance for Peace said its candidate Aliou Diallo won enough votes to claim second place and join the run-off round. The law bars candidates from announcing results before any official publication, so the lack of governmental confirmation of either rumor leaves the nation waiting for truth. European Union observer mission chief Cecile Kyenge addressed the less-than-ideal circumstances of the Malian election process. “We observed several irregularities in the distribution of electoral cards… which were done in ways that did not follow the law.” He urged publicity of polling station information in order to better observe the voting process. “The lists published by the government do not identify the polling stations precisely as we asked them to do,” he said. “That makes … observing difficult.” Moussa Mara, campaign director for presidential candidate Cheick Modibo Diarra, expressed worries over potential violence. “There is a risk people are going to complain, they might say that because the vote was disrupted, ‘We are not happy with the results.’”  “We’ve never had violence [over an election result] before, but this one is more close. Violence is very possible, if people take to the streets. We hope they don’t, but there’s a danger.” No matter the result, the UN urges both sides to accept the result or challenge it legally in order to avoid a potential political crisis.  Official provisional results are due August 3 with a potential extension to August 12, if necessary. By Anna Schaeffer

By Dil Bola  Rabat – After a forced stoppage of the 2018 opening for the first Moroccan cultural center in France, work will now recommence for completion in 2019 and inauguration in 2020.  The initial unveiling of the second Moroccan cultural center abroad occurred in 2016 in the presence of King Mohammed VI and former French President Francois Hollande with an intended opening in 2018. Due to technical and administrative issues, the joint Moroccan-French project aimed at heightening international recognition of Moroccan culture came to a halt. The center will be the second in the world after the first in Montreal, inaugurated in 2012. The second center will be located in Paris in place of the original building which housed the Association of North African Muslim Students (AEMNA) and will be fully financed by Morocco. The total price paid by Morocco is €6.7 million, with €5.7 million allocated for construction and an annual operating budget estimated at €1.5 million.  The postponement was primarily due to the site work that had not yet been completed; the incomplete demolition of the old building resulted in the blockage as well as long meetings in attempts to overcome the issues. Further, a spokesperson for the cabinet in charge of the project stated: “The administrative procedures of authorization had required more time than planned because of the historical particularity and urban planning of the Latin Quarter.”  The situation deteriorated as the architectural firm in charge, Oualaou-Choi, revealed prior to pre-demolition work that deadlines to cooperate with a variety of companies were not met. Issues included “disconnection with companies of the electricity and gas network, asbestos analysis firm, soil studies, geotechnical studies and foundations, etc.”  Architect assistants Tarik Oualalou and Linna Choi released a statement in the relaunch of work: “All these issues now being resolved, work should accelerate and be completed by the end of 2019.”  If the proposed agenda is respected, the 1,400 square meter  area should be opened in 2020. It is comprised of a publicly accessible ground floor and a gallery capable of holding five annual exhibitions, along with a library and auditorium allocated for conferences and film screenings.

Rabat- Left-wing politician Omar Balafrej said that he “respectfully” disagrees with some content in King Mohammed VI’s Throne Day speech, revealing that he was anticipating the King’s pardon for imprisoned Rif activists.  Balafrej, who is known for his criticism of the country’s political system, made a live video interview Tuesday on his Facebook page to discuss a number of issues, including the monarch’s Throne Day speech which aired on the evening of July 29. The politician did not specify the points he disagreed with in the speech; however, he emphasized his right to do so. “I disagree with the solutions that the royal speech suggested in the 19th anniversary of the King’s accession to the throne…. I have the right to discuss the King’s speech, as a political activist and citizen, but within the limits of respect to the monarch.” Balafrej went on to say that the King’s speech brought commendable points to light such as the importance of developing the state education in terms of boarding facilities, transportation, cafeterias, and funding for students’ education. He had hoped that the King would announce pardons for the Rif activists who were sentenced 1 to 20 years for their involvement in Hirak Rif protests of social disparities, which reverberated across the Al Hoceima region in 2016 and 2017. Moreover, the politician pointed out that the country is facing a crisis of trust in institutions, “embodied in the ongoing boycott campaign.” He added that the protests in the Rif region were justified by the negligence of their rights. Lastly, Balafrej said that he did not attend the oath-taking ceremony of officers on Tuesday because he did not receive an invitation from the royal palace. The oath-taking ceremony took place the day after Throne Day, at the Mechouar Royal Palace in Tetouan.

Rabat – An investigation by the Middle East Forum think tank has revealed that the Obama Administration approved a grant of $200,000 to the Islamic Relief Agency (ISRA), a financier of terror groups that has been linked with Al Qaeda.  The investigation uncovered that despite the government’s knowledge of ISRA’s terrorist affiliation, the grant was approved. American taxpayer dollars were knowingly bestowed to the Al Qaeda affiliation, yet uncertainty still surrounds how ISRA was initially authorized as a grantee. In a statement to i24 News, a USAID official said that the USAID partners had the “primary responsibility” to run checks on ISRA, but “did not identify ISRA as an organization subject to US sanctions when it made the initial award.”  When asked to comment on the funding, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, “As this occurred under the prior administration, the current Secretary of the State, Secretary of Treasury and USAID Administrator had no involvement in decisions surrounding this award or subsequent license.”  However, the USAID official told the press that since the Obama administration, the system and the bureaucratic process have changed.  Officials overseeing the agreements have received additional training to avoid reoccurrences and to improve screening of grantees. ISRA, a known funder of terror groups In 2004 the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) listed the Khartoum-based ISRA as a terror-financing group. The designation was based upon ISRA’s strong links to Osama bin Laden and his organization Maktab al-Khidamat (MK) since 1997. By 2000, ISRA had raised $5 million for MK. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) in 2014 awarded $723,405 to World Vision, an international evangelical charity for the purposes of “improving water, sanitation and hygiene and to increase food security in Sudan’s Blue Nile State.” Despite ISRA’s affiliations, included in the World Vision grant was $200 000 directed to the ISRA as a sub-grantee.  In November 2014, World Vision alerted USAID to the precarious status of ISRA, which had led USAID to “suspend all activities with the ISRA,” according to a USAID official.  Consequently, on January 23, 2015, OFAC confirmed that ISRA was an unapproved entity and denied World Vision the license to engage in transactions with ISRA. Despite OFAC’s ruling, World Vision was reluctant to cut ties with ISRA, arguing that with the refusal of their license and inability to distribute grants, their humanitarian efforts were jeopardized.  A stalemate followed between World Vision and OFAC, as both USAID and OFAC were unwilling to act on the issue. On May 7, 2015, after “close collaboration and consultations with the US Department of State,” OFAC took the untenable decision to issue a one-time license, which allowed the singular transfer of $115,000 to ISRA.  Assessing the system  The byzantine unfolding of events led to the conscious transfer of American taxpayer dollars to an Al Qaeda affiliate. A twofold system oversees grants from the US government: all grantees and sub-grantees must register under the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and with the government’s System for Award Management (SAM) database. The checks belie the ease with which ISRA was able to become a sub-grantee. ISRA was mysteriously assigned a DUNS number, which did not match with any organization in the SAM database.  The void of knowledge and bureaucratic confusion which surrounds ISRA and its mysterious listing reveals blatant flaws within the system. By Isabella Wang

By Dil Bola  Rabat- The Mediterranean Automobile Industry Society (SMEIA), the exclusive Moroccan importer of BMW, has reconfirmed its commitment to an eco-activist cause, launching a new hybrid range.  BMW iPerformance is composed of two new models: the BMW 530e and the BMW 740Le. The range combines the fundamental characteristics of comfort, luxury, and pleasure with the latest hybrid technologies available in the BMW brand. The price positioning remains in pursuit of customer satisfaction; ergo, the range is “the Hybrid at the price of diesel.”  The release of the range comes at a convenient time, specifically in relation to recent developments in the Moroccan market. Tax incentives and a newly-implemented charging infrastructure on the national motorway network prompted the launch of the new environmentally-friendly series.  The charging connection to the high voltage battery is placed on the front left side panel protected by the hatch, highlighting the innovative drive concept within the iPerformance range.  Drivers can experience the best of both worlds with the sport comfort and eco pro settings under the driving experience control switch, but what is particularly exceptional about the new series is the ability to further fine-tune the system. With the BMW eDrive system three additional driving modes are provided: Auto eDrive, Max eDrive and Battery Control.  Auto eDrive allows a dual interaction between the conventional engine and electric to facilitate optimal driving situations and an all-electric top speed reaching 90 kilometers per hour. Max eDrive, on the other hand, utilizes only electric power, reaching a maximum of 140 kilometers per hour. Battery control mode facilitates a manual control of the charge level of the battery as target values can be set anywhere between 30 and 100 percent. By reserving a portion of the battery, the vehicle maintains a constant charge, thus increasing reserves of electric energy and allowing conservation possibilities.  By conserving fuel and producing less CO2 emissions, the future of automobiles is in hybrid technologies. The environmentally-friendly incentives coupled with financial advantages prompt a reduced dependency on fossil fuels, ultimately aiding future generations with cleaner air and affordable fuel prices.

Rabat – Moroccans are expected to celebrate Eid Al Adha (Festival of Sacrifice) on August 22, astronomer and researcher Abdelaziz Khabrouch Al Ifrani told Morocco World News on Tuesday. Al Ifrani, whose previous predictions for Ramadan and other religious celebrations based on the lunar calendar were all correct, said that based on astronomical calculations, Morocco will be able to see the crescent of the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah on August 12. The following day would be the first day of Dhu al-Hijjah which will impact when Eid Al Adha will be celebrated. Dhu al-Hijjah is the sacred month in the Islamic calendar in which the Hajj (pilgrimage) takes place. The month also marks Eid Al Adha, which is the second of two Islamic holidays celebrated by Muslims worldwide. The expert added that “it will be impossible in any way” for specialists to sight the crescent of the 10th Islamic month on Saturday, August 11, even with advanced equipment. Al Ifrani said that all these predictions are according to astronomical calculations. The astronomer also called on Islamic countries to fully disclose the standards they use to make their calculations. Preparations for Eid Al Adha In June, Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch announced the ministry’s plans to prepare for Eid Al Adha in a meeting attended by representatives of the National Office for Food Safety (ONSSA) and the National Agricultural Advisory Board (ONCA). The objective of the meeting was to ensure better animal traceability and transparency in commercial transactions, since most Muslim families will purchase and slaughter a sheep or goat for the holiday. For Muslims, Eid Al Adha is the second holiest celebration in Islam after Ramadan. The day honors the willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son Ishmael in an act of obedience to God’s command.  Before Ibrahim sacrificed his son, God provided a male goat to sacrifice instead to honor him for obeying his command. Muslims across the world celebrate the day, sacrificing a sheep or a goat to honor Ibraham. How Muslims celebrate the feast In the morning of the feast, thousands of Muslim men across the globe dress up in white traditional clothes, especially djellabas. Men then head to mosques to perform salat El Eid (Eid prayers). After the prayers, the family gathers to experience the joy of Eid as the father or the oldest brother slaughters the sheep or the goat. Part of the meat is donated to needy and poor people. Families also greet and invite each other over for dinner. Most regions in Morocco serve couscous with meat and vegetables for dinner.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has dismissed Mohamed Boussaid from his position as the Minister of Economy and Finance. The royal cabinet issued a statement Wednesday afternoon, announcing that in accordance with his powers in Article 47 of the 2011 constitution, King Mohammed VI has decided to relieve Boussaid from his ministerial duties. The decision came following consultation with Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, according to the same communiqué. The statement added that the decision is part of efforts for accountability and holding authorities to responsibility, which the King attempts to apply to all officials regardless of their status and affiliations. Boussaid’s dismissal came four days after Throne Day’s customary speech of King Mohammed VI who heavily criticized social disparities and Morocco’s development model, saying it has failed to meet the demands of citizens. Morocco has witnessed a similar political decision in 2017 when the King sacked four ministers for irregularities in the implementation of Al Hoceima development projects. A social movement, known as Hirak Rif, decried social injustices and a lack of development programs in the Rif region in 2016 and 2017. A member of the National Rally of Independents Party (RNI), Boussaid held the position of minister of tourism and crafts between 2007 and 2010, before becoming minister of economy and finance in 2013 during the mandate of former head of government Abdelilah Benkirane.  After the launch of a major boycott against high commodity prices, Boussaid sparked outrage among Moroccans due to his remarks made against the boycott. Boussaid labeled Moroccans supporting the boycott “madawikh” (morons).

By Renee Sang Rabat- In Morocco, entrepreneurship has been on the rise as an economic survival tactic for those seeking to escape the reaches of the country’s high unemployment rate. Although the government has taken initiatives to assist young start-ups and improve the economy, it is still difficult to compete and thrive as an entrepreneur, especially for women.  Making the decision to be self-employed is already a brave choice in itself without having to also compete in a male-dominated field. It can often be intimidating for women to challenge the status quo and have to work twice as hard to be taken seriously. However, many Moroccan women have faced the issue head-on and successfully integrated into society with their businesses and organizations. Morocco World News spoke with two female entrepreneurs to learn about their experiences.  Asmaa Benachir is the female founder and manager behind the social enterprise Au Grain de Sesame. She acknowledged that every woman’s experience in the workforce is unique and the difficulties experienced vary from field to field.  “It depends what kind of activity you choose. If it is art, there is no difficulties. For creating an enterprise, every woman can do it…Usually, it was man who made this job or work, and now everything is open to women so the women have to make their place. In some activities, it’s not easy. It’s like in every country, not something special to Morocco.” Benachir founded Au Grain de Sesame in 2007 with the goal to combine art with sustainable development. Her business functions as a literary café, arts and crafts gallery, and training center for women to learn how to produce and sell their own recyclable art.  “I’m an artist, so the things are different. Art is open for women here in Morocco… I think it’s more difficult for women to be in a position of decision, as a man. I think it’s not impossible, because we have women in history, we have them as directors of very big, national companies, and things like that, but there are few. In comparison with men, there are few.” “I think in the future things are going to be better for women, because now it’s the beginning that [a] woman ha[s] her right, can do what she wants without the authorization of man…and maybe in the future it will be better.” Benachir also steered the attention away from the conditions of women and instead emphasized that part of the problem is the lack of available resources for women. Training, financial support, and education can go a long way in providing a better working environment for women.  “[I]t’s not that women can’t do the things, because it’s forbidden, or things like that. No, they can’t do it because they don’t have the real support they need… My advice [to women] will be to always empower themselves by learning—not stop learning.” Thanks to initiatives set forth by King Mohammed VI, women have more rights related to divorce, custody over children, inheritance, and more than they had in the past. However, less constraints on women in accordance with the law does not eliminate their disadvantages. The literacy rate among women in 2015 was 58.8 percent in comparison to 78.6 percent for men. There are clearly still strides to be made in terms of ensuring equality and equal access to rights such as education. Sana Afouaiz is a social entrepreneur and the founder of the non-profit Womenpreneur Organization that provides a platform for women in North Africa to build their business initiatives. She has worked with organizations such as Queen’s Young Leaders of Queen Elizabeth, the European Commission, and Young Professional United Nations. Afouaiz acknowledged that there are various difficulties that hinder women that may not always be visible on the surface.  “When it comes to Morocco, a country where I grew up myself, the challenges are different. You have the economic difficulties—less economic investors who take you seriously. There’s cultural issues—as a female entrepreneur you have certain limits. For example, being a female entrepreneur means working late, traveling around, et cetera.” “The mobility in Morocco is different [for women], it’s not as acceptable to work late. There’s a lot of possibility that you get harassed [at night] …because they don’t have the same mobility as men do. The third issue is the mindset. There’s the way women see themselves and the way men see them.” Afouaiz recognized that there is not only an issue of external factors but social notions held by both genders that limit the potential of women. She noted that “at the end of the day, men see themselves as the breadwinners” while women are expected to prioritize family over work, leading many to be discouraged from starting a business.  “When you look at [fields] where women are taking care of people, they don’t have as much difficulty…. When you look at [fields such as] innovation, engineering, business—few are women dominated.”  Economically speaking, she also insisted that there is a need for female entrepreneurship, as women comprise more than 50 percent of the population. However, even when they do pursue entrepreneurship, women may face judgement and a negative reputation in society.  “There’s the image of the entrepreneur woman…She’s traveling around, she’s meeting a lot of people, maybe a lot of men …so she doesn’t fulfill that pure image of a Moroccan woman.”  Access to resources all around the country is also needed to advance and sustain women’s entrepreneurship. Benachir and Afouaiz both recognized the importance of providing funding and education to empower women, especially in rural areas. Afouiaz noted that although there have been efforts to improve the conditions of women in some respects, a greater challenge may come from changing existing social expectations.  “I really think that there is an urgent need to challenge and change the mindset of both men and women in Morocco—this would help to advance women entrepreneurship in Morocco… When you hear the same message every time, your brain starts to believe [it]. The environment and the message that the environment circulates, make[s] the women believe what [is] being said.” Afouaiz urged women to pursue their passions, be confident in their own abilities, and “not accept society cutting [their] wings.” Setting a positive example may lay a less daunting and more hopeful foundation for future generations of women to follow.

Rabat – In another attempt to reconcile with its customers, the French dairy company, Centrale Danone, launched a consultation campaign Tuesday to hear and discuss the requirements of grocers, consumers, and milk suppliers.  Since the launch of a boycott against the company on April 20, Centrale Danone has received numerous questions and recommendations from customers on social media about the procedures that should be taken to respond to the demands of the angry boycotters.  The company’s new campaign, called “Ntwaslo w Nwaslo” (we communicate and proceed) aims to find a compromise on price to meet the purchasing power and boycotters’ demands: a decrease in prices for Centrale Danone’s dairy products, especially milk.  In response to consumers’ anger, the company decided to “deepen this approach by listening to all its stakeholders (consumers, grocers, breeders, suppliers), to better understand their needs and to commit and engage efficiently to secure a fair and equitable price for Centrale’s fresh pasteurized milk,” the company said in a statement published on July 31. The company invites its customers to meetings, which will take place in different cities, to hear their opinions and recommendations. The campaign will run until August 15. The company chose to start its campaign in Marrakech and will meet with customers today in the Royal Theater at 5 p.m. Centrale Danone has mobilized 1,000 employees to meet consumers and grocers to listen and discuss their proposals with them. “Five public consultations will take place every two days starting August 1st in Marrakech, and Casablanca on August 3rd, Tangier on August 5th and Meknes on August 7th,” according to the statement.  The location of the fifth consultation will be decided through a vote to pick a city of the three cities proposed: Rabat, Kenitra, and Agadir. Centrale Danone has also launched a website, www.ntwaslo.com, to explain the process, to harmonize the exchanges, and to give an opportunity to all those who want to comment on the proposals.  “All actions can be followed on Centrale Danone’s official Facebook page in which internet users are called to exchange,” invited Centrale Danone. Centrale Danone also published a video of the spokesperson of the company, Abd Al Jalil El Kaimi, explaining the purposes of the campaign.  The spokesperson invited customers to take part in the meetings and to share their recommendations with Centrale Danone’s staff.  During the visit of Centrale Danone’s CEO, Emmanuel Faber, to Casablanca on June 26, he promised Moroccan customers that the company will adjust dairy prices. He made three commitments: to be transparent in costs and quality at all time, not to make a profit from the pasteurized milk, and to trust all stakeholders of Centrale’s pasteurized fresh milk to find a fair and equitable price.

Rabat – Fatiha Ghamid, the public prosecutor in charge of women and children’s affairs at the Oujda Court of Justice, has urged Morocco to “invest more efforts and energy” to guarantee the rights of at-risk women and children, especially minors or children from low-income backgrounds “in need of special attention” from authorities. Ghamid, who recently addressed an audience of legal authorities, government representatives, and international partners (mostly an EU delegation), noted Morocco’s recent efforts to protect the rights of women and children facing violence and related treatment both domestically and outside their homes.   She said that recent reforms in the country’s legal system have ignited more public debate around issues such as children’s right to proper education and basic care.  Arguing that the condition of ‘abandoned children’ and at-risk minors has improved since the year 2000, she said there is still more to do, especially as “many [at-risk children] still have their rights deliberately ignored in detention and social rehabilitation centers.”  Not surprisingly, then, despite perceived improvements in limiting violence against at-risk minors, “needy children” from low-income neighborhood are still experiencing violence, including economic exploitation and physical abuse, Ghamid said.  Explaining that in some cases economic hardship causes some parents and older relatives to use children for begging, Ghameid contended that inciting children to beg is considered a crime and should be tackled as such “in accordance with Moroccan legal provisions.”  Public criticism For all her efforts to offer a “general overview of violence in Morocco,” however, Ghamid received heavy online criticism for her “pathetic” French level. Taking issue with the Oujda public prosecutor’s “never-heard-of display” of French oratory skills, some internet commenters joked about her choice to give a public speech in a language she knew she was “terrible at” in the first place. Other less sympathetic online users lampooned Ghamid, suggesting that she embodied the many public officials “miraculously” occupying important positions. “Pathetic!!! Please stop this mind-boggling public carnage,” one user wrote on Facebook, adding that a translator was needed to help the audience make sense of what “our so-called public prosecutor is madly yelling.” Emphasis on social support With more than 80 governmental and private bodies working to ensure the application of the existing legal framework in terms of child-related violence, Morocco should now “integrate a more humanitarian and social care aspect to the available legal work done to ensure efficient and well-adjusted measures to fully protect children and at-risk minors.”  According to Ghamid, fulfilling the “essential mission” of realizing full protection of children’s rights requires more effective coordination between all relevant authorities—government, civil society, and legal experts—as well as expertise-sharing and institutional cooperation with international partners “like the European Union.” “In spite of a number of constraints, namely the lack of sufficient material means, we have been making some efforts to mitigate the violence and harsh treatment that women and children face in Morocco. But the means at our disposal are not enough.… That is why we need more involvement from the government and the international community.”

Rabat – Moroccan footballer Younes Belhanda has ruled out a move to the English premier league in the 2019 summer transfer window, saying that he is happy with life at Turkish side Galatasaray. The 28-year old playmaker has increasingly been linked with a number of Premier League sides following a successful season in the Turkish Super League and solid displays in Hervé Renard’s Atlas Lions side. Crystal Palace reportedly proposed a £5.3 million transfer fee to obtain the services of the former midfielder. And with Galatasaray’s desire to sell some of its star players to meet UEFA’s financial fair-play regulations, the deal was expected to be sealed in the 2019 summer window. Speaking to beIN Sports, however, Belhanda openly ruled out any prospects of transfer this summer, reiterating his desire to be part of Galatasaray’s next season Champions League’s squad.  “I am happy in Galatasaray. I will play here in the Champions League. I do not want to go to England,” the former Shalke 04 man was quoted by Turkish Football as saying. Belhanda was part of Morocco’s Atlas Lions squad that won worldwide plaudits this summer for a solid performance at the World Cup in Russia, though many fans were left frustrated with the team’s exit in the group stage.  The Moroccan star also impressed at Galatasaray last season, helping the team claim league triumph by providing ten assists and scoring three goals. Belhanda, who joined Galatasaray from Ukraine’s Dynamo Kyiv in 2017, is formally under contract with his current Turkish side until 2021.

Rabat – The Atlantic Free Zone (AFZ) of Kenitra, near Rabat, has once again attracted a French leader in household energy management.  The Full Home Energy (FHE) Group, which specializes in the management and storage of electric and thermal energy will open its first plant in Africa in the AFZ. According to l’Economiste, the group signed a purchase contract on Wednesday, July 27, with MEDZ—the managing enterprise of AFZ—for a plot of 5,000 square meters for an estimated $3.5 million. Work on the production factory will begin in September and is expected to be completed by the end of 2019.  The factory will supply European and African markets with printed circuit boards. The boards connect electronic components together to create a complex electronic circuit. The French leader already has plants in Germany and Switzerland, with plans to expand to Italy and Spain. Several international giants have established themselves in the AFZ, namely, automotive giant Nexteer which produces automotive parts for some of the largest auto manufacturers—such as BMW, Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen, China’s Dicastal which produces aluminum car wheels, and PSA Group.  Free Zones across the country have succeeded in attracting automotive giants due to their tax and customs benefits for companies establishing factories in Morocco.

Rabat – Moroccan-American rapper French Montana experienced a traumatic episode on Tuesday morning. The singer was the victim of a home invasion in his Los Angeles Calabasas Mansion when two armed robbers broke in at 8 a.m. July 30.  At the time of the robbery, the rapper was home, having a gathering with friends.   According to American outlet People, authorities responded to an armed robbery call a few minutes after the incident. However, upon their arrival, the thieves had already fled the scene.  The Calabasas Sheriff Department confirmed to People that two armed males forced entry into Montana’s mansion. No injuries or hospitalizations were declared. The authorities are still investigating the identity of the invaders and still have no suspects. It is also unknown how much the robbers stole.   The Casablanca native bought the house from young pop singer Selena Gomez for $3.3 million in 2016.  A similar incident already occurred for 23-year-old Gomez in 2014. A man entered the property while she was home. He reportedly broke into her guest house and was found and arrested on the scene. The invader was charged with burglary and trespassing.. The house, which extends over 1.25 hectares, has five bedrooms, six bathrooms, a pool, a spa, a guest house, and ten parking spots. Gomez, who faced harassment by fans at her home, sold the house for security reasons.

Rabat – US President Donald Trump has joined the list of world leaders who sent their congratulations to King Mohammed VI on the 19th anniversary of his accession to the throne. In his message, Trump lauded King Mohammed VI’s leadership in “international efforts to promote religious tolerance and fight against extremism.” The US President also welcomed the friendship between Morocco and the US, a relationship “based on an interest to promote peace, stability and economic opportunities.” Morocco deliberately works to prevent and control radicalism by ensuring that the practice of Islam remains unified, moderate, and stable throughout the country. Trump also expressed determination to continue to work with the King to reinforce ties between the two nations and to continue bilateral collaboration for a safer and more prosperous African continent. Trump’s congratulatory message came through US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said that his country “is proud to work with Morocco in the areas of security cooperation, culture and educational exchanges.” Pompeo also said that the US is interested in promoting economic opportunities in favor of both peoples. “We look forward to further deepening our strong relationship that has lasted for more than two centuries,” Pompeo added. The US secretary of state also reaffirmed the strategic Moroccan-American partnership, expressing interest in working together to “advance the vision” both countries share “for a secure North Africa and Middle East.” The two countries work together in multiple fields, including security. On June 29, Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita welcomed US Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan in Rabat, and both agreed to reinforce bilateral ties. The US official said that Morocco is a key partner in counterterrorism, expressing more interest in preserving the diplomatic ties to safeguard national security interests in the two countries. On Monday, King Mohammed VI chaired a reception ceremony for Throne Day in Tangier’s royal palace. Several former and current officials from different countries attended the ceremony.

Rabat- The unemployment rate of students with higher education degrees has doubled since 2013, according to Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi. As the number of higher education students increases each year in Morocco, unemployment remains a challenge.   According to El Khalfi’s recent press statement, the percentage of unemployed university graduates is over 22 percent, a figure that has doubled over the last five years and is expected to keep increasing in the coming years to reach 50 percent. “The number of degree holders increased from 43,000 in the last five years to 120,000 this year,” El Khalfi said. El Khalfi argued that the kingdom is facing a sizeable problem of unemployed higher degree holders that cannot be ignored. To find a job, many Moroccans believe that it is necessary to have money or connections. One unemployed Moroccan holder of a master’s degree in economic studies, named Nesrine, told Morocco World News: “I could easily find a job if my parents were rich or had rich friends but unfortunately they don’t.” Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) reported that the higher levels of general education—which typically ranges from elementary school to college—correspond with lower likelihood of employment. Half of the actively employed population (estimated at 52.2 percent) are not degree holders, compared to 34.2 percent of workers who hold degrees, according to HCP. Meanwhile, the research group BMI has forecasted that high unemployment will prevail throughout the next decade due to the expanding workforce, unmet demand for technical positions, and decline in traditional high employment sectors. For unemployment to decline, Morocco would need to create 115,000 additional jobs each year and maintain all current employment opportunities in order to maintain a workforce participation rate of 47 percent. The worrisome unemployment figures have prompted the government to adopt a national program and relevant trainings for young graduates in several spheres to increase the possibilities of employment. The Moroccan Party of Progress and Socialism has proposed in Parliament that the government create a fund to support Moroccan undergraduates and postgraduates from universities across the country. The proposal suggest that unemployed graduates will benefit from a one-year fund of MAD 1,200 monthly, valid for a six-month extension.  Throughout the extension period, beneficiaries will only benefit from MAD 600 a month.

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat- After three years of work, a translator has completed a third and updated Polish translation of the Qur’an and is expected to launch it on the 160th anniversary of the release of the first Polish edition.  Five thousand copies will be printed and readers will also be able to access the version online. The translator was poet and editor Musa Czachorowski—a member of the Tatar community (a group of Turkic-speaking people residing in Russia and other post-Soviet countries). The Muslim Religious Union of Poland (MZR) spearheaded the push for a more up-to-date translation of the Qur’an. According to MZR’s Ethnic Department Coordinator Barbara Pawlic-Miskiewicz, the first Polish Qur’an was published in 1858. However, language evolves over time; Jan Murza Buczaki completed the original work and, as expected, utilized many terms that are no longer understood. Jozef Bielawski, a Warsaw University professor and founder of the Faculty of Arab World Studies, published a second edition in 1986. Pawlic-Miskiewicz noted that the second version was “definitely better in quality,” but still used language that was “non-obvious” and too “poetic.” Islam in Poland Today, Muslims make up less than 0.1 percent of Poland’s total population, yet have managed to leave their mark on the country’s history. Polish Muslims are also largely Sunni and of Tatar descent. There are an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 Tatars living in Poland today, but many Poles are descended and influenced from Tatar bloodlines. Beginning in the 14th century, Poland saw a steady stream of Tatar Muslims incorporated into its society. Both during and after World War II, Tatar communities were subjected to poor conditions and drafted into the army along with the other civilians. The Nazis largely murdered their intelligentsia. Furthermore, they were victims of post-war expulsions, and the majority of their settlements were expropriated by the Soviet Union. Only three settlements remained after the war: Bohoniki, Kruszyniany, and Sokolka. Poland’s oldest Tatar mosque, Kruszyniany Mosque, is located in the Kruszyniany settlement in the northeastern part of the country. The mosque is a quaint wooden structure built on a rectangular plane that measures 10 by 13 meters. The current structure was completed between the 18th and 19th century, but a Kruszyniany Mosque was first mentioned in a document dated in 1717. The mosque was renovated in 1846 and provided with a safety system in 2008. It remains active to this day. Despite the relatively small Polish Islamic population, anti-Muslim sentiment and verbal and physical displays of hate are high. Unfortunately, the crimes also go largely unpunished. Many cases of vandalism on mosques or violent attacks on Muslims are unreported, and women who opt to convert to Islam and dress more conservatively are seen by some as “traitors.” In 2014, the Kruszyniany Mosque was badly vandalized the day after Ramadan began. The culprit spray-painted a pig on the side of the historical mosque and painted a Nazi symbol known as kotwica (“anchor”) both onto the mosque and on some of its tombstones. The kotwica is made up of a p and a w which stand for Polska Walczaca (Fighting Poland). Kruszyniany Muslim community leader Bronislaw Talkowski commented on the incident, noting that it was “a very regrettable thing—incomprehensible.” He emphasized that Tatars have always been peaceful neighbors and that the act of vandalism on the Kruszyniany Mosque was unprecedented. Czachorowski criticized the incident but emphasized a belief contrary to reports—that Polish society is largely free of hate toward Muslims. Czachorowski referenced scores of emails and letters of solidary sent to the Kruszyniany Tatar community after the vandalization. Commenting on the support his community received, Czachorowski said, “We take notice of it and appreciate it.” According to Amnesty International, “Widespread hate crimes in Poland are part of the disturbing rise of racist … violence against migrants, Muslims … across Europe over the past few years—a trend that sets the backdrop for xenophobic responses.”

Rabat – Saad Lamjarred has surprised his fans with his new single. After teasing it on his Instagram page, the Moroccan singer finally released “Casablanca,” in which he sings in French for, a first for the 33-year-old artist.  Lamjarred’s recent legal controversy has not stopped him from producing music. Released on his Youtube channel on Tuesday, June 30, the clip has already reached 2.4 million views and is trending number one on Youtube Morocco.  Lamjarred’s choice to sing in French paid off. On social media, the fans of the successful singer were very happy with the decision, congratulating him for another hit single. When it comes to his musical style, Lamjarred is very versatile. Two months ago, during Ramadan, the son of Bachir Abdou released a religious song called “Ya Allah,” far from his typical pop sound.  Despite his musical success, Saad Lamjarred’s legal troubles are far from over. French authorities arrested Lamjarred on October 26, 2016 for sexual assault of a woman named Laura Prioul. He was released and put under surveillance on April 13, 2017. In a pretrial motion, Prioul’s lawyer requested a medical expert in Paris, aiming to establish a link between the rape she reportedly suffered in October 2016 and the deterioration of her health since. Lamjarred is suing Prioul for defamation over her legal request for a medical exam and asking for EUR 15,000 in damages. Last month, the Court of Great Instance in Paris (TGI) decided to allow a medical expert to examine Prioul to find out if her right kidney stopped working because of stress following the assault.

Rabat – The African Development Bank (ADB) hosted a forum in Casablanca on Friday as part of a project to attract investments to African countries, citing ADB reports that Africa needs $120 billion each year to boost competitiveness and invest in development and employment-generating projects.  The ADB’s Africa Investment Forum initiative is reportedly the start of a long-term Africa-focused investment platform where investors interested in the African financial landscape can have better access to the continent’s many investment opportunities.  In addition to developing a platform for partnership and expertise-sharing between African investors and their foreign counterparts, the project also aims to create an intra-African link between Africa-based private enterprises. Promoting South-South cooperation was also a central concern, with participants citing some of the latest financial reports on Africa and the necessity of bridging the continent’s large investment deficit by involving more private African businesses. Although the ADB will not be participating in fundraising for the projects chosen during the series of forums, participants deem the bank’s sponsorship important for the success of the project. The bank’s credibility over the years is particularly valued by participants and investors, as an ADB-sponsored project is more likely to attract interest. Advertising Africa Speaking at the forum in Casablanca, Mohamed El Azizi, ADB director general for North Africa, said that the aim is not only to attract investments to Africa, but also to give the continent’s investors and growth drivers the prominence and viability they lack on the global market. “In big international forums like Davos, Africa has very little visibility and space; it does not attract enough investments,” he said. El Azizi explained that one of the objectives of Africa Investment Forum is to establish an economic forum that prioritizes Africa and facilitates “match-making” between African business leaders and their counterparts elsewhere. Last week’s meeting in Casablanca was the third such gathering, following two previous Africa Investment forums in Cairo and Tunis. The goal was the same in all three forums: identify profitable markets and projects for African and foreign fundraisers and investors, in addition to facilitating exchanges and cooperation between African investors. Olivier Eweck, senior economic manager at the African Development Bank, said that one goal of the Africa Investment Forum is to gather sufficient data on Africa’s investment and creativity potential, with the long-term goal of pioneering as many profit-yielding partnerships as possible. The next Africa Investment Forum is set to take place in Johannesburg, South Africa. Organizers expect between 1,000 and 2,000 investors to attend what is set to be the project’s biggest gathering.

Rabat – Morocco’s Royal Air Maroc (RAM) submitted an application to the US Department of Transportation on July 26 to launch a direct flight linking Miami and Casablanca. According to a statement from RAM, the company requested permission to “enable it to engage in scheduled foreign air transportations, of persons, property and mail between Casablanca, Morocco (CMN) and Miami, FL (MIA).”  Morocco’s national carrier asked the US Department of Transportation to grant “the requested authority expeditiously to facilitate marketing and advance sales of RAM’s proposed Miami service.” RAM wants to operate the flight for an initial period of two years, or more depending on what the department “may determine.” The company presented the department with a set of arguments to convince it to approve its request. The statement addressed to the US Department of Transportation added that the company serves local and international destinations, including Europe, Africa, North America, South America and the Middle East. “It currently serves New York (JFK) pursuant to its foreign air carrier permit issued by order 1975-2-61 in Docket 26260, and it has served New York since 1975.” RAM also recalled its 40 years of operating services linking Morocco with New York and Washington, D.C. Pending approval, the company wants to launch its new service in April 2019 with a Boeing 787. The new line, according to the statement, aims to expand RAM’s existing service between Morocco and the US and “would represent the first non-stop service between Miami and Casablanca, thereby providing significant new transportation options for passengers and shippers.” The airline is currently facing a major crisis, leading the company to cancel more than 10 flights a day. Hundreds of pilots have been on strike since July 18 to demand a salary raise. The pilots are also calling on RAM to offer better working conditions and more decent treatment, especially regarding retirement terms and health coverage. Since the launch of the strike, the company has been losing an estimated MAD 20 million every day.

Rabat – The Moroccan government has approved the Bamako Convention on hazardous wastes in a move towards greater environmental conscientiousness and management.  At the very forefront of the convention is a mission to protect human health and the environment from threats presented by hazardous waste.  As entailed by the treaty, the Bamako Convention prohibits the importation of all hazardous and radioactive wastes from non-contracting parties, as well as the disposal of waste in African oceans and inland waters. Further, it seeks to minimize the production of hazardous wastes and ensure cooperation in treating and disposing of waste in an environmentally sound manner. The convention operates within the given framework of the UN and of the Basel Convention, from which the Bamako Convention is derived.  For Morocco, the impetus for adopting the convention was recent. Still lingering in the Moroccan collective consciousness was COP 22, the 2016 Climate Change Conference held in Marrakech, and Italy’s exportation of 2,500 tons of waste, intended to be incinerated in the Moroccan city of El Jadida. The uneasy nexus of an environmental dialogue with what some saw as exploitation agitated public opinion. Moroccan netizens rebelled, refusing for Morocco to become the “landfill of Europe.”  While officials insist that the link between the 2016 controversy and the bill is tenuous, such events were instrumental to parliamentary dialogue. The Chamber of Advisers created a parliamentary commission to take “an urgent and clear decision concerning the Italian cargo of waste.” The move prompted governmental interest in organizing the informal sector in the field of waste discovery and management.  In statements to Yabiladi, Nezha El Ouafi, the secretary of state for sustainable development depicted the Bamako Convention as emblematic for change and development. At the heart of this was what she deems “the transmission of know-how” which will enable Morocco to develop various channels of knowledge, not only within Morocco, but all throughout Africa. She stated, “We are setting up seven sectors to involve the private sector, especially civil society, such as the battery industry, tires, lubricating cars, etc. … with twenty years of experience that will strengthen cooperation between African countries in order to install a shared know-how between these countries.” El Ouafi cited the waste management facility in Bouskoura, near Casablanca, as a paragon of Morocco’s capabilities. Built by the United Nations Development Organization (UNIDO), the facility ensured the safe and sustainable management of electrical equipment filled with mineral oil and contaminated by a hazardous chemical, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB).  The burgeoning environmental consciousness of Morocco aligned with the goals of the Bamako Convention, which had emerged from the failure of the Basel Convention to address economic disparities that emerged in the trade of hazardous waste: many developed nations were exporting toxic wastes to Africa.  The Bamako Convention, formally known as the “Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Wastes within Africa,” was adopted in Bamako, Mali, on January 30, 1991, and entered into force in 1998.
